												I am not a big gamer.  I'm old.  Over 50.  When I purchased a new computer recently, wanting to take it for a spin, I asked my son what to do and he told me about Steam.  As an ancient history buff (I'm also a writer and have written a novel about the ancient Spartans), I did searches on Greece and Rome and eventurally found Rome 2.  I read all the negative reviews about the launch.  Things haven't changed much in the gaming industry.  Companies have always rushed their product to market.  I imagine after spending years developing a game they end up deep in the hole and pressured by corporations like Sega to push it out - no matter how many problems exist.  That's been going on for years.  The wise thing to do is to wait.  You know there is going to be a patch.  Why not let someone else trip over all the bugs?  From what I gather, a lot of gamers just can't wait today.Anyway, I love Rome 2.  When I read about the Emperor's Edition having worked out most of the problems, I dove in.  It's been a delight.  What a great game.  It's more addicting that crack.  Being able to play so many different factions gives it limitless re-playability.  Thus far I've played as the Romans, Spartans, Athenians and Epirus, and have had a blast with each.  There is a huge amount of strategy and tactics available on both the campaign map and the battle maps.  Placing your armies at choke points in the mountains or at river crossings... putting them in ambush mode... slaughtering 2x or 3x your number of units without getting your hands dirty... it's all so gratifying.  One of the things I've noticed is that I usually end up winning by gaining a technological edge over the computer AI factions.  If I can survive the early stages of play, eventually I'll start kicking out armies composed of better units than my opponents.  When the autoresolve gives me results I don't like, saying I'm going to lose, or take unexceptable losses, it's fun to take control of your army and lead them on to victory when the oddsmakers are betting against you.  Of course, often times you're leading superior units against hordes of untrained spearmen or levies, but occasionally the computer gives you a run for your money and there's nothing like destroyng your opponents Praetorian guard or Oathsworn unit that fights to last man.Big kudos to the modding community.  After playing vanilla R2, I found the Workshop and have been in pure amazement at the products the community has added to the game.  The 4x moves per year mod, agent color coding, the new unit mods, and many others deserve effusive praise.  I feel like a kid on Christmas morning every time I look in the Workshop, wondering what new toy I'll find under the tree today.The Bad.  I have none.  Okay, okay, there are some, but I'm like a newlywed on his honeymoon right now.  I don't care if she leaves her panties on the bathroom floor or that the 4x calendar year mod makes agents overpowered.  For right now, I'm enjoying the game far too much to complain about a thing.

												The pros and cons as I see it (compared to other TW games) based on the campaign (single and multiplayer)EDIT: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE VANILLA GAME WITHOUT MODS. Please read the review before making critical comments, as I'm bored of having to repeat myself for people who couldn't be bothered.Pros:- campaign map environments are varied and atmospheric- graphics especially in battles are beautiful- small details such as rocks hitting walls then falling to the ground, & remaining lethal while in motion adds to the immersion- army/navy military traditions and generals/agents traits create a satisfying long-term progression over the campaign- The conversations and comments among soldiers during battles are amusing and add immersionCons:- Naval combat and boat physics is abysmal, the worst yet by far.- Naval AI is feeble.- Autoresolve calculations are extremely bad, making small and uninteresting battles often compulsory to play to prevent ridiculously unrealistic outcomes.- When autoresolving, siege equipment is invariably the heaviest casualty, even on a 98% victory I have had entire units of Heavy Onagers wiped out entirely. Cavalry often suffers disproportionaly high casualties as well.- Diplomacy is still terrible, despite what they say about improving it: nations with 1 village demanding tens of thousands of gold for a non aggression pact when you control half the game world...- Unable to specify amounts of money in diplomatic negotiations, instead having to select a percentage of your total treasury.- Pikemen were the one unit which actually behaved realistically upon release, moving forward relentlessly into the enemy lines and encircling cornered enemies. That has since been ""fixed"" and they now stand gormlessly in a dead straight line, even when ""formation attack"" is unticked.- Roman legionary units fight in the same style as barbarians, with single men constantly breaking formation to have a 1v1...- ""Growth"" becomes worthless after about 50 turns, whereas in all previous games it continues to be beneficial.- Desyncs in multiplayer campaigns are not uncommon, and often void the save.- Barbarian units are far too disciplined and tightly regimented. Essentially just reskins of helenistic or roman unit columns.- Barbarians have access to the same siege equipment as the Romans and Greeks (with the exception of the Polybolos, which barely counts as it is the most useless of all the siege units)- Many available buildings, such as the slave trader or wine markets, are completely redundant and offer nothing that isn't easily bested by other buildings.Overall this game has been a major let down, and I wasn't even one of the ones who was super hyped about a Rome 2! Add to all this the constant releasing of new DLC which - even if you do not buy it - downloads automatically, rendering all mods incompatible! (but remains unavailable until you pay for the handful of half-baked reskins of pre-existing units & new menu screen that it contains)Its not all terrible. With enough modding it does become relatively enjoyable and worth investing some hours in. So as long as you are prepared to spend the time finding the right mods to address the multitudes of issues, and are willing to endure the frustration of having them periodically disabled by some new piece of unrequested DLC inviting itself into your install, then it is worth a look. Otherwise, its not a good call.I would love to love this game, it has so much potential, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it to anyone, especially not fans of the series such as myself, as it has seriously damaged my faith in Total War.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Update 31/01/15):Few more cons that I didn't mention first time around (the list is so long its hard to remember them all!)- Campaign AI is idiotic regarding threats. An enemy army garrisons a town. I move an army into the region in preparation for attack. Next turn, the enemy army has gone and the town is completely undefended. Bad AI and an opportunity for a fun siege battle ruined.- I have never seen campaign AI recruit the top tier units for Roman or Hellenistic factions. Even 250+ turns into the game I'm fighting against armies of militia hoplites + slingers.- Amphibious battles: AI frequently leaves one or two ships out at sea, so after killing their land forces the only way to ""win"" is to sit there on fast forward for the next 20 minutes while the clock ticks down. (NB: If you have selected ""Unlimited"" battle time, this situation can not be won, you must quit battle and be given a defeat, or reload and autoresolve. Yup, one ship containing 10 levy freemen can defeat your force of 1000+ elite troops just by sitting at sea, doing nothing!)- ""Fast forward"" in battles increases game speed by about 3%....- Pathing for siege engines and siege-equipped ships is terrible. Instructions to shoot at targets within range often just results in the engine walking/sailing slowly towards the target, not shooting at it.- ""Fire at will"" often results in many friendly casualties, as they will simply attack the nearest target regardless of its proximity to friendly units. Shogun 2 was intelligent about this and did not have this problem. Rome 2 seems to have gone backwards here...- Cavalry frequently ignore orders to disengage from melee. Often the same order needs to be given 3-5 times before they actually attempt to escape the melee.- Cavalry frequently ignore orders to attack. If the enemy unit begins to run from the fight, your units will make no attempt to pursue or re-engage them. This means MASSIVE micro-management of cavalry units when fighting against skirmisher or archer cavalry, as each individual unit needs to be re-instructed to attack several times throughout the battle. Failure to notice this results in your unit standing still whilst the enemy cavalry sit 20 feet away murdering them with javelins and arrows.- Ship ramming animations look like something from a cartoon. They are truly terrible. Again, Shogun 2 did this MUCH better. Heck, even Empire had better collision effects, and that game didn't even have a ramming mechanic!- Campaign map resources are.... a nice idea. However, one region of North Africa containing little more than sand and scrub supposedly supplies timber. Playing as Macedon, I found myself importing my timber from this North African region in order to build siege engines, despite occupying around a dozen heavily forested regions in Europe, none of which apparently had any access to timber... Nice idea, but ludicrously implemented.Keep in mind, ALL of these issues are reported from the Emperor edition. This is all after the game has supposedly been ""fixed""..! Personally, Empire TW still beats this game, even now.			"

												*This review is a statement against recent Total War titles marketing scheme*This recommendation will stay negative unless Creative Assembly and Sega demonstrate to Total war fans that future Total War games will not be plagued by abusive and overpriced downloadable content (as is The Viking Forefathers ''Culture pack'', and the Longbeards ''Culture Pack'' in Attila - same with culture DLCs in this game. We have to pay to unlock an excisting file).Sega and Creative Assembly, show some respect to Total War fans.We have paid for a complete game. Could you do us the honor of delivering one?About the game: All I wanted was a new Rome 1 with better grafics but I got a Rome 2 which lost its soul of Rome Total War. I am missing the micormanagement of evolving my cities, getting in conflict with my neighbours and inventing new technologies to improve my armies. Rome II is much more easier than Rome I because some features are missing, e.g. to get in contact with other civilizations I just have to ""see"" their borders or an unit of them (in Rome I you had to send diplomats). The grafics are okay without impressing me very much. I am able to play Rome II with extrem settings but the battles are not very immersive. The new feature, the unit camera in battles, is nice to have but absolutly unneccessary. Like in any other Total War the AI is not the best. CA improved it but all in all the AI is not a tactical genious. In battles they try to flank you with riders but if you handle them you win. Without mods the AI spams tons of agents that is just annoying.I enjoyed the game. Really. I like the ancient setting very much, that's the reason I played this game. But I do not recommend to buy this game (especially outside any sale) because without the expensive DLC it's unfinished. You are able to double its content by buying DLC - so you pay twice as much for a complete game. That's not fair!			"

												Ignoring that this game was an absolute joke on release day (yes, I'm still bitter about getting duped into pre-ordering so I could use one of the factions included in the game without having to pay for it), it's still a huge disappointment. The Emperor Edition is a massive improvement, but still falls way short of what was promised. Even with all the patches, the game is a big step back from Shogun 2.Firstly, the game is lifeless and boring. I've yet to even get close to year 0 in a save and I've probably started about 20 of them. Just look at the hours I've spent playing this game. I've tried so hard since the day it was released to get into a save in this game, and it's never happened. All of the screenshots and promotional media for this game looked amazing and captivating, but that feeling never materalizes in the actual game. I never have the urge to expand my empire, or make my enemies pay for crossing me. It just feels like I'm engaging in a strategy (if you want to call it that) exercise against AI, nothing more.  CA have sucked the life out of this series by dumbing down things like politics and diplomacy, and removing things like family trees for no aparent reason. The best feeling I got from this game was when I finally accepted that I wasted my money on it and uninstalled it from my system. The AI is still horrendously bad. It's a million times better than it was at release, but it's still terrible. It's so easy to learn AI tendencies, and it takes a huge amount of restraint to stop myself from exploiting them. Battle AI is really bad, but luckily there are a lot of mods that can fix this and actually make it enjoyable. At the same time, there's only so much modders can do to cover up CA's mistakes, and it's really sad that CA needs other people to fix their game for them to make it playable. Campaign AI is atrocious and not even challenging. There's hardly any logic in the strategy of AI factions. They don't seem to care about defending their cities and they never create any type of organized, strategic attack. The only way to make the game challenging is to put the difficulty on very hard, so the AI can just churn out full stacks at will and send them at you one by one. Even then, it just turns into a game of fending off the armies, one or two at a time, until the AI does something inexplicably stupid to give you the advantage. It's extremely frustrating to have a back and forth war with an AI faction over one of its settlements, only to have that faction just randomly move all of its armies away from that settlement, basically allowing you to walk right in and take it. This type of thing happens ALL OF THE TIME and takes all of the intensity and excitment out of wars. Some parts of the game are still broken, even in the Emperor Edition. Sieges are somehow even worse than Shogun 2. City gates are broken. Any unit can just burn down a gate by throwing flaming sticks at it, but then they are unable to walk through it. I'm not even sure if battering rams work at all. Ladders and siege towers kind of work though (at least with the overhaul mod that I've used), so there's that. Obviously the game is still addicting in some way, as it's managed to get me to pour 200+ hours into it, but it feels more like I've wasted a massive part of my life trying to get this game to entertain me than anything else. People who have never played a Total War game before may find this game neat because of the setting and the battles (which are absolutely a standout feature for this series when compared to other strategy games), but those of us who have played TW games before know how much of a disappointment this was. For those who disagree with me: go back and look at the promotional videos that CA released prior to the game's launch and compare that to what we paid for. I've not experienced anything close to what was advertised, and I've yet to see anyone who has been able to make this game look anywhere near the way it did in the videos of the ♥♥♥♥in alpha (that CA said was still going to be further optimized). It still looks cool at times--some of the cities having unique features on the battle map is a really cool feature, and the campaign map looks by far the best it has in any game of the series.Overall, Rome 2 was a huge failure and a waste of time for everyone involved. It actually compares really unfavorably to Rome 1 and Medeival 2 from 10 years ago. CA has already rushed into making another game, Atilla, which is really just a remake of one of Rome 1's expansions released as a full game. I will not even be touching that game unless it gets great reviews and goes on sale for <$20. You'd have to be a fool to preorder that game after the trainwreck that was Rome 2's launch. CA has used up all the good faith it built from its early games and deserves to be under heavy scrutiny going forward.As for anyone thinking about buying this game, I would strongly recommend not to. Even if its heavily discounted, it's really not worth the time that you will pour into it before finally accepting that it's just not a good game. I would suggest waiting for Atilla's release and seeing what the community consensus is (let's not forget how many gaming websites gave Rome 2 highly favorable reviews at launch). Hopefully CA will get its act together and release what Rome 2 should have been.TLDR:Pros+Campaign map looks really good compared to other games in the series+Modding community is amazing and did CA a huge favor by saving this game before CA could make it playable on its ownCons-The AI is so bad that it's really hard to actually use strategy in a meaningful way-No immersion due to features from previous games being streamlined or removed-Game was released with numerous broken features and many of these features still remain broken despite all the patches-Really disappoints graphically in a lot of areas (poorly optimized)			"

												Rome 2 was extremely bugged upon release and infuriated countless fans, including die hard Total War fans. With the release of the Emperor Edition, most of all these bugs and performance problems had been successfully adressed, making this entry one of the best that Total War had and has ever seen.To this day, I still enjoy replaying campaigns just for the heck of it. Meaning bingeplaying for weeks at end and still not getting bored.15.000+ hours of Total War and 2.500+ of Rome 2 alone speak for themselves.			"

												A Review of Rome 2.So. Yesterday I finally decided, after crushing another army at shogun 2, to give Rome 2 a whirl.I'll mostly compare it to Shogun 2, seeing as CA&SEGA tried to surpass it's success.Now, I know about how hyped it was, and how much flak it's been getting since release, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt.Gameplay-wise, combat.Good points:All factions have different units, with slightly different statistics to boot, which makes for more varied combat situations.Statistics are now broken down in even more sections that can be improved upon.Units are thankfully still in 100+ range, so your 20 unit army is still large enough.Hiding has been slightly improved upon shogun 2, and LoS hiding is detailed a bit better.Garrisons are now meaningful enough that one unit of bowmen can no longer snipe down an entire city.Bad points.Morale. I don't know what they're thinking down there, but early units' morale is so ridiculously low that getting twenty casualties can send units into a shattered state.Differences in unit strength. Your basic units are so weak when people start fielding their mainstays that, coupled with that horrendous morale issue, they hold for a literal ten seconds before routing.Your land army can spontaneously and instantly turn into a fullstack navy on a whim, making real navies pretty much pointless.Defensive battles are made even easier by making any and all defenders able to rout, and having 0 morale bonus for being the last line of defense, which makes sieges a cakewalk.DiplomacyGood points:New requests: Non-aggression pacts, defensive alliances, military alliances, yes! Give diplomacy a function besides extorting money and asking for trade agreements. The AI actively pursues diplomacy now, very rewarding.Bad points:The AI actively pursues diplomacy, like a toddler. Geography, war/peace status and relationships matter not to the AI, additionally they ask for the most ridiculous prices for mundane things at time, or ask senseless requests every single turn.Diplomatic relations are confusing and often nonsensical, even though there are way more actions that affect relations now.Gameplay-wise AIGood:AI now partakes in many more activities than before, and combines their land and naval armies in assaults now.Bad:Pretty much everything.AI in field battles goes in a near-straight line for your units, tries to send cavalry to a flank and then forgets about it, and battles devolve into a slugfest until they're out of units.AI on an offensive siege battles rushes your control points(REALLY NOW?) instantly, and that's it.AI on defensive siege battles...Stand their ground, even if they have no missile units and you're standing there slinging projectiles on their poor militia until the last arrow has been spent.AI sometimes inexplicably moves their army to who-knows-where when you're standing five feet from their capital, and leaves it wide-open for a quick siege.AI occasionally does seemingly senseless attacks with one or two units against a city or fullstack, and then obviously loses.Other things of note:You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT recruit any units anywhere, anywhen, except for straight into a general's army. So don't bother trying.Generals are near-pointless except for getting an easy elite unit.Expect graphical glitches and FPS drops, even on super-tier computers.Although there are several different factions, you are still very limited in your choices, which is a disappointment personally.Conclusion:Is this the TW game to rule all TW games? No.Is this game worth buying? If you're a TW type of game fan, pick it up for a campaign or two, though I recommend waiting for either fixes or it going on sale.Is it worth buying when you're new to the genre? No. If you wish to experience all that TW has to offer, Shogun 2 or perhaps medieval TW are the ways to go.Total score:6.5/10If you like the series, grab it if only for completionist's sake, if you are new to it or still in doubt, wait for fixes or it going on sale.Rose "

												Rome II has a few nice features the original Rome Total War lacked, like cavalry being able to dismount for assaults on cities ; and a battlefield AI which, after patching, is reasonably competent and doesn't throw it's generals in immediately to their deaths to try to run down a unit of skirmishers. Unfortunately it not only drops many of the most interesting, enjoyable and atmosphere enhancing features that were in the original Rome, but also implements many features in ways that destroy game-play, believability and historical accuracy. It also seems unfinishedThe province system in which cities are grouped into provinces in which buildings in one city affect every city in the province held by the same faction is interesting, but the way buildings work is pretty annoying.You can research technology, but the starting tech isn't even bronze age - you need a tech advance for battering rams and ladders.The level of detail you can see in your settlements population, happiness/unhappiness, squalor etc is massively reduced as is info on where income and trade income comes from.The political system and 1 year turns result in generals being recalled or dying as soon as they get any significant experience or skills. Agents don't last much longer.The stylised icon interface is annoying and not intuitive.The AI and pathfinding bugs in assaults on walled cities are pretty terrible even after 6 patches and one beta patch. The AI still can't pick up, put down and use ladders, rams or siege towers effectively the way it could in the original Rome Total War ten years ago or Medieval 2 Total War 7 years ago.There are over 100 factions, but many are out of period or just made up, including client states like Carthage's two ; and they slow the AI turn down more and more as the game progresses.Worst of all are the instant super transports. Any army can create transports to carry it by stepping off a beach, for free. They're capable of fighting in sea battles and beating any starting fleet whether in auto-calc or not by weight of numbers. Every faction from Scythian nomad horse archers to Spanish and African tribes goes for a sail in the Mediterranean, with nothing much to fear from enemy navies. Factions which lose all their cities also take to the sea. They then either float there till they slowly die, or hover off the coast forcing you to place armies in all your coastal cities for dozens of turns until they slowly die of attrition, or else they take cities by avoiding your land armies and acting as vikings. What? Build fleets to hunt them down you say? But you can't afford to - ships for fleets take time and money to build and require pay. Instant transports don't - and your own field armies are tied down on land preventing them from coming back by sea.Bizarrely the game designers have decided that transports should be just a slightly inferior version of a large oared warship with the same hundreds of oarsmen and ram and sleek design as a warship. In reality in the Roman and Hellenistic period transports were usually commandeered merchant sailing ships, because they could carry enough troops, horses and food and water for them. Oared warships were good for ramming, boarding and raking the oars off of enemy ships - but all those oarsmen and the narrow hulls to make them maneuverable left them with no room to carry more than a few marines. They usually followed coastlines so they could land to get food and water for the oarsmen each day - and so they could land if there was bad weather as oared galleys were not very seaworthy. Yet  insta-super-transports somehow  fit hundreds of soldiers, horses and elephants.Unlike in the original Rome you can fight out sea battles rather than just autocalc them. The ships and marines in sea battles look great, but the way sea battles work is pretty lamentable. Boarding is made very easy. No need to use grapples (iron hooks on ropes) to get close to an enemy ship to board it, let alone use a corvus (rotatable boarding ramp with a spike on the end to go through the enemy deck) - bumping into them is good enough. Even more ridiculously, once one ship is boarding another no other ship or marines can touch either of them.Historically smaller galleys could outmanouvre and defeat larger ships - as at the battle of Actium. In Rome II small ships are incapable of doing much damage to larger ones, even where the large ship is a transport or some lightly built viking style ship. Historically a small oared galley with a metal plated ram could turn faster than larger ships and immobilise them by oar raking (shearing off enemy ship's oars using ram). Or they could sink them by ramming broadside and holing it below the waterline. Many major ancient cities such as Syracuse and Jerusalem, which the Romans had great difficulty taking by siege and assault due to their massive fortifications and inner and outer walls and citadels are in the game as unwalled villages and hamlets. This makes the game even more ridiculous and annoying for anyone who knows even the basics of the history – and makes no sense.Total War games can’t include every settlement, so they usually include the most important, largest or most strategically significant ones. By conquering a settlement you conquered the province it was in in Rome Total War. In Rome II this is called the ‘region’ with two or more regions grouped into a province. How could the most important settlement in an entire region be a hamlet or a village? Even ignoring the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all over history, this makes no sense.Giving three quarters of settlements no walls seems like it was another cheap, rush option to minimise costs and so maximise profits. Have working siege AI? Nah - just re-use the engine from Empire, Napoleon and Shogun Total War but take the walls off most cities.Some attempt to justify this as reducing the number of ""boring"" sieges / assaults. In fact it reduces the frequency and size of field battles compared to Rome 1 or Medieval 2 Total War because in those games the player or AI required at least 1 turn and usually more to build enough siege equipment to take a town - and in that time the player or AI usually sent an army to try to break the siege - resulting in a battle with the relieving army on one side and the besieging army and garrison on the other.In Rome II you get lots of incredibly dull and annoying assaults on the unwalled town square against some garrison militia units instead. Field battles or assaults on an actual walled town using siege equipment would be preferable.The myriad bugs a requiring endless patching and missing features suggest it was rushed out incomplete and without even beta testing.Rome II runs poorly and with poor graphics on many PCs and laptops unless the Graphical Enhancement Mod is used. Mistakes made in the ongoing patching process make the game currently not run with mods. Anyone thinking of buying should hold off for at least 6 months and maybe a year or two till patching is over and better mods finished			"

												Oh boy, guys, this game is the bee's knees. This game is really good, insofar as the DLC policy makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a rusty flensing knife. Don't you love it when you go into the classical era and you can't play as the classical Greeks because you have to pay seven fiddy for the culture pack? Oh boy, check out the all new and amazing unit packeroni for the Mouthbreathii out in the middle of nowhere, only ten thousand of your hard earned doubloons. You have to pay for blood. Blood. In a war game. I get that the Germanians never gave up their backwards censorship culture, but just do what valve did and replace the blood with gears or something. How would you feel if nintendo took out the ability to play as luigi in mario kart? You can still race against him, just if you want to play as him you have to buy the ""We-a takin' your-a money"" culture pack.When you pay 60 bucks for a game, you expect to get the full game, am I right? I'm wrong, they did the same thing in attila and most people are just accepting that they are being taken advantage of. No one knows what is going on anymore, no one buys a game and expects anything more than a piecemeal half-baked omelet that requires the ""salt and pepper"" DLC for 10 million dollars. Hey guys, when was the last time you bought a game and you got the whole game, no strings attached? Almost a decade ago for me, unless you count indies. We dont need a socratic dialogue to see that the AAA sphere is an abhorrence to anything good and pure in this world. I'll now list the pros and cons of this game:+ Nice grafix+ Nice gameplay- AI is total garbage, hey CA, maybe A* was ok in the days of yore but there should not be an AI this terrible in a modern game. Make some better algorithms! Pikmin 1 on the gamecube has a much, much better ""army style"" AI and it was released in 2001! ! ! - Hey, if you want to see the rest of this review you have to give me 20 billion dollars as part of the ""GOD I JUST WANT TO END MY MISERABLE LIFE"" review pack DLC.All in all I'd like to bestow upon this game a rating of ""To see this rating, buy the ""End Reviews"" Review pack DLC for only 300 trillion dollars"", and if you think that joke is getting stale, well, for you it's a joke, for me and the people who own this game its a harsh, painful reality they have to deal with everyday.""Oh boy, scary face guy, they dun diddly did it again with Warhammer"" Thanks for telling me that, me. Now I'll just bestow upon you fellows my incomprehensible rage. Chaos is DLC, my friends. Chaos. For those not in the know, putting Chaos as DLC is like putting Carthage as DLC. Basically, we are now getting the shafterino againerino. Hey, this probably won't be the end of it. Make sure to buy the game 2 years after its out to get the whole actual entire game that they should have released from the beginning at a much, much cheaper price. Why on earth is SEGA doing this? Why? Why? ? ? ? ? ? ? What did we do to deserve this? I want to give you my money, but y'all are acting so incomprehensibly asinine that I don't think I can, at least not without having parts of the game locked out from me. ITS ""DOWNLOADABLE"" CONTENT, NOT ""HEY WE TOOK IT OUT OF THE GAME LADS PLAY4ONLY 4000 QUADRILLION $"" CONTENT.No, we're not done, lads. I want to play as my ancestors, the scythians, but thats a unit pack. We steppefolk don't like getting scammed out of our hard earned mnai by some uppity publisher that thinks it's disgusting DLC policy is ""smart"". There's less money in the industry than there should be because consumers are untrusting of scummy companies (ya think?). Well, that ends my magnificent opus odimini. Seriously though, buy the ""Complete Edition"" (read: the actual whole game) in a few years and save yourself the hundred dollars buying the DLC.11/23/16: ONE YEAR ON AND NO SIGN OF THE FULL GAME EDITION, B/C OF SEGA AND CA GRUBBERY I NOMINATE THIS HALF-GAME THE SAD STEAM AWARD, SAD B/C ALL YOUR MONEY WAS STOLEN BY THE DEVS FOR DLC.Where are the good games? Where are the games that make you wonder, that blow you away, that up-end your worldview? Where are the games that pick you up, slam you against the furniture, and leave you wanting? Where are the games that you pick up on a hunch and become family treasures that you cherish till end-of-days? Where are the games that don't follow cliche to make money but make money through grassroots watering con good gameplay, good sound, good grafix, good story, good character? Where are the games that are fun to experience, fun to play, not just difference exercises but works of love, passion, and beauty? Where are the games that save you and love you and make you love the world and yourself with no guilt as guilt is no concept permissible in the reality of the game? Where are the games with AI so good it isn't artificial and it is intelligent? Where are the games with music and graphics so good you see the game's reality better than your own? Where are the games with story so good you feel as though you weren't narrated to, you weren't told what to think, you weren't told what to do, you did it because you wanted to do it, because you love the game, because it loves you, because you are and it is love made manifest. Where are the games with gameplay so good you rolled with the licks and nicks and ticks because you felt the ribbing and it's like a cold Febuary morning drinking hot chocolate when you say something off and your big bro whacks you on the arm and it doesn't hurt tho it should because you have a family and you're together and you belong, and the rapport is fun, and the highs high and the lows high and you're feeling tired and satisfied and happy...  ...where is the hope? Wander through the eons of miserere. The darkness of modernity clouds us, makes us stupid, turns us against each other, the fog of modernity blinds us worse than acid, lobotomizes us, the poison of modernity is supped with gusto by those who can't take they're in a feudal society, but no free housing, no free food, if not for video games, television, internet, books suicide would be the order of the day. The kali yuga is unbearable, the dark age is a killer, the age of darkness is a merciless flayer, a mindless flayer, the machine engineered with one purpose and that is to enrich itself con the blood of the two legged cattle it flays. Where are the hope, Where are the hope, Where are the hope ???????? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ????????? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??????Where are the games that aren't TWO HUNDRED BILLION BUCKAROONIES FOR THE WHOLE PACKAGE CREATIVE BUTTEMBLY YOU SHEKEL GRUBBERS?

												(Before you read)The game runs well now. But my main issue with the game is the lack of immersion... the hurrendous dlc, the game engine itself.. the games horrid, its 3 step backwards from shogun etc, boring and streamlined, theres no depth.. . many features are still broken and irreparable, like the function of generals, or the use of siege equipment.... the fact that this game is available on Ipad is a joke in itself. Buy it if you're looking to see a few battles from the classical time period.. but dont expect any challenge from it, the games boring, unimmersive, broken, offensive and creative assembly are having a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥laugh if they think making 40 quid worth of dlc for one of the most dissapointing games of all time.. is at all acceptable. They have moked not only the fans, but history itself.I have been waiting for this game since I ever layed eyes on the first installment, back in 2004. A younger me would lay at night and dream about Rome 2 in all its glory... after my dream games announcment I quite literally jumped with joy! No words can express how excited and stimulated I was on the day of release.. I hadnt been this excited for a game since Skyrim.. unfortunatley I clicked play and instead, had an enormous peverted vanular fallas strike me between the eyes soo hard I thought not only my life had been extinguished, but the very reality we exist in, THIS GAME IS A BLOODY DISGRACE! AND THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TWO FACED MONEY GRABBING LIARS AT CA SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!Regardless of the initial bugs (CURRENTLY ON PATCH 7!!!), the game itself is a broken, shambolic, overpriced piece of rushed nonsense. The AI is awful, the worst its ever been, the ui has been destroyed and there is no immersion whatsoever... the campaign is dull and lifeless, with many broken features, such as pointless generals and a diplomacy system which leaves you in fits of frustration.. im not even going to start on the sea battles, lets just say I broke down and cried during one, at the fact that CA had the sheer ♥♥♥♥ing ordasity to reveal this to anyone other than children.... not to mention the ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced and historically inaccurate depictions of just about every faction in the game.. I will for the first time ever seriously consider whether or not to buy the next installment in the series.Sure they added a couple of nice features such as regional management and larger navies etc... But EVERYTHING ELSE is worse off...and the two things i've mentioned are buggy and in my opinion irreperable, they stripped hundreds of features from the previous games! WHY!??? where are the cutscenes? the immersion? the family trees? the music? the voice actors? the siege eqipment? AND ♥♥♥♥ OF TORCHES FOR EVERY UNIT!!?? RIDICULOUS! Pike units only reveal their pikes when in phalanx, units are unbalanced, slingers are too common and overpowered... the list is endless...As for Multiplayer.... christ.. It might aswell not have it, barebones and immpossible to play coop due to loading times! In addition tactical vantage points such as hills and forested areas offer no benefit, removing almost all form of strategy from the game.. Ive patche it, ive modded and invested 100 hours and still havent been able to change my mind, IF YOUR READING THIS DONT BUY THE DLC !!! be content with what you have, ROME 1 is a far superior game!FInally I HAVE HAD IT WITH THIS ENGINE! There is no unit collision! they all just awkwardly slide against one another, ♥♥♥♥ing mosh pit and then execute singular kill moves with added athletisism.. it just looks ridiculous and is totally unrealistic! Empire got away with it as it was mainly musket warfare! CREATIVE ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO START OVER!!! fighting in this period was all about fromations!! how do you think Alexander defeated Darius at Galgumea or The Romans againtss Budicca when they where outnumbered 10-1, ♥♥♥♥ING FORMATIONS!!!! NOT MOSH PITS!@@#@It is blatantly clear that the folks up at CA just don't give a ♥♥♥♥ anymore, and would much prefer screwing us all over for a quick buck, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.. :(from a depressed and infuriated fan of total war since 2004... have a nice day :) DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

												I bought retail version of the game for 20 bucks. I had some good fun with it.Rome 1 was and still is a masterpiece, but has Rome 2 reached that level of awesomenest? Nope, but it's still damn fun.So, why can't I recommend this game to you guys? PROS: I'm just 20 hours into the game, and the Grand Campiang has been really good so far, custom battles are fun, so are ambushes.Graphics are good, collision is not the best, but the battles are always great to watch.(and there is Steam workshop for Rome2 woohoo) CONS: It's not worth the money. Retail version for 20 bucks is definitely worth buying, but that's the price in my country (Serbia). Full price of 55 US dollars on Steam would be a fair deal if the game contained all the DLCs.There are 3 Cultural Pack DLCs which are the stupidest thing ever made. You can't play as Sparta or Athens if you don't spend extra 7 bucks. Besides that, there are 3 DLC campaings. With Emperor edition you do get an extra campaing, but if you want to experience all of the DLC campaings you need to spend extra 45 dollars. There are a few unit pack DLCs, and there is Blood and Gore DLC ( that♥♥♥♥♥♥should be free, shouldn't even be considered as DLC ).  CONCLUSION: Total War: Rome 2 is one of my favourite games in the series but IT IS NOT WORTH all the money.If you want to buy this game wait for a sale (-75%) or check♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs are NOT WORTH your money, buy them if you find them cheap (on♥♥♥♥♥you can find Greek States Culture Pack for 2$).SEGA really has to change DLC policy. Nobody wants to pay  full price for 50% of the game. I just hope they are not going to ♥♥♥♥ up next Total War game like they did Rome 2 and Attila. EDIT  I understand charging extra money for the campaings because they add hours of new content, and if made good, they can be worth getting. But ""cultural packs"" should be free.			"

												Rome 2 was a serious disappointment. Having loyally followed the franchise since Shogun 1, the expectations for this game were huge. The marketing campaign in advance of release appeared to promise all a fan could wish for and more. Yet once released it soon transpired that the game had many cut or truncated features (no family tree, nerfed political system), was dummed down to an arcade style tactical battle system (magic power buttons and battles over in record time), as well as many, many AI problems and design flaws (Transport Ships, Sieges).Despite all the patching, the core issues have not been fixed. Mods help, but they cannot cure the fundamental flaws.Paid DLC and generic content DLC just added insult to injury.This game is a victory of presentation over substance and an abject lesson to never pre-order. Wait for the game, be patient, it will be worth it when you save some bucks, get a patched release and perhaps a DLC bundle 6 months down the line. Although for this game, even if it were reduced in price and came with a fat DLC bundle = stay away, this is a disappointment through and through.Boot up Rome, MTW 2 and Shogun 2, add some of the excellent Mods and enjoy some great gaming.Rome Total War 2 was a shameful display.

												This will be an honest and fair rant. Please scroll to bottom for the fast review. ***I'll start this by saying I really like the TW series, I own all TW games and DLCs, plus some CA games that I bought mainly to support the studio. Generally I don't play many other games on Steam. Rome 2 was the first TW I was hyped for and wanted to get on release. It is just too diverse, too big not to be entertaining.  Seeing the buggy mess it was on release I decided to wait a bit and give CA the chance to fix the game. Which *spoilers* they never did. Now, as someone who enjoys playing even the original Shogun I am not one for graphics. I really liked how they went with all games since Empire and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Medieval 2 still looks great in field battles. But I couldn't care less about the looks. I fell in love with the game mechanics, they clicked right in place with me and I spent numerous hours trying to get to understand them, both ingame and in real life. That's how you know a great video game - you get to constantly think of it when you are not playing it. Learning Shogun 2 took me quite some time and I won't win a competition for knowing the game. There are still new things I discover every now and then. They all fall right into spot, close the cycle and it just feels great to come up to the next revelation. This is, unfortunately, not the case with Rome II. Rome II introduced some new things which are great. Like the army stances. So why on Earth does the Fortify stance say ""boosts reinforcement range by +50%"" and does not do it? This is the case with so many faction bonuses, personal traits and retainers, skills, etc, that it's mindblowing. When playing games I like to be on fair terms. Get helthpack -> health goes up. Critical strike on enemy -> 50% more damage. Things like this. Things we're used to take for granted. Rome II does a really poor job of explaining its mechanics. There are tutorial videos, but they are somehow obsolete as the game received 17 patches, the last one with major core changes. I had to play Attila to understand the whole party politics thing. Rome II is big and diverse. And this is a curse more than a blessing. There are so many little things missing, not working or just straight-forward overlooked by the developers, that I won't bother listing them all. Just go to the official support forum and check the Single Player Campaign support page. Fairly said, I think Rome II did not ever make it out of beta. The reason for this review is that CA stopped supporting the game. A game I paid and bought all dlcs for. A game I really wanted to like. The last patch fixed (arguably) some things, but not merely enough. And that is not even considering all the technical and graphical bugs, which are not a subject of this review. For a moment there I thought they are on the right way, but they just abandoned the game. The game with my favorite time period, that was supposed to revolutionize the TW franchise as the core mechanics weren't changed since Empire. Well, I'm sorry for being mad, but I am. As a user, as a customer. False data, false advertisment and false promises. Thanks CA, I'll gladly pirate your♥♥♥♥♥♥from now on and not buy a single title. Unless Rome II is fixed that is. ***PROS: + Looks great. Some folks may argue here, but for me the game running on Ultra is gorgeous. + One of the biggest maps in TW games. Meaning a lot of factions, traits, bonuses, variety in general. + There are some great historical campaigns in addition to the main game that make the title's worth.+ New mechanics and even controls to make the TW experience more up-to-date.CONS:- A bit buggy even after all the patches. Soldier groups will shout different units' lines. No anti-aliasing; water reflection is broken. Some really ugly textures. There's a lot more to that list.- Unfinished mechanics that clearly can be fun but are not even a factor to work with. - Some clearly broken gameplay elements. Bonuses not given though they should be. Traits acting on the opposite. Sometimes your generals will get bad (or good) traits with no apparent reason. - Too much DLCs, some arguably not worth their money. - Continious lack of support for some of the major elements and problems this game has. - Looks like some of the best ideas for Rome II didn't make it in the game and we were sold Attila instead. Which is fine, but everyone can see that Rome II needs some Attila in it.  "

												First of all. This analysis has been editted. The original one was pretty negative, and the reason for that were the infite bugs, glitches and unbalances of this game. After so many patches, even tho we may find a considerable quantity of bugs and glitches, it's not game-killing as it was in the days, weeks and months following the launch.So, finally, here's my review of the game Total War: Rome II.This game is adicting, because of the simple fact it's good. It has many mechanics that are great!The graphics, if you're playing on high or ultra quality are AMAZING. Both on SP and MP (by MP I mean battles, they can be campaign vs. AI battles). The camera they have is pretty nice to see charges, not that good on seeing infantry or ranged units, but you still get the emotion.It has a few nice historical battles, tho more should be added, FOR FREE.The technology part of it is pretty well made, and the development of your cities if pretty cool. The levelling up system on your general, troops, and agents is really cool, but it doesn't change the game too much. The diplomacy is nice, and one should pay attention to it, as it can save your life. Other positive aspect, the politics. Some factions are cooler to play when talking about politics. Some factions just don't have active politics, tho for all of them politics can change where your empire is turned to. If your family is too strong, the weak will rebel and create a civil war. Too weak? The strong will rebel and create a civil war. But, distributing the power well is not the only thing that changes. When your empire gets big, there'll be a civil war. Be counting on that. And be prepared. You may have to stop all frontier military actions to save your capital and near settlements from the separatists.Negative: These DLCs they create, they're too expensive just to add/change a few things... At the date near the game release, those who bought the game were forsaken by the producer of the game, making us live in the constant bugs. So, don't expect nice treatment.Overall I'd say the game is good, not perfect, AI still gets dumb sometimes, but, if you put on a difficulty high enough, it becomes quite a challenge. If you get tired of the game, I recommend you check the workshop out, maybe it has what you need to fire up that urge to play the game again.Right now, I'd say you think well if you want this game, if you're not sure, wait for a discount, tho, it might never come. Even a 25% discount would be enough to make this game worth your money.Talking about popularity of the game. Even tho it has been on the 'Most Sold' Steam tab many times, it hasn't got a big community, I'd say mostly because of the game-killing bugs it used to have, and the fact that Single Player Campaign (I don't mean the story campaign) is probably what attracts people most.My veredict: 8,5/10If using mods in the game: 9/10Please comment with your opinion (do not hesitate on using strong language if you hate me) and give me a like.Have a nice strategic day!

												I've been playing Total War games for over 10 years now.  Newer releases are getting more and more sloppy in contrast to the work being done on graphics.  The reason I chose not to recommend this game is because if you are looking for a Total War game to play among the countless that have been made, I would recommend newer titles.  I have not played and title newer than this one, but I would like to hope that they would be more ""fully developed"" than this title.  I am extremely dissapointed with this game series and I will not be purchasing any more future Total War games unless I hear good reviews from fellow die-hard TW fans.I bought this game on a black friday sale for 15 bucks; I would have kicked myself if I'd spent 50 bucks on it. For 15 bucks it is totally worth it. That being said...PROS:-Great graphics    +colors are not so vivid, giving a realistic appearance-Battle cries are emtional and excellently done    +although random soldiers' mutters are repetitive, they are usually context-relevant and humanize the soldiers    +Roman Auxilary Cavalry voice is AWESOME-Naval and land battle combination is cool, especially in siege battles-Can command 40 units at a time-Armies' unit cards are sorted intelligently (although this could be done manually in RTW 1)-Grouping settlements into provinces allows for more fluid management, especially once you've expanded to an empire-SPQR replaced by optional missions delineates gameplay allowing for a more sandbox campaign-Imperium levels and corruption, although extremely annoying, reflect the instability and brutality of the politics of ancient societies (and modern, for that matter) -Agents' passive actions (oxymoron?), such as Military Administration, Military Training, Spy Networks, etc., are cool.CONS:-Cannot play as Sparta without DLC (who pays 50 bucks and doesn't want to play as Sparta?)-Most historic battles are DLC-Units glitch on walls       +many times when you tell them to move left, they first move right, vice versa      +in a Rome city defense battle I commanded, units on walls wouldn't obey commands or act at all-Naval battles are bugged      +ships sometimes will get locked into moving the direction they are facing; never stopping until they slide into a corner of the map      +naval artillery/missiles will lock onto a land target's last location within their firing range, continuing to fire after they've left that spot until you command the ship to turn around or move out of range (commanding the unit to stop does not stop their firing orders)-Cinematic kill sequences disrupt the combat simulation    +Soldiers attempting to pull back from combat will stop and turn around to engage in a fight sequence instead of simply being chopped from behind    +There are no backstap kill sequences    +cavalry kill rate while chasing routing troops is frustratingly slow since cavalry MUST kill with cinematic kill sequence when not charging    +one sequence, in particular, may involve a soldier striking over and over again for more than 15 seconds, digging him deep behind enemy lines without being stopped by surrounding enemy soldiers-AI has not been improved since I last played Rome: Total War Barbarian Invasion v 1.6-Blood and Gore pack acted as an ""on"" switch for delimbing of soldiers; no new fight sequences were added.-General's/agent's abilities do not reflect their actions    +you may now craft an agent to accomplish any sort of task; regardless of what actual experience they have    +generals essentially cannot remain idle without developing negative traits, unless they have already aquired their maximum of three traits-Agents are not as specialized and can be more powerful than armies    +it's easy enough to develop a powerful agent; powerful agents can cripple armies into not being able to move for countless turns.    +all agents can perform all tasks with some differences in outcome (reminiscent of Dragon Age 2 and Diablo 3's overbalancing of classes, removing stark contrasts in capabilities)-Extremely limited diversity of buildings in settlements    +settlements, even capitals, are not unique from each other; essentially only a few dozen mix/match possibilities with hum-drum differences    +no point in preserving old buildings from another faction since they get in the way of your 3-5 building slot limit    +cities' appearance in battle mode do not reflect your personal development of that city-Encyclopedia is poorly organized and disruptive of the game    +Previous titles simply required a right-click to open a single unit/building information card			"

												Don't do it. I love total war. I really do. But this game lacks something. The battles are just not compelling. I don't know what the battles are missing, but their just not as fun as previous total wars.  If you want to try total war, I recommend Total War Shogun 2- it may not be as tactically deep as previous total wars, but its the most polished total war.			"

												The release of Rome Total War 2 was one of the worst in gaming history (In my experience only Assassin's Creed Unitys launch was worse), creating a huge outrage even outside the Total War community (and also some pretty funny memes).The questions is: Is it playable after more than a year? Yes it is. Is it as good as its predecessors? Sadly, no. And while I can recommend it to you, if you're looking for a good casual strategy game, its still a huge step backwards for the franchise, And like after playing Mass Effect 3, I am afraid of what the developers are doing to my beloved franchises next.So while it has its good aspects, I will focus mainly on the flaws of this game in this review. The Total War series is my favorite strategy franchise, and maybe my favorite game series in general. You've got a turn based campaign map where you capture and hold cities, build up diplomatic relationships with other nations, recruit armies and so on and so forth. When it comes to battle, the game changes from the campaign to a randomly created battlefield map, where you command your troops in real time. Total War connects the ""just-one-more-turn"" mentality from games like Civilization with intense real time battles like in World in Conflict for instance. This formula works every time, regardless of the given time period or setting. Creative Assembly added features until 2009s Empire Total War, and with Shogun 2 they've streamlined it back to bare bones to get rid of the problematic AI, which was all over the place in Empire and Napoleon.Rome 2 promised us an overhaul of the traditional Total War concept while bringing back the diversity of factions (Shoguns Clans all had the same units due to the Japan setting) and adding new features. They have lied to us. I still remember the moment when my legions first encountered the Scythians and their mounted archers in Rome 1. What I'm trying to say is that you had to adapt your tactics to the foe you were fighting back in the day. Now, although the skins and names are different, every nation still seems to have nearly the same roster. Barbarian swordmasters really play like a legionary cohort, they even throw javelins like them. The biggest two problems I have with Rome 2 is that its a) even more streamlined than Shogun 2 (they've even cut out building and upgrading streets. What the ♥♥♥♥, so you're telling me that some barbarians could march as fast through their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ woods as the mighty legions of rome on their high-tech streets?) And b), the features they've added don't work. The best example for this problem is how they've ""improved"" armies and recruitment. Previously you've recruited your troops in your cities and gathered them to army stacks. Now you have a limited amount of stacks, which gets increased by your ""empire level"" (so even if I have the economic capability to recruit more troops, I can't do that, because my ""empire level"" isn't high enough? What the flying ♥♥♥♥). Those serve under a general, who materializes the troops out of thin air apparently, as  long as he is marching through friendly territory. And while the RPG elements they've added to the stacks are interesting, not being able to move single or small amounts of units independent from a general breaks your strategy big time. If you want to capture a small city, you used to be able to dispatch a small force to get the job done. Here you have to use one of your huge, bigass Armies to conquer a tiny village. Or imagine a rebellion at the heart of you empire, while all your armies are fighting thousands of miles away. Normally you would recruit some units near the troublespot and eradicate the filthy rebel scum, but now you have to remove one of your armies from the front, leaving your cities near the enemy undefended cause once again, you can't recruit units in your cities, just to march all the way back and crush the rebellion. And if you want to exchange the units beetween your stacks, you have to move your entire stack to the other just to exchange one unit. I don't have to explain why this can be infuriating at times.Now lets get to the building and campaign map. Cities are now organized in provinces with 2 to 4 of them. This really helps to overwatch and upgrade entire regions but also comes with some problems. Those are the culture spread (Syracuse for instance has a cultural impact on southern Italy because they're in a province together) that creates public discontent, and the public discontent after capturing a city in a province. For instance the people of rome get angry at you when you take a city in northern italy, because they're in the same province. Why does this happen? Why does local discontent have to have an impact on your already captured and secured cities and lead them to rebel? What the ♥♥♥♥ CA.  I could ramble on about the hundreds of minor issues and odd design decisions of Rome 2, like the train wreck politic system, the faceless randomly generated Generals that are just weak compared to the family tree system of Medieval 2 for instance, which created interesting characters that you really cared about. I could talk about how you can't even see the fight animations because battles are huge moshpits with no order or discipline whatsoever (although CA managed to patch the worst parts of these) or how it just fails to get you immersed in the time period. Or that the repeated one-line general ""speeches"" are a shameful display compared to the long, randomly created ones of the previous games.But what breaks the game at the end of the day is the bare bones A.I. Total War is a single player game, period. And when you ♥♥♥♥ up the A.I. in a game that is designed for daylong sessions in front of your computer, you're doing something wrong. The A.I. was never CAs strenght, I admit that, but compared to the budget RTW2 had, the A.I. was never this incompetent. And while they fixed the worst insults displayed in the real time battles, it still seems you're playing against a brain dead infant on the campaign map. Giant enemy forces ignoring defenseless cities (garrisons are a joke), the A.I. randomly trying to form contracts with you even if they are completely useless, almost never declaring war on you (except you're playing the Seleucids, where its you against every eastern faction) and army stacks made half out of peasant slingers. And when you want to auto resolve those battles because 2000 slingers aren't worth your time, guess what. the auto resolve system is completely ♥♥♥♥ed, so you either lose or get unacceptable losses with your heavily armored legionaries accompanied by elite cavalry.But you've gotta give it to Creative Assembly. They know they've ♥♥♥♥ed up and they've patched big times. And while everything I've mentioned is still an issue (bad design decisions can't get patched), this is pure gold compared to the release state of Rome 2. With the release of the emperor edition, this game became something worth your money.But at the end of the day, looking at all the flaws this game has, you're better off with Medieval 2 or Rome 1.Speaking of money, my biggest concern about Creative Assembly isn't Rome Total War 2 anymore, its their DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. We're getting stoned to death by unit packs, faction DLC and additional mini campaigns, which are all right to ask money for, but please dont display a ♥♥♥♥ing button in the main menu that tells me to pay 15 ♥♥♥♥ING BUCKS for three uninteresting factions from the black sea. Again, the units are all reskins of the same 10 or so unit types, so why even bother when there are mods that make ALL FACTIONS AVAILABLE. I understand you don't have to buy these DLCs, but they lack quality and are way way overpriced. If they released a single, huge faction pack with 40 or 50 completely new units for 30 bugs, I would buy it. But the bombardment with lazy♥♥♥♥♥pay 15-bucks-for-three-more-dull-factions ""expansions"" is unacceptable and infuriating.			"

												If you're willing to play with DeI or another overhaul mod, the game is worth an upvote and can actually be fun to play, but this review is for the base game, which is underwhelming even post Emperor Edition release.First and foremost, only the first couple of turns - depending on the starting faction between 10 and 30 - feel like an actual challenge, even when playing on legendary. This is caused by the fact that the campaign map is simply to big. It takes conquering 3 or 4 nations to become the largest faction on the map and once that happens, the rest is simply a matter of time. If you get past that, the only potential problem might be the infamous civil war. Civil war was a bad mechanic at the time of release, and Emperor Edition has somehow managed to make it even more annoying. It simply punishes the players for making progress by randomly turning parts of their territory and armies against them, unless they bother doing lots of micromanagement within the faction politics system, which is boring and requires putting some aspects of character development (political traits) outside players control. I recommend using a mod that disables it altogether and hoping that Creative Assembly will finally stop adding punishing mechanics that try to emulate an actual challenge to their games - realm divide in Shogun II and civil war in Rome II have set up a bad trend, and I don't want it to be continued in Attila.In my opinion, too many buildings give happiness penalty from squalor when upgraded. It's neither a good gameplay concept nor a realistic situation, unless people living back then had nothing better to do than riot because someone in their province was farming cattle with clearly nefarious intent.The battle AI got better since release, but it can still be exploited, for example some barbarian coastal settlement maps have areas that AI never enters unless you lure its units there by coming close and then retreating inside them slowly, allowing to safely murder it with ranged troops. Siege battles haven't really gotten much harder in my opinion. Previously all you needed to do in order to win them was place a single unit of pikemen in pike phalanx behind the gate. Now you just block the stairways and towers on the wall section the AI is attacking, which will force a fight on the wall. This has the advantage of making your units pretty much immune to slingers and javelinmen - throwing stones and javelins up the walls doesn't really work, whereas a unit waiting behind the gate could still be hit - while also allowing your towers to score a lot of kills. The AI still mostly attempts to attack instantly instead of waiting for a few turns, except in certain settlements, such as Pulpedeva, where it will usually try to besiege.The factions are diverse when it comes to troop rosters, but they're still lacking balance. Armored elephants can easily destroy several units and depending on troop composition sometimes entire armies by themselves. This is offset by the fact that they require completing one of the military research lines to recruit, so normally you can't get them early on. Except if your faction can use them as general bodyguards, in which case you can get them at turn one. Sword infantry in general is also pretty underwhelming, which makes Rome itself a not-so-good faction. Basic barbarian units have morale horrible enough to make them route from being sneezed at and barbarian cities have pretty much zero defensive capabilities when compared to 'civilised' factions. The wooden towers at barbarian city gates also tend to burn one another with their own arrows if the attackers come from certain directions.When it comes to diplomacy, AI has some major issues when it comes to anything client state or satrapy related. Your allies will often declare wars against them, forcing you to either break the allience or lose the client state/satrapy. This happens because your allies will hate your vassals for having past wars with you, trespassing on your territories and agent actions against you. It also seems that other faction don't acknowledge resources produced in settlements that are being upgraded. Even if you have several settlements that produce a single type of resource, if you're upgrading just one of them then the chance to get the AI to trade with you will go down. This tends to only be noticeable at the beginning of campaigns though.The agents in general are far too strong. An experienced spy is especially broken, as he can can reliably kill over half of an army with a single poisoning.There are several major issues with the battle system.Firstly, AI troops (not whole units) will always turn to face the player cavalry charge. This is especially annoying when you try to charge at spearmen who are currently engaging your own infantry in the rear. You will notice that before your cavalry hits them, the last row of the spearmen will turn towards it, causing some extra casualties. This can be avoided by ordering the cavalry to run in the direction of the unit and only make them attack at the very last moment, and this only occurs when player does this to the AI, never the other way around.Secondly, flanking penalties are applied too often. Sometimes a single soldier will awkwardly move too far to the left or right, giving the opposing unit a morale penalty for being flanked.Thirdly, all the AI does in battles is ram your battle line with 2-3 large blobs of units, while also attacking your flanks with cavalry - even if the flanks consist of spearmen turned to face them or horse archers/skirmishers.Fourthly, giving active abilities to pretty much every single unit is annoying and is nothing more than a micromanagement nightmare that doesn't really increase the complexity of the game, since most of them have no drawbacks and should simply be used as soon as possible.Lastly, the points where reinforcements enter the battle are somewhat random. It's perfectly possible to have enemy reinforcements pop up behind you and vice versa, regardless of campaign map placement.My last concern lies with the DLC. There's more of it than it was in previous total war games, and most of it also costs more than before. In the main campaign, only 14 of the 32 playable factions are available without the DLC, which to me feels downright insulting.			"

Total War: Rome IIVeni, vidi, vici!Rome II is probably my favourite Total War game so far. It is all about ""historical"" gameplay during the Roman Empire.Rome II is worth your money because it offers you a lot... (I had more than 1000 hours of fun with this game)My review is based on the game without mods. Yes, vanilla from release on.(I never had any serious problems with the game) [Patch 17]Pro+ Graphics are still good for a 2013 game+ Battlefields are well made with some love for details+ Unit detail is okay and the animations are good (Blood DLC gives you some gore)+ Naval battles are a mess but it seems that they really happend like in the game^^+ Huge map (Ancient known world, regions [2-4 towns])+ Region system and edicts+ Wonders and important ressources+ War Elephants!+ Seasons+ Revolts!+ Over 100 factions+ Armies can level up in addition to the generals+ Good weather effects+ Religion and diplomacy+ Huge battles+ Barbarians+ Great sound, ambient music = great feeling+ High replayability (DLC's for factions and additional campaigns)+ More than one campaign besides the main one+ A few historic battles+ Multiplayer Co-Op or Versus+ Mods for every tasteCon- The AI is sometimes gamebreaking bad. It is passive and has a bad pathfinding. Simply, it has often no strategy... [mods could help out]- Sieges are not bad but the town designs repeat themselves often...- Way to many DLC's- Generals are weak and have no real skills...- No family tree...- I wish a few African Tribes would be playable (official)- Compared to other Total War games before it seems to have less game mechanics (You can't place any forts or towers like in the first Rome Total War)- I miss the agent videos of older Total Wars- Nealry no historical background informations like in ""Empire Total War""Conclusion:Although I miss a few game mechanics in Rome II, which had been in Rome I, it is a great Total War game. Mods can give the game more depth and replayability. The ancient world is waiting for you to be conquered. This game is a must have if you like Total War games!My rating is 90/100Have fun!English is not my native language. Grammatical mistakes are possible :DRegards,Dead_Terror			"

												Ever since high school, I have been obsessed with the Greek and Roman civilizations. Any of my friends IRL or the Internets can attest to this. If there is ever an occasion to indulge my passion for Greco-Roman history, I take it--be it the guilty pleasure of Starz Spartacus, watching HBO's Rome or Gladiator for the tenth time, or reinstalling Rome: Total War. Most assuredly, Rome II is not Rome: Total War. In fact, its creators (perhaps conscious of how diametric these two games are), renamed it Total War: Rome II, conceding that it is no Sequel to the game which stirred my imagination all those years ago. All that Rome II is--and can claim to be--is a Trojan horse: a transparent, misshapen, Classically themed ""gift"" that bears all the faults of the Empire: Total War engine, aka Warscape. Coupled with its technological limitations, Rome II is the victim of greed and cowardice: it was released in September, 2013, prematurely, to avoid competition with the Next-Gen consoles (showing how much faith the developers had in their product), and was gutted of content in the deluded pursuit of a perfect Metacritic score. What has been left in the wake of this Creative Idiocy is the skeleton of a game in desperate need of at least TWO YEARS of patching and the support of a dedicated modding community. My time is not meant for Rome II, and neither is yours.			"

												Straight to my vote: the game is ""somewhat"" playable after patch 7, not total garbage like on day 1, with some mods the score could reach a 6/6.5 (average), though some moments on campaign/battles can be rated easily as an 8: unfortunately these moments happen not so often and don't last very much.But i'm downvoting it because the game has still SERIOUS BUGS, GAME DESIGN FLAWS, and the BEHAVIOR OF CA IS TOTALLY OFFENSIVE on its fans.These especially make me totally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Combat system is totally arcadish and not enjoyable: fastest battles of the franchise, magic abilities, BS flags, TORCHES, formations don't matter, blobbing, almost no ""gameplay"" unit diversity between factions.-AI alternates moment of cleverness to totally stupid moments, especially on sieges, where sometimes the AI freezes, and, if you are the defender, you are forced to sally out, or wait the 60 minutes timer goes off (siege AI on Rome I and Med 2 was a lot better, and those AI were not the top: after 3 months from release is still not properly patched...).-Boring and broken naval battles, alongside a horrific non-working political systems.-Stripped down features from previous games (guard mode, family tree, fire at will for legionaries and so on).-CA  keeps releasing BS panoramic screenshots or trailers, saying they are made with Rome II engine (they are not, they are trying to cheat more people with that BS!) instead of creating cutscenes especially designed for the game (a big lack on the game)!-Instead of properly patching the game, they are keeping releasing DLCs over DLCs. Till now we have blood&gore, nomadic pack, greek states pack, caesar in gauls, and this doesn't stop. And that stuff needs patching too...-Lies over lies on marketing pre release campaign; i'll mention only one aspect: performance. They said a lot of BS about how well Rome II would be considering this aspect. You can even read ""extremely scalabe experience"" here on Steam description (yeah, my♥♥♥♥♥). They didn't release a DEMO prior to release for THE FISRT TIME IN THIS FRANCHISE: now i know precisly why the didn't make one. The game has seriously engine flaws: the worst are no proper multicore support, and the fact that CPU (and not GPU!) is used for some intesnsive gfx tasks, which brings to high CPU bottleneck-->low FPS, especially on melee.-Lack of immersion elements: no connection  with generals, no family tree, almost no faction intro videos/cutscenes, boring and repetitive musics.-Horrific UI: they have gone from the perfection of Shogun 2 to the actual crap!And i can continue to go on, but let's stop here...In the end: ALMOST NO CHALLENGE (sometimes the challenge turns out as frustration), NO IMMERSION, NO FUN LIKE ON PREVIOUS TITLES.And this is really a SHAME, considering the HUGE AMOUNT OF BEAUTIFUL ASSETS made for this game, such as beautiful units and their huge variations of helms, shields armours and so on; along awesome landscapes and cities and huge number of factions.Moreover this is double shame, considering that many aspects of the game where way way better on the old Rome I and on the previous Shogun 2. Why didn't they take the best parts of these 2 awesome games and combined to make a proper Rome II?			"

 Here's why 99% of negative reviews are invalid:  Check the date the review was posted.  It was likely posted when the game was still going through patching hell. I've heard that the game use to be broken, that the patches ruined more than they helped, that the campaign diplomacy was broken, that the campaign itself was broken, etc.Did CA rush the game? Probably. But this isn't about how angry we are, this is about the game itself. And the game is amazing. No game I've ever played has come close to this. The mix of turn based strategy and real time battles is so entertaining.I'd even say it's better than Shogun 2 Total War which is the highest rated total war game. The only downside of rome 2 is that there is a steep learning curve. They didn't do a great job of organizing all of the information and making it all intuitive to learn. The campaign is closer to being shotgunned in the face with 500 stats and facts from all of your provinces, politics, armies, and more.  BUT  once you learn how to play the game is so deep and incredible. And if your pc can run it; watching battles close up is like watching a movie. The seiges are beautiful with the full sized walls, seige equipment, destructible barricades, gore (if you buy the $2 DLC), and massive hordes of armies.And the mods..... omg the mods. They can make the AI easy or hard (or ridiculous). They unlock every faction in the game minus the DLC ones. Which means you get about 50 free factions to play. There are unit packs with entirely new units, stats, and even overhauls for the campaign and battles. There are even mods that shuffle the map around so that Rome can start where egypt is, or sparta where the barbarians are. There are mods that change how the morale system works, how fast the battles come to a close, and what types of flanking/strategy are the most effective.I literally have to force myself to stop playing sometimes. This is one of those games where you could be playing for an hour only to realize it's actually been 5.			"

												Sadly Creative Assembly has done it; they managed to outdo the mess that was the launch of Empire Total War. This game is flawed in so many ways that it would almost be funny if it were not so frustrating and sad. Even after seven (quite large) patches this game has gone from a total mess to a slightly smaller mess. That is the good news I guess? The A.I. is if I am honest is not up to par with that of the original Rome: Total War and that was released in 2004. There is still a massive issue with overall performance; specifically when it comes to frame rate drops on even extremely high end machines. The game itself feels as though it was made to appeal to a ""wider audience"" by this I mean it has been dumbed down extremely. The UI for example is very barren when it comes to information, the research screen is poor in choice, and the government screen is close to pointless. It just seems that the two steps forward Shogun 2 gave this franchise are gone and instead CA have not only taken three steps back, but have stumbled from those three steps down a massive canyon, into a river, floated miles away, and washed up in the middle of nowhere. The final thought from me is to just wait on this one. Wait not only for a price drop, but I would say at least a year or so till CA has managed to make this into a complete and working game.  This was highly disappointing. "

												As an owner of every single Total War game up until recently, this is another game I wanted to like but never managed to.The game has advanced graphically, but not in other aspects. Some mechanics have changed, lacking real innovations and its hard to objectively say any single new mechanic is ""better"" then its previous iteration.Waiting times ingame are very long, loading is frequent and time-consuming. Even on a healthy quadcore with plenty of RAM, the game is very slow overall. An SSD would adress the loading times, but would do nothing for the slow decission-making process the AI seems to suffer from.I remember having similar issues with Rome: Total War. As my hardware improved over the years, this game became a lot more fluent.Perhaps in a few years the hardware will be available to make this game play with the fluency required for some level of immersion. Currently, this is too slow of a game for me, making me stick to older incarnations of the game.As a final point, given all the above, the price is far too high, and bringing out DLC while having a faulty base-product, is really low.

												To start - I've played every Total War since Shogun 1. I've been there day one and I was for Rome 2.Never again.There is some good - the province system introduced here its a step up. There's been some effort to fix the constant castle battles experienced in Shogun 2. I think that's all..?The rest is poor beyond belief. It's well documented everywhere in the community where the issues lay - far to many for me to rewrite here. Basically, you're here reading this review to help determine if you should buy this game.Short answer: NO. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.In fact, DO NOT BUY THE NEXT TOTAL WAR, unless you can fully demo it through whatever means. CA are not the studio they once were. Move along. This game is not worth your time, and its certainly not worth your money.			"

												Rome II had a bad release, and there is no denying that. It was buggy, content was cut and people didn't like how it was watered down. Howeever, now it is a fairly solid game that is DEFINATELY worth buying. I must say that the DLCs really make the game due to the fact that they add whole new flavours of units, cultures and technologies. I highly reccomend Caesar In Gaul, Hannibal At The Gates and the Greek States Culture Pack. Two super-awesome campaigns and a pack of 3 grand Hellenic States.If you're new to Total War, this game should be one of the best for you - that or Empire, another bad-starting Total War game. Rome II is a watered down version of Total War with an easy enough campaign and helpful advisoor. So, if you want to try out Total War for the first time; this game is for you. Command the legions of Rome, bring glory to the Republic!Thanks for reading, I give the game a 9/10 (w/ DLCs)			"

												Highly dissapointed. Buggy, glitchy, and crashes all the time. Turn based elements are not nearly as good as original rome. As for the battles, while they do look good, they always end up in a mosh pit brawl with stratigic and tactical decisions having little weight. The sadest thing is I could write paragraph after paragraph about what is wrong with this game and only have a few good things to say. I would not reccomend buying this game in its current state.  Edit: Yeah I have a lot of hours on record. I payed money for the game, so why would I not try to get some value out of it? Also, before the earlier patches end turn wait time lasted anywhere between 5-7 minutes on average. Lots of time was spent afk while the ai in game took its sweet time figuring out what exactly the worst possible decision it could make would be. So yeah im dissapointed, I had higher expectations for the product on release. Just because im dissapointed doesn't mean I am not gonna play a game I paid for. I stand by my reccomendation not buy this game at this time. In the future maybe, but not now.			"

												While Rome 2's now imfamous launch was attrocious, in its current state, the game is one of the best of the Total War series, and a shining example of a RTS. 1. Campaign: As always, Rome 2's campaign is a mix of turn based strategical management on the campaign map, and real time battles. For the most part, the AI does a good job managing their cities and armies. They don't make foolish mistakes, they defend their cities, and they attack any vulnerabilities left by the player. The UI is fine, but the lack of branching skill trees for generals can be annoying. The removal of family trees is another annoyance as you feel no attachment to your faction's characters. One place where Rome 2 shines, however, is its variety. There are dozens of faction to chose from, exact numbers based on DLC, all of which have interesting units, traits, and challenge levels. 2. Battles: Once again, we see the return of CA's battle AI. While it is not totally imcopetent, it consistently makes moronic mistakes. It will engage your pikemen head on, charge cavalry into the front of heavy infantry, and often attack with no real tact. However, the battles are still fun. Troops are easy to control and the battle UI is slick and customizable. Sure, when a cav unit inexplicably gets stuck on one lonely spearman it can♥♥♥♥♥♥you the hell off, but it never detracts from the overall expirience. 3. Multiplayer: Due to the variety of factions, Rome 2's multiplayer shines. Each faction is fun to play as and offers different stregnths and weaknesses. The added bonus of phasing out the battle AI is just the icing on the cake. However, technical issues still at times hinder the multiplayer, as you will often expirience severe lag and will occasionally be dropped from the game. 4. Graphics: As one of the best optimized PC games out there in its current state, Rome 2 has no issue delivering both stellar graphics (in-battles and on the campaign map) and smooth framerates. 5. DLC offerings: While the 'Wrath of Sparta' DLC fell short, and I still have yet to see the point of 'Blood and Gore,' Rome 2 still has some fine offerings for DLC. Some packs will add fun new factions, and others will offer new, full legnth historical camapign scenarios to be played out on customized maps. Without a doubt, 'Hannibal at the Gates' and Caesar in Gaul' stand out from the pack as superd additions to the game and engrosing windows into some of the most fascinating wars in antique history. Without a doubt, Rome 2 stands out as one of the most extensive and deep offerings in the RTS genre. It is a stellar game and in its current condition, and it is the best Total War game to date.			"

												While this game is definately playable (Though ideally when heavily modded), this is not the successor to the orginal Rome which Total War veterens wanted. It's more akin to Empire: Total War in its structure and yet more simplified. Its controversial released combined with the dumbed down approach to campaign management (the province system, general system and recruitment system) means that I would recommend any other Total War title (with the exception of possibly Empire) over this one. However the game has been patched to a level where a new player to the Total War franchise should at least consider it , however I would suggest you wait for a sale ($60 is not worth it for this game in my opinion).On top of this, the game seems to have shed some of the aesthetic features which made the first Rome so immersive. The lack of a family (while not required) means that you feel little to no immersion to your generals. They're just ""spawn general and give him a random name"", a tool to be used worn out and thrown away. Emperor edition has not changed this other than the presence of a few historical generals in the Imperator Augustus campaign and the limited use of them as political tools to gain gravitas.The same can be said for the politics system. While the concept is great, the exectuion leaves a player feeling likes its strapped on to the side, since there was no actual politcal positioning involved other than gathering Gravitas (The resource the game uses to increase politcal support percentage). [Edit] The Emperor edition patch has fixed this somewhat by adding a politics tab which you can use to determine your overall politcal standing in the same way the senate slider functioned in Rome 1 as well as guage the risk of a civil war. While there still isn't an organised map of senate positions (where you would be able to determine how high up your general is in the senate), it still places faction politics into a position where the player can see its benefits to the faction as well as its relevence to the game over all. In the original Rome, having a high ranking general in the senate (Consul or other high ranking positions) felt like it was of immense importance in terms of your standing with the senate. But you don't feel that connection to your generals. Its like theres supposed to be a connection to the senate but there is none to be seen apart from a rank which isn't really displayed.The armies and recruitment system is also a step backwards. The number of armies you can field at one time has been hardcoded with a limit based on your faction's Imperium level. This severely restricts your capability to spread your forces, as they limited to working only within an army. You cannot detach a small force to bolster a garrison and you find your self forced to move an entire army in order to swap a few units between them. The recruiment is linked to these armies aswell, so you cannot have an army on the move and produce reserves at the same time. This all has a severely negative effective effect on your ability to field armies in a dynamic manner. The arguement for this change has been to stop random small ai forces jsut roaming your lands for no reason, however in my experience, the only difference is that these warbands now have a general at their head and a raiding stance icon above them.Navies in this game are virtually useless due to uncanny strength of transport vessels. This is due to the fact that armies now automatically form a fleet of transports the moment they are ordered into the sea. Considering that a considerable portion of Roman conflict occurred around the Mediterean, this ability to magically make a transport navy appear out of thin air is a major oversight, as it renders navies pointless, as transports make equally effective fighting vessels. The ramming mechanic is messed up to the point that a light skirmisher bireme can sink a heavily loaded quintareme filled with marines in a few hits, rendering most expensive naval vessels useless.The province system restricts your ability to build your cities by hard coding them into two presets, provincial villages and provincial capitals. Capitals can build practically any structure and have pre-built walls which cannot be improved in any manner. Villages by contrast can only build certain building types and cannot be fortified in any manner. This greatly diminshes the ability to customise your empire as it existed in the original Rome. In other Total War games, every settlement was the same preset, it could be built up, fortified and garrisioned as needed. You could created industrial or military cities where you wanted and when you wanted. This is something you simply cannot do in Rome 2. On top of this, the limited number of build slots which has haunted the last few Total War games also makes a return, limiting what you can do with the city's space.[Edit] After 15 patches the vanilla balance of units atleast feels good enough to credit the combat in this game. Graphically stunning with only a few things to nit pick such as the inccorrect modeling of the hoplite phalanx.(use the argive grip please)[/edit]Rome 2 has finally become a playable experience similar in many aspects to Empire. For a new comer to the Total War series, this game would be worth a look though not at $60, however from the point of a veteren of the Total War series, this entry seems far more restrictive than previous titles and I cannot recommend this game over other Total War titles. Instead you should consider other Total War titles like Shogun 2 or the original Rome.[Edit] After 15 patches the base game has reached a state somewhat similar to Empire. It is now a decent game and newcomers to the Total War series should have no problems with this game. Regardless because of the cost of the game (60$) combined with the misgivings I've provided above, I still will not recommend this game when the other Total War titles provide a better experience at a better price at the cost of only graphical quality.To address the questions regarding my over 300 hours of game time, yes I've continued to play Rome 2 despite my concerns (And with several mods to boot) , however I feel that my concerns mentioned above are still legitimate.[/edit]			"

Posted: March 1, 2015
												For years I've spoken praises for the Total War franchise; and I can say that I have played hundreds of hours of Medieval 2 alone, not to mention similar investments in Empire, Shogun, and Rome II. But alas, the time has come where I can confidently state that I will not buy another Total War title, for Rome II was the last straw. The Franchise has been devolving since Medieval II. TL;DR at bottom.I was originally hooked back in 2007 on the first incarnation of Rome: Total War, and I was completely STRICKEN with it until I was exposed to the ""hotseat"" variant for Medieval II: Kingdoms. To this day, many of my friends and I continue these hotseat campaigns through the Retrofit mod, and it has become somewhat of a ritual for us. Since, we have hoped for a Total War experience that would capitalize on this feature and maximize the idea of a ""multiplayer campaign."" Since, we have been disappointed time and time again. Empire came promising a new multiplayer campaign that could be played on a massive scale that included three entirely separate theaters! Unfortunately, unlike the hotseat function, only two players could be present, and this alone was enough to shy my friends from buying it (not to mention a very limited selection of factions, and no ability to edit the descr_strat.txt to unlock all factions. . . but no matter! A simple mod fix, I thought!) but I had to try it. After having my all-time favorite campaign as Prussia, Empire had my praise. I persuaded a friend to play this ""Beta"" campaign. We did, and indeed we found it to be exceptional. We could even play as the enemy faction during battles to surmount the jagged AI which for YEARS was found to be lacking. Then, after 10 turns of greatness, the dreaded DESYNC. We trouble-shot for hours on end, digging through the internet to find answers- to no avail. Plenty of others had the same issue, but there were no answers? How curious. Even following ""a one-month delay for the release of Empire"" (Quote Wikipedia) they couldn't fashion a working version of the Multiplayer campaign? No matter, I thought; a failed project. Perhaps they will fix it in the near future. Unfortunately, despite taking my money and making a promise, to this day no fix has been issued. A ""Beta"" they called it- not worthy of a fix, despite having delayed the game launch. Buy Napoleon, they said. Quote the Creative Assembly; ""This beta programme was designed to offer a taste of the exciting multiplayer gameplay we were integrating into recent titles, such as Total War: Shogun 2 and Napoleon: Total War,""I ignored Napoleon entirely (although I was foolish enough to buy it) because of the puny map size and the pathetic faction diversity. These facts did not convince any of 'my party' to buy it, either. Despite a supposed ""working"" multiplayer campaign, where was the fun if you could not be Venice, Spain, or Greece? What about an African or Anatolian or, for that matter, any ""small"" faction whatsoever? I supposed it was because there was no audience for such things. I supposed that all of my desires were a niche and that only my group of friends were the audience. Then came Shogun offering another attempt at a multiplayer campaign; still no hotseat, mind you. Again I felt hope that it could be everything I had wished, and again I gave the Creative Assembly my money. PLENTY of ""small"" factions, but little unit diversity! You could play with Samurai, or with Samurai; Japan is a very small place, after all. By the way, where were the nearby Eastern Korean or Chinese shores? Once more, Shogun did not interest the majority of my friends (for there was no hotseat function! No separate theaters of war! How difficult could it be to BRING BACK an old, yet fantastic idea? It could even be modernized and perfected!) but one other decided to take the plunge with me. I wasn't impressed by the lack of unit diversity, but I found myself well at home with the culture and the new agent system. The campaign AI was still clanky and had an absurd handicap budget, but at least the multiplayer campaign didn't desync! Or, thus I thought, until ALAS! The dreaded DYSYNC AGAIN! We were halted until we discovered the problem; each turn that passed seemed to bring the .sav file to a bigger size (just like in Medieval) and these new ""packets"" of data would build upon each other until finally, after enough turns had passed, our (I and my campaign partner's) .sav files were no longer identical. The fix? exchange .sav files via E-mail and replace. Thus, the desync was defeated- but only temporarily. It would come back to haunt us every twenty or thirty turns and we would have to repeat the process. NBD, I played Shogun with this friend of mine for many hours. We completed several multiplayer campaigns on Legendary (cooperating and surviving) and tried a multitude of factions to mix up our geographical positioning. I wanted more so I reluctantly bought the Fall of the Samurai campaign for both myself and my friend, whom is an adamant boycotter of DLC- fearing that each sale to The Creative Assembly is another encouragement for MORE DLC. I foolishly purchased and gifted him a copy. We went on to play two more Legendary Coop campaigns both for and against the Imperials. Even with the presence of the Westerners, there STILL was no Korea and no China. I must admit over the years my desire to play SP campaigns has died down, and I've been looking for something to do with friends more than to do with myself. That said, I've played ample SP campaigns for each title, with the exception of Napoleon. I've played ample MP campaigns on Shogun and Rome II, and I've invested hours of effort into attempting the Empire Beta, both LAN and online. As I said earlier I still do Hotseat campaigns with my mates to this day, and we have one rotating right now. TL;DRROME II REVIEW:My rating: 5/10 MP campaign, 3/10 SP campaignPROS- Decent/good battle AI- Armies/Navies more personal/customizable- Decent campaign AI- IF YOU PAY FOR IT, reasonable unit diversity, CONS- OVER HALF AVAILABLE FACTIONS ARE DLC. TERRIBLE FACTION DIVERSITY.- MORE THAN HALF CAMPAIGNS ARE DLC. INCOMPLETE GAME THROUGH and THROUGH.- Non tradable tech tree. Uninteresting tech.- No multiple theaters- Army units are glued to their generals, unlike previously- Battle AI still somewhat reliant on stat handicaps- *nonfrequent* Desyncing multiplayer campaign, limited 2 playersCONCLUSIONSo, what's my point? Each game had its admirable traits, but the Creative Assembly continues to swing and miss. Gradually they have lost their innovation and they are trying to get away with selling more DLC. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE and honestly quite INSULTING to me that the GREEK STATES are DLC. (Or preorder contents in my case.)To be honest, I DO have fun playing Rome II, but I think it is an UNFINISHED product. There are tears in the graphics, many unit animations look mechanical, the load times are substantial, and half the game is DLC. IF none of the game were DLC, I would rate it 9/10 and call it a fantastic game, even if it was at the expense of my ideal Rome II. SO what would be my ideal Rome II? A blend of traits from each total war.Medieval II: Hotseat campaign / Unit and faction roster diversityEmpire: 3 theater world map / political, systems / gamechanging, tradable tech Shogun: Good agent system Rome II: Customizable armies / Dynamic naval application / Good AI / cultural differencesNO FACTIONS DLC. NO CAMPAIGNS DLC. DESYNC FREE MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGN. HOTSEAT WITH REALTIME PLAYABLE BATTLES.  I have NO reason to believe ATTILA will be anything but a graphical UI revamp, and thus NO REASON to believe the Creative Assembly deserves another dollar of mine. They are selling content that is in every respect UNFINISHED.			"

												Too many stripped features, too much DLC that should have been in the game in the first place, too many siege battles ( which don't work ) and defenatly too many hours played. I still remember my first general from my first campaing as the scipii in rome 1. He was a true hero of the republic who consolidated sicily and north africa. He died of old age, and later his son came to be a great leader himself whom I gave the city of carthage ( his fathers greatest conquest ) to manage in a time of war against the Numedian tribes... I dont remember one of my generals in rome 2, and I simply don't care about them... I wish I did but they are just lifeless.			"

												The AI is abysmal.  I can defend a city with only 300 against 4000 all because the AI decides it wants to use a gate all the way across the city instead of climbing the walls or storming the gate in front of it.  The current political intrigue seems useless and I try to ignore it now.  Lastly the auto resolve feature, common to all Total War games, is incorrect in almost all regards.  You can have such a superior army and it still have you in the red.  Fight it out and you only lose a fraction of your units, 10 out of 10 times this occurs.			"

												This was probably the biggest let down of the year.  A longtime total war fan, I had high hopes for Rome 2.  Unfortunately it was bogged down by poor gameplay and poor optimization.  Even three months later after launch, it's still plagued by poor AI.  The modding community has come together to fix what they can, but even they can only do so much.  It's really sad.  What's more troubling is how much the game developers promised and promoted, leaving content out and selling it as DLC.I cannot recommend this game at all.  It has its moments where it shines, but just as you're getting in to it, you are let down by performance issues, bugs, or bad AI.Edit:  Rome 2 Emperor Edtition reviewCA updated the game all year, releasing 15 different patches.  Finally, with the Emperor Edition, it's in a playable state instead of a beta.  It's not perfect; there are still some optimization issues and even if you have a high end PC you are going to experience Framerate issues as well as stuttering in certain occasions- like during sieges when units are climing up and down walls/fighting on walls.  The EE update improved a lot of things, including campaign AI and battle AI, and a slight visual update.  It's worth playing now, but I still wouldn't pay 60 bucks for it.  At this point I would wait for it to go on sale, particularly since TW: Attila is coming out in february.  I give props to CA for continuing to support their game and constantly updating, but it was too little too late in my opinion.  I spent more hours testing and fine tuning than playing throughout the year.   There were a lot of immersion breaking issues, and there still are a few even now.  Nothing kills your fun like seeing units stutter around on the walls, and while CA is still working to fix this, they release silly nonsense like the Women of Mars DLC and the Halloween update to keep us distracted until they can figure out how to fix it.

												I just spent some time with the Emperor's Edition for this free weekend, and came away fairly unimpressed with Rome 2. I was a huge fan of Rome 1, and I feel this game is inferior to it in almost every way.1. Graphics: Rome 2 looks very good at high settings. The units on the battle map are fairly detailed, the terrain looks decent and the effects are nice. The campaign map also looks gorgeous.2. The AI does a fairly good job on the battle maps. They attack in unison, send in their infantry to charge while their light/missile infantry support from behind, they actively send their cavalry around your main force and try to flank you. Overall, well done.That's about all the good I have to say about Rome 2 though.3. The UI during battles. It is completely useless. The game needs a simple, organized UI that lets you easily distinguish between units. The pictures on the unit cards are such that it makes it farily difficult to tell apart different units when clicking on their cards. Also, the current status(es) of the unit flash at the centre of each card in 1-2 second intervals. This means I need to wait up to 5-6 seconds just looking at a specific unit's card to see if they are under enemy missile fire, routing, or whatever. This is competely useless and unacceptable when previous TW games dealt with this much more efficiently.Also, the lack of walls and siege equipment. WTF happenned there? One of the most fun battles you could have in Rome 1 was assaulting a huge city with a full army of light/heavy infantry, archers, cavalry, and most importantly, trebuchets. The onagers available in Rome 2 are fairly weak and just not as satisfying to use to wreak havoc in an enemy's city. Another big issue is the campaign map province system, which makes it so that only the provincial capitals have large walls. All other settlements are minor, with to walls defending them. This makes it very easy to steamroll the majority of enemy settlements you encounter, and makes the overall campaign much too easy.Speaking of the campaign map.... although it does look gorgeous now, much of its openness from previous TW games is gone. Italy especially feels just like a highway connecting 1 settlement to another. This is a problem because the game forces you on a linear path between settlements, rather than letting you do whatever you want. Diplomacy is still an issue. The AI will propose stupid deals on a regular basis. For example, I would propose a mutually beneficial trade agreement and have it rejected. 5 turns later, I get an offer from that faction for a trade agreement, but they also want 4000 gold. Or I will almost destroy an enemy, and when they have 1 city left they request peace, but also want me to pay 10 000 gold to them for that peace... when I have a full army beside their last city and they have 5 units defending it.The AI has some issues on the campaign map as well. There have been numerous times on the campaign map when I am holding a city wih a garrison of 20 units, and I am attacked by armies of 4-8 units, which are of course massacred by my forces. Thankfully, the AI works well on the battle maps.Naval battles are an exercise in frustration and poorly implemented. You have little incentive to build actual navies, since when you order an army on water, they magically transform into transports. This is very frustrating when you have several enemy ports blockaded, only for them to send a random small force to attack one of your settlement behind the front lines... ♥♥♥♥ing seriously? Those transports will usually be a match for actual navy ships... making navies completely useless in the game.Unit collision was a big problem in Empire/Napoleon, although I did not find it to be a big issue in Rome 2, despite it using the same engine. The formations are nowhere near as clear/fluid as in Rome 1, but unit-on-unit combat works fairly well. A unit of 60 cavalry charging into a unit of 80-120 light/missile infantry will make short work of them in a few seconds. However, combat between heavy infantry units is a bit of an issue. The units tend to lose formation and congregate into a blob, which kills the immersion and makes it frustrating to try to command units.Lastly, the price. The game is a complete rip-off for $66.50 CAD, especially given the almost $100 of DLCs. The greek states should have been included in the base game, as should have blood/gore. Charging additional money for blood and gore is completely ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (yes, it was for the rating. Well, ♥♥♥♥ your rating). Some DLCs are cool and worth it on their own, but it feels like there was basic content cut from the game just to be sold as DLC, which is unacceptable.I held off buying Rome 2 for a long time, and after spending a weekend playing it, I refuse to pay CA for this game. Yes, it is quite a fun game, but it could have been so much more, and as a sequel, it ultimately just makes me want to go back and play Rome 1. Well.... maybe I will buy it, but once it gets to under $15 CAD with all the DLCs. Otherwise, the game is simply not worth it, even at $16.50 + $20 for DLCs.Edit: I purchased Rome: Total War Gold Edition and started a campaign in the original and in the Barbarian Invasion expansion. Comparing vanilla to vanilla, Rome 1 feels a lot more polished/better done and a lot more immersive. Very happy with the RTW Gold purchase.			"

												Well is this what CA wanted to achieve by creating a game that's based on rock,paper and scissors tactics. More and more players wait to see what nation your gonna take and if they don't like it they leave the lobby. It's a case of if you bring Sparta or Mecadon,i'll bring a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of slingers as you'll spam spear or phalax. You change from these 2 nations too a decent melee setup to counteract what i pick,i'll bring all archer units and kite or even better 'll just bring the Guals with all noble swordsman & 4 noble cav and just charge as it's seems to be down to who hits the special ability button first when in battle. The game is so predictable it's boring there's very little SKILL or STRATEGY to the game and that's very sad as they admitted there mistake in previous title with the retainer system but this sort of game play is even worse. Now for the battle itself ""WHAT A JOKE""it takes you 5 mins to march your troops then you charge them in and its over,even tired it on large armies where you have 40 units and the time scale remains the same. All charge in and hit those special abilties and hope for the best. Now games like napoleon or even shogun it's down to the units and your micro management skills as a player. You's may not agree with what i've said so go try these 3 simple setups and see what skills you really need to win. As for the leaderboard lol the last patch messed this up....it means nothing as a player who has 5 battles can play against a player who has over 200 and be beaten very easy. If a 2 star player in nappy played against a 7 star player,he would be destroyed. What more can i say i've dedecatid over 60 hrs to this game in the last week and im having to force myself to love it.................................................. Plus im sick of crashing to desktop after the last patch when i zoom into the battle or desyncing when in multiplayer. I for one would of paid £30 for new maps and units for napoleon not this crap !!! CA if you read this just fix your game and not with 20-30mb patchs each week for the next year or 2. BETA BATE BETA BETA BETA BETA BETA BETA BETA......CA ARE LIARS & THIEVESNothing has changed since i first wrote this review back in sept 2013...i've decided to repost it has the original post disappeared. I'm still very very disappointed with  C&A as i've been a loyal dedicated fan since medi-evil to the present day.The link below is the first announcement of the game a week after it's launched priory to the announcment above.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/THENIGHTCRAWLERSOFTOTALWAR#announcements/detail/1621582846793349768 "

												Rome II. The launch was a blind-date with broken gameplay and buggy traversty, riddled with so many errors and balancing issue that it's infamy will never live down. Now? Somewhat below average, I'm sorry to say.The Good: I'll be brief. The good things about the game is the things you would expect from a Total War game - the campaign map is great and works the strategy overview of your Empire. You decide where armies go, what you build in what settlements, how you manage your economy, diplomacy, and so on. Some things are streamlined and dumbed down, but there is enough flavor to make it a game about the antiquity it's trying to represent. I like the new cultural system and the effect it has, it's a nice new touch and makes more sense than once again having to garrison the castle you just took because somehow, the peasants give a damn about what authoritarian Japanese feudal lord squeeze them for more rice sacks, or not. Tactical battles work as you may expect and it's still not terribly hard to either turn a losing battle around through simple skills, or to make it at costly to the enemy as possible.Beyond this, the modding scene HAS to be mentioned. Radious Mod is the most known and widely used because it's one of the most complete, balanced and able one out there, adding considerably more units to various factions and helping to balance things out more, as well as graphical improvements etc. Other mods enhance the graphics more if you wish, improve blood-effects, add units to specific factions that are lacking, and so on. (Honestly Messalia for instance can not train any archer type troops on their own. This is a BIG.DEAL. There are mods that help deal with this.) It's weird to have to mention the mod-scene as a good about the game itself, but here it is, mods greatly help you enjoy this game more, depending on what mods you get.The bad:I wish I could be brief but there is SO.MUCH. here that's a major concern for me and the reasons, obviously, I can't recommend this game. Only buy this if you can live with or don't care much about the issues at hand here.First of all, the DLC whoring is obvious and widely documented. Just look at the list on Steam and you will see what I mean. Luckily the only 'essential' DLC to me is the blood-pack, because reasons, and mods can seriously help you with this game in this area as well as so many others, so you may find yourself not needing the official DLC to get what you want out of this. This still don't justify or reedem the audacity it is to hide a sizable portion of the factions out there behind pay-walls, just as one example.Secondly, the difficulty settings are completely bi-polar and horrible.Easy difficulty is a massive joke. Everything is simple and way to easy. Your economy will never struggle unless you are completely incompetent, your armies will hardly ever lose, unless again you have personal problems, your agents are easy to level up and meet with success almost all the time. It's boring, you win all the time, there is no challenge at all.Normal difficulty is barely any better. Depending on what faction you play, you may struggle a little in the beeginning period, but once you have a couple provinces under your firm control, you start to snowball out of control and by the time you have 5+ the game is terribly boring. Agent actions are still easy to pull off and the economy is solid. You will be rolling in money soon enough and your biggest problem is, everyone around you turn into beggars asking you for hand-outs. Everyone.Hard difficulty is where the suffering begins. The game don't seem to understand how to increase difficulty a bit at a time, and there is a MASSIVE leap between normal - to easy - and hard - that is frustating as hell.On hard difficulty, any agent success-chance lower than 80% is an automatic fail 4 out of 5 times. Above that it's basically 50/50 chance. Note the chances and the times you fail vs succeed. You will not be pleased. This turns agent actions into a gold-sink that frustrates you far more than it should.The economy is hard to handle and you will need to know what you are doing and how to manage your infrastructure, how to make friends and keep them - and this too is harder than ever, with the AI sometimes blatantly refusing to trade with you, even if they love you, and you have been their finest and most loyal friend since forever. This requires constant maintenence and you will only start getting a balanced and able economy around 4+ provinces.Your armies had better be led by veteran and able generals and you will need to work together with muliple good stacks of troops, because if you slip up the AI can and will obliterate you suddenly and without warning, because......the AI cheats like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. When you understand how the economy works, you understand exactly how your enemy has infinite money. They always have the money to pay for agent actions, and recruit armies, and improve settlements and so on. It does NOT matter how hard you crush them and limit their land. The enemy can be down to one minor settlement with only one economy building that can't cover all the armies they have, and only one military building that can't produce all the different types of troops they constantly get. The AI will always have armies, leave them to their devices and they will come for you, with powerful and noumerous troops.Because the AI has infinite money their agents are always doing things, so they level up quick. Ergo, you will soon be harassed by super-agents who can and will scuttle all your plans and cripple and dismantle your armies. In contrast, you have to pay for your agent with money you don't always have to spare, and the odds of failure and thus wasting that money are very, very high. Once you lose a few high-end generals the green-horn replacments are not nearly as good at resisting agent actions as the old ones, leading to your armies being crippled a lot easier than before, so even if you can replace your losses, their effectiveness is being limited the longer the conflict goes on.Add to this some really absurd ideas about how sieges go - cities for instance can have 3 different control points, where it's a king of the hill style race to control the majority. Once you hold 2, the timer ticks down to victory. You can lose a whole army without a single man dying because your carefully crafted kill-zone only covers one flag and the enemy don't have to kill a single man to wipe out the whole army. Totally logical and a sound game-mechanic, I'm sure.On top of the imbalances the AI is very eager to make alliances and deals with other factions, much more than what they did on easier difficulties, so you can soon find yourself with a war on multiple fronts and seriously outnumbered by your new enemies. Even your long-standing allies can become your enemies in this manner as the AI is much better at teaming up against you, no matter what they have to do. Be on-the-ball with your diplomacy at all times or pay the price really soon.All this said, hard difficulty does provide a big challenge, but it does so not by being harder in an organic way, where the AI has the same limitations and rules as you, but they do it by blatantly cheating and enjoying perks you will never have. To some this is just a bigger challenge, to others it's a massively frustrating experience that will leave you shouting curses at your monitor.The short and simple is, ROME II is a total war game in all ways you expect, and that may be all you want. However it also suffers from poor business decisions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI balancing that may frustrate you or bore you, and a strategic system you may find to be intuitive and decently set up, or needlessly dumbed down, all things considered. Should you find yourself not caring or handling these factors, it's a decent game and worth your time and money. If not, you may want to see if Total War: Warhammer is better off. "

Posted: October 13, 2014
												With the release of Emperor Edition, Total War: ROME II has finally launched the game they meant to make back in 2013, a full year ago.  What this means is ROME II no longer has fatal bugs, crashes, humorously rendered faces, poorly designed building trees, poorly designed tech trees, or painful wait times between turns.  The bugs are gone, the polish is there, it is safe to say this is a completed game.This might be too long for people, so I'll put my final thoughts here and then if you wish you can read the justification for them below:Rome 2 is more of a management game than a strategy game.  There are very few strategic descisions to be made in this game after 30 turns into a campaign.  You simply build buildings, train troops, give movement orders, and upgrade generals because if you don't the game gives you a pop up telling you what you forgot to do.  There's a shameful lack of interesting battles to be fought, and it hardly matters what buildings you choose to upgrade or build, and it certainly doesn't matter what general traits you choose.  So you click the buttons to get the pop ups to go away, and eventually you start wondering why you started the game up in the first place, because there's no game to be had here.I'll start with the Campaign.The map is pretty, but a pain to navigate when your empire is large, as the camera does not zoom out enough on the main screen, forcing you to go into 'strategic mode' and double click and have the game zip the camera over there.  Despite there being several views of the map: the normal camera, the strategic map, and the diplomatic map (the latter of the two having options to change different overlays) there is still no good way to get a picture of what is going on in your empire.  The Strategic map will show you the position of your armies and enemy armies, but it doesn't tell you how big the armies are, or how much movement they have left.  So when you see an enemy flag in your territory, you still have to zoom your camera over there to see if its a full army or one of the small, threatless stacks the AI likes to create.On the campaign you will develope your cities and move your armies.  The UI for these functions is minimalistic with lots of tool tips that pop up.  This allows you to get a good look at the graphics, and a poor look at what the buildings do and what affects are on your armies and generals.  To compare two different buildings you have to hover over one, wait for the tool tip, memorize the stats then hover over another, wait for the tool tip and mentaly compare the stats of the first option.  There is no side by side view, or a list of effects or anything.  This leaves you mousing back and forth frequently trying to pick which building you want.  The buildings themselves often offer small percentage bonuses to one type of income (cultural for example) and cost food.  Thus one must balance their food and food-demanding buildings appropriately.  This is an ok mechanic.  It's not great, but it's something to break up the monotony or the linear upgrades of other Total War titles.  However once you have a large empire, it is very easy to lose interest in min-maxing your buildings, because you end up conquering so many cities so quickly that you always have food and you always have money, so balancing the economy and food tends to go away at a certain size.  The technology tree feels rather pointless and linear.  It provides either a flat bonus to troops (like upkeep, movement speed, or combat effectiveness) and access to buildings which allow higher teir troops to be trained.  This mechanic is hollow.  It primarily serves to gateway what troops are available at what times of the game, because the flat bonuses are small and inconsequential.  Some of the religious buildings will increase your research rate by a small amount, but the technology tree still fees shallow and arbitrary.  In Rome 1 units were gated by buildings, and occasionally (in the case of Roman legionaries) the date.  This functioned better, and was more transparent, which allowed for better planning.I like the feature of generals and armies leveling up, but they get too many bonuses and they seem so small and unnoticeable.  This leaves me clicking one at random and not really caring, similar to buildings.Other aspects of the campaign map are simmilar enough to the other Total Wars that I can't expect anything more or less from them. On to the battles.Battles are pretty.  There's plenty of nice effects that let you see your army of antiquity on the battlefield in high fidelity.  However, due to the nature of Total War AI (which is SLIGHTLY improved in Rome 2) the battles are boring.  As long as you line your men up to face the enemy properly and prevent any sad attempts the AI makes at flanking you, you'll probably win.  This is a problem because the battles are supposed to be the best part.  That's where they spent all the money, right?  Right?The unit variety is nice, and I could complain about the way pikemen don't really feel like pikemen, and that the difference between heavy cav and light cav is very minimal, but there's no point, because it takes a special kind of idiot to lose to a Total War AI.  I haven't played much multiplayer, I presume the battles are decently interesting when they're both controlled by a human.Over-all.There's a mysterious and unfortunate paradox to the Total War series.  If you are playing correctly on the strategy map, you would make sure you have the highest chance to win a battle as you possibly could.  This means that most of the battles you fight you will have overwhelming odds and you can auto resolve them with 95% of your army remaining.  Fighting it out would be boring, and you probably wouldn't save that many casualties commanding yourself so what's the point?  This means that there's a small 20-30 turn window at the start of a game where you actually fight the battles because you only have one or two armies and you need to put them in 'risky' situations.  And since in a fair fight you will always defeat the AI you win those risky situations.  But once you're large enough you tend not to fight battles, and just auto resolve as you blob over the entire map.  Which leads me to the short sampler from the top of the page.			"

												The worst game in the Total War series. Gimmicky, butchered in DLC, uberpatched to death, lacking any optimisation at all and with an angering stupid AI, this game truly is the pinnacle of greediness. As a diehard fan of history, enthusiast of strategy games and longstanding follower of Total War, I can't help but feel frustrated with a game that had so much potential, and raised so much hype. Total War: ROME II is the very definition of disappointing. It doesn't only invert the title (from Rome: Total War), but the series overall.As Empire proved to be a hard (buggy) step, Rome II is just pure misdirection. Maybe the first game (the first Rome) wasn't historically accurate at all, or had any nice animations, but it was really enjoyable. I would NOT recommend this game to ANYONE, not even to fans, and especially not to newcomers. It is a complete catastrophe.			"

												I am not satisfied with the direction the developer took.- City building/province management is innovative, but not enjoyable, unnecessarily complicated and unclear due to bad statistics screens. Instead of being able to view the core pieces of information on the campaign map, I have to painstakingly click myself through too many menues to unveal the correct information.- The Politics system is annoying, boring and therefore dispensable. It has no purpose. It is not connected to other important game mechanics.- One of the most annoying things are revolts. If you expand too fast, 60% of your battles are fighting revolts of your own citizens, instead of fighting other interesting cultures.- The armies do not need any supplies other than goldAltogether I prefer Empire Total War or the old Rome Total War much more than Rome 2. It feels like there were five different departments who had to create one part of the game (i. e. politics, city management, battles) and it got assembled afterwards. The result is a game that does not fit together in its parts. Some game mechanics are unbearingly and overproportionally time consuming compared to their importance as a main fun generator. Some mechanics are not legitimately connected to others, or do not have a connection at all.1/10 I am done with fighting revolts, Alexandria shall stay Egyptian			"

												IF YOU WANT PEACE, PREPARE FOR WAR!!!!!! I am a fan of the TW series at heart. For my credentials as a critic, I currently have over 100 hours in game, have beaten a campaign, and im pretty good at it.. Rome 2 feels entirely dumbed down when compared to the previous title, Shogun 2.The terrible campaign&battle AI, the lack of unit customization, the lack of general customization, banners, etc and so on.. I would have been more than happy to volunteer my time and test this game for free so that the game could be passable on release, but CA and SEGA didn't feel like quality took a priority to advertising. Lastly, the moderating on their online forums are terrible. They cherrypick what threads do or do not stay, they keep horrendous and troll praisers yet they delete and ban valid criticisms.The sporadic moments of greatness, when you’re storming enemy walls or have finally brokered a peace agreement, are swallowed by tedium. With patience, your inner imperialist is satisfied as you skillfully cultivate a sprawling empire. It’s too bad you have to put up with so much to get there. but If you’re a hardcore strategy fan specially TW it’s definitely worth a look, and if you’re new to the genre and have the patience to learn, it’s not a bad place to start, Rome II is a testament to all that is great about PC gaming and should be a must buy for all its followers.Maybe its not better than first one but definitely its worth to play.. ofcourse worth to play cuz its one of the TW series game.. many people said ROME wasn't  built in a  day so be patience and give another chance to CA to build it again with it new updates. at last i should say Total War: Rome 2 is pure enjoyment. The strengths of the first installments are still there, mostly in the form of the diversity between different factions and armies. The limited amount of armies, freedom in missions and handy execution of 'auto resolve' only add on to this.It might not look as great as the images might have you suspect, but it's still an easy recommendation. so prepare yourself for a long and endless road cuz all roads lead to ROME.....Worth to buy...                       8/10			"

												Major letdown to me. When I first watched the trailers, the interviews, the ideas and visuals were amazing. None lived up to that. The core game is the poorest it has ever been in a total war game. I never feel like I'm achieving anything in this game. I play and play hoping something amazing will happen but everything falls short.Every culture is not diverse, it does not feel that way at all. Instead, it feels all the same. From rome to egypt, i don't get a sence of diversity I get a sence of, what... again?The lack of control over how cities expand and grow and even the poor way you upgrade cities. That has led to a feeling of I don't care about my cities. My terroritory that I control never feels like mine. It feels borrowed permanantly. It's like a asked the greeks if I could come over and party with their women. Instead of partying I stole their women and ran off. Only if taking something in this game was as fun as steal women from greeks.Atleast in that scenerio you would get a thrill. From the redundant building patterns that are identical in every city. The lack of depth in strategy is poor. I never feel the need to choose what I need to build or upgrade for my general or even for my army traditions. There is never a concern that something will be lost. Never a concern that I am clinging onto the game. It doesnt' give me a feeling of panic or terror, not even joy, but most of all it doesn't make me feel like an emperor or that I'm running a country, it makes me feel like I'm setting at a computer. This game takes me nowhere.			"

												The worst total war game ever made. It was released months ago and still feels buggy and unfinished. Most of the core strategic elements have been dumbed down or stripped out. Creative Assembly has gone off their rocker; every other game in the series, even with problems, was good at the core... but this one is rotten. The DLC is overpriced and worthless also. New factions play almost the same way.			"

												I've long been a fan of the Total War series, and Roman history in general; in fact, the original Rome: Total War ranks as one of my favorite games of all time, and I logged in countless hours in grueling grand campaigns, doubly so with the added depth and fun of some great mods, like Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥.It's a terrible shame, then, that Rome 2 is such a disappointment, in almost every way imaginable. To start, while previous iterations of the game occasionally grew stale without mods, the vanilla games were still engrossing enough to be worth playing on their own; sadly, this is no longer the case here, and in fact vanilla seems broken, requiring mods to even function properly. Second, while the game is indisputably gorgeous, it seems like something of an unwieldy beast, bringing my computer to a crawl even on the campaign map, and lasting an eternity between turns. But perhaps one aspect I found deeply underwhelming was the household management: the new system is pared down even from Shogun 2's rather barebones set-up, and it's a far cry from the original Rome or Medieval 2. Admittedly, this has never been the core part of the game, but it was a seemingly small aspect that could do wonders for immersion and replayability, not to mention the inherent fun in roleplaying. But in an age of Crusader Kings 2, this even more rudimentary roleplaying aspect is just striking, and just sapped what little interest I could muster in the game. In fact, this is perhaps the first time I really regret purchasing a game on Steam. Hopefully, the game will improve, but it's disappointing that in this day and age we should have to settle for ""eventually playable"" even when paying upwards of $60 for AAA games, when other companies are putting out quality products out of the gate for 2/3 the price. At this point, I would not recommend the game at all, maybe not even on sale.			"

Posted: June 2, 2016
												I reccomend this game only if you were a fan of the original Rome: Total War and would like to play a more graphically-improved sequel. However, be warned that the base game is bland for the most part. I would highly reccomend using mods, because you will find that this game has a few missing features from its predecessor, Rome I.Also, before you buy, you might want to consider a few problems on this game:1) Compared to Rome I, Rome II's campaign is watered down and has some of the dumbest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you could ever imagine. Remember when I said the game feels bland without mods? Here's why: -There is a limit to how many armies a faction can have on this game. If you want to increase that limit, you have to conquer a specific number of regions. This really is the dumbest BS you can add to a game like this. The devs lack brain cells and fail to realise that this limit they added is useless and just makes the game dumbed down. You should be able to build as many armies as you want in regards to the state of your economy, just like the older titles. Adding an army limit to all the factions on this game means that you might be fighting less battles than you did in Rome I. The developers were too stupid to realize that if we wanted to fight less battles, we could have just used the auto resolve button just like the previous titles. There's no strategy involved with a limit like this...-On the campaign map, you can't split armies into smaller groups like you could in the previous titles. This is another incredibly stupid feature that makes the campaign overly simplified. For example, let's say an enemy army containing only 3 units shows up in your territory, and the nearest army you have to counter them contains 20 units. Since this army is so puny and would be destroyed in no time with, say, three of your higher quality units, you'd think it would make more sense to just send in 3 units to counter that army. Well, in this game, you can't do that anymore. You have to move your ENTIRE ARMY if you want to get rid of them, which is a complete waste of time because you could be using the rest of your units for more useful purposes. You simply can't split armies to cover more territory, scout unknown parts of the campaign map, or provide support to another army. You're just commanding completely immobile armies that have had their strategic potential neutered by this ♥♥♥♥ing stupid mechanic.-Just like armies on the campaign are unable to split up, they are also unable to merge with other armies. This means that if an enemy army containing 20 units, for example, is in your territory, and you have 2 armies that each contain 10 units, you can't merge them into one strong army of 20 units to take on the enemy army. Instead, you'll have to go through the BS of having your two separate armies stuck on two different sections of the battle map, wasting precious time trying to get them where you need them. Once again, the strategic value of this game has been further watered down...-It is mandatory for every single army to have a general. Now, I don't mind having generals in all of my armies, but it'd be nice if you could have some of them under the command of captains and turn them into generals after a few battles like in Rome I and Medieval II. -You no longer have the choice to build walls in your settlements. Only a certain number of cities will have walls by default. Once again, the strategic value of this game has been watered down a by the diminished brain cells of the developers.2) The soundtrack of the base game is your bland, run of the mill dramatic tryhard collection of the works of a composer desperately trying to become the new John Williams. The developers should have kept the composer from Rome I. Thankfully, there is a mod for this game that allows you to use the soundtrack from Rome I itself.3) Voice acting on this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ In Rome I, different factions from different parts of the campaign map actually had their own accents, giving them a unique identity. Instead, there are only two accents on this game. Basically, 'civilized' factions like the Romans and Athenians have the same old, plain and boring British accent. 'Barbarian' factions like the Britons and Suebi just sound like a bunch idiots. 4) The Greek City States are a mandatory DLC, so you can forget playing as Sparta or Athens without paying extra money. CA, like your average AAA developer these days, just loves to manipulate its fanbase by locking content on a game and calling it ""extra"" content. 5) In battles, projectiles fired from archers and slingers don't look deadly and fast at all. The devs came up with the stupid idea of putting tracers on every single projectile thrown. None of them look dangerous at all, and when you zoom in on the unit of soldiers being attacked by arrows or rocks, the sound effects don't sound like any of these projectiles were able to hit anything with a great amount of force. The only good things about this game are this:1) Better graphics.2) There are mods.Use as many mods as you can if you're still reading this review.			"

												While many enjoy the Total War games because of their unique blend of real-time strategy combat and standard-setting visuals or their incredibly high production values, what makes them truly fantastic is that one can easily invest hundreds of hours into just one entry of the series and likely never grow tired of its addicting mix of fighting and management. I have spend many hours on Rome II and yet I still keep coming back for more. Whether it be to try a new faction, a different early game strategy, change up my research priorities, focus more on naval prowess rather than raw manpower, empower trade over combat as a continent-spanning empire or mix up my tactics in the battles themselves. The Total War games are packed with content, like the unique scenario battles that represent a key conflict in history, narrative campaigns and tutorial campaigns that each require a few hours or more of your time at the very least while presenting a mostly distinct experience, many entirely separate factions each with their own various traits at both a regional and cultural level, and the grand campaigns.Each of these is a massive undertaking and has almost endless permutations for the path to total victory, dependent on any number of the factors mentioned above. You can even use the skirmish battle system to try out all different tactics and unit combinations from any of the numerous factions present in the game against a battle AI that you can freely adapt to your tastes in terms of difficulty. Lastly, Rome II offers an expansive suite of multiplayer options to back up its gargantuan single-player offerings, allowing you to play challenging battles against your friends or compete for global domination through the usual turn-based campaign system, even if the multiplayer isn't as functional as I would like! I have put many hours in every single Total War game and each new entry is both fresh enough and packed with quality to easily justify that kind of investment time and again - truly, this is a franchise that knows how to eat up the small hours of the day. If ever you needed a game to kill time in while trying out multiple different approaches to victory, allowing you to succeed either through making friends or destroying enemies in equal measure, then Rome II has been tailor made to match your desires.

												I really really wanted to like this game, had it since release, have checked it out every now and then. But it's simply garbage.... Been streamlined to hell to cater to a larger audiance, which destroyed the essence on which the title thrived in it's previous games. Next too that, the game only becomes decent IF next to having spent 60 bucks on basically a broken game on release, you pay an other 100 bucks to gain all DLC. I somewhat like the improvements on the campaign map, but hate it at the same time. You can't even build wooden walls for your smaller settlements. On the other hand, your forced to specialize towns, which gives them all their own stratigic value, something that was missing in previous Total War games. AI is horrible, and I mean a step backwards from Shogun's AI, as in, will walk into 3 units of phalanx head on never attempt to flank bad.... O did I mention Phalanxes where broke on release and could be slaughtered by peasants ? Yes heavily armored troops, some of the heaviest in the world and amongst the most discplined, could be slaughtered by peasants.... Battles feel rushed and because units break like crazy, grand tactics are out of the window, it's all about bring heavier units then your enemy.In fact, it's become more of a economy simulator (and before they patched the building tree's a horrible on at that). And after 2 years, all they done is stream line the game some more and add back functions we had in every total war game, like fire at will and hold ground (yes you are reading this right, that was NOT added in release). I've only gotten around to write my review now because i'm so utterly sickend by the game for which I was waiting forever. If they updated the orginal Romes graphics and released that for 60 bucks I would have been more satisfied. Even the basic path finding on the campaign map is broke. If you move a army that would be faster embarking into ships and then sailing over and landing, prepare for the path finding to screw up and take your army 4 additional turns over land. And then there is unit collision, which wasn't there in Release, which basically lead to major mosh pits, when battle where at the time won by formations and discpline. It was just a laugh. Now they have fixed it by forcing units to stay in formation and everything, but it's obvious it's not something the actual engine itself does. So basically the game is running on a engine that is not suited for the game at all. Yet ever since Empire they stubornly hold onto this engine, and with Shogun they got away with it because they polished it so well you didn't notice it. But F me Creative, get the hint already! Either update your engine to support it or pick a better suited engine! We want our realistic like combat, Total War is picked because of that, if we want Arcade combat, we have a 100 games that do a better job then Total War will, stop trying to cater to people who shouldn't be touching this game to begin with, all you do is drive away the people who do love these types of games. 3/10 I do not recommand you buy this unless it's on a sale and you have to pay less then 10 bucks. It's not worth more and you better get some free DLC's with it. Also, don't try and criticize them on their own official forums, all honest criticism is basically disregarded and removed within a heartbeat.			"

												Total War is a franchise near and dear to my heart.  So when word came round about Rome II, I leapt onto the hype-wagon and held on.  Every preview I pored over, and my interest in the classical time period renewed in full.  Preordered the game and pre-loaded it as soon as I could.Then the release happened.  And my love met a grisly demise.It should be common knowledge by now, if you've read any of the other reviews, what happened on launch day.  Players with Godzilla-grade monster rigs like Attila16 noticed troubles running the game on Day 1.  Rome II was unplayable.  It was horrendous.I contend it is absolutely unforgiveable what Creative Assembly did here.  We were promised even better graphics than the ""pre-alpha"" models we saw the summer before; launch visuals were nowhere nearly close to that.  I don't know how they took the solid engine from Shogun 2 and botched it beyond belief a game later.  Within a month after release, DLC was announced.  DLC!!  And the game was still struggling with ruinous bugs and whatnot!  And the faction packs?  Yeah, those were in the game already; CA just turns them ""on"" for the player once you've paid for them.  And after that?  Boom: new campaign.  Courtesy of another $15 at the time, of course.I essentially stopped playing by the end of 2013.  I write this review as a plea and a warning.  A plea, because I do not want you to buy this game, like I naively did.  Creative Assembly lied to us.  The result of their ""work"" is this unfathomable drivel.  I don't care how much better it's gotten over the months; it should've run this smoothly back in September 2013.  It was utterly dishonest to release such a travesty as was done here.  The warning, to never preorder a game again.  I don't care how much you love a franchise; I've been burned too many times to trust any developer.  Wait for some time after the release.  Read/watch a review or four.  Determine for yourself how much the game will be worth to you.  Don't preorder for a better deal; wait and purchase a better game.TL;DR: Please don't buy this game.  It will only encourage developers and publishers like these to release half-finished garbage and reap the positive feedback months later as they patch it after the damage is already done.			"

												Is Rome II good? Yes, the land battles are fun, there is immense variety when it comes to factions, with diversity in units, the Grand Campaign is highly addictive, and replayability potential is massive, as each culture is different. The graphics are very  good for a 2013 game, especially of this scale, and we can have massive battles with hundreds of soldiers on each side. But it has a number of serious flaws that need to be addressed. Firstly, the performance. While the game is stable and runs decently, it does experience framerate drops during the turns of the other factions, and while zooming in to ground view during battles. Those drops are not horrendous, but my PC is a good one, and this game is old. I have a 960, and it is to be expected that a 2013 game would perform well on this hardware, which it does, but there are a few times when it should do much better. Secondly, the naval battles are just boring. Uninteresting units(merely the army units on a ship), uninteresting ships, and every faction has virtually the same ships. Thirdly, diplomatic featuress are a bit lacking. No trading of provinces, your client states dont feel like client states but just ordinary allies. They are too independent. Logically, they should behave like puppet states but they dont. We should be able to push them around, intimidate them, as after all, they are our client states, and insubordination would not be tolerated by a faction that is so powerful. Lastly, SEGA's dlc practices. Nations like Athens, Sparta are not playable in the base game's Grand Campaign. Not even a single Iberian faction is playable in the base game. These factions cannot be unlocked, they need to be bought via dlcs.  An entire culture, the Iberians, are not playable in the base game. At least Macedon, Seluccid etc are there as playable Hellenistic factions, but there should have been at least one Iberian faction in the base game.Overall, I recommend this game, because it is extremely fun. But these flaws are not minor and should not be ignored.			"

												What i say now is not just aimed at Total War but in the state of games and the industry in general, i just wanted to get it of my chest:I am giving my age away but i come from that era where there was no such thing as DLCs and expansions. Game was complete and very very very stable and almost bug free. Now like the person above said, WE ARE THE TESTERS and we PAY THEM TO TEST THEIR game. I wish this CRAP can stop. But its the users fault because they (me included) starting to pay for all these DLC's and take the crap.In my defence if i bought a DLC or expansion i expected whole new content like new races or new weapons or stuff but on major scale change so that you can really say this is a change and this DLC worth it.These days we get DLC's with content i expected in my opinion to have been part of the game in the FIRST PLACE.For example, Star Craft 2, now we have to buy the DLC's or so called expansions just so that we can play the 2nd race in game (Zerg) and the third expansion coming to play the 3rd race. In the past you got games where you could play all races in single player, each having their own story, cutscenes etc. BUT NO!!!! We have to now buy it as DLC and everyone just throw money at them and now its become the trend, the norm. This is BSHT. Unless people stop throwing money at all these developers and start demanding full games again, then this will never change.At least CD Project Red tried by taking a step in the right direction, we got a huge game (The Witcher 3) and they giving us 16 Free DLC's for the game, not PAYING but FREE. This is stuff that should have been in game in first place and they are adding it and giving for free BUT.... we are still trapped in this huge DLC or Expansion (whatever you want to call this) nightware where we are paying for stuff that should have been in the game in the first place to make the game COMPLETE.Never had this 10-20 years ago.Its a pity how we let them do this to us and gaming just a money making scheme and they always thinking what else can we do to SQUEEZE more money out of the SUCKERS.Total War sadly went the same route and they are doing it even more to us now, 4 DLC's with stuff that should have been in the game. I am a BIG Total War fan, no, no, no...let me say... I WAS a big fan. I am also fed up with all these DLC's and trying to milk us for everything we have and then get content that should have been in the game in the first place.Its time WE put DOWN our FOOT and say NO MORE!!!!If we do not start a REVOLUTION regarding this then it will get WORSE and WORSE. Its time we take the power back and say NO MORE!!! Its time we get FULL games again!!!This is SERIOUS people (gamers), we allowed this and now we need to STOP this!!! Hurt them where it hurts the most. THEIR WALLETS, THEIR BANK BALANCE.We need new developers who do this for the love of it and still make a living, but this DLC CRAP is getting redicioules.IT MUST STOP NOW!!! and it can only be done by YOU!!!

												So many other total war fans have left (negative) passionate reviews detailing what is wrong with this game. Like them I wanted to like it. Rome 1 remains my most played game of all time and enthralled me for almost 18 months straight. To say that I was excited for Rome 2 is an understatement. My dissapointment is great but ultimately my review comes down to this:It's boring and lifeless and that's the worst thing I could possibly say about any game. The 100+ hours I put in were in an effort to find the fun. I didn't succeed, but it did lead me to re-buy Medieval II and pick up Shogun II for $8 during a sale. I know I'll find the fun by rolling back the clock.Avoid this game if you're a total war fan. If not, meh, maybe take a chance if you find it for a fiver, but the older games are better.			"

You would kinda think when you buy a emperor editon or masters collection it would include ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpriced DLC2.49€ for a blood and core DLC..........wow since that should not be part of the game as standard.Half complete game is what this is.......want to complete it? will cost you another 70€ for all the DLC outside sales.Buy shogun or one of the older games its a better buy and a finished game in comparison			"

												''It's a solid game''. ""It has its moments.''' ''It's competent''.  You see, I was searching to express the good parts of Rome 2 and I' can't quite reach the words ''It's awesome, get it now'' , like I would about most other Total War titles. That must mean that I'm mixed about Rome 2 and after some pondering, I don't think I'll recommend it to my friends. Rome 2 is in itself a solidly designed strategy and if it weren't for the other titles in the series, I'd probably like it more. It certainly has a few things going for it: It's different and modernised enough so that you don't feel like it's the same as its predecessors, the battles are mostly entertaining, modern graphics, and there are some nice design additions:They've introduced a system where armies level up and gain traits, even though they need to stock up on new recruits they retain their ""unit tradition"". A good addition that mimics the way real life legions retained their own unit's traditions, stories, habits and in-jokes over time. Case in point: Legio IX Hispana, ""The Ninth"" , about which a few novels and films where made.Agents and generals matter a lot now and you can level them up in different ways, which makes you pay much more attention to individuals. Some design decisions are a bit wonky: they've done away with the family tree, which removes immersion from your lineage. The political system is good in theory but fairly annoying in practice, everyone hates you anyway. You now have a limit to the number of your armies which takes away a lot of the fun of managing your empire. The building system is convoluted and ultimately not engaging.Ultimately, my biggest gripe with R2 is that I feel it lacks in flair and immersion.  The little things add up, from the interface, the music and the unit cards and limited rosters, to the fact that it all feels 'game-y', from the weird build&tech trees to the general abilities and the all-too-many unit stats. There's no real passion for the ancient era flowing from R2, it could just as easily be a Heroes title or some other decent strategy game.It's not a bad game, it's just... the other Total Wars are better, so why play this one?

												Broken game, broken company full of bull and finally my heart is broken. Been with this fanchise from the beginning and I sadly don't know if I'll ever buy a CA game from this point on. Sad, very sad. Could have been a great game but is just flat and tedious.Edit: Now they have the balls to set a date for the first major DLC so soon when the core is still so broken at the very basic level. Not even talking optimization here. Really shocking. I wouldn't even gift this to my worst enemies. I just am in shock.Edit 2: Beasts of war...really...Just one face palm after another. Don't waste your cash.Edit 3: While I still do not agree with the buisness practices of CA, I would like to amend my review a bit. After many patches and with extensive mods this game is much better. If I could give it a side-ways thumb I would. Disapointed it took so long to ""fix"", 7.5/10DEI and Radious are the only reason to play this half game.			"

												All the ""new features"" are lies. Politics system? What politics system? You don't feel like you're running a nation or that you have any impact on the world what so ever. If you want politics buy Victoria 2.The total war series is on it's last legs, they need to truly re-invent this game. Waste of money and time. I couldn't even complete one campaign because I just ended up getting bored after expanding a bit. All this game is is you trying to turn the map to your colour; that's it, no joke. The combat is dull and very much the same as every total war game except with LESS features. Shogun 2 was far more in-deph than this rubbish but not in-deph enough. A true scam, just a lot of hype about nothing. I won't be buying the next one.			"

Rome was not patched in a day - Some guyThat's the raw truth, you know. Ever since the huge pile of bullsh bugs and unbalances this game was upon release, things are a lot different now. And for the best.The full package of Rome II: Emperor Edition includes a Grand Campaign, 4 DLC Campaigns, 9 gameplay packs, 10 million dollars, a prostitu, never mind, I think you get the point. Some of these DLCs are free and others are a bit too pricey for what they offer. My advice? get them during steam sales.For the sake of briefness, we will mostly stick to the Grand Campaign. You got a map stretching from the Brittanic Isles and Iberia to Northern Africa and Bactria. The faction you choose will be somewhere inside this vast landscape, and your goal is to fulfill certain objectives to beat the game. The map is historically accurate, and please, show some understanding and don't complain about certain ""historical cities"" missing, if every aspect of history was added in this game, we would have a giant mess to deal with that would be pretty unplayable.The gameplay is pretty complex. As your faction's leader you got access everywhere: from internal politics between parties and dynasties, to economy, to constructing new buildings, armies, navies, to recruiting agents, to foreign policies and much more. You have so much to do and so many ways to destroy or subjugate your enemies, you will never be bored. Every playthrough is unique and always something new and different happens, requiring your skills to take care of it. Diplomacy, economy, military, they all are the means to an end. And you have to learn how to use them properly.When is comes to AI things are a bit obvious: it's completely predictable. The AI does this certain loop: build big armies, attack neighbours, refuse 80% of the time to trade, repeat. Seriously, no idea why it's so impossible to trade with other factions in this game. You have to make huge coin offers that will obliterate your coffers and most of the times, it's just not worth it. Particularly, I can't recall Rome as a faction to ever accept my trade offers. What a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are.As for the battle AI, things are better there. The enemy actually adapts to your tactics, trying to counter your movements and is not afraid to use dirty tactics to finish you off (like using huge amounts of javelins or hit-and-run tactics with cheap units). If you don't know what you are doing or take too long to come up with a proper strategy and battle plan, the AI will proudly march back home with your general's head mounted on a spear. SPOILER ALERT: pikes and horse archers beat anything. Kind of.Not gonna lie though, the game is BEAUTIFUL. The sounds are top notch, the soldiers are detailed, the animations very cool and there are thousands of soldiers on the battlefield, ready to slaughter each other for your amusement. Combine it with graphics mods and all you have to do is order a roman armor from ebay to complete your immersion. It's simply that good.Rome II still has several flaws, many of them fixed by Attila. That doesn't mean the game is unplayable, in fact it's extremely enjoyable and has a tremendous amount of replayability. Trying out new factions with different playstyle, take different courses than your last playthrough, epic, massive scale battles and cunning diplomacy combine in an amazing package of fun. And for those that want to take it more competitive, there's also the option to play online.RATING:Gameplay: 7.5/10Presentation: 9.5/10Story: 9/10Unique Factor: Replayability: 10/10OVERALL: 9/10 "

												I've played this game close to over 600 hours (lost my other account, about 400 hours on this one., and there are so many things that's disappointing.I'm going to bring up a few major points.1. DLC:s....... they cut out alot of parts of the game and sold them as DLC:s, which made me extremely disappointed and angry. This is one of the largest disappointments out of everything I'm about to bring up. Us, Total war fans see this as a ""F*ck you, we don't care about you. We just want money.""2. ""Wrath of Sparta"" DLC: When I played as Sparta I noticed a few things... the military building gives minus public order. Pretty f*cking stupid. On the battlefield I noticed that some of the troops say something like this ""Don't be scared men"". Which is pretty wierd since all men in the spartan society (not slaves) were trained since birth, and were renouned for their bravery -_-'. Details like this are very important for me and surely for other people aswell.3. The politics system: It's insanely bad. You have no emotional connection to your generals. Since there is no family tree or anything, and you can just replace them instantly if they die. 4. Mods: I really didn't enjoy the game without using mods. There are factions that have insanely bad and small rosters. Which led me to install unit mods to have a larger variety.I have a really good computer and I run all graphics on max. And I was extremely disappointed in the results, which led me to also install graphical enhancement mods.There are many other mods that I have but you see the point here... without them, it's pretty bad.5. Bugs and glitches: After years of patching I still come across major bugs, for exampel. During a battle an enemy boat of soldiers literely went through across the whole battlefield to land on the other side of the map. This bug was seen in launch and obviously is still seen today.Soldiers are spacing out sometimes and act very wierd.Final words: Even tho the game have all these problems/issues, I still enjoy it (mods being a huge part of it). In the beggining tho, I forced myself to play the game. I'm a Total War fan, and I've been that for many many years.Warhammer is the next game that Creative Assembly will release, and if these things still appear in that game (especially the DLC b*llshit) I will literely will go insane, probably will be the last game from them I'll buy if it continues. It has already been shown that they are doing the exact same thing in Warhammer, they have ripped out Chaos Warriors out of the game and is a pre-order bonus (DLC). I'm extremely tierd of this b*llshit and they better stop before they lose all their fans. I won't buy Warhammer until this DLC b*llshit stops, you shouldn't either.Anyways, to the actual subject. These are a few points of issues out of a hundred that I've brought up. For those who aren't Total War fans, I really don't see you enjoying this game at all. And I DO NOT recommend this game, not worth the money. Not even close.The vanilla game is not worth playing at all but with mods it's okay. Still not acceptable.			"

												Total War: Rome II (Or just RTW2) is a game of two halves. One half is filled with potential, graphical accomplishments and a sense of community through the additions in the Workshop.The other half is a mess of bugs, poor balance and a total lack of attachment to a campaign. Bugs on release and balance issues have been part of Total War since the days of RTW1, but not after 20 patches and certainly not with the level of game-breaking effects present even nearly a year later after I pre-ordered it.The attachment is where it really hurts for me as a long time fan. Shogun Total War II made you feel attached to every member of your clan, they each gained skills and traits that made them feel genuinely unique. Rome Total War 1 was arguably the epitome of this though, with sprawling family trees and a real sense that you were taking a Roman family (or an enemy of Rome) through one of the greatest eras of history. Now most turns feel like a slog, destroying factions is commonplace thanks to the huge number of seperate areas, and characters all end up with similar traits (If everyone in my faction likes Romans then it's not really a very unique feeling to each person).Siege bugs are the worst I've seen in an RTS game, missile units sometimes don't fire and melee battles sometimes just look like two blobs fighting eachother. Naval Battles, while initially absolutely awful, have been improved but still feel totally void of character or any real sense of strategy. Mods solve some of these issues, but the game appears to irrepairable without the right combination of mods that match the the patch your at. In short, I cannot recommend it. It's easily the worst Total War game ever made and has essentially killed any chance of me pre-ordering a Creative Assembly game againEDIT: There have been several complaints on this review about my amount of playtime and how I should change my opinion based on it. I didn't spent £40 on a game to abandon it and just leave it with a bad review. I came back patch after patch, including the most recent Emperor Edition, not because I would tell someone to buy it but because I want to be ABLE to. Creative Assembly are a company I support, still support, but unless reviewers like myself make it very clear that this game was not an acceptable release and still isn't mistakes will be repeated in newer titles.Complaints about my playtime will be deleted from the review.

												Where to start with Rome 2..? Well, it looks nice I guess, but promised way too much. If you're coming to this from Rome: Total War then you'll notice a lot that is different and not so much in a good way. The game is literally still riddled with game breaking bugs 1 year from release, even after hefty patching that seems to have just covered up an otherwise sinking boat. AI that doesn't know how to siege your settlements, the game engine itself struggling to cope with 2 full armies on the field at once resulting in a perfect FPS on your part but the units in-game moving in a stuttering motion being just one bug that's been there from release and has yet to be fixed, The huge battles take such a toll on your system even though on paper your machine should be able to smash this game, leaving you feeling bitter for the price you've had to pay for a series that keeps letting it's fans down but lying to them to get their money again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     There are a few interesting features like on the campaign map how you have to deal with dilemma's in your empire, I like that, makes you feel like your involved with you populace on a personal level. There is a large unit variety which is nice but after a certain point, if you're not playing as Rome, your empires tech just stops which has also been a problem in previous Total War titles, for example. Rome has a meagre power in your game but they can still happen upon the tech for their heavily armoured and well trained legions yet if you're playing as another faction then a few upgrades later is all you're going to get.                                                     There is too much that is wrong with this game and I've found that contradicting something the Creative Assembly has said gets you insta-hate from their fanboys which is a constant on the forums or blocked entirely from saying anything constructive about the game at all. With a mix of bad customer service, bare-faced lying to their customers and combined with a broken game, this Total War game isn't worth your attention unless it's on sale for a very low price.			"

												I recommend you buy this game at half price at the very most. I do recommned the game, it's fun, has a very large and extensive campaign with many factions to play as. However, the game has been stripped of some features previous in older Total War games such as the family tree. The game in general moves far too fast to get attached to your commanders, like in previous games, and they die a lot without any real notice. The buildings and campaign planning is now at an absolute minimum, with a new provincial system that works well when you are  a large nation, but suffers from a lack of depth when you are a small nation. The politcs screen does nothing, and can be ignored completely, providing nothing in terms of gameplay to the world. Seasons have been re-introduced because the community cried out for it, however the game moves at one turn per year, so seasons don't fit the timescale and don't play much effect.The graphics are top notch. Both on campaign and on battles, however my PC is very capable at running on Ultra, but only around an average of 30fps. Optimization is extremly poor for entry level PCs and the graphical fidelity falls extremely quick when you lower the settings.Battles are fun to play, they look impressive and work well in general. It's taken 12 major updates to get to the stage where I am comfortable at recommending this to someone, but as with most TotalWar games, the AI is terrible. On the campaign it's fairly smart, however diplomacy is almost non existant. You can't trade money effectivley, you can't gift regions or demand them you cannot bribe armies or settlements, you cannot co-ordinate with any certainty your nation and another to attack a particualr spot or nation. On land, battles work pretty well. The AI behaves appropriately and in some cases smartly. This is where the game is best. Open terrain battles with large armies clashing in the fields. In large towns, it's more cumbersome as the enemy try to navigate streets quite poorly. In full on walled cities, the game falls flat on it's face. The AI pathfinding is terrible and they will pretty much throw armies at one spot until they break through, which they never will.The multiplayer scene is dead. For a game that's sold over 1m copies, you'd be lucky to find 20 active games.Co-op campaigns are brilliant. This is because AI isn't an issue and you can play against someone for the entire game. You just need someone willing to play with you for a full campaign.That's all. Like I said, half price at best. The game's DLC packs offer nothing great, more factions and more of the same. this is probably the worst Total War game to date. But it's still a Total War game, if you need to play battles where 1000's of troops clash together, this is your game. If you need good strategy, in depth campaigns or history, I'd look to Civilization V, Crusader Kings II, Total War: Shogun II or Europa Universalis IVIf you're a hardcore Total War fan who wants to boycott the series, no point, they've sold 1m+ games. It's by far their most successful game to date. Just don't pre-order the next one.			"

												Our men flee the field of battle! This is a shameful display.I've put 53 hours into this game from Sunday night to Saturday morning. I became so determined to take the exact area that real life Rome held that I just couldn't quit playing lol. I fought some of the most brutal battles I've ever faught in a video game, at one point being outnumbered 5300-2300 and killing over 3300 of their men before my last unit fell.If you like Civilization, I'd say give this game (or one of the other TW's I haven't tried them, but based on the vids I've watched they all play largely the same). You can basically play the entire game like a more complex Civ, on a smaller map, locked into Roman times (due to this, the map feels quite massive). But, you have the added bonus of being able to actually fight the battle and control the troops RTS style. Allowing you to pull off wins in battles that the quick battle claimed you were going to get slaughtered in lol. Though sometimes, the result is the same (or thereabouts).I played much of the second half of my war for the Roman empire, taking what was the eastern empire. And I did the vast majority of that as I would have in Civ, but the few times I took direct command, I pulled either wins, or significantly more damage on the enemy than what quick match was going to do.I overlooked this series, and I wish I hadn't, as this is the most fun I've had with a game in quite some time. And I am going to continue to play it, and will be buying other TW games later down the road.Do yourself a favor, if you like RTS or any of the Civ games, whether it be Civ V, or even Gal Civ, watch some vids on this or one of the other TW games, and see what you think, and give the game a chance. I have 97 hours into Gal Civ, and 65 in Civ V, and as much as I like both of those games, I have no doubt that I will pass them both up with the amount of time I put into this game.			"

												Total War: Rome 2 is a game with serious flaws. It was released with severe bugs; three months (not to mention seven patches) later I still experience occasional, unexplainable crashes. Gameplay-wise, the interface is poor, the AI makes mind-boggling decisions during battles and in the campaign, and the graphics leave something to be desired: even with all settings on Extreme I can't seem to get near the quality of those damnable screenshots. Oh, and the Blood & Gore setting -- a standard option in most games -- is sold as DLC. As if a $60 dollar game shouldn't have that option by default.On the flip side, the game is eminently moddable, so if you're open to experimentation you could search for mods that make the game entertaining for you. Or create those mods yourself! And hey, despite all its rough edges, I still find Rome 2 sometimes engrossing, and you might too if you're a fan of large-scale strategy... Yet I can't help but feel that I'm forcing myself to play just so I can say I got my money's worth.			"

												As a veteran of the series, I must admit this game feels very shallow and completely without any depths. The way how CA simplify this game makes you wonder if this will be first Total War title that will be ported to consoles. Overpowered agents, AI that can't conduct siege attack, or making sensible choices (like Rome army enjoying cruise on sea when all they cities were taken).On the top of that horrible, horrible optimization that is really affecting performance. CA gave us 7 patches yet it seems like we will need at least 7 more to maybe past beta version.Stay away for time being - maybe in the future or if you can find it for less than £10, then buy it. Otherwise spend your money on something different.			"

Concept and legacy are promising, but after 3 months and 7 patches the developer still hasn't managed to fix the terrible frequent crashes, horrible frame rates and graphic glitches (This is not because of my system it's community wide). The AI is a mess and the game fails to entertain in the long run. The multiplayer is plagued by desync issues as well.  Not recommended at all.			"

												This may be a rather controversial review, but I must say that I am sick and tired of Rome 2. The game in principle should be good - an apparent forty percent increase in budget from previous total wars and a brilliant precedence led me to pre purchase the game, and at first I was pleased. However after about only ten hours I began to realise there were several problems that I was experiecing (I wont go into detail), but they included a dodgy public order system, that seemed to make it counter productive to get high tier buildings, an extremely useless politics part, Generals that came and went without any real family or attatchment, Im sure you can find a long list of its problems online.This is not why I hate Rome 2.  The campaign I enjoyed (despite the problems) and I liked the battles (despite the worst Ai i have  ever seen in a total war). I hate Rome 2 because of the continued corner cutting and obvious fan based exploitation. The most obvious of this ROME 2 Emperor edition - which (and correct me if Im wrong) promised to contain all the content and DLCs so far and (again correct me if Im wrong) but all Rome 2 owners were promised a free upgrade - which technically means that they owe us all the DLCs, but nevermind that. I loved Rome 1 because they gave you so much content without paying too much extra. Emperor edition brings almost no content to the game (unlike rome 1 barbarian invasion), has no extra units, and even though I played my first campaign as Eygpt it gave me the pregame cinematic for the Rome faction (there is only currently one type of pregame cinematic in the game). Rome 2 augustus campaign is extremely half-arsed, bringing no more units to the game (unlike barbarian invasion in rome 1 where there were tons of different units. Although Rome 2 was already money - grabbing (SEE THE £44 worth of Dlc!?!?!) This free lc of augustus campaign is just a rearanged map and factions of Rome 2 (currently) with even less effort than there was in the origional game.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment to anyone who has played any of the other Total war games. Here are some of the pros: Improved graphics (After all the years this should have been a given), more playable units/nations, after a few minutes I could not figure out any other pros... Here are the cons: No one can really play it on max graphics because of the horrible optimization, the game is buggy and glitchy, the combat is horrible to where it is easier just to auto resolve every battle, AI is horrible and does things that realistically would never be possible, food and happiness systems do not function correctly, sea battles are horrible, tech trees are really dumb to use, the limitations on troops which you can create until you tech up through the horrendous tech trees sucks, the loading times are rediculous, the diplomacy is broken, the combat is horrible, controlling your army has become a nightmare, probably the thing I hate the most is the unit cards where you can not even tell what the unit will remotely look like, DLC is completely an outrage because all of their DLC should have been included with the game because it does not expand the game but only allow the player to access the entire game. Overall I honestly would Never recommend this game to someone who I care the slightest for but hey, if you want to ignore all of critics about this game then be my guest.			"

It also has fantastic mod support so there is always a mod availible for any thing you want to tweak.There are a lot of people who rage on this game but they are over exagerating.

But the thing that ruins this game so much, is that you have to pay for the things that should already be in the game that you paid 79.95 usd for. like blood, gore etc. I can honestly see why so many Total War fans are disappointed. So, if you wanna be safe and keep your money, don't buy this game.... But if you're a rich mofo, well then feel free to see your riches wasted on 10 DLCs which should be in the game, but what can I say. I'm a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												***REVIEW DATES FROM WEEKS AFTER RELEASE STILL HAVE TO GIVE IT A 2nd CHANCE***This is from a Total War fan and very subjective, quite a few reasons are personal tasteThe biggest budget total war to me looks like many AAA games this year and got on the market in beta/alpha stage.This game would have been alright if they made it pre purchase with beta acces and in that stage it should still be instead of moneygrinding dlc's. Down to the facts why I do not like this game:-CA wants you to play very long campaigns so they made the battles in fields really fast paced for me its horrible-Each turn is a year, no season's, no strategy for winter, no nice map transform... ok there now is if you pay for the Ceasar DLC-Improved diplomacy? Did not play long enough to tell the whole story but at the start of the game its pritty horrible-The political system, nobody knows what it is good for or when it makes any difference at all-""We have big plans for rome total war 2 multiplayer""... a poll by some guys who did not like the avatar system and another shortcut was found to shorten development time and strip all of the great improvements in shogun 2 making multiplayer almost boring instead of putting loads of time in fixing the leaderboards, dropping etc-Campaign with capture points in open fields and multiplayer with none = corner camping in MP and very limited tactical options in SP-Multiplayer campaign, stop asking for 2vs2 in each new game the regular 1vs1 gets more desync's (actually mailing eachothers save's like in the old day's should be supported) -Bugs for landing, bugs for moving, bugs for clicking, ah well this will get patched thats alright-Units have all the poly's in the world while the terrain on open ground to me is not what it should be for a game in 2013 at this price-Units automaticly convert to ships same as in civ 5 I hate this arcade thing with routing units going up sea raiding your port the next turn while you should have slaughtered them on the beach etc-AI that beats you only with bonus cheating no brain at all, ok that is just total war-UI as if you play a future game nothing like a history game, unit cards should be art or something but I have trouble recognising what unit it really is...-CA & historical accuracy-CA & realism (gray wolves in the desert)-In the end it never made me feel like hurr I take over the world thinking over all my moves rather go play rome 1, the strategy part is gone to me-Music in total war games has always been really nice but this is just mainstream to me not touching me just some fitting noice-Animations... loads of them being a huge improvement over last games, but... rarely visual when all units are in a blob (kinda ok tough that all men fight instead of going line by line for every unit) in way to short battle's. While other nice extra's like general speech scene's, many cut scene's etc are yet again striped out. For the ultimate budget game I was expecting afther shogun 2 they would make loads of these but no.Overal the game is still alright but the franchise to me is broken all the new options from shogun 2 multiplayer are gone instead of fixed, the single player is not touching me like it did in the past. Strategy is goneLIke many mainstream games now get it with a big discount			"

You could see the soldiers pushing each other and ganging up on a soldier. But in rome 2, the soldiers stand still fighting 1 on 1 until the unit routes.

												This game was far off everyone expected and most itching what was advertised. It took a year till it got shaped and being in a state it should been have back in Sept. 2013.In Steam Store it says: scalable experience regardless your rigCitating CA: We had +40% more budget; AI dev said: ""We never invested more into AI development""; CA promised ""sieges battles of immersive scale"".Honestly this game was failure on release.  The pictures we can see on Steam and in the trailers are in-game graphics but very much edited. I am not saying this to beat an already dead horse but because we customers have been betrayed like Varus.Some people say the game is now absolutely fine but honestly CA is not able to fix this game completely because of the warcape engine which was never intended for Rome 2 like battles as it was made for line infantry battles. So if you care to directly compare the battle mechanics like Dr. Sane did on Youtube you will notice differences.At the end of the day the problems this game has due the engine (core issues) and which have been discussed to death in reviews and forums either way STILL exist, despite the good efforts of the Emperor Edition and more than 14 major patches! Also watch out this game is available legit for about 29 € so do not trust the prices on Steam. People in Russia and Britain pay a lot less than us even without discounts. Check out {LINK REMOVED}onlinekeystore.com to get legit and well priced keys for this game.However, saying the game is not worth a penny is a bit exaggerated meanwhile. By today (Sept. 2014) I rate the game with a 8/10 (original rating September 2013 4/10)-1 point for the severe AI issues, which propably cannot even get patched.-1 point for performance and LoD issues, which propably cannot even get patched.-1 point for the streamlined functionality compared to previous TW games-1 point for the athmosphere and music (music mods available by now)-1 point for the battle mechanics compared to Rome 1 / Medival 2+1 point for the good mods available+1 points for the Emperor Edition release and changes+1 for continued supportI still do not recommend to buy this game full priced! For the half price it is a good buy and can distract you for some time if you do not focus on the misses it has.			"

												Empire feels well-polished in comparison, even after many many patches it never addressed the root of many of the problems which is the warscape engine itself: it was tailor-made to simulate Early-modern line infantry warfare, not Roman maniples or Greek phallanxes. As such shields get waved around like theyre made of foam and the combat itself lacks weight, this wasnt a big issue in Empire/Napoleon since there were few dedicated melee units and most bayonet charges were brief exchanges meant to break the enemy with pure shock rather than killing power. The lack of weight is most apparent with cavalry when in Rome 1 charging a cataphract into infrantry sent the front ranks flying and often times immediatly broke said unit.Yes there are mods that can fix certain things but they cant fix the underlying problems like the engine, you should not buy a game based on the fact that there are mods to fix it; the vanilla game needs to be able to stand up on its own as a satisfactory experience to be worth your money			"

												After an agonizing process of patches, involving many periods of not being able to play it, a great community ripped asunder that I doubt will ever be the same again, and the judicious use of many mods, this game is finally something stable and good I could spend a few thousand hours in. The number of mods available for the game is staggering, and some of them are brilliant.I guess CA have to be applauded for going through eight circles of hell to put their mistakes right, especially compared to certain other developers who basically laugh in their users' faces when they mess up - how you behave when you make a mistake says a lot. It just would have been far better for the game to release where it is now.All in all, a good game, and where we are now, it is my favourite of the post-Medieval 2 games.Note: In case you want to know ""which kind of fan"" is posting this review, I mainly love the older games, Medieval, M2 and Rome are the best in the series in my opinion and the series took a nose-dive after that, even if Empire has some redeeming features.

												I've been giving this game a chance every month or 2, just tell myself to try the game and see if they fixed it. I am a Total War fan all the way back to the original Shogun. I knew it was going to be hard for CA to live up to the brilliance of Rome Total War. A year after release I am still dissapointed and sad of what they managed to launch as a finished and polished product. Instead what we got was a béta at best, for full price.My last try came with the Emperor Edition free DLC which CA claimed would fix all the problems, as if they never said that before. Nevertheless I tried it and found myself dissapointed again. so I started looking if I had the DLC and went to the store page and this I should not have done! I was horrified by the amount of DLC already available. Howcome, a game that has so many problems manages to launch so many DLC, even worse, the combined cost of the DLC is € 60,42, whereas the basegame is 'only' € 54,99. It is simply outragious they prefer to unlock-new-factions-DLC which customers have to pay for then to sort their game out. This might just have been my last try of the game and I am not sure if I want to support CA any longer, but today they have definately lost my position of an absolute fan of the company!			"

From Rome 1 and Medieval 2 I had a very positive experience with CA and so I let the whole thing slide and show faith.How do I feel now? I feel like my girlfriend I was with for five years tells me the night I propose to her, that she is running off to marry my best friend whom she was dating for 2 years behind my back. I feel THAT cheated. Why? Promotionally CA did its best to lure us to buy a game with high expectations: ""40% higher budget"", ""it will look much better at launch, this is pre-alpha footage"", ""our goal is to make Rome 2 the best Total War game yet""We trusted them and gave them money for a product we have not seen.What did we get?I'll state my positives so to be fair:- Cinematic camera- Addition of naval warfare (it is unplayable but is the best in the series :P)- Depth and number of factionsTo the important stuff:Battles:- Super awkward formations and unit movement- No realistic collision between clashing units. Ironically Rome 1 had more realism than its successor- Animation seems idiotic and fake- Individual persons interact only 1v1, so if even if they are outnumbered one unit can survive waves after waves of enemies- When charging, units awkwardly stop and lose momentum instantly (and this applies to the entire unit)- Music is unspirational and does not change with battle conditions- Control areas in open fields (whaaat??). Instead of playing the enemy and thinking strategically, you run to a controll area, stay for a little time and you win the battle- Battles are super short- AI is stupid beyond imagination- Buggy and laggy as hell- Naval battles are even more broken and buggy- UI makes no sense, all units look exactly the same- One spot for unit condition, so you lose precious time to understand all the status ailments of a unit e.g. fighiting, taking fire, firing etc.- and much more Campaign:- AI is even more stupid than that in battles- Diplomacy is broken with out any explanation of what led to an ally's/enemy's particular decision. AI decisions are spontaneous- Very easy even in high difficulty level- Building system makes no sense- Loooooong wait turns- and much more  Overall, Rome 2 is a beta game. It is blunt, boring and uninspirational I attribute the fiasco to awful project management, but I can only speculateI understand CA tried to mend it with continious patching, but a game so flawed in its core is unfixable no matter how you try to improve specific features. Also, when you talk about patching at launch, means you should not have launched in the first place.			"

												If you like deep immersive strategy games play ROME 1 or Medieval 2 instead, if you like getting kicked in the nuts paying for overpriced DLC (not the complete overhall of kingdoms or the purchasable special units of Empire, here the've cut out chunks of the finished game to resell after to maximise profit.   If the gold version with all the downloadable content comes down to around £20 I'd advise buying it, if you allready own and have played to death the Rome, Medieval 2, Empire (& Napoleon) and even Shogun, it might be worth a purchase.  Although after playing the others this will feel like an empty experience.  Waited till the game was playable till I write this review.  Over the last 12 months the game has gone from being unplayable due to graphics bugs, crashes and fps problems after a year of patches they now have a game thats unplayable as you get bored and think of other things you'd rather be doing instead (like sorting socks).     I've played the total war series since Shogun and have thousands of hours of play on the series especially the original Rome (I Love classical civilisations) and Medieval 1+2 even a couple of hundred hours on Empire.  This game looked like the game I was waiting for fantastic graphics, complex gameplay and a lasting challenge (even more so with DLC) how wrong I was.  Comparing it to the original Rome (Which I still play) from ten years ago is difficult as the new version lacks so much content, gameplay and complexity that made the original so much fun.  The new one has better graphics (just lacking visible unit upgrades, terrible unit cards and cohesion in battle).  Whats lost is summed up well here(not by me): http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1qwj7a/everything_rome_1_had_that_rome_2_doesnt/  Over all its like they thought lets take the strategy game they've been waiting 10 years for (Rome with modern graphics) and cut all the top level strategy out (politics, dynasties etc) take off the factions people will want to play (all were playable in Rome1) to sell for premium DLC's.  The strategic AI (sAI) is atrotious even by Total war and civ game standards but the combat AI is passable (but you tend to autoresolve battles as the sAI can rarely provide a good enough army to be fun to fight.

Posted: April 30, 2016
												I was introduced to Total War only last year, and since then I have played Medievil 2, Shogun 2, Attila, and Rome 2.  Of those, I have to say Rome 2 is by far the worst.  While it can still be fun, the game is just a sloppy mess that tries it's best to suck the enjoyment out of itself.We'll start with the good things.  The time period is fantastic.  This is Rome during the height of their power, not the shadow of glory that is present in Attila.  You can re-enact the war against Carthage, you can play as the ancient Greeks or Egpyt if you like, or even try to reclaim Alexander the Great's empire as one of the successor kingdoms.  As I said, the time period is great and the map size is awesome.  I love how at the beginning of the campaign there are dozens of different factions trying to fight for control of the ancient world.  And the game is still a Total War game, with all of the positive things that that entails.Now onto the negative.  The game is a broken, complicated mess.  Mechanics don't work as they should.  Fortify stance giving you +50% reinforcement range?  No, it doesn't.  Units tend to blob up despite the use of a ""formation attack"" toggle.  Morale mechanics are broken, I've had units at over 50% break and route even though they were ""winning decisively.""  Your general is useless, he will always be one of the first troops to fall if his unit is attacked no matter what angle it's from.  Sometimes units won't even follow orders.  I had a unit of Roman Cavalry that I was telling to attack a unit of enemy slingers.  Despite the fact that they registered the order, they stopped thirty feet from the slingers and stood there.  No matter how many times I told them to attack they just sat there until they finally routed from losses garnered by standing in the line of fire for ten minutes.Other battlefield mechanics make no sense.  How are slingers dropping my Super Heavy Spear Infantry locked in a shield wall from the front?  Then there is the truly broken:  Pikes.  You know your game has severe balance issues when multiplayer rooms are usually tagged with ""no pikes allowed"" because Pikeman > EVERYTHING.  Without a doubt.  I once had a unit of heavy swordsmen in a shield wall acting as an anvil for a unit of light pikemen.  I then hit those pikes from behind with a unit of heavy melee cavalry.  Both of my units routed without the pikemen taking any significant losses.The campaign map isn't much better.  Buildings are overly complicated with their bonuses and negatives, turning empire-building into a game of hardcore addition and subtraction.  Capturing territories is extremely slow because the public order system is designed to bog you down.  Generals will pick up negative traits for idling in cities after only one turn.  The ""political intrigue"" system is boring, time consuming, and doesn't really have any effect on the rest of the campaign.  The entire game just feels...Broken.  This isn't even mentioning that half of the playable factions are locked behind a paywall.  So you charge me $50 for a broken game that isn't even close to the whole package, then charge me an additional $35 to unlock the rest?  What a joke.What makes this worse is shortly after I played this I bought Attila.  Attila is everything that Rome 2 should have been, which is even more upsetting because rather than fix the broken piece of junk they charged everyone good money for, they went ahead and just made another game that actually worked and said, ""Sorry guys if you bought the crap that was Rome 2,  go ahead and buy Attila instead!  It works!""  Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on CA, I understand that♥♥♥♥♥♥happens sometimes..And since Rome 2 they've really stepped up their game.  Look at how TW: Warhammer is shaping up!  Not to mention that they're walking everyone through that development every step of the way!  I am, however, hating on everything that happened to make Rome 2 the piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that it is today.  This is the black stain on your record, CA, and you owe everyone by making sure that this fiasco never happens again.In short, don't play this♥♥♥♥♥♥  Either get Attila or Warhammer instead, or go with one of their older titles.  Those actually work.OVERALL:  4/10			"

												Personally as somebody who has put over 700 hours into this game I feel I have experienced all that there is to in this game.This game to me is almost perfect, many things factor into this such as its simplicity and how its so easy to pick up and play for hours and hours of endless fun.Another thing I love is this games Factions you get from the start (Yes I know I could be like 99% of all the other review and complain about DLC but that to me doesn't matter) The line up we are given in this game is extremely different to each other, this with the inclusion of mods that make every single other non-DLC faction playable makes it amazingly replayable.Every time I pick up and play this game it excites me for the kind of empire i'll build next, maybe i'll build an African empire with Rome or maybe i'll take on the barbarian tribes with Macedon ~There is very few problems that I have with this game, one being the AI is too passive (although this can be fixed with a simple mod) I felt they weren't expansive enough and that they'd just wait in line for me to invade them next.Another problem is Pikemen, as fun as they are to use and they look really cool, I feel like they're overpowered and over used, any faction that can get them spams them so damn much it's insane. This pike spam makes playing as factions who dont have them I.E. Iceni, Suebi and Parthia really hard as you need to focus all of your power on them and it just takes a lot of fun away from battles and it just makes you want to auto-resolve the battles with pikemen.Apart from those 2 issues I have the game itself Is one of the best Total war games out there!I'd seriously reccomend this to anybody wanting to get into the Total war franchise.I give Total War™: ROME II a 9/10			"

												I love the Total War franchise and Classical History!Save yourself and just play Rome Total War 1 Gold Edition.  I have a quadcore and SSD and plenty of available memory and loading was still too time consuming.Graphics were cute, but prettier graphics do not make game play better.  The game play was too directed, not enough free form game play.  The agent system is irritating.  A single agent can stop an entire legion in its tracks and the legion can do NOTHING to stop it.  The % chance of success of any agent action seems to not reflect the action mission accomplishment at all.In battle labeling and unit information identifiers are frusterating.  In battle unit maneuver is sluggish.  The visibility of other units is inconsistent.  Invading a city of any size plainly favors the computer player because of the awkward in battle user interface.  Diplomacy is bad comedy.  Even when I have intentionally given the AI a deal that clearly favors them, they often decline.  The AI may start a war or initiate a battle against a clearly superior force for no discernable reason.  The labels describing how reliable a civilization is or their tendency does not actually mean that much.  The most defensive, honorable, factions still are likely to stab your civilization in the back.  Curious. . . Sure, I have finished the game 4 or 5 times.  I don't feel like I have really won though because it took SO long and the in battle engagements were not much fun.  I ended up simulating almost every battle on my last two campaign wins because I was sick of waiting.This game has nice graphics, but the overall game experience is unbalanced, tedious, and too directed.  The game freedom tends to be generally cosmetic.  I do not recommend this game. "

												Rome 2 is a very pretty game. It also has a lot of nice features to it, and if you are new to the series, I'm sure you'll love it.Being a veteran of the Total War series though, its a major step back in almost every way. While big and pretty, the overland map is not very functional, and serves mostly as a vehicle for moving your ten million agents that has to be moved every turn. Of course you also move armies here, and this is where the biggest disappointment of the game comes out.The AI is horrible in almost every single way. While it has gotten better, the AI still has no real idea what to do in sieges other than the extremely weird magic torches.Combat between armies end up being large blops of men, something that was introduced only in this latest of the series.All in all, I can only recommen people interested in the series to get Rome: Total War 1, Medieval 2 or Shogun 2 - all three are much better games with more features and better strategic combat.

												Rome 2, ahhhhh Rome 2..... So much hype, so many expectations, so many promises.... Here is the thing: Overall, now is a solid game, on single player only( at least for me and my buddy).  Almost 2 years after release how does the game fare? Well, the thing is, this game fails because of what sorrounded and still surrounds it,  from a design and gameplay perspective. Allow me to elaborate, if you will: this game was HYPED to no end. Several live action videos and developer diaries, ALL of it to deliver an inevitably weak game.  From a  design perspective, many strange decisions: unit cards, UI, retainers, generals, agents, faction bonuses, turns per year are just some features that seem like a downgrade from previous Total War games, namely the previous title, Shogun 2. Gameplay wise,  the battles suffer a lot, and is in this aspect that  most critics arise from. Unit collision is still an issue, cavalry still has absolute no way to it,  kill moves are quite franckly a poor way to make units interact with each other ( even tough recently they appropriated the animation of projectile hit to kill other soldiers without using the kill move mechanic, which is just lazy).Faction wise, there is almost no variety between them, (amazing that even though Shogun 2 has the exact same unit models and soldiers for every clan they still manage to give more variety and personallity than Rome 2's many factions).  Seriously, aside from character skins and faction banners, there is no difference in gameplay between Rome and Carthage.That is not to say that the game is a disaster, it is not. It has some good ideas, like province happiness, and graphics wise it is impressive, it is wonderful to see the ancient world more vivid than ever.What ultimately makes this game a thumbs down for me is the preposterous practices on the part of the publisher and the developer. Sorry, no ammount of justification will ever make up for a broken game at launch ( don't believe me? watch a certain "" angry""youtuber review of this game); day one DLC  also is unnaceptable under any circunstance, for it means it is content that was created along with the main game and cut and sold later to boost their profits ( I'm looking at you greek states DLC ( bought it later for 1 buck during sale) ); Also currently, at the time of this review, we are at PATCH 17! This is absolutely outrageous, I ask you fellow gamer, how can a game need 17 PATCHES to be in a working state? Simple, an uttlerly broken game. Even if the state has improved (  sfter almost 2 years.... yay....), the point is THIS SHOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTABLE. The thing is, the moment they released this game is when they decided it was good enough for sale, and this clearly wasn't the case, so, a Shameful display.In the end, it is painfull, because this could easily have  been the greatest Total War game ever made, a comeback to the glory days of Rome 1, now it is a reminder on how not to launch a total war game.P.S. The most amazing thing, recently I played with my friend ( fellow Total War fanatic), a Fall of the Samurai coop campaign, over 60 hours  of campaign and not a SINGLE issue, NO desyncs and smooth framerate. We tried to play a Rome 2 grand Campaign recently, and it crashed on turn 2... "

Posted: December 6, 2013
												I wrote this on 7 SEP 13The long anticipated and waited for Total War: Rome II! Did the new total wars series deliver or is the game as treacherous and underhanded as the Roman empire? Read the following 'brief first impression review' from my 25+ hours of game play and see what is in store for you if you decide to buy the game.First of all, if you do not know what type of game Rome II is--it is basically a turned based battle map game similar to the board game RISK, which I will stereotypically assume if you are an 80s kid you played at least once. Except for the battles are not just dice roles, you have the opportunity to raise armies, control real-time offensive and defensive battle formations, hire spies, dignitaries and companions to subjugate, assassinate, and cause all other forms of havoc to your enemy/neighbors.Several key elements exist within any game that very import to a lot of gamers such as immersion, re-playability, user friendly interfaces, uniqueness, and the list can keep going and going depending upon the player and their personal interests. I will review several facets of the game as they are important to me and stood out fairly immediately.The empire I decided to start playing first was Sparta, cheese I know, but 300 is an awesome movie and I just had to choose them first.THE BADStabilityFor my system, the game is not stable at all. Rome II is default set to high graphics and causes immediate issues. I have also found these same issues (freezing, graphical glitches, black screen of death, ect) were discovered with several different ""standard"" computer systems. Several known bugs have already populated the technical support forums with issues from integrated Intel chip-sets and graphics cards. My aging gaming laptop was barely able to keep up and setting the graphics down to low helped out tremendously. At the obvious sacrifice of visual stimulation. The game ended up looking like Medieval: Total War from 2001. Even with the game set to low, the performance was still very sluggish however playable.After starting the game up for the first time and loading the tutorial, I didn't make it very far past that. After annihilating my enemy in a very fashionable noob manner, the screen turned black instead of populating a victory window. Needless to say I ended up closing the program and ""failing"" my first mission. After doing a little bit of homework, this is also a known error with game as of day one.ImmersionImmersion within Room II is non-existent comparatively speaking. There is not any avatar/character customizations, renaming, history, background story, nothing. The generals and statesmen are empty husks of simple skills with predefined names in order to keep track of your armies. When they died in battle or of old age, it doesn't mean anything to the player because there is literally no connection. When you are required to replace the generals you eventually don't even look at the names on the newly populated list. You just randomly click and go because there isn't any difference. Where did these people come from? Who knows? Who cares? They just in charge of my entire army now! They are also identified as royal versus non-royal families. What does that mean to you? Nothing, not that I have discovered thus far anyway.Another calamity within Rome II that erodes any element of immersion for the game is waiting for your turn. I am not opposed to turn-based strategy games, honestly I love them however I do have a significant problem with the amount of time Rome II takes to get back to your empire. By the time my empire had scouted or obtain city-states from one part of Europe to the Middle East, I had to watch and wait for ALL of the empires to take their turn. This may not sound that bad, but it is, because you will wait on average 10+ minutes for all of the other empires to move their armies and all other units. I was able to get up and do some chores, make my kids lunch, watch some TV for a moment and come back to my computer and it still was not my turn! By this time I was ready to just turn the game off because I was losing interest. Not to mention during some stages of your empire's development, you may only have a minute or two worth of improvements and/or movements to make. Thus, most of your game play hours are spent watching little computer army symbols skip around a map.Artificial IntelligenceDumb. I could leave the review at that because there really isn't any other way of describing the AI, but I'll try to elaborate. I have slaughtered over 1,000s of enemy hoards, outnumbered 3 to 1, just by using simple military strategies at the loss of only a few hundred of my forces. These same battles were originally calculated as being a defeat or victory with severe losses, at times predicting over 60% my forces will die. I am not an epic military strategist and I only had the difficulty set to normal however I find it hard to believe I was able to turn the tables of battle by approximately 50% in my favor (You'll always have some battle losses regardless of what you do).THE GOODEntertainment ValueRegardless of all the problems annotated above the game is still highly addictive and fun to play. I am honestly surprised at the fact I have played 25 hours of this game within first 5 days of release, but the game is honestly hard to put down. There is nothing better than scaling the walls of my enemy and slaughtering the archers as they try to flee or running the enemy down with my cavalry as they retreat from the battlefield; out flanked and tasting my Spartan spears!PotentialThere is a lot of room for improvement which can be added in order to make it more timely and enjoyable for the average player. Such as adding a save option on the battle maps for starters, would be nice considering you have an hour to finish the battle. Sometimes the enemy just doesn't want to walk into your trap and these things take time. The fast forward time function only feels like x1.5.Brief closing comment: Good game with a lot of enjoyable features and addicting battles however covered in bugs and empty handed immersion. Not worth $60 but if you really want to try the game out wait for steam to put it on sale because it is going to happen.			"

												There are many reasons for which I would NOT recommend Rome Total War 2.First because, as you all know, when this game came out, it wasn't full of bugs, it was literally broken. Of course it ran normally, but you could not do one thing without there being a bug to hinder you.The AI: bugged.All kinds of naval combat: bugged.The real time combat gameplay: bugged.In other words, the game was crap and I cant believe I paid the full price for such an unfinished game.Second is due to the fact that Rome Total war I was in my opinion way better than this version (and I'm saying that even though the comp I had at the time wasnt powerful enough to run it and the game didnt stop crashing)Third  is because the DLC that come for this game should:1: be free for those who got the pre ordered edition who had no idea how bad the game would be.2; be free for all others because AM I THE ONLY ONE TO THINK THAT BLOOD AND GORE SHOULD BE IN THE GAME AT LAUNCH ??I simply cannot forgive companies who think they can release a game as bad as that and STILL try to make extra profit out of it. Don't you get it? All sega obviously cares about is money. They dont give a damn about us the players (after all, we've already bought the game) and I sometimes wonder if the updates really change anything at all.My final rating is a 5.5/10. I highly recommend you wait for this game to be at least at -50% (which is under 20 pounds) before buying it.			"

												So to start off I love the total wars. I have played them a long time now and will most likely keep playing them but I came about a few very annoying problems that are killing the game for me. First the AI is literally stupid and will sometimes just sit there at the front of your walls just looking at you(A lot of the time actually). They will also camp out and have a cook out at the bottom of the ladders while fire arrows kill them from the defence towers.  Trying to put your troops on walls or even off of them is impossible so dont bother. Even sometime on the field they dont listen to you they just sit there. I find a lot of the problems happen in city battles but sometimes it can happen in land battles to. I think these are problems that the game has had since the start and dont know if they will ever fix them. I think if your gonna have a game like this you need to make sure your troops actually do something other than glitch out and do nothing.			"

												Such a shame for a great series like Total War. This game is an unfinished, buggy pile of code and art. The AI is just a pure cheat machine, while he can't do any intresting combat manouver, but defeat the roman army in 1 vs 2. Foreg.: Fight against the barbarians, and order a platoon/squad of your Spearman against the barbarian's spearman. 1 group vs 1 group and your loose it surely. If you send in two group vs one enemy, you might win the fight.In TW Arena the swordsman vs spearman, allways the swords wins. But not here. Swordsman is a bad choice.Sea battle is a complete mess. You give orders to your fleet and they ""try"" to do it. Order a boarding action, and hope the best they will do it. Sometimes, I don't know, they are just watching the waves, and the falling arrows/stones. Or maybe they are seasick? In melee your sword wielding mercenaries mostly loose against ranged infantary, at a boarding action! My flagship just sails away when its ordered to attack an enemy ship. If I give him order. If he just have to stay and get arrowshower, he is doing his job nicly.Buy a couple of siege warship, and hope that, you will stop the enemy before they reach you. Or you will loose. On the bright side: if you were try to use normal units, they will lose.City management is a joke now. It have some nice aspect, but its just difficult to understand (first), plan, and get any intresting benefit out of it. Money, maybe a few new unit. Done. Dull.There is a political system in the game, but I havn't found any intresting interaction.There is no depth in diplomatic interactions. In easy mode (couse the battle is unbearble in Normal or Hard level) ""Trade with me!"", ""Nope"". ""Fight with me against..."", ""Nope"". Great graphic demostration for an okay game design, and cheaply programed game.			"

												It's a good game but it's screwed. Coop campaign desyncs AI pathing, no AI in general and unit collison ruin this game. The amazing features from Shogun 2 are stripped resulting in a broken 4.5/10 game. Everything we hoped it would be gone. It's hard to say it's bad as the total war franchise is amazing. No amount of patches can fix it's awful release and distrust focussed towards it. On a side note, a Game of Thrones mod would be good for this. Ultimately I do not recommend at all, maybe in the sales but it's not worth £30.			"

												Pathetic, PATHETIC campaign system is nothing but frustration and illogical silliness. AI nations do not have to fund their armies. That's really all that must be said. The most basic element of any strategy game like this, and the devs, after making DOZENS of releases, think this is ok. You can have the largest empire and a 1 city enemy still gets to max out their army stacks with no repurcussions. Battle AI is equally awful with skirmishers no skirmishing, everyone getting willingly ganked by horsemen and aggressive troops. Micromanagement at every level makes battles a chore and not fun. Naval battles are broken beyond belief. Good god the hours wasted trying to have fun in this game. Not. one. more. second...			"

												Whenever I talk to people about rome 2 the immediate reaction is that rome 1 is more fun and more accurate than rome 2. Well agreed there is no free for all mode in Rome 2 which sucks majorly,  I mean what is the point of a 2v2 if you can't beat up your ally for being incompetent or backstabbing everyone around you. It may not seem like a make or break thing in a game but the free for all defined rome, sure the javelinmen sucked♥♥♥♥♥and if your spearmen couldn't form a phalanx they sucked♥♥♥♥♥as well and all the barbarian infantry on an equal leg (without upgrades) would get beaten up by romans everyday of the week, furthermore the carthagianian mecernaries were underrepresented, the spanish suck many things as a faction and Spain at the time compromised of multiple tribes, armenian spearman are to pufta, macedon do not have the right symbol to represent them, the historical accuracy of what artillery pieces each faction had available are sketchy at best, unit details in general are misleading from being culturally inaccurate like seleucid archers are less likely to have resembled greek archers to german spearmen having a pike phalanx formation WTF???On these many point I am therefore a greater fan of Rome 2 because Rome 2 allows you to fight battles with much more accurate unit compositions meaning the battles are more realistic, javelin units suddenly have a purpose and the tactics you can employ with them much more sophisticated this is no longer a swords vs archers vs cav vs large, tactical game it is way more expansive.Campaiging has also been a touchy subject when I have discussed it but given that not many people buy all the expansions it can be hard to explain nonetheles wasting that amount of money just to make it a full game is criminally insane and certain people should experience ancient warfare without any safeguards or be sent back in time to appreciate why dividing the cost between the main game and so called expansions damages what the game is trying to achieve for the player, an immersive experience with a context of historical warfare that is far superior to Rome 1.it is easy to point fingers that greece was not divided betwen sparta and athens and that in reality there were many city states but why would the total war team have added the greek states campaign. In reality it is impossible to include every singe faction in history into a grand campaign as the map and interface would become incredibly distorted not to mention the change in where settlements are, routes, roads etc. For instance for a armenian history buff where is tigrano? Nowhere is a good answer. That is why Rome 2 with everything packed in is a great game provided all the extras are stuffed in sure it still falls short of real history but hey everything does as we find ourselves increasingly finding holes in the past the further forward we go, its time people just learnt to improvise again (just not to a Rome 1 standard more sort of stop picking small holes and making them larger).My only concerns are the lack of a free for all mode in multiplayer, the cost of the so called expansion packs which you need to make the game run and as always with Rome 2 the accuracy of siege engines available to all factions, but don't let that ruin the game it still feels more realistic than Rome 1 ever will.

												After a rocky release, I must say that CA has pulled them self together.What started as a avarage game has, with patch 8, been turned into a very good Total War: -Though it misses some old features, like familiy tree, it makes up for it with new ones, like the political system (I really like it. Deal with it). -The AI is (after patch 8) avrage for a total war game, although sieges still need work.-The units are ballanced, wich I find very rewarding: Because they are so balanced, you know that it is your superior tactics that won the battle.-The graphics are truly stunning, even though i pay on a high/very high combo. The units and citys feel spectacular, however  the terrain looks a bit grainy, but not game-breaking.- All bugs that plauged the launch is now gone.- Sea battles are boring (in my opinion) and broken. Take this into account when buying this game.- Historical battles are fun to play, but arn't as memorable as in earlier Total War games.- Multiplayer campain is broken at the moment (mostly desync), but normal multiplayer is fully playable, challanging and fun. Sadly, the avatar conquest does not make a comback in this game.- The DLCs that are present should have been included in the game from launch, not a pay-to-play option.All in all, I think this Total War is good. not the best, but far from the worstFinal verdict: 7.5/10Signed etc. etc.Shadow			"

												I'm more than 50 hours into the grand campaign as Rome.  I think it could easily last 80 hours.  I've really enjoyed this game and it has lots of replayability.  At some point I'll probably do the Imperator Augustus campaign that comes with it for free as well.  If you can get this game on sale, got it for 12 dollars, it's a no brainer.  The issues of the past are gone and it is better than Shogun 2 in my opinion. As a bonus, it has got me into history more.  Specifically Roman history.There are issues, but if you can pick this up for 15 dollars or less it's a no brainer.			"

												I have played Medieval II, Shogun II, and Rome II for over 100 hours each at least. Each game is spectacular. Rome II is spectacular. The team has once again done a wonderful job recreating the era to give a real immersive feel to it. Each game has slightly different mechanics, and those are personal preference. Rome II for example has you recruit soldiers through generals instead of settlments. But after 2-3 hours of learning any Total War game you feel right at home. My favourite part of Rome II is how they added so many factions to the map. This creates a unique play-through every time you start a new game. The downside to me though is that not enough of these factions are playable. Considering how many factions are around at the start of the game it does feel a bit like you are getting ripped off when you see the small amount of factions you can choose to play. However this is only my real critcism of the game. Along with that the only other thing I would change is bringing back the family tree aspect, from Medieval II. I give this game a 4.4/5The reason for that score is because it's nearly a perfect game, but the lack of factions loses it a half point, and the tiny wish that the family tree was reintroduced loses it 0.1. Of the 3 Total War games I have played, I put this one behind Medieval II, and ahead of Shogun II.			"

												Though this games launch was absoulutely attrocious, the emperor edition fixes the majority of the problems. Though many problems are still prevalent which of course can be fixed with a few good mods. I have put in a good 200 hours into this game and I greatly reccomend this product.Pro's-Runs like a dream.-Looks beautiful.-Multiplayer battles are extremely intense.-Great modding community.-Great setting (Nothing feels as good as sacking Rome).-Campaign is one of the best (A proper working Auto-Resolve button).Con's-Unit rosters are a bit lacking (Mods fix this).-The Campaigns mid to late game becomes way too easy.-Town battles (Auto-Resolving fixes this).-Generals die like flies (4 turns per year mod fixes this).  -DLC Market is attrocious (You have to pay for Blood&Gore!!!)

												I can say this, if my hours don't convince you the game has some merit, at least think about this. For all the floors of the game, it was CA's first return to the total war franchise after the two straight recoveries of napolean and Shogun. Shogun being a really damn good game and napolean being a much better version of empire. Essentially here though, just look into mods for this, like darthmod or radious. Get those and the game runs amazingly. Modding is the rebirth of Rome 2 and it's how i actually began to enjoy the damn game.			"

												Rome II is by far the worst total war game in the series. Creative Assembly claims it had a 40% bigger budget for their latest game Rome II, meanwhile  I'm dumbfounded as to where that money was allocated.On second thought, No.  That money was clearly spent on false advertising; they promised us working seige battles and a full year and then some of patching and I still can't play this interactive movie for more then 30 minutes (just enough time to finally hit my first actual battle due to ridiculous loading times.) Once I reach battle it all comes back to me... the reason why I left in th first place. No ammount of modding or patching can make this a game. If I could give this game a score less then 0 I would because on every single level of gameplayablity they simply dropped the ball. If you wanted a game where you have to auto resolve all battles just to get through the game with a shred of sanity then you should buy crusader kings 2 or something (anything) else. What else can I say about this waste of time and money these people call a game. Well the music was claimed to be orchestrally epic and what did we get? Some interns and a lute, at least that's what it sounds like to me. This along with the voice acting or lack thereof. they shortened general speeches to about a 10 second coomment which you will miss every time. The graphics, ugh. This is the one place that could have given the game a score of 1 in my eyes, but even this part was just too complex for these teenage flash programmers. The videos they showed up had fake antialiasing which never showed up in the game and with every patch those idiots at CA claim they optimize their dung of a game, when they simply lower the graphics LOD (level of detail.) As of now the game looks worse then shogun 2 their subsequent total war game, even with mods. CA broke my heart releasing this ""game"" and I'm never giving them another penny in this lifetime at least... If I can save at least one poor fool from making this mistake, I'd be hella satisfied.

I think it makes the game what it should be (or at least as close as they could get it) and it gives a hell of a lot new factions. Not stupid DLCs.If you're coming here from Medieval II and before, don't even bother trying vanilla, go straight to DEI. Oh and also the RTW music mod for some real quality music. ;)			"

												Rome II ReviewNow where to start. I suppose from the beginning like most stories start. The game was brilliant, couldn’t go wrong. Though many people have complained about it in the past I can only find the odd few things.The advisor is horrid and deserves to be killed but oh well, we all get over him at some point, mainly when we turn him off but that's just me. “This is a shameful display!” that's to you advisor.The graphics are also horrid in comparison to Attila Total War and the FPS are terrible. They really need to be improved.CA really needs to start adding blood and gore to the basic price and stop money grabbing, three weeks and three DLC’s with every game now, seriously, stop or do it more subtly like GTA and and Assassins Creed do.The campaign map is good, you can control your family tree through adoption / marriage / assassination  / and securing loyalty , make allies, client states / satrapies and even rename settlements! You get much more free reign over your armies. The graphics are really best here and depending on which campaign you want you get a large or small map. The DLC’s provide smaller maps but have more cities in and smaller provinces so you don’t do it all to quickly. The Grand Campaign has the biggest map and is probably the biggest in Total War history.The modding community is great, I have a few on my friends list and they certainly help out. You will also find them great people to work with if you make guides like I do. Though they can be busy they also make personal request mods (some do not all) and the grand overhaul mods would certainly help out those in a rut.The battles are great but not as good as Attila, prepare for war as you face off against the ever expanding factions that you never heard off before or should die out early on but never do. Or perhaps face off against your enemies as Rome and destroy Carthage which is defeated early on due to Africans and Spanish… Well at least you can be Egypt… And get crushed by the Seleucid Empire… Or Parthia and experiences Horse archers and massively underpowered Cataphracts… Hey at least we have Britain’s Iceni tribe that gets invaded twenty four seven by its much stronger and superior other British tribes… Perhaps just stick with Sparta and be limited on what you can select as the cappo for certain units is ridiculously small. Argh screw it.Well don’t worry as all these problems can easily be overlooked as you change to Attila or quit Total War in anger, either way you will find Rome II an interesting buy that will either make you hate yourself and CA or the happiest man in Brooklyn. For those who don’t know Brooklyn is that place in America where people often try to avoid.			"

												If you've ever enjoyed a Total War game this title ISN'T for you. it's garbage released as beyond garbage and now that it's almost playable (though not in a single player campaign which is infact the primary point of the game) they've tried to con you with a 50% off sticker. The launch 'bugs' are everywhere just do a google. while they glossed over a few of the glaring flaws they forgot to entirely redo the campaign mechanics to even a standard of any of the last games. Perhaps they were looking to introduce groundbreaking new alternative mechanics? nope... just stripped it down and sold it under the tag line ""more money than we've ever thrown at a total war title"". Playing small tactical skirmish battles with friends is an option (not the AI as even 6 months after release it still just runs into a river and dances in circles) but will only entertain you for as long as throwing a ball against a wall.Day 0 DLC that chopped out one of the top 3 nations while they pretend it's 'utilising the art devs' which actually just boils down to bad time management where the art devs should have been working on cloneable mechanic units (such as they were but pretending it was a different project) during the closing phases and dealing with balance parses as they needed to under the waving day 0 DLC badge.It's worth noting: a few of the mods may save the single player experience for some players but I can't agree fjust yet given their current state of development.

												i would recommend this game for 15 euro but not for the full pricethe developers need NOT to ignore the AI, Empire Total War was a failure exactly because of this+ graphics: in strategic games this is a secondary matter thou+ style: it feels almost right as an Rome: Total War title+ battle AI: accaptable - dominium state's AI: instead of defending their territory they often prefer to wander- militaristic AI: stupid; only when playing the campaign at hardcore enemy armies are capable and by that the battles are fun- diplomatic AI: slightly improved Empire Total War one, less annoying but still;almost a random war generator; blindly aggressive against the player;an annoying state in a coalition of states due to their combine strength count attacks,but other states of this alliance completely ignore the call to arms, without consequences;high possibilities of hate loops; very low chance to improve damaged relationsOriginally posted by someone in Steam Store:scalable experience regardless your rigCitating CA: We had +40% more budgetAI dev said: ""We never invested more into AI development""CA promised ""sieges battles of immersive scale"" "

												I came from this game as a sort of noob of the franchise, when i say noob, i played Napoleon Total War, i thought it was good, good UI, a nice setting, alot of units for the major factions, so I was pretty eccited for Rome 2, due to its trailers and its overall sense that CA was going to do something very good and groundbreaking, a sequal to its most beloved game, and that they woudl do a good job,I was wrong, I was very wrong, while I did not play the original, or Medieval(hense me saying that i am a sort of Noob) i could tell that this game sucked, it's UI terrible, its AI beyond bad, its Units unimaginative, its so called new Naval aspects: was so porrly done that I barely used it( a full naval squadron, highly paid PROFESSIONAL NAVAL TROOPS, could be anihalted by a transport fleet of mobs) the cities unimaginative, the Generals near useless, the Political system non-sensecall, the diplomacy confusing and entirely luck based(at least for me), Yet the worst part for me was the units, THE UNITS, this hasn't been truly touched on by some reviewers(at least to my knowledge). The only factions that they put effort into was Rome, the Selucids, Carthage maybe, Parthia, and thats about it. The barbarian factions, the Iceni, Arverni, Suebi, were identical to every other faction they bordered, even their high tier troops, so that when you reach late game, a random tribe that played no historical importance becomes ruler of Germany, Gaul, Britania, etc.  They didn't add Arverni troops that dual wiedled battleaxes(as badass as that would be) or cool eastern Parthian infantry, like dismounted Parthian cav, or master swords men, or ANYTHING THAT WOULD MAKE EVERY FACTION INTERESTING OR BALANCED. But that not a problem, the AI's so dumb that in every one of my non Rome playthoughs, Rome barely expanded past Italy at all.All-in-all, this game is a poor exuse for a game, a sad addition to a good franshice, and a game that just made everyone who bought it regret it			"

												Rome II has come a very long way since the atrocious release and is polished to a glorious sheen. The mechanics and visuals are wonderful and feel just right. This game has endless replayability with a broad range of factions, each with a unique specificity. The campaign is wonderfully done and endlessly fun, even if the diplomacy is lacking. The custom and multiplayer battles keep the game enjoyable, even after 100+ hours. Although I would wait until a sale to aquire the gratuitous amount of DLC, this is my favorite Total War game by far.			"

												The game itself is solid although heavily simplified since earlier Total War titles. This results in battles being usually being over in 5 minutes or less and the campaign basically won after 20 or 30 turns when your empire has become so big that you can fight on multiple fronts without danger of losing.What really makes it impossible to recommend this game is the relentless moneygrabbing strategy SEGA pursues with it's DLC choices many of which simply unlock factions that are already in the game or add a few (mostly uninteresting units at a time). The real killer is the blood and gore DLC which adds an option to the game that should be available to anyone who has shelled out for an expensive full price game from the start. The next step will be restricting the higher resolutions or holding other graphical options hostage until the  idiots  customers pay extra for them.I can only recommend this game in some kind of big, heavily discounted, bundle and even then I think there are better ways to spend your time and money.

												This game gets a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I like it. Playing as Rome you are a power house from the get go. Literaly your men are the only guys in the civilised world who seem to not use spears. The Greeks even use spears for cutting their food. The game is essentialy you murdering your way to respect. Then you have to murder your way through Hate. Finally you murder your self right to victory. The only issue then is that if you loot 1 city you have at least 10 slave revolts in each city. The slaves also seem to be more experienced than the soldiers who took over their lands and the rest of the bloody world. Doesnt matter though because Legionaries can kill absolutely anything. I wont settle for all your male population I will kill Ra the sun God to.1. Hear loads of♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game2. Play the game with low expectations 3. Pleasently suprised4. be Rome 5. Take over most of the world6. Get Legions7. beat entire stack of enemy levy with 1 vet Legion squad 8. Have endless slave revolts. Kill more slave then the amount of prisoners you captured 9. get confused10. desire more realistic experience11. divide et impera12. play as Rome13.

Havent seen a single graphic bugg whatsoever. Total War ROME 2 it's just a deep beatiful strategy game like every other game of the total war series! Don't be fooled by the bad review couse it has some imperfection but it's only the performance that need to be improved and some Ai adjustement nothing more!

												Please for the love of god do not buy this game. It depresses me to think how hyped I was for the release, of the sequal to one (in my opinoin) the best games ever made. Sadly CA did not deliver, at all. Even after how disapointed I was initally, I thought to myself, 'Oh come on, I have to give it a good solid shot..'. So I did, 60+ Hours later I feel EMBARRASSED to be a Total War fan, I feel bad recommending the game to my friends because we couldn't even complete a single online match because of all the desyncs. All the tech demos, pre alpha gameplay IS NOT IN THE FULL GAME, please do not be mislead by the Carthage Demo that was uploaded back in 2012. The game looks NOTHING like that, and the scale is nowhere near that large, with less than half the amount of units and ships present in the real game. The graphics are NOTHING like what you expect from the screenshots, and frankly, I can't believe it's legal even having them on the steam store page, because they are COMPLETELY MISLEADING. Please invest your money into Europa Universalis IV, or Crusader Kings II. Games which are developed by are far more competent studio, and will offer you 100's of hours of entertainment. A fraction of the price of Rome II, if you grab them in a sale. "

I much prefered older total war titles!!Specifically: the game lags badly even on lower graphics settings (I have a brand new 2500 laptop with 12GB ram, i7 4800MQ @3.2GHz processor so that should not be happening), the loading screens for the battles take minutes as opposed to seconds for older total war titles, the army/commander/specialist unit management has badly designed interface and needlessly complicates things, and aside from the new province managment (which I did enjoy) there was nothing new and interesting enough to make up for all the problems listed above.

												I've been a long time Total War fan since the Original Rome back in 2003 I think.This game was hyped up, and I was keenly awaiting its release back in September thinking that this would be the best Total War to date. Alas, i was mistaken. It's been 8 months into its release, and is no where near being a finished product. The politics is terribleThe AI doesn't work in Siege or sea assault battles. There is still a massive fps/lag when units engage in combat.The AI difficulty on campaign is done by handicapping the player and giving the AI bonuses rather than a more superior AI to fight against. Diplomacy is beyond dull, and pointless.Have to play the game with mods to get any decent game time out of it, then as soon as I hit a siege, I get bored and quit as the ladders take 15 minutes to reach the walls, and then the AI decides to throw flaming twigs at the gates. I don't know what design decsions were made, but it's safe to say that prmary school children (<10) could have come up with better ideas.I haven't purchased any of the DLC since there is no point what with critical gaming elements broken or missing, and the fact that most of the DLC should be included in the game as standard!This is the last Total War game I shall ever get unless by some miracle the next one is outstanding.You will also notice from any of the promotional videos that CA have never done a battle defending in a city against the AI since the AI is completely broken.CA shipped an unfinished game which should have been advertised as ""early access alpha"" rather than a finished product. In summary, do not purchase this game unless you are just going to play multiplayer battles against real people.  "

Good Job CA you deserve all the praise you can get. It's not perfect, and it's not my favorite title in the series, But you've made it right by me, and as someone who preordered, defended its launch, then got fed up and bashed-- I can only praise the fact that you did not leave it in the state it was in and jumped through hoops to make it right as you could.I think at the very least we can simply forgive the past, and play the game. Just please don't do it again, boys.Is this game the best in the series? No.Is this game better than the original ROME? as far as I'm concerned they can't even be compared.Is this game perfect? No.Is it fun? yesDo I recommend it as a TW-veteran that's played these games since my age only had one-digit? Yes, Yes I do.I still say it's geared to the more casual-player, but honestly thats a really hard position to defend. If you like Total War you will get good gameplay out of this. If you've never played total war this is a good one to start with in my opinion.			"

												Update: (07/05/2014) So I decided to re-install the game after my initial review (About five months ago and about 8 months after release) And what do you know! I can finally play it, from not even being able to play on the lowest graphic settings to being able to max everything out, God knows why it took this long? I still can't reccommend the game however, as the AI is still pretty pathetic and I still feel as if I have wasted my money, but at least I can play now :) **********************************************Pre-ordered this game, couldn't wait to play it. Useually I don't jump on the whole ""Whaa my game doesn't work properly, this is  awful."" Band wagon, but 3 months in and I still can't even play it! It's been on sale before It's even been fixed, which makes me really feel like I've wasted my money! If you ask me, this is worse than the SIm City launch, at least they sorted that out in a week... And the blood and gore dlc.. Are you serious? That's on par with the horse armour of Oblivion!Call me a whiny ♥♥♥♥♥ whatever.. I've waited patiently for them to get this game playable for me, but with no avail. Avoid this garbage, unless you know for sure it will run on your set-up.			"

												Being a huge Total War fan in the past I was excited to see this release. I pre-ordered for the first time on steam which I usually don't do for big titles.I regret it. I could go on for quite a while about it but will summarize;If you enjoy shiny graphics and winning handily at games this is for you. Even on hard difficulties the game become easy after 30 turns or so. If your like myself and enjoy a challenge in your strategy games, or better yet, want your strategies and diplomatic decisions to matter then please at least research some other more in depth reviews before paying the hefty pricetag attatched to this title.Disappointed.

Posted: April 2, 2014
												Just a sad, sad entrant to the Total War series.  This is probably the most dissapointing title I have played in the last twenty years.  This is the product of a once passionate and aspirational studio which has now sunk under it's own weight of success and has lost all perspective on what makes a game work at it's core.  At launch the game was simply utterly broken.  The tutorials didn't work, the end turns took minutes, the graphics didn't work, the lag and stutter was incredible, the AI was non-existent, the mechanics weren't thought through.  What's more, CA added some awful features (random capture points on the battlefield, magic spells and 1 turn per year anyone?) and removed many staples of the series that made the game so great (seasons, family tree, map trading).  Eight full months on, some of this has been amended but the game today is still a shell of a TW title and doesn't really cut the mustard.  Seasons have finally been introduced and the game has been optimised so that it actually runs properly but it's just not enough to overcome all of the weaknesses of Rome 2.  Siege battles are absolutely redundant, the AI is simply non-functioning.  Unit rosters are limited and generic, unit formations do not work properly and battlefield ai remains poor.  Naval battles are a joke and sieges are an embarassment.  The portraits in the game look abysmal.  Because the number of armies is restricted and troops are so easy to afford, every army on the map will be a full stack, which is stupid.  Public order and slaves are game systems that do not work properly and detract from the game.  Generals and agents die far too quickly.  Terrain has no effect in battle (ie archers will have the same range from the bottom of a hill as at the top).  Armies can magically cross oceans without the need for building boats.  The time it takes armies/navies to traverse the map is stupid (4 years to sail around Italy etc).  You can't build walls or roads to improve a settlement.  You can't control public order in your settlemets unless you own the entire province, which makes no sense.  The civil war is a poorly executed idea which is unrealistic and stupid (armies just spawn out of nowhere in their thouands).  The politics system is just tacked on as an afterthought, it's barely worth being there.  The technology research is uninspiring and boring.  The traits system for armies/generals is similarly unexciting and tedious.  The game engine itself doesn't seem to be able to handle the simulation of armed combat (which is a bit of a problem).  All in all, this is an absolute trainwreck of a game where the developers obviously looked back over the elements of the TW series that made the games so successful and then decided to jettison anything that was worth a damn and replace it with the worst features they could imagine.  There is no hope this game will ever be in a decent state and meanwhile CA pump out the DLCs to be lapped up by devoted fanboys digging the grave of PC gaming by accepting a game made with such low standards.

It's a very good  strategy game,  worthy it's Rome Total War title.

												I have no doubt that Creative will continue to release patches and will eventually iron out all of the bugs with this game, but I fear it may need more than that to make it enjoyable.This Total War game looked as though it would be the ultimate game in the series. The original Rome was considered by many to be one of the best and after so many promising gameplay videos, why would we even question if this would be better?It's just NOT fun. The battles have been improved and there is still a bit to them if you play them in slow motion, but the appeal has gone. I don't know how to describe it- it's as if the units are smaller on-screen. Play the original Rome and they're larger than life. You can see every single spear and unit as if they're a person. I simply don't have the interest in them in Rome 2. The units tend to blend together. You don't spot a certain type of archer unit from across the battlefield and feel excitement or fear. They're just another unit that needs to be slaughtered. Maybe this is just me, it's lost what made the earlier games feel so unique.However, the campaign screen is unquestionably worse. I see what they've tried to do with the changes but they simply don't make the game more fun. They've added more depth to the boring bits and have sapped the fun from the others. Whilst in earlier games I'd buy a new building that would give me new units to play with, or have a noticable impact shortly afterwards, this game is so slow-paced I can't be bothered with it. I have completed Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2 so please don't accuse me of having a short attention span. It simply isn't long enough for this game.While before I would make large decisions, like which factions to attack and where to position my armies, I find most of my time in Rome 2 is taken up with pathetic trivialities. Do I want my spies to have +5% success in deviousness or man-smelling? (Okay, not proper topics, but probably more interesting than what you actually get to choose). I DON'T CARE any more. It's as if there are so many variables you can't see the big picture any more. Give me the old Medieval Total War system of having more command stars = better general, or 'buy this and you get a larger castle!', not 'wait for population to gradually reach this and then have enough food to get a town that will be slightly bigger but not big enough to justify the time or money spent getting it there'.The game is too deep and too complex. While before I would invade India, France or Italy, I'm now too busy trying to take over Cornwall. If I don't play each battle separately I'll lose and it takes so much time to get one step ahead that I've been distracted by another game on my computer that offers a far faster and more exhilarating thrill than the hours invested in this game can achieve. I thought I'd be excited about the changes and cinematic graphics. Instead I'm sick and tired of upgrading minor, pointless units.And yet, I will continue to try this game. Even if I can only stand playing it for an hour at a time, I'll chip into it and hope that, hidden amongst the rubbish are gems of fun to be had from it. I still can't believe how far they've fallen from the incremental but positive steps taken in the previous games. Shame on you, Creative. Now, give me the new patch and I'll give it another go. Again.			"

												I feel like a battered housewife.This makes the fifth weekend I've tried to love Rome II. These weekends have interpolated twelve patch cycles, eight months, two console releases, a government shutdown, a winter olympics, a plane disappearance, and — of course — this review itself. I wanted to succeed. After a decade of storming châteaux forts, firing by line, and charging samurai uphill against spearwalls, I wanted to return to the legionary maniple. But I couldn't love Rome II.Am I being melodramatic? Well, okay, I'm being melodramatic.Bugs don't factor into the equation. This game is just poorly designed. Political, economic, and military concerns don't relate properly, the first being especially loosely coupled. The lifespan of characters has dramatically decreased while the level of management characters require has doubled. The campaign copies the CKII civil war system and Civ V victory system without apparent understanding of what made those systems work in their games. And battle movement and killing speeds have accelerated to the point where tactics — and more importantly, tension — are virtually impossible.I won't waste my time detailing the many sins of this game.

Odi"" episode does that, as does Reynold Sanity's ""Why Rome 2 Failed"" series, if you prefer a brasher, more offensive, and (for those who dislike the game) more cathartic approach.Rome 2 has spectacle, and that's why many people love it. If you're here for strategy, this game is leagues below Shogun 2.			"

												Firstly, I will establish that i have been a long term customer and fan of the Total War branch since the beginning of time and really wanted to love this game. Con: It's really incredible that not only did this company push away alot of its mainstream consumers but also angered much of its Die Hard fans. I mean, it took so long just to make this game playable POST RELEASE. For its premium pricing it is obviously a unacceptable display. (bugs, glitches, freezes etc) Pro: That being said at least they bothered to manage to save the game and bring back some consumers. Con: Secondly, i was told Rome 2 would have a 40 percent budget increase on top of the Financial backing of a huge company yet they spent way too much money on graphics and half the kingdoms look like they are are going to a pyjamas party. They should of focused on cultural diversity so everything looks alien and rich in culture from lusitani to iceni to Parthia. Or how about inhancing the trade system, internal polticial system and diplomacy system? It's amazing that indie companies can absolutely whipe this franchise clean from quantity to quality of content. Yet Total War can not? how about taking the time to bring that into play via your expansions? no? well clearly they have not!Pro: I really enjoyed how building/ improving the city effects the expansion of the city on the map mode and also how that is interconnected to the difference's in cultures. That was something really great that CA did.   Con: When Rome 1 Came out they had a option to actually visit your city and go into it, i clearly expected them to bring this into fruition and capitalise on the city builder Sims/ Cities kind of feel to target a grandure target market but not only did they not do this they removed the city visitor option all together so that we can no longer are rewarded with beautiful visual displays enjoying our incredible city from within. Pro: Without a doubt the Battle system is Great adding more variaty with army legacy names give us a personal sence of belonging and meaning to the armies we use. The in depth battle system is what saves this franchise. Con: I have to say that Sega has been suffering as a company for good reason it's apparent that profit has become the main goal and mentality/values of its company instead of having a pro fan, and pro accurate History loving values/ employees within CA, they are making the same mistake as Rome and will fall just as Rome. I know it might be a tough review but your consumers only mean well and want to see this game and company become the best it can be so that we can throw more money at you guys! Hopefully Sega will learn from its mistake.			"

												This game is an EPIC fail . Napoleon Total war is what got me into the franchise because of the era . Shogun II and FoTs were decent products even though there were 1 billion DLCs for them . I didn't buy this game,but won it from a tournament - still I wish I didn't(Rome II) . It was a pure waste of time even though I had sometimes fun when playing with friends and trolling on online battles . I enjoyed playing campaigns but it is just not enough . Also so many factions are missing - this means that there will be around 20 DLCs for this game . The campaign now is kinda ...good...but BORING . In my opinion there is not enough big variety of units in the game . Battles are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too ♥♥♥♥ing fast , even in shogun II they did not finish their fights for 20 seconds ... WTF ,CA? Terrain doesn't matter that much at all and this reminds me of the long games on Napoleon where you actually had to be ♥♥♥♥ing careful . Even in shogun II thanks to the units with muskets and the bow cav the games could be longer . Rome I and Medieval II's online battles were decent and fun . In my opinion Napoleon total war is the most balanced game in the aspect of online battles . I will give you an example - http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/487812320661884097/EFBF821C573C5256897E22B3965E8124DEBAD948/   . For those who don't know - UK is the strongest nation at shooting in the game . I rushed , even kited when needed ,pushed on one of the flanks,then ran back and let my friend to make the final blow . The game was more than 30 minutes and our opponents were very good and it was all pure fun . As you can see I am using Austria which is one of the worst nations at shooting,their skirmishers are weak,their infantry is no match in melee,even in shooting vs the UK ones. The only thing I have that is better are the Ulans . Even though as you can see - if you think you can beat your opponent no matter what factions you are using . And can you do that in Rome II ? You simply CANNOT unless you are facing a brand new guy who doesn't know what people ''usually'' bring . What the ♥♥♥♥ , CA? Are you serious ? Why did you even release this game - why don't you 'freeze' it until you ♥♥♥♥ing fix it ? Better don't waste your money on this crap and play the other titles (except Empire which is still broken as ♥♥♥♥ :D) and have fun . Oh ,wait a minute ... I forgot ....CA WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ HAPPENED WITH THE SOUNDTRACKS? They were so epic in Rome I , M2 and Shogun II ... NTW and ETW didn't have the need of those because the muskets were some kind of a music ... But ,seriously ,when I listen to these soundtracks I get even more bored except 1 or 2 ... I can listen to the Rome I soundtracks all day anyday . G ♥♥♥♥ing G CA ,you failed,I hope that you will fix this ''game'' if we can call it a game soon enough . This is just ... unacceptable .			"

												Let me say first of all that I'm not a TW newbie! I played for example nearly 3,500 hours Empire, 1,000 Napoleon and several thousand hours MTW.1 and RTW-1, so I think I have enough experience to make a review of a TW game and my son (9) and me are both fans. I for myself retired from public gaming so far out of several reasons which killed playing time. But my son wished to have RTW-2 too and so I bought him for his 9th birthday. To be honest, I played serevel turn in campaign, several single battles and tried to enter a multiplayer game (but failed) and my conclusion for this game is not good!Sure, many gadgets and things now in game which were wished by mass of TW players to have ... and which I want to have in other TW games too, but the design, the graphics and the game display with menue etc. is very annoying and bad. To say it clear, scrolling down to units in Empire and even in RTW-1 made fun, but here at RTW-2 the single soldiers are looking awfull bad in comparison. The problems started still with installation and only after 2 weeks after game was bought it run ... with much help of Sega support which was very helpful ... more helpful as tipps given by community in some forums.However, RTW.2 will be played by my son and maybe some Mods will be installed which will for sure improve the game so far, but for me is Empire and RTW-1 the favorite game of the series.

												""The Increasingly Poor Creative Decisions of Creative Assembly"". The series has lost all the atmosphere and quirkiness that once made TW great. Remember in Rome I when you could load up the cities you owned to see civilians going about their business, among buildings you built? Can't do that anymore. (even though Rome I came out in 2004). Remember how in Medieval II, when you parked a character in a city with a brothel and he became increasingly debauched? That doesn't happen any more; you instead have tedious, repetitive skill trees, and the characters die off before they're any use. Remember the pathetic sea battles in Shogun II between vessels that were floating arrow-carts? Those have been retained. Remember the over-elaborate and glitchy campaign map, which needlessly strained even decent rigs? Yep, they've kept that too. This game is a car crash.			"

												Firstly, let's get this out the way. Whatever way you look at it, Rome 2 is a disappointment. From the farcical siege battles reminiscent of a mexican stand-off, to the bugged out textures, terrrible performance and awful battle mechanics, Rome 2 really pushes the boat out when it comes to how much a game can be screwed up. To put this in perspective, I have accumulated over 200 hours on Rome 2. During that time I had been forced to restart a Rome Campaign 7 times due to ""post release game patching"". At least 3/4 of my total game time has been campaign restarts, testing bugs, testing performance and most recently, attempting to create a series of videos with a friend that show up all the broken battle mechanics that limit the game so much....basically, I have spent most of my time trying to get this game to function and trying to squeeze blood from the proverbial stone in trying to eek out a sense of enjoyment in this title.Of course, all this would be acceptable if there were any form of communication from CA, or any intents to fix these problems. Unforunately anybody who highlights these issues is removed from the main forums and treated like dirt.Customers unite, do not buy CA's next title. Certainly do not preorder it. They have no intention of fixing Rome 2 up to an acceptable standard and any attempt to establish communication on the subject results in a banhammer on the main forum.It is about time that we as customers said ""No, this is not OK. You cannot release a product under false pretenses then proceed to silence the critics"".It is truly amazing that they would have time to release DLC's like CiG but still have the audacity to refuse to fix the main game properly. DO NOT BUY. AVOID. IT IS THE PLAGUE.Normally I would recommend Shogun 2 to anybody who wanted to try a polished CA product, but right now I am rather angry at the company for the way I have been treat personally recently (hence the decision to actually review this game)Yours sincerely, A bitter CA customer.

												Rome 2- Emperor Edition update - All patches up toI have not touched this game since last year, now being october 2014 i thought i'd reinstall it (BTW that came with alot of issues - but i got it to work)The emporer edition to the game is a good idea, i like the new factions and the story behind them being interested in the time period myself.So anyway since Rome 2's early days, alot has been improved. The AI is starting to think for itself and SOMETIMES picks a good army to field (infantry instead of 18 units of missile/cavalry archers) As we all know how annoying that can be.Siege AI is much better an can effectivley assault a garrison as much as you'd expect from a computer player, having said that it could be improved, especially when defending. When they defend, they are still not going to the right areas (capture areas)The campaign AI is better, but still appears to be lost...by this i mean randomly appearing to attack then leaves without even a shoe thrown. Diplomacy is still a disgrace, they'll pretty much reject everything until your rich or have alot of military allies.Don't even get me started on agents - CA, they are the dumbest thing you've ever done, seriously. I understand spying and such, but when your capital is surrounded by like 9 spies.... it's to the point where you can't raise an army in that city of fear he'll be assassinated during your end turn!The new politics system however is a much needed improvment on the old and i do quite like it, now just to bring back family trees and other roman factions on the gran campaign like in Rome 1? So moving on...Tactics by the AI... I'll keep this short and sweet, there's alot more of this on other posts i guess.1. I find it extremely annoying when fighting an enemy still... if they have a good stack of infantry, they won't double up to keep reserves, they'll use the entire battlefield to position one battle line.2. WHY DOES THE AI STILL RUN A MILE INTO BATTLE!!!??3. Flanking is still 50-50...AI only does it on occasions that i've noticed.4. Testudo doesn't work still - Roman AI won't use it approaching walls.I was never good and paragraphing in college so it's probably a literacy mess up there. ^^Having said all that.I do like the new edition with it's new factions and improved bits but i think CA wasted their time with DLC'S and add ons and given us a polished turd...a runny one at that, rather than really focusing on the real issues here.Yes i know they keep releasing patches...but seriously how long can they keep this up before admitting it's a disgrace...oh and what number patch are we even on now? ;)It seems they released a game 2 years before it's time and tried to sweeten us up with the extras...Overall verdict by me, a customer among thousands i'm sure.Game release - 1/5TO date release - 2/5Quick side note *** Reinstalled it to see if anything changed (March 2015) ---- you guessed it...not much if anything, i can't recall seeing another update patch. But anyway if you do decide to read this and give Rome a shot, make sure you look around on the community mods workshop - just discovering them myself properly (They are fantastic) CA should employ these guys instead of the $40k a year ""experts"" ***			"

Posted: February 10, 2016
												Total War™: Rome II - Emperor Edition is a historical turn based RTS game based in.. Ancient Rome. I thoroughly enjoy playing this game, and perhaps this review will persuade you to try it out and, hopefully, enjoy it. Rome II is a sequel to the famous Rome: Total War game. It's a part of one of the largest historical strategy game franchises to date. Total War games are similar to the classic board games Risk and Axis and Allies. So if you enjoy playing those games you should feel right at home here. It is true that as of late the Total War franchise has the infamous reputation of rushed releases. However, I find that this game, after over two years of being out, has come a long way. It may still not be what people expected at release, but it's definitely come a long way.There are mainly two parts of this game, the Grand Campaign and the multiplayer. The Grand Campaign lets you play as multiple types of factions ranging from Rome to barbarian to all sorts of others. Each faction has unique units that all have their strongpoints and weaknesses. When you start off you can come from a small state with a handful of soldiers, to domination of the ancient world. As you make your way from the bottom to the top, you'll have to deal with foreign threats. These threats can range from other nations declaring war on yours all the way to widespread hunger across entire provinces.A Grand Campaign completed game can last from a couple of days (Speedrunners) to months of hard work and effort. So you should be able to get a large amount of playtime out of this game, if you like it. Grand Campaign playthroughs may or may not get repetitive based on what you classify as repetitive. In my honest opinion the Campaign can have very rich gameplay that does not involve doing the same boring task over and over. The battles against the AI can become a bit repetitive, but that's only if you exploit their dumb nature.The AI in this game is by no means the best out there. But it's definitely improved from the release. The AI can sometimes be incredibly smart and display great ingenuity, but they have a bad habit of running headlong into a pike phalanx. Not to mention misusing artillery, chariots, and elephants on mroe than one occassion. This doesn't mean the Campaign can't be fun against just AI, it's incredibly fun for me at least, especially on Very Hard or Legendary modes.The multiplayer. In my eyes this is where Rome II truly shines. The multiplayer is where you can go onto servers or create your own, where you can battle other players with factions of your choosing. This can range from 1v1s all the way up to 4v4s. Connection issues is a common problem among multiplayer games, considering you're playing with people from all around the world. However, the sheer amount of units you can have on one single battlefield when you have multiple factions going against eachother is insane. This can definitely cause major lag and a lot of times people ragequit when it's so bad everythings in slowmotion or the framerate is below 15.Like I said earlier, each faction has their own unique set of units for their choosing. This makes for very dynamic gameplay especially in multiplayer. No faction is the same. Granted there are very similar factions but they still have their unique ups and downs. With these in mind, you can choose from dozens of factions to find your right playstyle. If it's tanky sword infantry that can still pack a punch, you're in it with Rome. If you like to cripple people with charges, you can go with barbarians or cav heavy factions. If you like to use pikemen to protect valuable skirmishers to pick at enemies from a distance, then you can go greek factions. These are just a handful of examples of how dynamic the multiplayer battle gameplay can be.You can also play multiplayer campaigns. This goes for quite the interesting time. Play with your friends as allies or enemies. Multiplayer campaigns can be a lot of fun if you can get your friends to play with you, random people joining isn't really recommended as you probably couldn't play an entire campaign playthrough in one session. One of the biggest problems I have with the multiplayer campaign is the fact that when the other players turn cames around you just have to sit there. For 5 to 10 minutes you just sit there doing absolutely nothing. You can use this time to your advantage by trying to help your friend out with what you two should plan with the help of your trusty paintbrushes, but normally you just sit there. Like a lot of multiplayer games, voicechatting can really help. It might also help make the time it takes for the other player to play his turn go by with a bit more excitement.This game has a serious learning curve to it. So if you really want to get into this game and know how to counter things with the right tools, then it may take you a lot of playtime and a lot of watching videos. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those of you who like to just sit down right away after getting a game and then being good at it in the first 10 hours, then you may be out of luck here. In my opinion the large learning curve just makes for more time to enjoy this game. The battles. The battles are probably one of the main reasons why you're looking into this game. With thousands of soldiers at your command you can fight equal amounts, smaller amounts, or overwhelming larger amounts of enemy troops in a dynamic game of intense strategy and timing. You'll have to move your troops around to effectively counter the troops they have in a certain place, make sure you have backups, move those backups in when necessary, and strike at the most opportune moments. Learning all of the stats of every unit is a big help. Knowing the stats will greatly benefit what you know will kill and what you know will not kill an enemy unit with the smallest amount of casualties on your end. You can see why there's such a large learning curve now.Overall this game is relatively well optimized, for my PC the game runs into a bit of trouble when there are 6,000+ units on the battlefield at once. But to be honest, that much is to be expected. At max graphics I can get a steady 50 FPS in normal battles. On the campaign map I get lower frames, around the 30s or so. So if you want solid frames all around, go with a lower graphical setting and you should be fine.This game is very fun, and I recommend it to you as well. Especially if you're a Strategy game fan.To Me: 9/10 I love itTo Strategy fans: 9/10 Definitely look into itTo Average gamer: 8/10 This game is a lot of fun!			"

												Just no strategy required at all.I've been playing the Total War series of games since the original Shogun, I've played them all and never had a problem playing one til Rome 2; the problem comes from armies, their compositions and their tactics. Now forgetting how worthless this game was on release, I've tried to come back to this game every so many patches to see whats changed, if its better, ect. Everytime I'm bored past caring before even a 1/5 the world is conquered and I forget the game exists and go back to the previous TW's. So what's the main problem? Basically army composition is meaningless. In Shogun 2 if you made a army of a general and 19 katana samurai you'd be screwed, In Napoleon if you went general and 19 line infantry you'd be screwed, In Medieval if you went general and 19 knights you'd be screwed. Here if you go general + 19 of the heaviest melee troops you got with shields its a perfectly legitmate strategy basically only counted by another army of nothing but ultra heavy melee. Every Rome game I play it just devolves into me just raising a army, building 19 legionaries and just sending them tword the nearest town. There is zero need to have any seige, auxiliary units, ranged units, ect. Because of this tactics is also meaningless, you assign each of your 19 legionaries to each one of their units and 2 possible things occur, 1. the unit is to fast to be engaged so it's probably a ranged unit in which case who cares; they'll run out of ammo before they kill even 10% of the unit then kamikazi melee or rout. 2. They'll engage in 1:1 melee and die. It's like that with everyone. Sparta? Nothing but royal pikeman. German Barbarians? Nothing but nobles. You get your heaviest Infantry and build 1/19 armies. The fact they limit your total armies even reinforces this, because it means you will ALWAYS have the money to be able to afford armies of nothing but these expensive units because you can't spend it on anything, it's like playing Shogun and there's no reason to ever use a Ashigaru-type over a Samurai-type when you have more money then you know what to do with, there you'd still use Ashigaru because you could always just make more armies so cost-diversity still ment something. When you only have so many spots on the field you only want the best of the best or nothing.Overall. I got nothing, this was my 6th attempt to find anything of value in this game but it just feels like nothing but busy work balancing out towns happiness inbetween rubber stamping clone armies to walk around with impunity taking more and more cities I don't even want but am forced to balance through.

												This game is a devourer of time. I would start up the game and then 6 hours later have no idea what the hell happened. You get so lost in trying to conquer everything, and destroying your enemies. If you have played total war games previously, you know what you are getting into. What I would say to you is, since release, the game has been patched over quite nicely and this game really shines as a result. After pushing through the main campaign on vanilla, check out the robust modding community that has created some really worthwhile mods.For those who have never played a total war game, this is a fantastic starting place to get into the franchise and it is such a wonderful game. It has so much to offer and is extremely engrossing. I would check out some let's plays to get an idea of exactly what you are getting into, and then grab the game ON SALE. As much as I love the game I do not believe it is worth the 59.99 price tag anymore. 14.99 is a steal though. One of my favorite strategy games and it does so well immesing you in one of my favorite time periods. Overall it is a fantastic game. And at this price, even the smallest bit of interest should be acted upon			"

However, with the launch of the Emperor Edition and mods.. ""DEI""(Dresden Shot out to you and thank you for saving this game!) and numerous others it quickly became one of my favorite games.  With my 700+ hours in game if you enjoy strategy games...you will like and love it like me!  My wife hates it, but what does she know about strategy and legions damnit!..hahaha!  It is worth picking it up if your a fan of the time period and enjoy strategy.			"

AI is very buggy, ""capture the flag"" system is an awful idea. And whoever made it should be hanged. No key buildings which makes corner camping possible. Too many unit abilities with no explanation on what they do. Not a very detailed encylopedia and hard to tell one unit from another.			"

												Dosn't compare to ANY of the other Total War games.Incredibly bad. Loose controls and unclear interafce make it very difficult to know what is going on during battle and the campaign map some of the most important info is hidden in tooltips, worst of all is the increadbly bad decision to sepperate the construction and city staus screens meaning you have to jump between them to make an informed descison on what to build.Agents and generals die of old age to quickly to be of any use. i could go on about this games many flaws but i refuse to waste anymore time on it buy the other Total War games and don't buy this one at all.

												Rome II Total War lacks the charm of it's predecessors. I have spent countless hours playing the original Rome Total war, Medieval II Total War and Shogun II Total War. Even though I would want to like RTW II Total War I just can't. The overpriced DLC:s is a one thing that really upsets me and AI is still buggy as hell. The franchise has been changing for worse after Medieval Total War II. To sum it up I will not recommend this game. Don't get me wrong. I love the TW series and all but in it's current state RTW 2 is infuryating to play. Some people might find it fun to play but for people like me who have been playing Total War games since Original Rome Total War this game was a disapointment. It is not nearly as good as it's predecessors ( - Empire TW ).			"

  Score 6 / 10 Lets just... no... just no... I feel like the original rome had more features... Horrible release like so many other games atm, oh and day one DLC for factions that should be free? sure.. I could probably get into this game as of writing this review, with a bunch of mods. But CA has truly stopped thinking about the gamers and started thinking about the best way possible to squeeze as much money out of the hardcore fans. Its really just not fair considering Total War is the only franchise ruling this game genre.Really disappointing..			"

												Bugs side, the design decisions made to this really ruin what has made this series so great. Certain changes aim to make certain game systems less complex. I imagine this was to attact more people to the franchise, but it really ruined the late meta-game of the series. The biggest stand-out from many is how you manage armies. You can't manage an army without a general. Given that you can have a finite amount of generals you are thus stuck with a limited number of armies late game. It forces you to lower the amount of stratgies you can use late game in constrast the other entries in the series. An unfortunate change which waters down the game. The aforementioned change encapsulates whats wrong with the game.			"

												This game is about strategy, huge battles, and empire expansion.Pros :- Good looking- Great handling- Great coop- Workshop- Huge lifetimeCons :- AI Still not good enough- DLC's prices ( YES , pay for a blood & gore pack ? Seriously ? This should have been offered for free ... ).- Mutliplayer battles ( skirmish ). No ability to join again when you get a disconnection. The timer is not loong enough and not usefull at all. It should just be allowed for the player to join the game again.- Desyncs making the online coop campaigns corrupted (still not fixed) you have to make sure you create multiple save points.If you can get this game for more or less 25€, go for it. It's even better if you play with a friend.I recommend this game.			"

												Not worth it for fans of history and/or fans of grand strategy games unless you are willing to get multiple mods or one of the total overhaul mods for it.  Look for Vae Victis, Radious' mod or Divide et Impera and perhaps some others.  I prefer Vae Victis because it centers on historical accuracy and includes the ability to play every faction.  Creative Assembly used to be fairly diligent when it came to historical accuracy; but now they can't even be bothered to correct the misspelling of an important Celtic tribe of the period, the Atrebates, as Atrebartes - even after many patches and updates and multiple DLC.  CA is only in it for the money now and the days when the devs loved the history enough to care about such things is long gone.  It takes modders now to make CA games good, when before (in the days of Med 1&2 and Rome 1 and Shogun 2) the mods merely improved upon already good games.			"

												When writing this i have over 530+ hours of Rome II, i have tried it since the horrible launch (horrible in every meaning of the word) and up until now where it is far better but still not perfect.The things i like about this game is the Battles themselves and the diversity in combat, not to mention the numbers of player made mods that the community have made.if you are looking for something similar to Shogun, then you will find this game is more of a straightforward battle-sim than the predecessor. The whole aspect of politics in Rome II has either been dumbed down or removed completely, i usually ignored it until i got the expansion packs which actually changed a lot of the random events and made them far better (even for the grand campaign) but did not give it anything else than that. with 3 campaigns currently there is a lot to Conquer with the original grand campaign as the biggest time sink by far.Battles : Normal battles on the campaign maps are very enjoyable. the AI will take different approaches depending on your unit composition, if you have the fast siege equipment (rock lobbers) they will try to rush you before their reinforcements arrive instead of getting shelled, while if you have slow ones or even the stationary ones then i have noticed the AI will pull back, wait for all the reinforcements and then attack you in force.Ambushes: they work pretty much the same way as they always did, they are fun to play and an easy way to eliminate big armies quickly. especially the mechanics when you are being ambushed are very enjoyable (you riding in semi first person view inside the army scouting for the enemies in a semi cut scene that will end when you get attacked). the only problem with ambushes is that the AI NEVER WILL USE THEM, in shogun the AI used Ambush when they found it to be a good tactic while in Rome the only times i have been ambushed is when i am moving my army at 2x speed (automatic ambush by attacking army).Fortification : one of the stances in the game is that you essentially build a small fort (with arrow towers) making it easier to defend key area`s with a smaller force. although i rarely use this myself the AI loves to use this mechanic.Pillage: AI loves this one, will sneak a small army (more often than not a single General) into your area`s and pillage them. will lower your income to 0 and remove quite a lot of happiness per round. if you dont pay attention to this or the Raiding equivalent (boats) you will get a rebellion.now to the ""Elephant in the room"" siege battles : the AI is HORRIBLE for the most part. until the second to last patch the AI would dance around rather than attack your castles in force and defend properly, then they fixed it and i had several VERY enjoyable battles where the AI would siege for several turns and bring quite a lot of siege equipment (rams, towers, Turtles and ladders). but the last patch ruined the AI again and now they rarely build anything (and if they do they will abandon it at the start of the battles), the only thing they will attack with is the standard ladders you automatically get from besieging a capital.The patch in question also destroyed the AI of your own troops meaning that they will not follow your orders as you give them and they will not always take the ""smart"" route but run out of your fortifications to enter them again further down the line. more often than not when i tell them to move somewhere with the Right-Click-Hold command they will decide to do something totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and move somewhere else.if they refix your AI and the enemy AI then the game will be improved greatly.Coop: This is my favorite part of the game. i have probably played more co op than single player because i enjoy splitting armies in two and playing battles with a friend. only thing that annoys me mechanically about they way the Coop is built is the lack of possibility of the other player controlling the AI which was possible in shogun. (please bring this back and don't limit it to non allies SEGA !).you will desync, you will curse and it is very annoying and time consuming swapping save games to fix something that should be working correctly, the funniest moment i had with this was when i got attacked in a capital and my buddy loaded a different city(which also got attacked that turn but in a later order). essentially he was watching the AI defending one of my towns and i was defending a totally DIFFERENT battle. because we loaded two different battles without problem is weird to me and should have been fixed.Naval battles : Hate it - Auto resolve 90% of the time. Factions: Tons of different ones, i found this to be the easiest way to determine game difficulty (Rome - Easy  Barbarians, Medium, Nomads hard, a little rough comparison). try one of the Horse Kingdoms on legendary for a challenge :)All in all i both love and hate this game, it is definitely worth it, especially if you have someone to play Coop with (random players for campaign in my experience never works out). have some patience with the AI and laugh at their mistakes.Grab a drink, Grab a friend and conquer the World !

												This game is worse in every aspect in comparison to Shogun II, except for one critical way. You can draw on the map, which actually substantially improves the gameplay during a co-op game. For example, while your partner fights a battle, you can draw a nice♥♥♥♥♥♥cumming on the enemy. Or you can actually use it as it was intended, in the way of advising  your partner on avenues of attack or enemy troops he might not see. Either way, 10/10 feature, Creative Assembly. It's just a shame the other parts of the game were awful, unfinished and to this day, those features remain unpolished, unfinished, and awful. And months later, the game still remains unfinished and awful, and instead of POLISHING and ADDING features, you make unit packs and add in paid factions that should've been included in the base game. Great job, Creative Assembly. I won't be buying a new total war game until 5 months after release, and even then, from the state of this game, I don't think i'll ever buy a new total war game.In retrospect: While the release was awful, unfinished, and ultimately unplayable garbage, I will say, CA, you surprised me with the Emperor Edition. It's really as if this was the game I was promised that fateful year ago. Congratulations on your acension from beta, CA.			"

												Given the initial poor release version, I decided to wait a year or two before digging into this latest Total War game. I think by now it turned out very well. It's an okay game, I guess, but Shogun 2 is still better. This game does carry a bunch of improved features though. All in all if you're a fan of the Total War series, then this is a must-have! By the looks of it, it's the last historical Total War game, because the next one will be in the Warhammer universe ...

												Been playing TW since Shogun 1. This was a broken, half-finished piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥with insane paywalls at release. Now it's a half-broken barely playable insulting piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥with insane paywalls. To the capitalists we're all consumers and they are selling us products based on market research. This means that the focus of making a profitable product is based on which type of psychological profile is likely to buy it despite the quality: this is where marketing/lying/exagerating comes in. And how they lied. The marketing materials are still a lie. I trusted CA when I bought this originally preferring not to read reviews before playing; that was a mistake.Spent more time on this♥♥♥♥♥♥recently attempting my little heart out to find some redeeming features but the more I played it the less I liked it, now I hate it. Companies (devs and publishers) like Bethesda(fix massive and obvious bugs before release please), SEGA, CA, EA etc. can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves if they treat people like morons with this type of BS. They know exactly what they're doing which is why they hire trained liars (see marketing) and professional exploiters (I call it MBA syndrome) to create and sell♥♥♥♥♥♥as ""entertainment"" to morons, children and compulsives at horribly over-inflated prices: they even have an industry nickname for such consumers, whales. They love whales because whales conform easily to all kinds of market metrics i.e. predictable sales.I want to be a customer, not a consumer. Maybe too many of us are still way too polite. If you take my money, you owe me a certain standard, planned devolution is not acceptable. "

												I was so excited when I preordered this game, seeing how fun shogun 2 was. However this game turned out to be a huge disappointment. The graphics even on the extreme settings is mediocre at best, i find that shogun 2 to be a lot prettier(cherry blossoms in the wind looks so freaking good).  Combat turns into blobs of units, compared to shogun 2 where the units are slightly spread out it looks awful. The Ai will charge at you head first, morale lasts 5 seconds, the fight is actually 5 min walking to your opponents troops and 30seconds-1min of actual fighting. Now of the dlcs, its been on every gaming website and forums that the actual game was suppose to have all the dlcs inc but they decided to release it 1 at a time and you have to play for it. Rome 2 contains on-disc DLC that is simply ""switched on"" by Creative Assembly when the player pays for it.So yea this is gonna be my final day buy from Creative Assembly. Stick to Shogun2 because this is just a money grab uncompleted game.			"

												Long time Total War fan, but this game drives me crazy angry, as many times as I've tried to get into it.  The graphics are amazing, and the battles are great (after some needed patches over the course of the first six months).  But the campaign mechanics and horrible UI are what absolutely kill any drive to continue playing after about a dozen turns.- campaign map is way too zoomed in.  Even at 1080p, you're lucky if you can get 2 cities to fit on screen- fog of war likes to cloud its way over your own land- always presented with choices that end up being dead ends (ie. if you have an empty construction slot, you'll get slums if you don't build something.  but you never know which buildings will be available or how much they cost until you build the slot.  so if you can't afford it that turn, you'll get slums, which then further reduce your income to the point that you can never build anything unless you dispand troops).I would recommend staying at Shogun 2 and not progressing past that part of the franchise.

Posted: February 15, 2014
												So, here's a quick review for Total War: Rome II. I'll try to sum it up for any casual gamers like myself out there, although I'll ultimately be comparing it to the original. Sorry for that if you two haven't met. PROS:--(As of the moment I write this) As playable as any other Total War game I've played (Rome, Medieval II, and Empire). Don't know about the issues other people are talking about.--Stunning graphics.--Satisfactory sound effects, voice-acting, and soundtrack (in all honesty, doesn't stand out from any other strategy game I have).CONS:--The price; if you really, really want it, I'd recommend waiting for another sale. --The ""fast forward"" option during battles is painfully slow and does not appear to be much faster than the normal option of ""play""; so, if you're moving an army into position, be prepared for some comparatively long waits. --Gameplay mechanics feel a little... ""dumbed down,"" shall we say, compared to the original. I mean, they cut quite a few features I liked from the original (the family tree, the ability to recruit units without a general, no limitation on generals, etc.), and added only a handful of features I do like (the random family events for one, the ability to fight naval battles on the map for another).The Verdict:Total War: Rome II is a playable and okay RTS, but I believe the graphics are really the only major feature it has in its favor. Honestly, if you're into strategy games, I think you'd be better off just buying / playing the original Total War: Rome. It may not be as visually stunning, but it feels more fluid and, in my opinion, is the better of the two. Plus, you save a handful of cash, and who doesn't like that? :)			"

												I really love most of total war games, but I have to agree that when the game was released, it wasn't acceptable. After 9 patches, the game have most of bugs fixed, however, people are still complaining - even those who haven't played in months or only think about the issues when it was launched. I pre-purchased the game and I have no regret from doing so. Creative Assembly gave away some DLC in order to thank fans for their support.So, is it worth to play? If you really enjoy this period and would like to dominate enemies and command an empire, this game is for you.			"

												I have had all the TW games since Shogun 1, I have loved them all....except this one. In all the reviews you'll note the general feeling is that the AI is broken, especially when it comes to sieges. In this respect I am ever hopeful that Patch 10..or even Patch 20 will give us the game we, as fans, hoped for. But it seems the game lacks something far greater than just AI. It lacks soul.Sure it has OK graphics, it has good ""audio"", but it has no compulsion for just one more go..don;t be fooled by the hours I've spent on it, I have hardly enjoyed any of them, they were mostly testing settings and patches for improvements.If you can look past graphics, try the original Rome TW but with RSII mod, if you want graphiocs, try M2TW with DBM MOd and GEM graphics enhancement...you'll have a lot more fun I promise.

												The Ai is a bit pants occasionally and the single player campiagn map is poorly done, but there is hope for this game. There is a nice balance troop and faction wise (besides the elephants!), graphically the best strategy i have played and there is a Mod workshop! There could be a bit more in the polictical aspect, as i completed a campaign with little to do with it. i'd give a 8/10 form the single player.  However, the multiplayer is stupid because it is exceptionally complex to find a match (or mabye im over complicating things!) and the menu is cheaply done. When you get through the stupid menu and find yourself in a game, u r thrown into a tedious pit of bordom. The games can drag on for ages if your not careful. I have a gtx 660, i5, 8gb ram and still roughly 700 gb left of harddrive space, and i lagged in some of giant battles due to the scale. They r cool but will cause your system will struggle with these specs. My advice, dont join massive games (8vs8 ones that is)unless your pc's got better spec than mine! multiplayer 4/10. BUY THIS GAME FOR THE SINGLE PLAYER NOT THE MULTIPLAYER			"

												Love the Total War series.  I have every game!  Was disappointed with this new installment especially when the game initially came out.  I was told recently the game was patched up and works great.  Well went to play the game again and it crashed my computer, uninstalled/installed game and still nothing...The graphics look great.  I was disappointed with the game mechanics, it seems that no thought was done to seriously upgrade from the original Rome game.  Diplomacy is still very basic and the economics could use work also.  Also would love to see more of an upgrade on the amily history tree mechanics...I am still boggled how the Total War series has the great Medieval, Empire, Napoleon franchises and then this game?Would love to see a Crusader Kings and Total War developers get together and create a game, Rome II has failed to spark my interest.

												After purchasing the game on it's release date and playing since,  I can say that I have thouroughly enjoyed the experience. As of patch 15 beta (i.e. Emperor Edition), bugs seem to be much more scarce and battle/siege A.I. appears to be at a whole new level. After playing every title since Rome Total War I personally feel that this game is now on par with Shogun 2 (if not more enjoyable).If you enjoy the Total War series and this time period interests you then I would recommend adding this to your collection.

Posted: August 4, 2014
												After all this time I'm finally entering my thoughts on this game.This will go on more like a story of my experience than a review.I bought the game on pre-release, meaning full price, only because I loved this franchise. This was something I never did before, but I jumped on the hype; or rather, I was part of the hype.As many already know, the game was delivered in an unplayble state, it only ran well on few computers. So I waited more weeks for the update, disappointed but still eager to play. Thankfully, CA worked hard to release updates, which happened almost weekely in the start.Soon I got my Rome II to run on my computer....but that only makred the beginning of my frustrating experience with this game.I won't go into any details about the specific problems as for they have been extensively covered by many expert reviewers.Plus the CAs part on over-promise and under-deliver, I'll leave it to others. It is beating the dead horse at this point.However, it must be noted that besides the countless bugs and flaws in the codes, many aspects of the intentional game design is inferior to that of its more successful older siblings. These flaws will never go away, such as the Civil War, which appears to be getting more and more unreasonable as the patching goes on. The game design cannot be changed at this point.Again, CA worked hard to patch the game. They updated weekly, which soon became monthy... Plus they gave us free DLCs that opened up a few more factions in the game for the players to command.And about 3~4 months after the release, the game finally became enjoyable....then the Rome II+DLCs went on 50% sale.At that point I was beyond certain that pre-purchasing this game was a terrible mistake.I could've waited 3 months for the 50% sale since I wasn't able to play the game anyways.Even with the 3 free DLCs, the savings from the half-price discount was worth more.The message/impression I got from this event was that CA is really hell bent on selling more copies of this game than anything else. Of course, any reasonable buisness would do that, but while offending those who love their work and delivering inferior product?? ...I don't think they should. All those little friendly guestures (or at first they seemed like friendly guestures) CA made went down the drain. If it was something you were going to do anyways, it cannot be an apology.Those of us who pre-purchased got screwed hard. There was no benefit in buying early and at full price.It has been 11 months since the release and we are now at 14th Patch and updates are becoming very few and far in between. The game has noticably improved and I've logged many hours in this game. Although it does not have the charm the old Total War games had, it certainly has new fun things in it.However, the lesson Rome II has taught me (and us) is to never buy the next one on pre-release and to never pay full price for another Total War. Even better, never be the first one to buy CA's game in an untested state. Let those fools who cannot learn from experience to taste it first. Once it is certain that it is not poisoned then consider buying it. This is what I'll do if I ever buy another Total War.			"

												Are you into sequels with dumbed down UIs, braindead AI, bugs, no challenge, missing series features, and a bad case of developers milking customers with DLC? Then this is the perfect game for you!See those amazing screenshots on the store page? You won't be seeing that stuff ingame! The actual graphics are something you would've seen several generations ago even on maxed settings. The alpha gameplay footage looks better than the 'final' version. Creative Assembly knew that Rome 2 owners wanted to be called retro gamers and gave us the graphics we wanted so we could claim the title!Thought the User Interface was too intrusive in previous Total War games? Good news, Creative Assembly went with a bare minimal approach this time around! Unit cards have been replaced with ancient greek pottery looking designs. Good luck telling some of your units apart when the difference on the card is a tiny squiggle on it's shield!Previous Total War games too hard for you? You don't have to worry about that! They hired Julian McKinlay the developer behind Battlefield's AI to come in and strip out any and all ounces of strategy the old AI had, and hype up the brand new intelligent AI. Can't defend you cities? No worries, the AI never builds siege and when they do they just send 1 unit up a ladder then procede to run through the gate.Remember how tedious it was to have the AI in previous total war games create advanced units and kill yours? No need to worry about that in this sequel. The AI will only build it's most basic units and never upgrade them with armor or weapons. Also McKinlay was kind enough to make the world map AI destroy all its military buildings and build temples and only temples if the cities happiness gets too low. Easily beat the game on legendary difficulty which would've been classified as very easy in previous total war games.Speaking of happiness. Loved having your cities revolt in previous games? Well the new public order system makes sure that all your cities are revolting every 4 turns. Good news though, Julian McKinlay made sure that the revolted armies never attack and instead die from attrition. Don't have to worry about facing annoying rebels with the new public order system!Remember how tedious features like family trees, seasons, generals' stats, and complex building systems were in previous total war games? Good news, those are gone! Just hire a general, and he's part of the family! 1 turn = 1 summer year! Build a set number of select buildings, mostly temples due to public order! General doesn't need his Loyal or Temperamental traits anymore, those just make the game too complex!Thought the previous total war games were too balanced? Well good news! You can be overpowered all you want! Have 1 elephant general wipe out 1000 troops! Research Boiling Oil and go make a sandwich during a city defense while a near endless stream pours out and slaughters your enemy! Don't recruit a navy, cause land units are stronger than naval units when you send them on water!Too few bugs in previous games? There's plenty of those this time around! Watch the world map disappear. Watch the game crash again, and again, and again. Hope you don't have certain hardware that makes the game unstartable! Enjoy low fps battles! Normal speed? More like 3x slower than real life speed! 3x speed? More like normal speed!Game not working or fun? Don't go to the steam forums to voice your opinion. You're not allowed to complain that the game is bad unless you have no less than 400 hours spent ingame. You'll only find buyers remorse this strong on the Aliens: Colonial Marines steam forum. By the way, don't bother complaining that Superman 64 is a bad game unless you have 400 hours put into that either.Don't have 400 hours put ingame yet to complain? Buy some DLC! The creative director of Creative Assembly said that Rome 2's launch issues were ""Totally unacceptable,"" and what better way to forget about those issues (which still persist to this day) then buying some paid DLC to forget about the problems. Get amazing factions which are the same as current factions. Why play Rome and attack Gaul when you can buy Caesar in Gaul and play Rome and attack Gaul with paid DLC! Want Blood and Gore? Well, that basic feature in every other game has been stripped out and is being sold as glorious DLC.Like the choices that regularly came up in the Crusader Kings series? Well good news, there's a system in Rome 2 that's just like it called political intrigue. The political intrigue is so well developed with so much thought put into it that even 3 months after launch not a single person knows how it works or what it does! Tribal leader blackmailing you? Well you can retaliate and get 3 chiefs supporting you, or ignore it and lose 3. What the chief support does, who knows!? Don't have to worry about that pesky Senate breathing down your neck like in Rome 1, since to this day, no one knows what the benefits or downsides to the chief support system are. You'll only have to open the interface when you need to promote someone maybe once every 10 hours. Once again, Creative Assembly knew that we didn't want to navigate through those pesky menus and interfaces to use the political intrigue system.Tired of the terrible diplomacy in previous titles, and the AI ganging up on you and declaring war? Well good news, that diplomacy system has been improved and simplified. You'll only need the diplomacy system now to declare war! Creative Assembly knew how annoying it was having to open that screen and form alliances and trade routes. You'll no longer have to worry about getting too big and having everyone attack you and end your 100 hour game, cause the improvements have made sure that the AI barely ever makes alliances with one another, and barely ever declares war on you. You'll have no obstacles beating the game on legendary difficulty in this total war game!Sun Tzu probably said something along the lines of, ""Something, something, something, something, military formations are important to stay in to win or something."" Well historically he was correct, but historical is BOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIINNGGG. That always bugged me in previous total war games, all your units would stay in tight formations and fight enemies in tight formations. Well Creative Assembly decided that it was boring too, so instead of fighting in formation, all troops now fight in awesome mosh pits. YYYAAAAAAA PARTY!!!! WOOOO!!!!!!Hated how sssssssslllllllllooooooooowwwwwwwww previous total wars' battles were? Well they've been sped up! Those 20 minute battles now last 4 minutes. Creative assembly knew that we wanted shorter battles and longer load screens, and they delivered. Nothing like waiting 5 minutes after clicking end turn to take your turn. Great way to work out and get buff!If you love strategy games where you have to use zero strategy and can just afk and win 99% of the time and the other 1% you just charge all your units straight toward the enemy, then Rome 2 is not only for you, but game of the year material. If Aliens: Colonial Marines didn't give you enough buyer's remorse then Rome 2 is perfect for you, and you'll soon be raiding those steam forums to make sure your money was well spent.Incase you couldn't tell this is sarcasm and no one should ever buy this game.

												Its just not a good game. Stripped down to some dumb mechanics in the campaign map, taken away most of the things that made past TW great. It got streamlined, made more ""accessible"" and during this it got boring, repetetive and just not really intruiging to play. Even with mods its still a dull experience. During Campaign you run from one war to another to the next and yet another. There is basically no economy any longer, diplomacy is near none existent and whats left means nothing. Just throw some dice, it will probably get you more reliable and fun results. What a waste of time the campaign is. If you like the fights go fight. They are fun if you install AI mods. Without them...pointless, CA is just crap beyond believe at programming ai. One might think they figured it out by now. I mean after all TW is around for a few years now. But ...meh!So all in all Rome... well i guess ""meh!"" says about enough about that game.			"

												As I approach the 1000 hour mark, I feel I can finally make a review about Rome 2. Let me start by saying I completely disagree with the ""do not recommend"" reviews, especially if Rome 2 is on sale. This game is NOT rome 1, and it is NOT medieval 2, and it offers a different playing experience. One thing I didn't like about rome 2, that they limited the amount of army's one faction an field at one time. This can be easily worked around with mods. The modding community can fix almost any problem you have, outside of AI (TW AI has never been the best, am I right?). Give it go, then check out the workshop to see what mods you may like!I did like, In Rome 2, that they added army stances. You can set your army into a 'Fortified' mode, where they build a fort for defences, used if your're going to stay put and guard an area. A 'Forced March' mode, which will allow great distances to be traveled,  but at the cost of morale and being vulnerable to an ambush. Or 'Raid' mode which allows you to plunder an enemies territory, angering the populace and possibly drawing out an attack from any enemy army's.I'd not recomment purchasing Rome 2, unless you have at least the 'Recommended'  system requirments listed above, otherwise It will likely look pretty ugly, and lag in larger battles. Though, I can't say with certainty it will not run well on a ""2 GHz Intel Dual Core processor / 2.6 GHz Intel Single Core processor"" I can't imagine it running very well. Everyone has reacted differently to this game and since release it's been under much scrutiny, and while I agree, Rome 2 had it's fair share of post-release issues, It's still a very worthwile experience. Don't let all the negative reviews sway you from this great game, because it's definitely become my most played Total War title, and I had played a LOT of TW prior to Rome 2.All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this game to any Total war fan, or even as a good place to start for someone new to Total War because of the way they simplified the user interface. It does seem to require less micro managing than shogun 2, or Empire. It does feel more limited, though, as you cannot build ANY given bulding type in ANY given city.  You will just have to decied for youself if this newest installment to the Total War series, will be YOUR new favorite. "

												Compared to Rome 1 Total War I am very dissappointed with the game. On a fundamental level, the game is too clunky, arcadey and many of the mechanics have been dumbed down or removed.My most major qualm is with the UI primarily. Rome 1 had a very clean, intuitive and satisfying to use interface, however in Rome 2 this is all reversed. The map is horrible, the menus obtrusive and disorganised, the unit cards ugly - the sleak feel from a game released 10 years earlier is gone.My next point is fairly neutral. The game seems to have been abstracted further, with regions of three-or-so cities and odd, over-simplified buildings, forcing you to make choices when it is not necessary. This is obviously in the name of balance, making it a more competitive game online, but personally i find this direction a bad choice to make, and i hoped for more historical accuracy than this.I waited a long time to post this review because I hoped they would made some meaningful changes to the game, however nothing was major enough to convince me to change my review.

												I'll admit, as a long fan of the Total War games, the launch of Rome II was practically a disaster. However, that's no longer the case.The game has absolutely improved and has been patched to hell. The gameplay is a hundred times better. Units clash much more than they did, AI has had tweaks and personally, I haven't encountered many game breaking bugs that were spotted on release.That being said, SEGA still persists to make factions that should definitely be playable DLCs... The game itself is good, but SEGA's greed ruins the experience. That's why, as a game, I do recommend it. I also recommend Rome Total War, the original, because that game was a damn masterpiece.			"

												Rome as a game Is if your system is up to par. Great graphics, and  effects. In depth campaign, solid real time battles, great detail given to historical accuracy. Hundreds of hours in content here. Now why I don't reccomend this game.....$85 in dlcs is ridiculous to expect any gamer to pay on top of a $60 game. With no option to purchase a season pass, sega is truely sticking it to the gamers. What a shame, I am not against dlcs but $85 with no option to purchase a season pass is absolutely unjustifiable. So in total if you want the full experience out of this game that will be $145. Seriously, unless you can get this on sale I would pass.Oh and this game is still $60 roughly 3 years after initial release.			"

												I don't know why this game gets so much hate. Then again, I learned that CA does early acceess without calling it early access, so I always wait a year or two before buying one of their games. But in its current state it is quite enjoyable.Pro:-Better overworld map mechanics than Rome 1, the province system is a nice touch.-Politics can be a fun game to play-Once you figure out how army recruitment works it makes allot of sense, and makes you try and hold onto your armies as precious things rather than throwing troops to the slaughter. It also makes the game more strategic, careful army positioning is much more critical.-Client state system actually viable strategy. Con:-AI is still useless, CA really needs to find a better AI coder for the battles and overworld map. -The politics don't seem to do anything really important, and I end up saving money for building up more troops.-Once you get going there's not much stopping you from taking over the whole map. Which I suppose is the point really. There might be one early game challenger but that's about it.-Diplomacy consists of ""Trade with me"" and ""I'm attacking you"". Again, this is somewhat how Rome operated so I guess it's appropriate. Still, would have been nice to have more nuance there. Overall, great addition to the franchise. The polish level is nice and high, and of course nothing like smashing a cavalry charge into an enemy flank.			"

												I play total war games from Rome 1. That has been my favorite game untill now. I used to hate Rome 2 from release. It was a mess, it made bad changes to the formula I loved from Rome 1 and Medieval 2 and was made in the warscape engine. Recently I thought to give it another try, with the emperor's edition and all the patches released, and I found out that the game is very good and quite addictive. I hate to admit that I can't see myself going back to Rome 1 now, especially when a mod that brings Rome 1 music to Rome 2 exists. Rome 2 music is also amazing though. Good job at CA for fixing your mess. I bough the complete game at 120€ only to find out 2 days later it is on a 75% sale. Luckily my copy was eligible for refund and I refunded everything (took me 1 hour!) and then repaid 30€ for the complete game so I am extra happy today. It was worth the 120 also. Go get it.Update: I have now 60 hours of gameplay and I havent even touched a campaign from one of the DLCs. Hell, I havent even played any other faction than Rome yet in the Grand Campaign. The game is able to offer hundreds of hours of entertainment, it seems. Also, the workshop offers many useful mods for fun and for gameplay ""fix"". For example, I use the Testudo buff and the rebalanced skirmishers mods wich fix the issue where skirmishers, especially slingers, could massacre heavy armored infantry or kill of a unit in testudo formation. I am happily surprised with this game.			"

												*This review is a statement against recent Total War titles marketing scheme*This recommendation will stay negative unless Creative Assembly and Sega demonstrate to Total war fans that future Total War games will not be plagued by abusive and overpriced downloadable content (as is The Viking Forefathers ''Culture pack'', and the Longbeards ''Culture Pack'' in Attila - same with culture DLCs in this game. We have to pay to unlock an excisting file).Sega and Creative Assembly, show some respect to Total War fans.We have paid for a complete game. Could you do us the honor of delivering one? "

												Sweet game! It has good graphics and gameplay and can run smoothly on a decent GPU, the Ai is not as good as it was in Rome 1 or other total war games but is still better than the dreaded Empire total war. Rome 2 is amazing to look at, has some decent historically correct dlcs and is so fun in general. The multiplayer is so fun and can teach you good tactics and units weak and strong points as a lot of people are much better than the ai in the campaign. The morale system in Rome 2 can be stupid at times and screws up the AI quite a bit. In total I love this game, so fun, would probally rate it a 9/10			"

												From time to time I pick it up in the hope it became more immersive with the patching......but truth be told, it is simply NOT a strategic game! The AI is dumb beyond reason and the game is in no way tuned to be challenging. It is just a case of let's see if I can produce more stacks of unit than my enemy does. Developing settlements is not really rewarding nor is diplomacy. CA has quite a good concept with TW - but have they really done much to increase the depth of the game since Medieval 2? My advice is: Don't be fooled into buying this full price!			"

												Do not buy this game, save your'e money for some thing else,  it's not worth it. I'm disappointed in all partys, for allowing such a great series as the tw games, to fall form grace in such away it leaves nothing but a bitter taste upon the tongue, and an unsure future for the franchise. I fell so strongly about this, that i will not purchase anything else from CA or sega. I have enjoyed Tw form the very beging, but this game is an insult to fans and they should be appalled with themselves for releasing it in such a state as this.			"

												This game sadly is so far removed from the rest of the Total War games that we have come to love. played 20 turns and during that small span of time I realized armies were next to useless when constantly assaulted with spies. The spies are completely overpowered and the AI uses them every single turn against you. Apparently what I have taken away from this is that wars were won by spies and armies never meant♥♥♥♥♥♥back in the roman times... This is honestly the worst title I have ever played.			"

												While a few bugs remain, most of the serious issues that Rome 2 suffered at launch have since been ironed out. The AI is much better both on the campaign map and during battles and capture points have been removed from open field battles which makes them much more tactical and longer lasting. At launch, most battles would resolve in five minutes or so, now they usually last ten or fifteen minutes. While it still isn't as slick as Shogun 2, Rome 2's massive scale and varied factions make for a entertaining and addicting strategy experience that is closer to what fans expected before the game released. There are still some lingering problems with AI in battles, particularly in sieges when the AI is attacking. The game also doesn't look as good as the latest builds of Shogun 2, they still need to implement a better anti-aliasing system to smooth the visuals out. However considering the state that Rome 2 launched in, its nice to see that Creative Assembly didn't abandon the project and instead patched it to the point where it is well worth playing. Get it on sale if you have been on the fence about this one, it is finally a worthy entry into the Total War franchise.			"

												I don't know how to start this. But maybe I should start by saying that this game is the latest Total War game in a universe of 7 to 9 games if you consider Napoleon and ""Last Samurai"" as StandAlones.If I were to review this regardless of the previous games I would say it is worth buying, it is a solid game, has some bugs but none game breaking at the moment, the devs update the game once in a while, the battles are epic, the campaign in early and mid game is engaging kind of feels like Civilization and then mixing that with the accomplishments of your RTS battles it's a pretty solid rewarding experience. And I'd have to give it at least a 7/10 in the game's current state. Shame that the developers decided to go with all those DLC things with factions and units. But the game is there and it's good. I already spent 460h on it and most of the time it was great.Now reviewing this taking into consideration the earlier games... This game was very, very disapointing. It is a little better now with the patches but it's still disappointing. Family trees, the building system of Rome I, the inability to have smaller defending armies to complement the garrissons that are led by captains instead of generals, the AI which isn't better and at times is worse, the agent system is rather dumb, all the mini clips that would pop out throughout the game are gone, the field battles are quicker and have arcady goals and sometimes it looks like arcade games. So... There's a lot of thing that were dumbed down, others totally removed. When I first started playing I thought ""Oh my god, the graphics are nice, not as good as I thought they'd be but nice, gameplay is nice... oh but where is the family tree? but... I can't have armies without generals? what?""  Well I got used to it.  But the emersion is just not there. You play because you want to win. And in late game it just feels like a Grind. It's painful. The Civil War system is completely broken as well. How is that? I would have made it as one army goes rogue or all the armies controled by the family who rebeled and those would go take your capital. If they took it they'd be in charge. You could either give up command or lose your territory and try to re-capture the capital to gain control of the empire. That'd be awesome but no. You just get a random number of armies spawn around one of your cities and that's the civil war. Plain dum and stupid. The only reason I kept playing Rome II is because I made a mod to make the battles exponentially better. Plus there are features I can't live without and with other mods the game is pretty nice to play. Considering all this and the earlier games I'd rate the game a 4/10 due to the huge let down, with mods I'd give it 6/10. It's worth trying. But wait for it to go on sales. Below 35 ~ 40 euros/dollars it is worth to pick and try.The only reason I don't play Rome I more than Rome II ? In Rome I you have to go into a city and retrain your armies.  :P "

												I once said that Rome 2 has ""Stupidest AI I have ever seen in the Total war franchise"", and due to that I do not recommand it to anyone that love the former Total War titles. Now after numerous patches and updates, I can say with confident that this game is pretty solid right now. With reformed battlefield and domestic management system, Rome 2 is a lot of fun to play. Though it is still not as good as Shogun 2 IMO, CA released the Emperor edition together with its campaign pack for free, which is a positive signal that they are trying to improve the game since its buggy launch. This is something that I really appreciate, and I will continue to support any Total War title developed by CA in the future.			"

												This is my favorite Total War game. I still play it nearly 3 years after it released. One big issue though. After playing a campaign for awhile and gaining power, the game looses it's feel of urgency. (The first part of a campaign feels like being on a knife's edge. Very exciting.) While I understand that you need to progress, there usally is no other big threat on the map after you controll about 1/4 of it. ALL the other nations are still squabbling over small territories. I would expect that at least 2 or 3 empires would control 90% of the map other than I have at that point. It's a big enough gripe that it kind of ruins the latter game play of a campaign. On a good note, the battles are amazing to watch and I am still surprized at how you can use real life tactics from history and they work. (It's not perfect, of course. and there will always be room for improvement.)			"

												I Love the Idea of having a Roman based strategy game, but it falls short on some aspects.  Nonetheless, I'm going to continue to play the game, seeing as there's not much other choice.  I know Rome: Total War is an option, I've played it, maybe five times longer than this one, and although there are some negative remarks about this game, there still was an improvement to the game's overall feeling for me personally.The thing I would change is having the physical city size on th campaign map smaller, more realistic than it is noe, and altough it would be an undoable task, have a battle map unique for each city and it's development.  The programming exists for this tast, but the PC's required to rrun such a feat would be unrealistic.I hope, one day in the future, we will recieve the Rome we were promised, is it is delivered by Creative Assembly or another company.  Overall I am disaapointed in the devs for thinking ONLY about making money, and not the users playing the games.  Screw you CA, give us what you promised us, and stop ruining our dreams!!!			"

												You can stick your overpriced♥♥♥♥♥♥culture packs up your fat asses!The game is good, not great. I bought it on sale in a bundle which included some of the more expensive DLCs. So I'm content with the game for what I payed. Also having had waited until well after its release (2+ years) I did not have to deal with the bugs this game was infamous for upon release. So why can't I recommend this game? Well, Sega is DLCing this game to death. There are DLCs in this and other TW games that should just have been in the original release. But why add them for free when you can charge more for them? I'm surprised they have not started microtransactions where you actually have to pay for the mercenary units you hire or something even more ridiculous. But soon I am sure.This method of cash grabbing is the reason TW fans such as myself will never buy a TW game pre-release, shortly after release, or at full price ever again.			"

												Total War: Rome 2 suffered from a rough start, releasing with many questionable design choices and numerous severe bugs and optimization issues. This led to poor fan reception and a Metacritic score lower than that of any Total War title to date. At launch, and for quite some time after, I would not have recommended Rome 2. Thanks to Creative Assembly's continued support of the game, it has now reached a stage where it is extremely enjoyable with the recent release of the Emperor Edition. The game has metamorphosed drastically since the game received is initial reviews.The Emperor Edition, released on September 16, 2014, drastically overhauled the game. The building system was redesigned for the better, factions all underwent extensive rebalancing and recieved new, more natural factional colors, unit abilities were overhauled, and last but not least, a new free campaign, Imperator Augustus, was released. All of this was added to the game free of charge! With the changes introduced in Emperor Edition, I definitely recommend Rome 2 to anyone interested in a grand strategy game with RTS and TBS elements set in the ancient world.All of the DLC is recommendable, though depending on your personal preference, you may wish to skip the unit packs. The two DLC campaigns, Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the Gates, offer an experience different from that of the Grand Campaign and Imperator Augustus. They are more focused experiences, zooming in on the world map to flesh out Gaul and the Mediterranean, respectively, in greater detail than what is found in the Grand Campaign. Caesar in Gaul, Hannibal at the Gates, and Imperator Augustus all also operate at a slower yearly rate, with one turn per season, as opposed to the Grand Campaign's one turn per year. This greatly increases the number of turns you will have generals and agents at your disposal before they die of old age, allowing them to accrue more experience than they would be able to in the Grand Campaign. All of the DLC content is reasonably priced for its value, especially during sales.My biggest gripe with the Rome 2 is how visually disappointing it is. The lack of true AA makes the game so much uglier, and the art direction really is vastly inferior to that of Shogun 2, in the UI, graphics, and soundtrack.The UI itself is my second biggest problem with Rome 2. Coming straight from Shogun 2, I don't understand how they managed to make the UI so much worse. In Shogun 2, the UI beautifully blended with the style of the game, and functioned perfectly for gameplay purposes. In Rome 2, they somehow decided it was a good idea to make the UI take up more space on the screen, while at the same time making it more difficult to navigate and use. Between the advisor constantly popping on the screen for no reason, the unit stat card being permanently there and GIANT unless you want to manually hide it completely (instead of fading away like in Shogun 2), and the unit bar section taking up a way larger than necessary portion of your screen, right in the center, they really succeeded in consuming as much screen space as they could with their devolved UI. I just don't understand how they could have made the UI so much worse coming straight from Shogun 2, which had a magnificent UI.My two gripes aside, I do recommend the game.			"

												Total War: Rome III have to say it first. I was one of the critics. I refused to buy this game after the first reviews surfaced making clear this game was released in a terrible state. I was looking forward to this as it spans over my most favorite historic period of time. I played all the Total War games from the beginning with the first Shogun and I would call my self a fan of the franchise. Now I got this game during a sale and firstly felt bad about it. Lets not kid ourselves, the dlc politics of EA is rather cheeky demanding money for factions that would have been included in older instances of total war. But its our fault. They tested us when they brought faction dlcs in Shogun II and we bought them. I got the feeling in a few years we will have to pay for a games core engine and for every single faction in it and they will sell it to us as feature. We brought this upon ourselves.If you want to play the greeks, the germans, the iberian tribes, the balcan factions and even some gaul tribes you will have to buy the dlcs. Especially the greek states as being one of the major antagonists of the early roman republic are a must have for anyone interested. But enough of that.The Game:The Game right now on 8th September 2014 with all dlc included is the most complete, most playable, best looking, most enjoyable strategy game of the Total War franchise. Yes even better than Medieval II. The game feels and looks astounding. You will be sucked in into ancient times. you will find yourself speaking with the voice of a roman consul during the battles. You will cheer your elephants trampling down poor barbarians with Carthage. The epic struggle for power in the east with vast armies and the biggest ships the world had ever seen at that time. Slave uprisings. Forming your own barbaric confederation to face the roman onslaught. You will be in the middle of it.The tactical and strategical depth is incredible. Multiple Army battles. Naval invasions in the style of ""Troy"" the movie. Even combined Land-Sea-Sieges of cities with large armies are possible and incredible fun. Ambushes, Plundering, Mowing down of barbarians with organized armies. Roman legionaries advancing in turtle formation. Huge siege machines. It is all in here for you. The politics of your factions are there but they are toned down. I feel split in opinion about that but i have to say you can actually ignore the whole political side of Rome II and still succeed. Occasions of civil war are very very rare in my experience.Armies, Generals, Agents all gain experience and skills. Agents becoming extremly useful. You dont like to manage them? Leave them in your provinces and set them to overwatch and they will help your economy, stability and military developement and defend against enemy agents. The technical aspects of the game are pretty well right now. It looks good and is reasonable quick. I am playing this on an older PC with  4 GB of RAM  and it works well with medium graphics. Loading times will however be signifcant. Especially after and prior to huge battles. The criticism of the game was always about the innitial state it was shipped out and it was terrible. There is no denying. But today with all the patches and changes and the community input this game is finally what was promised and it delivers.Get it but you maybe want to wait for a sale. Including the important dlcs it is one of the more expensive products on steam. "

Posted: August 7, 2014
												I will start this review by saying that i love the total war series. I have played all of the total war games with the exception of the original Shogun and medieval. I was introduced into the series in 2010 when i saw my housemate playing barbarian invasion and i was blown away. the dude was kind enough to lend me his total war rome cd and it just got me hooked. After that i played medieval 2, empire, napoleon, shogun and fall of the samurai and i ♥♥♥♥ing loved them. I did not even mind empire with all its flaws, trully. And then i was i was introduced to the amazing comunity with the exeptional mods like europa barbarorum, stainless steel, third age total war (best lotr game ever btw), and of course the darthmods. I came to the realization that i could not play the vanila games anymore. The mods for these games were so much better in terms of content and gamplay that i just could not. I am not saying by any means that the vanila games were bad nor do i have less respect for CA cause if it wasnt for the original product i would not get to play these versions.For empire total war i have played (and im not proud saying that) more than a 1000 hours (with darthmod platinum). with this out of the way when i first heard that they are making a rome 2 total war i went ♥♥♥♥ing mental. the game that introduced me to the series was being remade with all the experience that game with CA after all these titles. How wrong i was......The state of the game when it was releashed almost a year ago was at BETA stage and im being super kind by saying this. I completely agree with all the rants and videos out there and im♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with how CA or SEGA treated the fans. The reason im am writing this now is that after almost ONE year, i can say that the game can be enjoyed. I have had no lag and the battles are playable (unmodded). However i still do not agree with most of the changes that have been made (requitment, provinces, not being able to build wall nor roads and many more). Finally i will treat this game as a spinoff for the total war series. It  feels that it was made by a completely different company who though what total war was about but missed the point along the way. With that in mind i will recomend this game because it NOT a bad game but total war as i remebered it and played it (as i do to this day) it is not. it is a fun arcade strategy and nothing more. And maybe it can intoruce new players to the classics that i mentioned. I am not going to give any pros and cons cause im sure other players have done it a lot better that i ever would. Im just here to say that it took literally 1 year for CA to get the game sorted after patch 14 and that players who bashed the game should give it a go, just think of it as a spinoff game. Last thing people are entiled to their own opinions CA should be critisied for their games and actions (im talking DLC whoring and the likes). If theres no negative opinions we are gonna get more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games and that in the end hurt the gamers. I personally will not preorder a game anymore no matter how many free factions or gay little catapults they throw at me. Wait for the reviews and judge by yourselfs Peace			"

												if you've never played a total war game this might be fine, but overall this doesnt really bring much to the table for the series beyond sheer repetitive size, and the battle system seems like its a step and half backwards.  Overall all its probably a C+ rating, but there are plenty of other total war games that have done better  and more worthy to be played.maybe if i had more of the dlc factions it might feel less generic, but looking at most of those didnt seem very appealing either and im not one to play nickle and dime dlc nonsense with dozens of worthless additions.Oh and the load times i thought i was crashing but it really can take 20 minutes minimum just to load a single battle or map.  At first it wasnt bad, but im only half way (i own every western european country and most of the medetteranian and im only halfway ffs lol) and i think its already the longest loads ive ever seen in 30 years of gaming and im not exaggerating.  Ive left and run errands and come back and she'll still be loading, and sometimes you need to do these back to back.Im going to give the fact that some of the mini factions can support more armies then you can being 1/100th the size a pass, but overall just really unimpressed by this one.  Its not necessarily bad, its just nothing great either.			"

												While the base game is relatively fun and balanced, it feels small. CA is holding the other 50% of the game hostage for over $90. Do NOT buy this game unless it's on Steam sale for over 50% off. I'd say the base game is worth $20 at best.			"

												The game is much better than it was at launch - I have not encountered any bugs during my time during the game, and although there are many complaints on the DLC - just buy them during the Steam sales, they go down to unbelievably cheap prices.A well-rounded strategy game, which although isn't on the level as Rome: Total War (in my opinion), it is very innovative and has many more features.

Posted: November 27, 2014
												I'm a huge fan of history, particularly classical history. I spent my time in college studying Roman Civ, so the game was hugely appealing to me. But I'll try and take a step back here in order to review it from the point of view of someone who isn't completely infatuated with history.I'm a big fan of the old tactical JRPG style games, like Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics. I haven't done much gaming with its cousins in the subgenres of military strategy and real time strategy, but I really enjoyed how this game seemed to blend both of those genres together, and I respect that Creative Assembly is basically designing two games in one, here. There's the overarching strategical game in which you're managing your cities and towns and moving your military and spy/champion/dignitary units, and there's what is obviously the meat of the game in the battle system that occurs once you engage in combat with an enemy unit. They flow together quite nicely, allowing you to build up the efficacy of your units via upgrades in your cities and towns. It scratches the RPG itch in that way while at the same time providing a great strategical and tactical experience. You can easily find yourself dumping hours upon hours into this game, thanks to the patented ""Just One More Turn"" addiction technique made famous by the Civilization series. It's quite enjoyable, and there's quite a lot of it -- One campaign can take nearly 100 hours to complete.There are some really cool features to the game. I got the most enjoyment out of it simply due to the fact that it strives to be historically accurate, and it does a great job of it. The Roman military is clearly split between the Manipular system of the middle Republican era, and the Marian reforms later on that transformed the army from the group of levied farmers it classically was into the group of professional, disciplined fighters that would eventually conquer most of Europe and all of known Africa. The historical accuracy of the military units also extends to the Celtic tribes of Gauls and Britons, the Iberian tribal fighters, African and Asian horsemen, etc. It's all really enjoyable given my interest in history.There are numerous little touches that are really nice, as well. The art on the unit cards is really awesome. It's clear they went for an antique style with them, and it really works well. The Celtic tribes look particularly cool. Another thing I found really enjoyable was the pre-battle speeches that the general can be heard giving his troops. They're phenomenally well voice acted, and they make accurate references to religion and state. It's enjoyable down to the cornua that the centurions blow whenever you tell a unit to move. It matters a lot that they get the little things right here, as they do a lot to immerse you in the time period, and Creative Assembly has absolutely succeeded there.The actual combat, and being able to zoom in and out as your units go to battle against others, is absolutely phenomenal. You can zoom in and see each unit, in great detail, fighting against the enemy. Or you can zoom out and take in the entire battle from a colossal scale. Watching your cavalary charge the rear of an opponent is immensely satisfying. I had one situation where one of my legions was caught in enemy territory. I had had the foresight to send my units into a defensive stance, so the battle began with them entrenched in a wooden fortress. I was heavily outnumbered, and didn't have many units to do anything with other than just station them in the doorways of the fortress and hope they could hold off the enemy. They ended up succeeding, breaking the enemy waves at the entrance in true Roman legionary fashion. It was awesome, and easily my most memorable moment in a game filled with them. The problem is that about half of the most memorable moments are due to terrible bugginess, and those memorable moments always caused battles to end in disaster for me. Imagine fighting a battle for close to 40 minutes, and having it suddenly turn because one of your key units got stuck on geometry and slaughtered since you could no longer maneauver them. It's just as infuriating as it sounds.I've gotten into this game somewhat late, playing it a full year after it originally exist, and I've read quite frequently that people say it's become way better, that it's been fully patched and is now recommendable to everybody, but my experience with it has not proven this to be correct. I've had units refuse to enter a breach in a wall literally a dozen times, which has caused me to stop knocking down walls altogether and just use siege ladders. But then I had units get stuck on a wall and do nothing but continue to climb up and down the siege ladders, which caused me to lose an extremely important battle. I've also experienced a bug where my cavalary has run in the completely opposite direction from which I've ordered them. There are numerous other things like this that really destroy the experience for me, but it's also incredibly poorly optimized, even after Creative Assembly has patched the game several times and repackaged it into the ""fixed"" Emperor Edition. I'm running 780ti SLI and I see dips down to around 20fps at times, which is absolutely ridiculous.It really hurts me to give this game a thumbs down, because I did enjoy it quite a bit. But the frustration from dealing with its bugs and its poor optimization make it hard for me to recommend to anybody outside classical history buffs and hardcore Total War fans. If you fall into either of those groups, then by all means, take the plunge, because you'll get quite a bit out of this game. I surely have. But if you're not, then you should probably just pass it up altogether, because the frustration will likely outweigh any enjoyment you'd get out of the game.			"

Easy access to mods and modding tools makes many issues such as the low unit diversity and annoying features fixable, with many new innovative mod ideas created each day. The only major bug now is the siege AI and I believe that with future patches this will be fixed. Overall an enjoyable game. 7/10			"

												I recently started playing Medieval 2 Total War again and had a blast , then I saw that the entire Total War series was playable for free for 2 days so I tried playing a little bit of EMPIRE and NAPOLEON Total War and I was satisfied because it felt pretty much the same as previous games, but not ROME II, because it simply feels less serious than the previous games in the series, the battlefields feel almost cartoony and so do the units.Also:The banners that float above your untis are too big and only block the view of your units from a medium view distance.The unit cards are too complicated and you can't really tell whats happening from a glance (which is important when you have to make quick decisions).

												Brutally fun, viscereal, and completely engrossing. Play this game patched and with a great headset for best results.Good: extensive Mod support, fun battle AI, great multiplayer, acceptable score (Rome I's original musical score is better than Rome II's in my opinion). Bad: Town sieges for Level IV capital is very unbalanced in favor of defense, AI turns still long after several patches (partially solved by using SSD)Ugly: You must use a good office chair while gaming, perhaps also a lot of beer and pretzels for the long gameplay sessions, and a girlfriend/wife with high tolerance for your long play sessions.

												I have a feeling my review about Rome: Total War 2 not going to be popular. I know total war games avoided by grand strategy game lovers as its focus was mainly allways the battlefield fight but as that is just only part of the game i cant avoid the critic about those in my review.Iam a hardcore strategy game player, its my most played genre and i enjoy even ""bad"" strategy games if the mechanisms of the game ok. Its SAD, but i think this is the only negative review i ever wrote about any strategic game and its not easy to make me do so about a strategy game.What i liked in this game?-well, you know, the battles are nice, but we seen that allready in other total war games.-nothing else, really:-pWhat i not liked?-store page says its a turn based strategy game, well, the onmap strategy options limited, ill epxlain a bit more later-missleading tutorial. tutorial showed me how to build armory etc to improve the armor of my troops. Well, then the game was total different, it was built as main building on cities with iron resource. I had no clue whats the problem, why cant i build upgrade building in Italia, probably was changed later with DLC/patch, but really, they should update tutorial then-city building options too limited-conquering a city not means population loss, ok that sometimes ok, but not even if city was under siege or encircled and captured years later after city ran out of food? REALLY?-useless money and unbalanced economy. i not had ever money issues. Game is just not challenging at all economy wise, for example in mediavel 2 which is i think the best total war game ever i never had enough money.-weird AI fleet movements, they idle at the middle of nord atlantic ocean and complete faction elimination because of fleeing fleets just annoying-AI takes like 5-10mins to finish turn, even if i choise ""i dont want to see AI movement"". I bet AI shows slow movements for my CPU or i have no clue, my PC is above recommended and still too much wait time in mid-late game.-above option wouldnt be that annoying if you could do something else IRL while AI moving. BUT NO, AI just bombard you with the same diplomacy offers every 2nd turn, so you just cant leave and return to play your turn when AI done, no, because AI diplomacy interrupts AI movements turn. Its like that in other games too like Civ5, but AI turns fast there-AI know if he can win a battle or not, he dont even try to attack or it avoid battle if he cant. I mean, we talking about an era when army leading and strategy wasnt that great yet, only for a few literated empire was it. German/gallic etc tribes fought even they were outnumbered and not tried strategic retreats, it totally kills the feeling that i play a strategy game about a roman era.-unlike in medieval or rome1 in rome2 you can build units only for army, you cant increase city defenses with additional units so its like a ping-pong war sometimes, enemy army avoid fight as AI calculate its own win chance and so just avoid battle even if they have more men for the battle, so they choise another route and conquer your city, leave it, conquer other one while you reconquer, its like a cat-mouse chasing game.-my client states declare war on each other, forcing me to either not join the defender (losing defender as client state) or joining on the side of the defender (losing attacker as client state) WTF?Iam not exactly sure i listed all my problems with the game, i tend to give more chances for games, played this a lot (as i not wanted this game to ruin my AVG) but no, i just cant recommend this game at all.

												Before this the only Total War I had real experience with was Medieval 2, and I've gotta say, I'm glad I picked this up. Thank you, franchise sale, because Rome 2 is my favorite strategy game experience ever.  The world map management feels like a combination of Sid Meier's Civ V and Total War, and the research tree is a cool addition to the building. My only complaint about the world map is that it does feel a little oversimplified; definitely do your campaigns above ""normal"" difficulty if you want a real challenge.  Diplomacy is easier to do than ever before and it actually makes sense; your standing with a particular faction and its allies will actually affect what kind of treaties they'll enact with you, if any at all, and you're less likely to encounter random backstabbing. (Although why my client states maintain military alliances with countries I'm at war with I'll never know)The actual battles are the same as before, with a pretty UI that tells you all you need to know and the addition of abilities - not just the formations, phalanxes, fire arrows, and stakes that we had before - but things like war cries to rally your own troops and intimidate the enemy all makes battles feel better and grittier.  All the different types of battles are great too, and it's awesome having an online battle work out when you're the reinforcing navy coming rescue your teammates :PAll in all, would totally recommend this game, especially as a good starting point into the Total War franchise if you want something that's actually historical and cool "

												This game WOULD be great, but for me at least, it has one huge problem that kills it alltogether. I do not want to write a full review, there are some great features, such as the food-happiness-money triangle that you need to juggle when developing your provinces, but what really kills this game is....The AI. The AI is so extremely dumb in this game, it is unbelievable. Yes, it is a very complex game, I'm sure coding an AI for it is nightmarish anyways, but I believe no matter how rushed the development is, a good AI is quintessential for any strategy game.This makes the game very snowballish (and this is my main point) in singleplayer. After I had 4 whole provinces I was pretty much unstoppable. AI states don't conquer at the same rate as you, although some intersting things can happen (Gauls in Carthage in my last game). So once you become a giant, there are no other giants you could play against. No alliances made to stop the huge Rome (or anyone) from devouring half of Europe. And as I know strategy game balancing, all a higher difficulty level game would do is make the AI cheat harder. My only problem after securing Italy was the occasional food or unhapiness crysis that resulted due to my mismanagement. Now that I have about 12 provinces I'm just not interested in playing the game anymore, because I KNOW that nothing can get in my way. They did TRY to balance this mechanic out, but it was a weak try.It's fun to meddle in on the free weekend, but I wouldn't suggest buying it, especially at full price.			"

												I read all of the negative reviews about this game so it took me a while to pick up the courage to invest in it - Ive played several titles (not Shogun ) and i thought the original  Rome Total War was still the best in terms of playability -especially the battle map interface  ....  Jesus! this game is freekin off the scale awesome 10/10 ..ill be getting Shogun if its supposed to be better !What can i say i bought the game about a week ago and havnt stopped playing it , the battles are just brilliant , its great to zoom in on your troops and hear them chat sit to each other , make jokes , taunts etc - the auto resolve is a great feature too - one where you know the odds before rolling the dice .. ive gotten good at taking a garrison and hiding them to ambush stupid enemy units and when it seems you cannot possibly win - ambushing in the streets means you can chew the enemy piecemeal - and listen in as your guys discuss whats going on .. the graphics are 100 times better than i thought the troop selection is awesome , everything is really smooth even moving troops quickly.The stategic play is really sweet too , just need to read up on best tactics and what to build .. my first three days were spent fighting revolts until i understood the mechanics of what to build and when not to build -as long as the happiness is going green dont build anything - you soon get ""mega rich"" and able to concentrate on fighting those battles with the best troops money can buy ! Also use the diplomacy tab to open trade with any and everyone who is willing -The three Agents are awesome too - but kinda annoying when an enemy champ blocks your path - but its part of the charm . if you like this kind of game its now a must buy - the emperor edition has fixed any previous issues and with modding i could be playing this for years !!!!!

Posted: March 8, 2016
												Ahh, Rome II. I love you so much. I also hate you so much. Let me explain...When I bought Rome II at launch, the game was a mess. Seriously, Total War Arena is far more polished right now and that game has not even entered open beta yet (it just finished closed beta on March 3rd). Still, there was nothing else out at the time that really appealed to me, so I continued to play it through all the patchwork and DLC shananigans that Creative Assembly seems really addicted to right now. Honestly, at the end of the day, the game is not perfect, but it works 100 times better as compared to launch and is entirely fixed as of March 2016 IF subsidized by mods such as the radious mod. I am aware that saying something is made complete or better because of mods does the developer no credit, but do not worry, I will address that elephant in the room at the end of the review. In my oppinion, I can recommend the game today in its current state if you use mods. None of the mods I use are obtained anywhere but steam workshop, where downloading mods takes no effort and is as easy as clicking ""subscribe"". If they required any more effort than that, my review may be different. As things stand however, they do not. The Good:The Setting...The game has an extremely large scale and is a very interesting historical ""what if"" simulator set in the historical period after Alexander the Great's Empire disintegrated and states such as Rome, Persia (not called Persia right now, but trust me, it is) Macedon and Carthage (to name maybe 5% of the faction list in this game) made their bid for expansion in the Ancient World. The setting is really exciting and really sets a mood for expansion and ancient warfare between mighty nations where pretty much anyone could have ruled Ancient Europe, Northern Africa, the Asian Steppes and the Middle East all of the way to India. When you finally reach the end of a game you cannot help but marvel at the size of your empire and all of the epic battle symbols on the terrain and say ""yeah, I built that"". The setting also makes the game incredibly addictive and the feeling of ""one more turn"" is omnipresent. The state of diplomacy in the game is almost completely fixed, and with mods is 100% fixed so that nations respond to rationally, even if you don't see their grand strategy upfront and their actions do not make sense to you in the short term. One game, I was playing as Rome, and I sought a trade agreement with a nearby rival, Massalia, who had expanded but was diplomatically friendly to me. They refused me every time, to my bafflement. However, I later realized that Massalia had no plans of being friendly, as they launched a sneak attack on me by sea right after I became engaged in a war with Carthage, breaking a Non-Agression Pact in the process. Needless to say, things got interesting, and they behaved deviously rationally: a trade agreement with them would have made me a stronger foe in the long term, despite the short term boost in wealth. And that, as they say, simply will not do.The Gameplay...The gameplay, both on the campaign map and in battle are vastly improved, and immensely challenging. Enemy AI, if subsidized by mods, is capable of highly sophisticated flanking maneuvers and uses ranged units to deadly effect right where you don't want them to be. A superior force is no longer a guarantee of victory like it used to be, and this means every engagement is as tense as the last. The political and diplomacy systems are fixed even pre-mod, and make a lot of sense to me. Some people remain baffled by the political system and true, it is poorly explained. But it is not overly complicated I promise you. In short, it is a game of balancing your factions prestige and power with the other factions in the game. Become too powerful, and you will become a dictator that will be despised and subject to uprisings and schemes. Become too weak, and you will be forced out and exiled. The extreme result of either disbalance is a civil war: either from a position of the majority or minority. The catch is that maintaining a balance of power becomes increasingly difficult the larger the empire or potential pie becomes. It really is a cool dynamic when subsidied with mods like 2 turns per year or 4 turns per year that result in almost God like Generals that command the respect of tens of thousands facing off against one another in a political tug of war. Also, the Province system is a huge improvement to the system for land management  in Empire to Shogun 2, and really motivates you to expand quicker so you can control an entire province rather than just part of it in order to capitalize on the bonuses of ""complete"" ownership such as edicts, food bonuses, public order bonuses, and economic bonuses. It really makes me smile when addictiveness is built into a game mechanic that works well on its own already. The Shiny Baubles...The game looks great on higher settings. My PC is 4 years old and I cannot touch ultra on anything except unit textures, building textures, and unit sizes. The game could run better at times, but it is a thing of beuty if you crank the graphics a little bit and have a system that can do it. I am thinking of upgrading my PC soon JUST so I can see this game maxed out. The UI leaves a little to be desired though, and the unit cards are just ugly, albeit historically accurate (the unit cards look like a drawing on an ancient pot or urn). The campagin map looks beautiful though, and it is huge. Attila is a better looking game than this and is optimized better (runs smoother, better load times etc.) but Rome II is still impressive to behold. Overall, Rome II is an excellent addition to the total war series, and becomes crazy addictive once modded out to reach its full potential. The gameplay is fun and challenging both in the campaign map and in battles. The game looks great on high end machines. The setting and sense that you are creating the story of a nation in a historical ""what if"" scneario is immersive and addictive in its own right, but even more so given the time period of epic ancient conquest. This game, unlike so many on the market today, is as much about being ballsy as it is about being smart and cunning. This is why I love it.Too bad CA sucks.The Bad:DLC DLC and what do you know? DLC...The DLC for this game was out of control from day one. Normally I do not mind DLC, as I believe in freedom of choice and the free market, and I honestly have no problem enhancing a product with DLC if the product is complete in its own right out of the gate. The way CA has used DLC however, has perverted the practice to the point where I am not so sure anymore, and I am very sceptical of new games nowadays. CA is certainly not the only party guilty of this in gaming (for an example of the most eggregious customer pillaging to date on consoles, see Destiny and how Bungie flogged anyone stupid enough to get that game out of the gate with shameless DLC flaunting in the season pass), but they are one of the worst. Day One DLC is an abysmal practice in its own right, but when combined with CA selling an incomplete product, using their consumers as free product testors for patchwork, AND dumping DLC behind a pay wall rather than fixing the game, the result is downright buggery on an epic scale. Again, selling DLC = not offensive. Selling DLC for an aplha build that cost 59.99 + lying to consumers  = insulting. The game was not complete until Emperor Edition (one year later), and by then creative assembly had added countless culture packs, expansions, a blood pack that should be standard but is not, and who knows what else. In the end, the game suffered, the fans suffered, and CA laughed its way to the bank. This is why I hate it: CA dropped the ball. Conclusion: buy when on sale. A solid game with a troubled past, but if you like total war, you will like this. With mods, you will love it. Buy it instead of Warhammer TW.			"

												This is finally a finished product after almost 15 patches I can say this game is worth buying at full price. One of my biggest issues with this game is the compartmentilization of the factions and DLC only historical battles. You do not have to buy them to have a great expierence but they DLC's offer a lot and have a hefty price tag for me. Also the fact you cannot make custom maps kills many mods. But this is not only native to Rome 2 so I cannot deter you from this for that it was only a personal grudge. Overall a great Total War game with excellent graphics and good gameplay. I would say 7.5/10 now after 15 patches. The campiagn shines the most when you make it your own and give yourself your own personal objectives. When you make the game your own it gives you much more than you could pay for.			"

												1. I have to mow my lawn in between turns and then I still have time to spare. Every time I think of playing this game I go through a turn and hit end turn.... then after EVERY SINGLE FACTION TAKES TEN SECONDS A PIECE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF BLOODY FACTIONS THAT ARE THE SAME! Then i can take another turn. Dear god if a unit takes over two turns to produce its not worth ever wasting your time the war will be over and you enemy will be using tactical nuclear strikes by then.2. PvP after being non existant at launch its now okay.3. Some races are very imbalanced for example some of the german tribes, they top out at mid game and then just become less and less effective so you had better have rushed for a whole mess of land when you had the chance. 4. Compared to other total war games it feels very mellow, the world map is way too simplistic and the fact that every army must be headed by a general is kind of stupid and removes the ability to simply have scouts/detection forces lying in wait.5. The unit cards are god awefull half the time in battles I have to pause it just so I can tell the difference between units as their unit cards are identicle for the most part with very minor changes. OH THAT HORSE RIDER HAS A PONYTAIL HE IS SUPER HEAVY ARMOR THE ONE WITHOUT IS A BLOODY SKIRMISHER CALVALRY.TL;DR game 6/10 Just go buy shogun 2 with all the expansions for the cost of one dlc for this.

												Lets start off with what this game is comparable to.The first Rome total war spans over a much longer period of time with many more factions. It was much more complex with city management but there was an auto-manage button. The AI wasn't to great but it didnt ruin the game.Now Rome II is garbage.ProsGraphics(as if that would be a reason to buy the game)Prologue was actually funTotal war Encyclopedia in gameGenerals are also politicianConsTutorial teaches you NOTHINGCity managementPoor AIDifficulty JumpAutoresolveNaval SystemConfusing Tech treeConfusing building systemUI is a messDiplomatic AILimited units unless you buy the dlcCan't Merge UnitsMultiplayer bugsLets tackle these individuallyProsThe total war encyclopedia is very helpful when you want to look up a units stats and maybe a little history. It was not helpful however when looking up tech trees and building treesA Cool Aspect of the game is your generals can rise through the ranks of your family as you use themCons-Doing all of the tutorials and they don't teach you about: Tactics, Diplomacy, Politics, Regional management, Unrest.-City management is a confusing mess. Each city has smaller cities part of their region. They all share bonuses(including population). So if you can recruit in one city you can recruit in the whole region. My problem is they don't tell you that. They also don't tell you anything about edicts and the requirements for those. You also can't build things like walls in sub-cities(I am looking at your Jerusalem)-The AI is consistently dumb. Sometimes they get stuck on boats when doing a landing, and sometimes the enemies general will walk to the edge of the map and stay there. Your long term ""Friends"" will betray you instantly if you don't have your cities well guarded(even if you share a common enemy).-There is a massive difficulty jump when switching from any faction besides Rome. Rome can just walk across the map, but you can easily spend 50 turns doing nothing as the germans or british. This is because each city has a large garrison and they can reinforce armies.-In Rome 2 they added a little more control over autoresolve. However autoresolve has no idea how to judge your odds. 1 extra group for the enemy will drop your chances down to 1/5. Also expert units don't seem to make a difference, and you can destroy anyone with just a ton of slingers.-The naval system is completely over powered. Each ship carries a full set of troops that can get off their boats and attack cities. Even if you kill an entire unit the boat doesn't disappear. They also require less researches to get epic boats(including onagers).-The tech tree and buildings are mostly unique to the faction(which is a plus) but it offers no advice on what to get or what future things offer. Sometimes you can unlock powerful unique troops by getting a religous building but you wont know unless you make those choices. The tech tree is split up into obscure categories that don't offer you any real reason to go for a specific tech when you start. Unless you know what everything unlocks you will find yourself starting a research when you can't build something, and you have to waste time to advance.-The user interface is so confusing and is very pointless. You will find yourself search through all the tabs just to figure out why you are having a civil war. You can easily ignore most of the buttons until you have a problem because the tutorial doesn't go over the interface at all, and you won't bother figuring them all out because some of them do nothing.-Diplomacy is probably the most frustrating thing in the entire game. Your allies will betray you. You sometimes have to pay thousands of gold for a non-agression pact. Sometimes people from across the world will give you money and ask for ridiculous things(like an alliance). Some people will completely refuse to trade even if you offer 4k gold. Their diplomats will want something but via audio will insult you.-You are seriously limited in gameplay unless you buy dlc. More then half the nations you cannot play.-You can't merge injured units(like in the previous games). I even went out of my way to look this up. You have to either disband them all and re-recruit or what like 8 turns in a city.-In Multiplayer, desyncs were frequent and sometimes you will find out 10 turns in the future that you desynced ruining the save. You have to start over or manually send them the save file.Overall, This game was a huge disappointment. I have played all the total wars and beaten them all except this one. The most I'd pay for this broken unfocused game is 10 bucks with all the dlc. It is seriously disappointing that their is so much dlc and they still want 60 bucks for this game. They seem to have invested in things that the total war fans don't care much about. If you have any interest in playing a total war game save your time and money and just play shogun 2 which is a much more polished and focused game. Rome 2 was a catastophic failure and couldn't deliver on any level of satisfaction. With buggy AI and completely lame intricacies this game has destroyed my hopes for this series, and alienated me with Creative Assembly's future projects.			"

												Rome 2: Totaly UnderwhelmingThis game has a lot of potential, but the poor optimization and many bugs makes the game a lot harder to enjoy than it's predecessor. As a huge total war fan, it's a shame to see the sequel to one of the best strategy games ever (Rome: Total War) be released in such a poor state, and still not be fixed. The graphics are good, and a lot of the idéas put into the game are brilliant on paper, but the poor execution makes for a lot of frustration. the game is also overly convoluted at times, making it unnecessarily hard to find information might be crutial in a grand-strategy game.But all of this, and the games poor AI, are problems that we have seen in other total war games as well. Some have gotten bigger in this installment, some have been improoved, and some have stayed the same. So the real issue I have with this game, is not in the gameplay itself, because I actually enjoy it more than many of the other games in the series. My big issue with this game, is the poor performance. I have pretty decent rig, and so does a lot of my friends, but the trend i keep seeing, is that whether or not you get a good performance seems to be a total coin toss... And, a fatal bug, causes the game to stutter like crazy (without the actual framrate dropping) whenever the units have pathfinding issues. This is especially prominent in sige battles (mostly in barbarian settlements, but also occurs in any large scale battle) this occurs even on te lowest settings, and I'm running this on a 680M and with an i7 processor, so I should be able to run the game at OK settings at least. CA have stated on their website that they are aware of the issue, and even said in one of the patch notes that the issue should be resolved, but as the patches grow fewer, and the problem percists, my hope for the game to ever be truly playable for me are diminishing. This came as a big shock to me, especially since Shogun 2 (and every other total war game for that matter) runs silky smooth, even on the highes settings. I realise that Rome 2 is more demanding than Shogun 2, but when I can't even run it on the lowest settings there is clearly a problem. As of the time I'm writing this, CA still havent fixed the problem, but I'm still hoping for a fix. If they would resolve this issue, Rome 2 could easily become one of my favourite strategy games, but when the performance is so poor, it just makes all the other little anoyances so hard to deal with, and therefore I canno't recommend this. But as I said, I hope CA resolves this issu, so I, and anyone else with this issue, can once again be proud to call oureselves total war fans. (Sorry for poor grammar)			"

												As a long-time player and collector of Total War games, I am extremely disappointed with the direction this company has taken. This game is incomplete without buying all the DLC, the cost of which almost amounts to that of the game itself. Upon entering the game you are pestered with notifications to buy the rest of the game and it is this fact that irks me the most. It is like you have spent 80 bucks for a demo. It saddens me to say I won't be buying the next Total War, I'm done after this plus the fiasco that was Shogun 2.TL;DR: $79.95 (Initial Purchase, Basically a demo) + $64.93 (DLC) = $144.88 for a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥(Rome II).

												One of those games where you can spend a lot of hours constantly having fun. However the game is not balanced at all. If you want to play vanilla mode you will get a hard time my friend unless you're playing as Rome. Modded version is way more enjoyable and it's fixing a lot of basic problems in the game. Multiplayer is unplayable, lagging, disconnecting etc. And yes, the great DLC politics is (in my opinion) not working how it should work but still for prety high amout of money you can get new units (that sucks) and new campain modes (thats cool). However (again), in the middle of game (even at legendary difficulty) when you have around 40% of world game is not challenging anymore. You're just pushing it into 100%.

												I am thoroughly enjoying this game. The Emperor Edition has ironed out most if not all major bugs and the game runs smoothly on my new but fairly low end laptop (new i7 chip 6500U, Nvidia 940MX graphics card, 4 GB dedicated RAM, 8 GB DDR4 RAM). I am mainly playing multiplayer and it is a blast. The classical era has lots of different units like hoplites, phalanx, swordsmen, chariots, elephants, slingers, peltasts and all else.. This makes it fun to play. To be honest, I also have Warhammer Total War and this is much better on multiplayer for me at least. The multiplayer community is quite large and I never have to wait long for battles. I also notice that most mp battles are stable and there are not so many crashes compared to older Total War games. As this game is a few years old I would urge you to get it and play it while the online community is still thriving. 9/10 from me.			"

Decided to give it a second chance and started another campaign (starting a new campaign fixes the camera).  Don't even think to maybe play a battle instead of auto-resolving it unless you want to have extreme lag and I'm not even joking like every 2-3 seconds the units froze. Even more frustration. Oh and I forgot, the A.I. is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as f*ck (4 groups of hoplites took over 10 minutes too kill ONE enemy group of hoplites, and yes I did surround them.). Also a few noticable freezes happened during the game that made it crash. The game is a waste of time. I wouldn't suggest buying it. Only thing that was fun was playing on the world map, until the camera controls died ofcourse.			"

												If you like the first Rome Total War game, you'll love this one. I recommend it, but have given it a thumbs down because of the DLC.I love this game, you can see that through my hours of game time. It's an excellent sequel to the original 2004 game. They've done everything better...except the damn DLC. It's totally pathetic that they create and entire game, sell you 60% of it, and sell the rest off as tiny bits of DLC. Because of this I had to wait until the game was on sale so I could swallow my pride and buy the blood and gore add-on for 60c. They've done exactly the same with Attila. Only buy this game if it's on sale, then you can get all the extras without breaking your wallet.			"

												As a devoted fan of the Total War series since Shogun I, I can safely say that this game is the worst of the franchise, by far. Everything is so terrible that it is as if they chose to remove everything that made the success of the previous Total Wars. - The worst of all for me is the dumbed down interface. It is now a small window in the bottom of the screen where you can barely see anything. It looks like they designed this game for consoles instead of PC, and the result is catastrophic. Forget about the detailed menus of the previous opuses, you have now a 200 pixel wide screen where you build your buildings.- The buildings, precisely, have been oversimplified into a few categories. Forget about the shrines, temples, blacksmiths, training fields, schools, etc.; the building tree is gone.- Family members have disappeared, there is no character traits. It's replaced by generals that you can clone indefinitely.- You cannot split your armies, once an army is created it's there for ever.- Combats are lame because the IA is terrible. They are also far too fast. Big battles are over in 5 minutes. Strategy is useless.- Diplomacy is annoying because the IA is unpredictable, they always refuse to even trade with you.- Diplomats are gone.- Even the campaign map is weird with these cities that are so big, Syracuse can take up to one third of Sicily...- I could go on for hours. The last nail in the coffin is the scandalous, vicious, obnoxious DLC policy, which locks the Greek factions whereas they are already in the game, so you have to pay for something that is already included in the first package. Shame on you SEGA. Shame on you.tl;dr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Even the mods can't save this game.If you want an upgraded Rome TW experience, download the mod for Medeval II called Europa Barbarorum II: http://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?743622-Announcement-Europa-Barbarorum-II-2-2h-released!

												As Total War games go, I feel fairly justified in referring to this one as the worst so far. Probably the most disappointing aspect is that it fails to live up to its older brother, the original Rome: Total War since the Creative Assembly decided to take the original Rome game, improve the graphics and then make it worse in every other possible way. That cool feature allowing you to see a city on the battle map outside of combat? Gone. Family trees? Gone. About the only decent thing added is naval combat and the ability to perform amphibious landings, but the glitches therein where the AI are concerned do tarnish that somewhat (the AI likes to land troops on the beach and then just leave them standing there).Even the helpful information pieces on each unit and building to tell you what each of them do and to provide historical context has been moved to an online service, so if you don't have an internet connection you have no idea what anything does until you can build it. Honestly, what was wrong with just having that as part of the game?Then there's the fact that the game has glaring mechanical issues too - perhaps most pronounced in the closed system of the Britannic tribes, where often times if you start as the Iceni you can find yourself in a ridiculous stalemate where everyone has a 20 stack of identical units and can't take anybody else's city because of the garrisons and can't build more/better units due to a lack of cash. The root cause of this ofc is the fact that even across cultures all the units are fundamentally the same - they're all either swordsmen, spearmen, cavalry or missile units, and since all the units are equally terrible it comes down to a simple matter of whoever has the most men wins - which may be fairly accurate historically but it doesn't make for an enjoyable experience in-game, particularly since you can't have any more than 20 units per army.The blandness of the uni choices is further compounded by the fact that a lot of the abilities and formations don't do what they're supposed to; the testudo is underpowered if not totally useless and when last I checked the shield wall had literally no effect whatsoever.I'd recommend the original Rome: Total War game over this (or any other Total War game really if you're not set on the time period) any day of the week.

												As with almost all Total War releases, its (currently) buggy, and unplayable. The combat is more faster-paced and units blob together, making formation attacks almost useless. They removed some features and functions from previous total war games and made it more streamlined. The devs have been making patches so all the problems should remedy itself in a few months.

												While many enjoy the Total War games because of their unique blend of real-time strategy combat and standard-setting visuals or their incredibly high production values, what makes them truly fantastic is that one can easily invest hundreds of hours into just one entry of the series and likely never grow tired of its addicting mix of fighting and management. I have spend many hours on Rome II and yet I still keep coming back for more. Whether it be to try a new faction, a different early game strategy, change up my research priorities, focus more on naval prowess rather than raw manpower, empower trade over combat as a continent-spanning empire or mix up my tactics in the battles themselves. The Total War games are packed with content, like the unique scenario battles that represent a key conflict in history, narrative campaigns and tutorial campaigns that each require a few hours or more of your time at the very least while presenting a mostly distinct experience, many entirely separate factions each with their own various traits at both a regional and cultural level, and the grand campaigns.Each of these is a massive undertaking and has almost endless permutations for the path to total victory, dependent on any number of the factors mentioned above. You can even use the skirmish battle system to try out all different tactics and unit combinations from any of the numerous factions present in the game against a battle AI that you can freely adapt to your tastes in terms of difficulty. Lastly, Rome II offers an expansive suite of multiplayer options to back up its gargantuan single-player offerings, allowing you to play challenging battles against your friends or compete for global domination through the usual turn-based campaign system, even if the multiplayer isn't as functional as I would like! I have put many hours in every single Total War game and each new entry is both fresh enough and packed with quality to easily justify that kind of investment time and again - truly, this is a franchise that knows how to eat up the small hours of the day. If ever you needed a game to kill time in while trying out multiple different approaches to victory, allowing you to succeed either through making friends or destroying enemies in equal measure, then Rome II has been tailor made to match your desires.

												Total War: ROME II has experienced many release issues, that is true. I remember having shadows too dark and are pure black and don't show the textures behind them, or units that are just too dense for proper collision after a charge.The condition of the game in its release date was unbearable. Many could'nt play the game at all.However, CA has been comitted to the release of patches for the game. They fixed graphical issues, unit formations, performance and optimisation, shock cavalry, testudo (to some extent), and many other functions.Today, the game is still in a state that needs further optimisation and and fixes, however, when compard to the game's original state, one does not deny the improvements.Some people have been complaining some patch has made their game not work, either freezes or splash screen loading screen taking forever. Personally, I had minimal encounters with such issues.When buying the game, do not expect the game CA displayed in the battle of Teutoburg forest or the siege of Carthage. Yes, the game has improved, but the pre-release displayed content was perhaps heavily scripted, etc.AI was completely broken during the original version, but now with recent patches, the AI is better. The AI now flanks correctly for example. Siege AI however is still broken, despite yet noticable improvements with patch 8.1. Many people blame CA for the game's release conditions. I disagree with them. SEGA is the problem. They pressurised CA into releasing the game earlier than it should have been, perhaps to get it out before the release of next-gen consoles.There have been many diplomatical functions stipped out of the game. Diplomacy is now very simple. Players complained alot about the game in its release stange, that was understandable, but now, people overdo it. Whiners are many, and sometimes even are wrong. Despite the game's problems, it deserves much less hate.Despite what I said negatively about the game, I still recommend it. The game is enjoyable and very fun. Improvements have been made and more will be. The game now very rarely desyncs in multiplayer, and lags much less. I am confident that CA will keep patching the game until it's in a near perfect stage, just like Total War: Shogun 2.I hope you learned a thing or two about my feeling towards the game, and are more confident in your choice in wether to buy the game or not. I tried to be as unbiased as possible.			"

												This game is getting a thumbs down from me for many reasons. One the whole reason this game is supposed to be better than other stradegy games, is the pormise of being able to play on the battle feild. Whenever I try to run this,however, my whole system freezes. I tried this on a PC and a Mac running a PC V.E. Second, the game randomly freezes. This happens a lot whenever I am playing the game. Not sure if it's just me or more people, but it's really frusterating. When the game is running properly I really do enjoy the game, but with freezes and system crashes. I just can't put up with it.			"

												While not the strongest of the TOTAL WAR games, it is still fun to play.  It expands on the diplomatic aspects and with the DLC adds some interesting scenarios, but it will also frustrate you, especially some of the AI enemies (and in multiplayer) that amplify the annoyance with heroes and diplomats doing far more damage than any army could ever do.The battle tactics are pretty good, but the AI must be watched, to keep your armies intact and doing what you want them to do.  Diehards to the TOTAL WAR series will want this game in their arsenal, but may prefer Rome 1; new players should probably get Rome 1 first, and get Rome 2 when they become diehards or want the bump in graphics at the cost of some game play.Either way, wait for a sale.6/10			"

												The game is decent, but in no way worth of 55€.The game has improved qutie much since release, but there are still many problems with it, the greatest of which are the horrible and often even confusing UIs and most factions, and even some of the most interesting factions, like Galatians, Armenians and Greeks, being DLC. If those factions and their unique units were available in the base game, I would be ready to purchase the game for maybe 20€. 50+ € is just way too much for such a lackluster.			"

												Ok, afyer abandoning this game at launch becuase of the horrible AI, Campaign, and multiplayer i must say....this game is FINALLY WORTH BUYING!! The AI is actually a decent challenge on very hard to legendary difficulty. The AI make Armies and fleets with power behind them and usually attempt to out number you 2 to 1, sometimes it's 3 to 1 and it is almost impossible to win unless your units are all elite and have amazing ranks (which wouldn't happen cause you wopuld be in serious debt) The senate mechanics actually mean something now. The only thing i wish they would put in this game is a option that you can force another faction to make peace with another faction.....too bad they didnt do that. The game runs great now after the countless of optimization patches they have released. The modding community makes this game fun as hell to play and makes your campaign experience much better cause most people use mods that make the construction and unit build times better. Overall I think i have said enough, It is time to start playing this game again cause now you are finally missing out. Believe me you will no longer regret buying this game and will play it for countless hours. I also recommend buying the DLC pirates and raider becuase in multiplayer if they are used right , they can be extremly deadly. The multiplayer is decent now and connection issues are mostly resovled!My final rating for this game with mods is a 10/10 becuase there is so much more added content wiseThis game in vanilla state had managed to achieve a 9/10, still a good rating to be honest.This game overall i would give a 9/10, it's entertaining, fun, sometimes difficult, and just plain awesome. Don't listen to the haters, take it from me, a total war fan for more then a decade. This isn't the best total war and it sure wasn't at launch...but it's making it's way up there....slowly but surely			"

												Well well. Here we are. This game is not a masterpiece. But has lots of good parts in it besides being completely different from the older totalwars.+The new castle/city building+Army training+Champions and diplomats ( with awesome system of Cunning/Authority/Zeal which exists for the commanders too)+Awesome designed Tribes ( do not count the dlc's, it looks like they didn't even try to create new faces neither battle style)+Rome+Conquering Rome has an aditinal cutscene <3+bureaucracy and controling your generals and authorities is more important and dangereous than before+awesome technology improving ( every nation has it's own style )+Graphics look shining, espacially from general's view. ( CHAAARGE FORWAAAARD! )+New army march styles!+PLAYABLE WITH ONE FRIEND!+ Diplomacy is way way way way better than the older games-- Unfortunetly, the battles don't feel right as the old games, It's slow or too complicated looking that you won't get the rage or satisfaction of war--Unit and commander vocalization litteraly sucks. I don't know why they did it but there is no legionary yelling at your face ""THE VICTORYY IS O*sound crack* OURSSS! or some old warrior telling you how our man♥♥♥♥♥♥♥their warlord. Breaking the concept really badly.--Civil war is a huge dissapointment ( you can check it out from videos )-Hoplites-Some of the dlc tribes are unplayable, you basically cannot win with them ( not having any spear unit and facing macedonians is not the best way to start a campaign )-Selling culture packs?!-Hoplites-Hoplites-Some of the most awesome tribes are not playable-AI can be completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ most of the times. So try to play at higher difficulty, so atleast you can have a bit opponent in front of you.( half of the negatives are joke. Don't get edgy )			"

												My review may be somewhat biased by the fact that this game no longer actually runs, but instead pretends to only to freeze my entire computer up and make me reboot it, but that's besides the point. Rome 2 is up there with the great gaming♥♥♥♥♥♥ups  of recent years; in fact, I'll go so far to say it's the Aliens:Colonial Marines of strategy - a game hoped for with a naive twinkle in my youthful eyes, but resulting in only despair and depression. If you haven't played Total War games before, give it a whirl, it's your money and I won't tell you wat to do with it, but if you've followed the series from the beginning like me, I wouldn't touch this steaming turd of a strategy game with a barge pole coated in a mixture of bleach and antiseptic.My advice to you is to go and buy Medieval 2 or, if it's the Rome setting you seek, Rome 1, for a fraction of the price, and then marvel and the quality a game released many many years ago compared to the rank, cesspit sniffing induced halucniations that must've been discussed in board meetings at CA. Also, Rome 1 and Med 2 have a funny business practice many people may appreciate, in that to have what feels like (or should in Rome 2's case) a full game ( or indeed a completely new game by Jove!), you only need one or two very ceap, very expansive add ons, compared to the plethora of content that should be in a base game but SEGA and CA have kindly decided you should pay around £7 for.Anyway, long and the short of it in my eyes is that Rome 2 just does not measure up to A) what was seemingly promised and B) a game released 10 years ago (in fact, I would rate Shogun1 and Medieval 1 far higher).

												Here is my experience with this mother*#$%:I've been addicted to the total war series since I first played Rome 1. I've loved these games unconditionally and went straight to the local games shop to preorder when I heard that there would be a sequal to the legendary rome title.Firstly, when it was released and I went to collect my pre-order, for some reason 'there were no DLC codes left' for me to collect my additional context (which was the Greek cultures pack). I don't know or care if it is the retailer or the supplier or whoever that buggered that up, what I care about is seeing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ price on the DLC pack in my library every day even though I went to the effort of pre-ordering and paying the whopper pre-order price. So that was the first little slap in the face.Anyway, this story gets far worse. I'm from South Africa and the bandwidth ain't so good here. I get like 100 KB/s on average downloading context through steam. You heard me, 100 KILOBYTES. Im sure you know what is coming next. I install the flipping 30gb or whatever onto my computer and fire it up like a giddy child at christmas. Unfortunatelly, it is bug-littered like you can't believe as we all know. Soon enough the gargantuan patch comes out - 5 gigabites or so if I remember. This naturally takes about a week to download, with my laptop on and connected 24 hours a flipping day. Literally, it just sat downloading in my room for around a week,  keeping me awake at night and highly frustrated. EVENTUALLY, the patch downloads. Is the game fixed? NOPE. its hanging and taking forever to change turns and weird patches of black are rendering on the map and AI is stuffed ETC ETC ETC we've heard it before. And my machine is WELL above the reccommended specificantions (not the minimum specifications, the recommended specifications). At the same time, something went wrong with the synching between my steam account and the game, so that my achievements stopped unlocking (something I seem to care about although I can't explain why). I look everywhere online and the only solution seems to be clear out the local content. I KNOW RIGHT, CLEAR THE !*$#*&%! LOCAL CONTENT. DESPERATE to get my monies worth (if you think this game is expensive, try converting $60 into South African Rands!), I eventually decide to clear local content. After deleting the game, however, another patch was announced, and I simply counld't muster the emotional strength to try and reinstall and download all the s*&$ neccessary to get this game to SIMPLY RUN. It has been sitting on my shelf ever since, a painful reminder of the godawful experience of trying to play the game and the unholy waste of my money that it was. I literally spent about 1/4 of my monthly income on this title. Everyday I get a flare of anger when that f*&*!@# Rome II box blinks in the corner of my eye and I think to myself, *@#! you CA and everyone involved. I don't give a crap if it has been finally updated to a playable level in 'the emperor edition' - it is still about 2 weeks of downloading and a sea of negative feels away from me ever bothering to try this game again. In total, excluding loading and crash times, I probably squeezed about 10 pitiful hours of painfully buggy and interrupted 'play' out of this disgrace. I don't even know if the game is good, because I  never got to really play it, although most people seem to say its crap compared to previous titles anyway.   In conclusion, if you live in a developing country with crap internet, and were as excited to play this game as I was - throw away you commemorative Roman tunic, or better yet, just hang yourself with it.

												Dear CitizensAlmost a year has passed after its release.Total War: Rome II is beautiful, but yet unfinished. CA does support the game and come up regularly with an equal amount of excellent, but also with very questionable content. The modding tools for Total War: Rome II are present and easy to use. However the actual modding is still very limited and when I say very limited I mean very limited.Expecting constant support for years, more modding tools to be released, modding restriction to be lifted and Total War: Expansions to add to the shallow game design I do recommend this game.If in question, simply stay tuned and consider buying it in one or two years, once we have more informations and being able to prove or disprove my expectations.CheersAlec			"

Posted: June 22, 2016
												Total War: Rome II is alright. Having only owned a few of the Total War titles, I may not have the best impression, but Rome II just feels a little different. While Total War games have steadily grown more complex, it usually maintains an accessible feel. And despite being complex, its rather elegant, meaning that its complexity is easy to learn and master. Rome II just doesn't have that feel. Actions and decisions are buried beneath menu after menu, and the screen feels extremely cluttered compared to the Total War games I've play. I also got a bad impression by the Prologue/Training Sequence; I'm not the best Total War player, but then again I'm not terrible, but the Prologue seemed very demanding and expected a lot of the player. There was also a lot that the Prologue didn't do a good job of explaining and I found it very difficult to balance management and conquest. However, I do appreciate that the game is actually a little more tactical than previous titles, at least for me. Playing Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai, I found myself relying too much on autoresolve and during actual battles I felt that I could strategize that much. In Rome II, I found that singular units can tip the battle in your favor, that you have to use hand-made formations and the terrain to prepare a better defense. I found myself actually taking the time during deployment to survey the field to see how I could use it and how the enemy could as well. I have to wrack my brain sometimes to figure out to claw entrenched units. I also appreciate that autoresolve, despite being more refine and choice-driven, is still not as good as getting your hands dirty. But still, Rome II has its flaws. I found that the management side to be less accessible and events that unfolded I didn't really understand. It honestly felt like it took care of itself. I also couldn't find a faction/group that I identified in as compared to other titles. It doesn't help that many of the tribe factions, such as Britannic or Germanic, have less options for the player, and it's very difficult to manage your armies and your land against multiple threats. I know its part of the challenge, but it makes it difficult for players who don't want to play as the more refined factions, and I don't feel like spending that much money on DLC.Rome II runs well and it looks great, but there's a lot missing that I enjoyed from older titles and a lot that's there now that just isn't that well done. But at the end of the day, all that matters is if it's fun. And yes, Rome II is fun, despite its flaws. Its fun to watch two Germanic tribes duke it out on a hillside until nothing is left except for your bloody yet victorious army.			"

												Well, its a very good game overall, the release of the game was horrible with tons of bugs but most of them are now fixed, but it took so many patches. But the fu*****ing dlcs, its becoming not acceptable as all dlcs together cost more than the normal game, some of them add its 3 factions and 1 campaign, other add 3 factions and some only add some bad units.... And even a BLOOD dlc!!!!! Thats not acceptable, the dlcs are really expensive and add too little, and lots of things that were added in Shogun 2 were basicallly removed from the game, Sega and Creative Assembly STOP!!! Dont fu*** up total war, do Expansions!!!! not those bad dlcs that just add facions that shouldve been on the game!!! Even Rome 1 had more factions the Rome 2 wthout dlcs...  This is still a good game and i recommend it, but total war is becoming a cash grab and i dont know for how long this will continue, Attila already has 1 dlc announced and probably 1 blood dlc to be realeased as the animations shown in the gameplays dont have any blood.

												I got to play this game on a free trial. I love strategy games. This game seemed like fast food. It was was really good at first but after I had logged a couple of hours, I realized it was a game lacking quality.I missed shogun and Empire releases but I always loved rome one. It seems that  a lot of the things that made TW great have been abandoned it this game. Its called total war but the game limits your armies. The interface seems to have gone downhill a lot. Unit cards are poorly drawn and confusing, as well as many things with the menu. The menus and cards take up lots of the screen on the Battle map. The whole setup is crude. The charge of unit is way too hard to pull off and most of the time does not. I encountered this in Medieval 2 but you could still pull off many charges in that.In short, good way abandoned for quick profits, lazy game design, and a lot of other quality work missing. It deos not live up to its name. I might pay 10$ for this, But I probably will not. Sorry TW ya messed it up			"

												 I just had to write a review about this, I will try not to rage and make it as helpful as I can.to be honest, this game has huge potential, it looks more steamlined, better map and some nice new functions, way better graphics which can be boosted a lot more even.Negatives :I will start with the campaign.In every total war game, the player has always been more or like a target for the enemy AI, however in rome 2 this is absurdly so.I understand they want to make the game challenging, but if you start as iceni for example and 4 factions declare on you in the first 20 turns and camp your harbour with 5 stacks. well this makes the game a drag.I have played many campaigns already and abandoned most, I found that diplomacy is broken completly,  Allied Ai will drag you in useless wars and then the game will mass declare on you.No one ever really wants to trade with you or form a alliance unless you pay up.Second is the agents of the AI.They are able to damage your settlement causing 4 buildings to burn, each repair costs 400-1200.they will do this every 2 turns and sometimes 4 agents will camp your capital while 2 more roam your territory. FMLBattles :Insanely beautiful to see ( with gore dlc and mod ) Battles become epic with no matched combat mod.Without mods, will lets just say this feels like a tetris game, you will form a line and the enemy will form up against that line.at least 3-12 units of slingers and max 2-3 units of cav will rain death on your units.First moves from AI are always to flank you, first time it took me by suprise but after 20 times I know to just send spears to the flank, after that I can flank with my leftover spears and my own cavs.Once you rout their slingers its GG.Siege battles : 3-4 units will torch your gates and get wasted.They will mass rush your gate and then their numbers are meaningless ( which is good since they always siege  every single city with 2 stacks minimum, I noticed they usually send 1 stack close, then the second and then a small third army which will attack you. )Number crush will happen in the gates, take boiling oil and its GG.Ladders they do use, however if you charge them while using ladders they will never form back up again. GGThey hit the walls with 5 units, those rout and they will never send backup GGMy suggestion for this game :Mods mods mods and a new engine lol.I still have faith, always			"

												I't started out bad, really bad. The game was half made. But that made a great opportunity for modders to make great mods and play around. And now the game is fixed and it's magical. Never been so happy for a total war game before and now im on 684 hours of gameplay :/ I cry when I see how much time I've wasted on a single game but I have enjoyed every second of it.  I'd reccomend a good computer for the game.Sincerly a satisfied Total War fan.			"

												im a fan of the Total War series and Rome 2 Total War is a worthy successor of Rome (1) Total War.i love to play the Roman Empire but i think that the Romans have too strong units and if you dont play them they will lose miserably but i love the Barbarian Fractions like the Germanic Suebi or the Celtic Iceni also.what i miss in Rome 2 Total War is the family tree, like in Rome (1) TW or Medieval 2 TW...but its still an awesome Game. 9/10.

												Has now played Total War: Rome II in over 200 hours and I can only say that it's a wonderful game. The game's graphics and its many cultures makes the game an exciting game that you do not tire of.The game deserves better rating than it has received, Total war Rome II has so many bugs in the beginning, but what game does not have it. But they've fixed a lot of bugs so the game is in very good shape.It is absolutely the best strategy game that's out thereWorth buying? Yes do it :)			"

												The game itself is great now compared to release, however, Sega is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ publisher.Only get this game if it's on sale.The fact there is a DLC for adding blood and gore graphics in the game (a standard graphics option for most games) should be the first alarming factor. The fact that there is $85.90 worth of DLC should be a huge red flag, Sega is just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as EA when it comes to DLC if not even worse.This type of business model is what has destroyed the gaming industry over time, wait until a sale happens to pick this game up. It's a fun game, but it is not worth paying full price for to support such a crooked and corrupt business model. Remember Sega is the same publisher that allowed Alien: Colonial Marines to happen and pretty much gave the community the middle finger after the chaos that ensued along with Gearbox.Edit: If you want more justification as to why to only buy this game during a sale, look at the current Total War: Warhammer, the DLC is already at $30+ with only 3 months of the game being released and the reviews quickly went from mostly positive to mixed because of it. The game is great, however, Sega's demands as a publisher is ridiculous with the DLC policy. Do not pay full price for this game or any Total War game that follows the abhorrent DLC policy of Sega.

												I've played this game a fair amount offline as well, as a fan of older Total War titles and in this time period itself.Just don't buy the game.The only advances CA has made to the TW series have seem to be just Graphical in nature.You could see it as a trend from Empire an Shogun, that the AI just wasn't able to cope, the difference is that the package is far tighter. So whereas it was noticeable, it didn't detract from the experience.Death moves are the only way units die, what's the point of having 200 men against 200 men when only a few die at any given time due to some perversion for Homeric style combat instead of actual battles and their respective battle lines being fought across (Force upon the playing, ironically by the new focus on graphical improvements and motion capture.)Units have no weight, a charging mass of cavalry or elephants has no real impact on the units they are charging.If you want a better Rome Total war experience, stick to R:TW or M:TW with a mod to emulate the Classical era.

												Here we go again.Rome 2 did not have a pleasant launch, but after lots of fixes and some really lame DLC (Seriously, I have to pay to play as ATHENS? SPARTA? You have got to be kidding me), it is done. Or at least it won't be getting anymore updates despite the fact that there is still at least one thing (broken achievements) that need fixing. But with Attila out and this Warhammer thing coming soon... I doubt CA or SEGA cares about this game anymore.Shame too since it's not bad. Since Shogun 2 got the series back on track and back into the realm of the more melee-centric combat CA is just better at doing AI for, Rome 2 generally does well.... mostly. Melee combat in this game seems rather overpowered, or rather ranged combat just does not seem to do much damage before the big melee brawl begins. This means that any faction that traditionally relied upon arrows and stuff to do much of it's work is at something of a disadvantage... unless you are the Parthians or someone else with awesome horse archers. But if you don't have speedy horses, or you play as a nation that relies more on ""skirmisher"" ranged units that are mainly on foot, then prepare to be eaten by the melee juggernaut that is Rome or any country lucky enough to have Macedonian-style Pikemen. That's not to say that you can't win. You can. It just will be rough.Do I sound bitter? Well, I sort of am. And the reason for it lies in one of the game's historical battles that, because of the game mechanics I described above, is basically impossible to do as it was done in reality. Which battle do you ask? Cannae. Yes, that Cannae. The legendary victory Hannibal won by using a smaller and more lightly equipped army of ~50,000 to surround and annihilate an entire Roman army of ~80,000 men. To make that work you need to have your center, consisting mainly of lighter troops, manage to not have their morale break as they fall back until you are able to use your elite troops on the wings and your horseys to close the Romans in. Except... your center is going to get eaten alive by that giant mass of Romans. Even if you get far enough to close the net (and I did), it all went to hell once the center broke and the Romans were able to then eat their way out of this encirclement. One of the most famous battles of all time... and I had to win it by exploiting the game mechanics (which has the Roman Army march straight ahead for a while no matter where your actual troops are) and forcing all the Roman troops to chase my lighter troops all over the map until I was able to pounce on them after they got exhausted. Even then, it was a mess.So CA messed up one Historical Battle. Who cares? Who even plays HB's anyway? Well, I do for one since they are neat and some of them have been very well done (See most of the ones in Napoleon). Even so, I concede that the campaigns are where the meat of this game lies. And in that regard... well it's mostly good. It takes times to get used to the new city management stuff in order to balance out things to make sure the people are happy, fed, and paying you the monies you need to FIGHT EVERYBODY - because you will be fighting lots of people in this game. But that isn't a problem because, well, it's Total War and all that. The whole point is to fight people. o_oMy biggest problem with the campaign part of the game lies in the AI's -very- heavy tendency to use force march to dash little armies all over the map running just out of range of the armies I have chasing after them. Unless you can corner them, the AI can just keep doing this over and over, particularly at sea, with you having great difficulty in managing to force them into a battle at all. Unless you do one of two things. First, you can deliberately weaken your own forces so the AI decides to attack you rather than flee. You still will deal with AI armies and fleets running around, but some will attack you at least. The other thing I ended up doing was to take a city/town, then leave it open and undefended to temp one of these AI roamers to attack it, and then (since you can't really move with the army that takes a city after it has done so that turn) eat them when they can't escape. I find all of this... rather annoying. >_>'Oh yes... those victory conditions. Can't forget those. Makes every campaign game take a very long time. And there are soooo many factions to get achievements for. ;_;The battles themselves, aside from the stuff I wrote above about how the game seems better geared towards melee combat, is fine. Lots of variety in the unit types, and the distinctions between the different cultural groups in terms of their strengths and weaknesses add quite a bit of variety to the tactics you have to fight against. The AI still does stupid AI things you can exploit, but at least they can put up a decent challenge at other times. On land at least. At sea... well. Lets just say that ramming ships very much became my tactic of choice. It made most naval battles, even when the odds were stacked against me, pretty easy. I had more difficulty with having my ships getting stuck on the wreckage of enemy ships and being unable to move than by any real opposition the enemy put up. Oh well. At least the land battles are cool.So... overall impressions? Fairly mixed with a positive leaning, as it was with TW games during it's Empire/Napoleon days. Rome 2 does stuff right with being a competent game that has fun battles, but then annoys me with it's AI armies running all over and how the game's battles seem much more favorable to melee-heavy factions like the Romans or Greeks (unless you are the Parthians or some other horse archer country). One last negative is the volume of DLC SEGA put out for this game. Yes it's kinda neat to play so many different varied factions, but some of the factions that ended up being gated by DLC (Athens, Sparta) really should have been playable from the start. Rome 2 is a major offender when it comes to excess DLC, and SEGA seems all too happy to continue that trend into the future. ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. >_>As for the DLC campaigns, i'll review those individually. I still need to play some of them to see how they are anyway. If nothing else, you can certainly get your money's worth out of Rome 2. There's enough stuff to do in this game to keep you playing for a -very- long time. Or at least until you get bored or aren't a crazy achievement-hunter like me.So... this gets a ""yes"" from me while I frown slightly at CA for some of it's mistakes and glare at SEGA for all it's DLC. This is a competent game, but I still prefer Shogun 2 even if this game has -way- more variety with it's factions.Get this on a sale if you want it. It seems to end up on sale often enough, and you don't want to buy all that stupid DLC for full price. Trust me on that.Bwee...			"

												Total War^tm: Rome 2 is to me both fantastic and deeply, deeply disappointing. It revamps territory, politics, military infrastructure and armies amongst other things, but the changes more than not are either not radical enough or just worse. To be more specific:•	Territorial changes and the Province system:I love this particular idea and personally is probably my favourite thing about Rome 2, the new larger territories and very complex building trees makes it far more complex and tactical to manage and maximise food, happiness, research speed, military, population and of course PROFIT. The disadvantages of higher level buildings are too steep and It does have the downside that you often left sharing a province with someone you don't want to kill but have to. The max limit on the number of edicts you can have is also obnoxious.•	Politics:Bare, often meaningless and a money sink easily the weakest part of Rome 2, but i really never found this stuff to be that good in other total wars either. So still actually an upgrade, just didn't get taken far enough.•	Military:Military matter have really remained unchanged, in my limited experience the armies often feel a little bland and are far more realistic than rome 1, with factions often having similar armies. Army traditions are underwhelming like the political aspect but this is easily fixed by mods.•	Balancing and combat:Combat is a strange affair here, when Rome 1 launched combat was far too short and the AI was rubbish but it has got a lot better and now is of decent length with standard fair total war AI (so still pretty damn dumb). I find that skirmishers are very good in T:R2 with more infantry fight often becoming slogs (especially if you use defensive infantry) and with cavalry generally being somewhat slow in total war terms and taking a lot of casualties when running through archer units to chase then down, but the balancing is pretty good.I personally like rome but always find myself only playing it for short times before stopping, even though I can't find a reason why I doSo it's a good game that continues the franchise. It's not rome 1 (my favourite) but it's ok and can be easily modded and improved by mods.I'd recommend it if you've enjoyed the other Total Wars, but i am not going to called it amazing or terrible it's GOOD nothing more nothing less(I am enjoying the rise of Constantine mod now, makes combat take forever and totally changes tech trees, army traditions and general upgrades)			"

												In it's release state Rome 2 was a disaster. Since then the gama has been patched into a stable and playable state, and thanks to mods I have gotten my moneys worth out of this game. However even considering the much improved emperor edition I cannot recommend this game. Battle AI is terrible and seige AI is downright laughable. Interesting mechanics and actual strategy are abandoned in favour of absurd arcady features (burning down metal gates with torches?), units have trouble keeping formation and most battles are over before you have a chance to flank or apply any real strategy.Proper sieges are non-existant and most cities do not have and cannot build walls. Even cities with walls may be instantly taken the turn they are attacked due to the ridiculous torch throwing mechanic. This was supposedly an attempt to reduce the number of repetitive sige battles present in earlier games but it has the opposite affect of forcing the player through the same uninteresting garrison battle dozens of times every campaign. The graphics are good (but not amazing) and the historical immersion is ok, but still with enough inconsistencies to make me cringe (why does Syracuse not have walls?).Additionally Creative Assembly has joined the list of developers which dole out features which should have been in the base game in the form of overpriced DLC's. This is downright insulting considering the state of the game upon release.Overall as much as I tried to enjoy vanilla Rome 2 It has too many flaws which ruin the experience, for every thing I enjoyed about Rome 2 there were 10 frustraing things I didn't. If you are looking to enjoy the total war experience I recommend Shogun 2 or Rome 1 with mods. "

I only recomend getting this game if you have a very high end integrated graphics or mid-high dedicated laptop graphics as the game still has problems with performance. Desktop users I am not positive, but for those users who have mid-high end cards should easily get 30+ fps not perfect like you may expect, but the game is still being patched and being worked on, so please don't give up I highly recomend this game because.1. It's not abandoned so if you already play this game or want to play this game and dosen't play well don't give up.2. you can control a large amount of factions and units especially when you get all DLC. 3. content is improving and the game is alot more playable and becomes very addicting. 4. A huge ammount of mods which adds even more content.5. You can siege coastal cities by ship meaning your troops arrive be sea which is an amazing feature.6. Patches keep fixing and adding more content along with DLC making this game in my top 5 favorites.7. At high-extreme settings graphical quality is pretty decent but I hope will be improved.8. Yes there is multiplayer like in Shogun 2.9. City building is alot more fun than in Shogun 2.			"

												This game, in my opinion, is the best total war game along side shogun 2. As the title implies, Rome is the most powerful faction as they're melee units greatly surpass those of any other faction. So all you have to do  is make a ton of swordsmen and charge the enemy with like one catapult blowing up enemy archers.

Needless to say as you all know, it was absolutely terrible when it came out, but I didn't jump ship immediately. I waited it out. The devs continuously patched the game the community pulled together with mods and the like. But now, months after its release, I just finished a 20 hour playthrough, and even with over a dozen mods and all the patches and fixes they put into it its still terrible. I had this realization that I was putting all this time and effort into this game to just make it PLAYABLE, forget making it fun. The game is beyond salvaging and is a true lost cause, a black mark on RTS gaming history which cant be removed. Avoid like the plague.			"

												This is very much a step down for the Creative Assembly compared to earlier Total War games. The campaign UI really does do a poor job conveying information, often hiding the information you want in metrics that are misleading. The diplomacy system is wretched, as rather than being able to freely specify an amount, you are required to give in incriments of 10% of your treasury. When trying to get AI powers to sign trade treaties, its rather odd to offer them several thousand gold because you can't offer them a few hunderd.On the battlefield, the combat is more of a grind. Even when flanked or encircled, units will stick around for a disconcerting length of time. Naval combat is not an improvement over Shogun 2, and the tactic seems to be, ""Get artillery ships, win."" Battle is just not as fun as in past games.On the campaign map, the province system is rather clunky. Having multiple areas connected to a capital really makes things problematic from a strategic sense, since it makes far more sense to go all or nothing, and take an entire province, than settle for a portion of it. Additionally, the objectives given in the single-player game, while historic, force the player to play the game in a way that might not be fun for them.In short, Rome II has shaken my faith in the Creative Assembly as a quality development studio.

												At the moment i'm not entirely sure how i feel about this game. It is very fun and well made (at time of writing), but i feel that the team who made this game, and the original Rome Total War, is different from the one that made Shogun 2 Total War (my favourite of the franchise). At this stage this is neither a pro or a con, simply an observation.The game is great, with mechanics resembling those in the earlier games, i.e. Sieges with rams, catapults, etc.. However i feel like some mechanics are missing that could have been utilized, such as the momentum of charges causing troops to penetrate the opposing lines rather than just form a linear front, and individual soldiers having individual fights rather than seemingly mass attacks, both features which were present in Shogun 2, but not in Rome 2. While some mechanics are missing, this game is still fun nonetheless. Recommended, though i would personally wait for sales to purchase the DLC (or even the base game itself). "

												Even after a year they haven't fixed the design problems.  All they've done is patch the bugs and (slightly) finish the political/civil war system.  Even the best modders out there can't fix the way buildings and provinces interact.  The main problem is that if you don't have all the regions in a province your buildings are *much* less efficient because all buildings provide their bonuses on a province-wide basis.  This results in you declaring war on your allies when they take the wrong province in a war.  Why declare war on them?  Because there's no way to diplomatically deal with it.  You can't trade provinces or even give them to your client state.  You can't threaten to intervene in a war between your client state and another.  The diplomacy boils down to: ""Want a trade route?"" or ""Declare war?""These fundimental issues are unmoddable, and every time I come back hoping to see improvement it never is there.  I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Thrilling real time battles and stunning graphics make the ancient world come alive. The game has come a long way since it's disasterous release and I can say as of right now that the game is in a very good playable state. As I stated in the opening sentance, real time battles make the game and it really seems like the Creative Assembly put much effort into the games visuals and sound effects. The sound of sword and shield clashes and the gristly death animations really make you feel like your right in the middle of an ancient battle. On the campaign map, not only will you be moving armies and fleets but you also have various agents to help you further your ambitions and hinder your enemies. Your spies will gather intellagence about your enemies and can seriously hinder an enemy army via different options at your disposal, Diplomats bolster your income in regions that they are deployed in, and champions can help speed up the experience gain of your troops. I have put over 600 hours and counting into this game and see no end to quitting and with its vast amount of content that will be a long while.			"

												Though it had been greetly improved over the years, I just can't recommand that game and the DLC's.The only thing that save it are the modders who add tons of units and things.Because yes, without any mod, every nations have quite the same units. And you won't have that much choice as there is not enough units in each nations.Also, I've been very disappointed with the maps. Seriously, every maps look like the same and ALL of them are just empty. Oh yeah, sometimes you'll have some trees. Nothing else.I don't recommand that game, Shogun is a lot more better than this one. Or, just wait for the next Total War.I hope my comment helped !			"

												While Rome 2's now imfamous launch was attrocious, in its current state, the game is one of the best of the Total War series, and a shining example of a RTS. 1. Campaign: As always, Rome 2's campaign is a mix of turn based strategical management on the campaign map, and real time battles. For the most part, the AI does a good job managing their cities and armies. They don't make foolish mistakes, they defend their cities, and they attack any vulnerabilities left by the player. The UI is fine, but the lack of branching skill trees for generals can be annoying. The removal of family trees is another annoyance as you feel no attachment to your faction's characters. One place where Rome 2 shines, however, is its variety. There are dozens of faction to chose from, exact numbers based on DLC, all of which have interesting units, traits, and challenge levels. 2. Battles: Once again, we see the return of CA's battle AI. While it is not totally imcopetent, it consistently makes moronic mistakes. It will engage your pikemen head on, charge cavalry into the front of heavy infantry, and often attack with no real tact. However, the battles are still fun. Troops are easy to control and the battle UI is slick and customizable. Sure, when a cav unit inexplicably gets stuck on one lonely spearman it can ♥♥♥♥ you the hell off, but it never detracts from the overall expirience. 3. Multiplayer: Due to the variety of factions, Rome 2's multiplayer shines. Each faction is fun to play as and offers different stregnths and weaknesses. The added bonus of phasing out the battle AI is just the icing on the cake. However, technical issues still at times hinder the multiplayer, as you will often expirience severe lag and will occasionally be dropped from the game. 4. Graphics: As one of the best optimized PC games out there in its current state, Rome 2 has no issue delivering both stellar graphics (in-battles and on the campaign map) and smooth framerates. 5. DLC offerings: While the 'Wrath of Sparta' DLC fell short, and I still have yet to see the point of 'Blood and Gore,' Rome 2 still has some fine offerings for DLC. Some packs will add fun new factions, and others will offer new, full legnth historical camapign scenarios to be played out on customized maps. Without a doubt, 'Hannibal at the Gates' and Caesar in Gaul' stand out from the pack as superd additions to the game and engrosing windows into some of the most fascinating wars in antique history. Without a doubt, Rome 2 stands out as one of the most extensive and deep offerings in the RTS genre. It is a stellar game and in its current condition, and it is the best Total War game to date.			"

												It had a HORRIBLE release but, the devs seen to care and they know they screwed up. After 9 major patches and a few minor ones the game is much better. And they continue to patch the game, sorta listning to the community. Theres still a few issues but in comparison to setember 3rd its a whole new game. Theres still room for improvment. So if the game goes on sale thats the time to pick it up.The game features a Smarter AI than previous games. Its oppurtunistic and crafty. It also considers the result of its actions with other factions with diplomacy and each has an agenda. in battles they adapt and have formations. They wont suicide charge their generals like in shogun 2.Attacking walled settlements is what the AI struggles with. But they'll fix that like they fixed the rest of the AI.			"

												I did the big mistake of preordering this game. So I really tried and wanted to like it, being a huge TW fan anyway.But I have to say R2 was and is a deeply flawed, partially completed, hastily assembled, sub-par product. It has no redeeming qualities compared to other games of the franchise. Yes they fixed some bugs and improved some features since the original release, but even now R1 back from 2004 still has the better gameplay experience in my opinion. Especially considering the abundancy of great mods for it. No, R1 wasn't perfect, it has it's flaws that's for sure. And modders work alot on R2 now too.So one might ask why compare a vanilla R2 with a modded R1? I can only say Why not? Did time flow at a different speed in CA HQ? Is it unfair to compare the work of paid professionals to that of unpaid amateurs? The year is the same for everyone involved. R2 has to be judged in context and that contains all the modding advances since R1. Ideally CA would have incorporated all that, both in terms of essence and polish. And they should have dealt with issues like pathfinding that have plagued the franchise since the very beginning. They certainly had the time to.All that being said, it is still only a game. It is playable. It does not CTD on launch. Has a menu. Options...Why not get on with it? Well what ticks me off is CA showed some really poor business practices. They just ploughed on into release of the game despite clear awareness of all the major inconsistencies in design. They heavily marketed and pushed the game despite knowledge of the inherent, dyed-in-the-wool problems. Simply put scamming customers by deceiving and misleading them.And instead of taking responsibility and to apologise afterwards when people found out, they tried to cover up (""only 2%"", ""it's a feature"") and shift blame on customers for their ""unreasonable expectations"". That I can not excuse.			"

												Rome Total War was not only fun and addictive, but revolutionary. Rome II is a big step backwards from Shogun II. The interface is clumsy, province management and even battles are unsatisfying, but worst of all, it is impossible to prevent rebellions...and when they occur, there are 10 times the amount of soliders that were there when you conquered the town in the first place....and they are better units! I will gladly return to Shogun II if I need a Total War fix: Rome II will be deleted after only a few hours of play.			"

												Don't get fooled by the hours I've spent in this game. Most of them are dedicated to finishing a campaign, and that's because I didn't want to say that preordering was a complete waste of money. After all, the game was playable after the third fourth patch or so. By the time of the seventh patch it was quite an enjoyable experience.However, do NOT repeat my mistake and judge the game by this photoshopped ""screenshots"", as I did, back when they were the only thing to base my preorder on. They are not even close to the real deal, and that's coming from someone who played it on the so-called ULTRA settings. Believe me when I say that Rome II at launch was looking worse than his predecessor. I won't ever bother with glitches and bugs, as the released version was so unpolished that you just couldn't get to the point of actually seeing them.The Rome II as of May 2014 is quite OK. Is not nearly as good as it could have been, if it wouldn't have been released in an Alpha state. Some of the small things that made the Total War series so good have been either cut out, or simplified. Some of the features and units have been hidden in the game files, just to be unlocked by DLC along the way. And that's outrageous. Finally, the multiplayer is a joke. Remember that cute avatar system in Shogun II ? With cute little units gaining experience so that you can drag them in future battles ? It's gone. The multiplayer in Rome II is from a technical standpoint  any point of view underwhelming and should only be considered if you have a friend to play with and you are bored out of your mind.			"

TL;DR: What started as a complete mess is now a decent game where one can forge a vast empire, delve into political intrigue, put the sword to some barbarians and be back in time for the Circus Maximus.All major bugs are ironed out, only a few small ones remain and none of them are game DLC, Voice Acting, Music, GFX & Performance RatingsThe DLC is mixed. Some are tiny and perhaps should have been included in the base game such as the blood or faction/culture packs buta couple of indivual factions were offered for free. There A few extra ""mini-map"" expansions and a large ""full-map"" expansion are available. DLC is over priced for what is it, but the expansions offer continued gameplay and a bit of variety to the base game. 6/10Voice acting is great, however a little more variety couldn't have hurt. 7/10GFX is nice, obviously a little outdated by now but still very satisfactory. 8/10Music is great, nothing negative to say. 9/10Performance is very well optimized. Running most settings on ultra and 1920x1080 on an Nvidia GTX 480 can achieve anywhere from 25-45fps. This is great result considering how old the card is. No performance isssues whatsoever. 9/10GameplayThe campaign is fun however I found it hard to complete a ""world domination"" style play like in the original Rome Total War. Plenty of extra fun to be had with agents, political events and diplomacy. Diplomacy is the best of any total war game so far, no outrageous demands, no pointless betrayals, friendships can last throughout the whole game.The battle gameplay is also fun however some battles can be over within 5 minutes, which is great for an arcade style playthrough but older Total War fans might miss the longer, more epic feel of previous installments.Overal7.5/10 - A decent Total War game with improvement and drawbacks over the original game. I highly recommend this game, however not for €54.99, wait for a sale.			"

It isn't just that the AI is still consistently stupid and the bugs constant a full year after release; it's that the basic design of the gameplay mechanics is inferior to Shoguns.An abysmal waste of the Rome license.

												After playing a couple of dozen hours now, and having read much of the other reviews here, i just can saybuy the game it´s totally worth it´s money with patch 12 being out.Many of the negative reviews here are just silly hateboy drivvel, some of them are just plain wrong and outright ridiculous.So get things straight: 1. Compared to Shogun 2, its a lot more stable; i kept having the famous autosave crash during the whole shogun 2 series , even with fall of the samurai every second autosave. Just once( !!!!) in rome 2, using the cloud for save.2. Some people complained that the game engine obviously comes from Empire, and wasnt therefore suited to melee warfare. Well, pure hogwash, Shogun 2 had the same Empire engine, and melee worked just fine!3. The premade tactical formations in battles work extremely good, and are very realistic. Frankly 80 % of all real battles in antiquity worked like phalanx in the front and cavalry on the flanks, skirmisher screen in front. If the main line budged, or the flanks got lost, battle was lost. The game here pretty much works the same way, it´s astonishing how well the engine emulates that logic of ancient phalanx/maniple warfare.4. The new region system saves you a lot of micromanagement and is frankly more realistic. On the downside, you cant fortify every border town anymore, but that just makes proper strategic planning and gaining client states or satrapies more important, since you cant defend each settlement.Well, the naval battles are quite crappy, but heh, no cannon broadsides without cannons, and ancient sea battles resembled a crazed ramming and boarding contest anyway. And rest assured, as soon as you got ships with on deck artillery, the transport rush thing is over. Besides, the often mentioned super transports can barely survive 3 rammings, whereas a quinquireme or somesuch can easily take a dozen hits. And transports tend to burn down real quick, therefore you just do need a real navy after the opening phase of the campaign.So yeah, the game is totally worth it´s money now, and i´d dare say it´s one of the best in the series in her current patched state( 12 patches lol, was the original qualitiy assurance done by drunken monkeys?) with more content coming up every 2 months or so. Haven´t played the Gaul and Hannibal campaign yet, gonna buy them with the next steam sale, and will write  probably a review about that too.p.s. patch 14(!!!!) out , a real big one commited just on artificial dumbness for siege battles. The comp attacking your walled cities was one of the weak points of this game; I kept butchering 4k plus barbarian armies with just a few units behind the walls repeatedly for example. So a real good game probably just got a lot better.			"

												I only played this game during the free weekend. I have been playing the Total War series since Rome 1. Every iteration of the Total War has added new things, and sometimes removed others. I have known about the negative attitude towards Rome 2 for some time, but I decided to try this game with an open mind.The first thing I noticed was the fact the the graphics were very buggy. Bear in mind that this game has been out for over a year as I write this. I have an Intel i7-4770K processor and an Nvidia 660 OC at 2GB, and the framerate was mostly smooth. However, there were tons of glitchy pop-ins out in the distance. Sometimes, the soldiers would glitch, causing the skin to be removed from their faces revealing their teeth and eyes. The game was otherwise quite smooth and the load times for the game were better than Shogun 2 (well, for me they were).The next problem is all of the little things that were removed from the game. There are many things, so I will only list the one that kills the game for me: No captains. In Rome 2, it is impossible to remove smaller units from a general's army and have them operate on their own. You cannot leave any behind to protect your settlement as you advance. In order to improve your defenses, you have two options. You can either upgrade your settlement, which improves your basic garrison soldiers. Or you can create a new army, new general and all, and have them camp there forever. It gets better, though, as you can only recruit generals from your capital (at least in the singleplayer campaign). If your front line is far away, you will have to wait until the army is completely built before you can send it there, which takes several turns.The no captains decision was clearly made to address player complaints in multiplayer. It is so obvious that this game was made to be played in multiplayer. On the Steam community forums, you can find people complaining about people abusing small armies. Thats like complaining about the ""noob tube"" in the COD series. Removing something just to gave unskilled players an advantage is terrible, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. You can't even send cavalry to scout.I can't give this game a score because I feel that I didn't play it enough, but thats only because I found the lack of captains to be completely game breaking.

												This was the game I was waiting for, it's my historical time period Sparta, Rome. I can't begin to discribe how frustrating it is, it could have and should have been brilliant. But it's not, the modders have made an attempt at making an average game into what it should have been from the beginning. The problem is the conflict between the CA and the mods, I spend most of my time starting new campaigns because saved games don't seem to be compatable. In short stay away from this until it's for free or about a fiver, it'll do your head in either way.			"

												Thinking of it? Buy it. Especially when it's on sale.It's like Shogun 2 but there's a LOT more involved. Bigger map, way more factions, better political mechanics and (personally) a lot more fun. Haven't experienced much bugs at all, and it feels just as stable as its predecessor now.If you're looking to buy the DLC as well, I definitely recommend the Blood and Gore DLC. Everything else is not a necessity. Some DLC give you more to play with, but the base game itself gives you a LOT to work with already. I would recommend you to play the game first and buy the campaign and culture DLC later, especially because the DLC is quite overpriced. I would not recommend buying all the DLC at once. 8/10			"

												Total war: Rome II is alright I guess. You play as the conscience of a single nation while you coerce them into annihilating anyone who had the absolute audacity to be born different than you.  Just like real life. The game revolves around the uprising of the Roman Republic and empire. Of Rome. An ancient nation so unique looking you would swear they fell out of a Forgotten Realms novel. Also, there are a plethora of other nations but they aren't important because their name is not in the title. When the game first came out, it ran as smoothly as my grandfather's chest hair. Which is to say not smoothly at all. I got this game at launch from a underground bum fight first prize, I would have preferred the wedge of cheese. Textures looked like mud, models looked like mud. Strangely enough, mud looked like water. There was also this thing where the A.I was so incompetant that my one year old nefew could have out smarted them in a game of build-a-blocks. It's amazing to see soldiers trained for years break out into a mosh pit as soon as a fight starts like a sweet sixteen at the Kardashians. Though I would admit, the combat animations are neat, especially with the blood and gore mod where you get to watch the Roman elite cut down farmers and city folk with sharp pointy swords. The campaign reminded me of my high school years where nobody liked me. It seemed that everyone had it in for poor little Rome, to be perfectly fair though, we do have nicer hats. I would be jelous as well. Diplomacy was practically useless and you could have probably sat in your chair and remembered all of the embarassing moments in your life, like the time you made a mix tape for Kelsey in a misdirected attempt to get her to fall in love with you while waiting for the A.I's turns to end.Sorry, Kelsey. Call me sometime. I've waited for you.But that was the past. And you know what they say. Those who don't watch Discovery channel are doomed to repeat discovery channel. Just like Discovery chanel repeats. With the Emperor Augustus update, you get a bunch of game fixes as well as a new campaign. The new campaign follows the Second Triumvirate where Rome split quicker than the cool kids at a lame party. You can play as Mark Antony, Pompeii, and a bunch of people who's names aren't nearly as cool.  The game no longer runs like a cripple on gravel roads, and you can now keep your units in formation, though you could probably do that before in the time I stopped playing this game. I found myself actually having fun (Which is illegal in some countries, be sure to check your local laws and jurisdictions.) with the Emperor Augustus update.Should you buy Rome 2? I guess you could, I mean, it's there isn't it? Just push the button. Come on. Do it. I dare you.I give Creative Assemblies ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child four Tim Allens out of five UERUGH?'s.  "

												This game is just a big waste of money sadly... There are tons of gamecrashes, and lots of bugs. I can't play past turn 5 because my game keeps on crashing when i end my turn (this made me have to pull the plug and damage my computer sadly). Tried to look up a fix but there was nothing that could help me. Why isn't this stuff patched yet????? Thanks Creative Assembly you wasted my 20 euros.			"

												Total War: ROME II is a turn-pased strategy game during the reign of the roman empire. The player will be controlling one of the factions for example The Romans or The Gauls and will be trying to conquer the know world through Millitary, pollitics and wealth.the player will command, purchase and train armies on the campaign map and command and lead the individual troops of an army on the battle map.The player can also use different agents to assassinate, preach and train troops.The game looks amazing but for it to look so amazing you will need an AMAZING computer, no shity laptop will work for this game.The ai in this game is a bit wonky but its ALOT better than at launch.It will have to do for now.I personally love this game, some people hate it, some love it, you might like it or you might not.Buy this during a sale if possible because for 50€ you could buy Medieval 2 total war and rome total war as they both are superior to this game if you dont mind the graphics and you still have cash left for other stuff.Good game, wonky ai 8/10			"

												After all the patches, this game is definitely worth the price. Nowadays I don't encounter any bugs anymore. I've completed about 4 campaigns, and started, but failed, many more. All of them were great and challenging, some to the point of almost giving up, but then of course victory tastes even sweeter! You can easily spend hundreds of hours on this game;+ Full of content, even without DLC+ Practically bug-free+ Incredibly extensive campaign map+ Factions are well balanced overall+ MODS, SO MANY MODS, SOOOOO MAAAANYYYYY MOOOODDDSSSS+ Weather effects look beautiful- Ballistae are about as accurate as modern artillery, hitting a band of 20 strafing horsemen 300m away (mods solve this)- Naval combat still feels bad, ships don't respond well too commands, especially after a first contact with the enemy- Music is really average, but mods fix that in every way- Battles are too fast, again, mods can solve that.- A.I. still cheats, I know maybe it's impossible to avoid cheating, but I hate games where this happens. Sometimes you are clearly better, the A.I. just stomps you with 6 armies which it definitely can't pay for. Overall still a great game, mods solve almost every real issue and add a lot of good combat and tactical changes. If you liked the previous entries, or strategy in general, this is for you!			"

Posted: August 24, 2014
												Was abroad when i heard that CA was going to release the much demanded Rome sequal. Now after almost a year since it's failed release, writing a review on the current game seems a proper thing to do. First of all, considering how proud CA were in talking about their huge budget, i expected something 10 times better then the final product. Firstly, it was false advertising with the graphics of the game. In the gameplay trailers they touched it up alot to make it look better then it really was. Then in the Teutoburg forest gameplay they talked about how the battle maps in Rome 2 will be very detailed and unique like in the historical battle. Sadly, all the maps look basically the same. Unit selection i simply miniscule. Then i go to the most annoying part of it all. The DLC whoring. I had a fear that with Segas huge involvement in this game, that they will release a few DLC like they always do. But i didn't expect it to be on this scale. The sheer lack of respect from CA just sums up how they treat their customers. Releasing units that were already in the game (Camal Catapracts) and then selling them in DLC for 2.49 euro. The sad thing is that the modded units are 10 times better then the CA ones. The simple fact that CA looked at factions that people played as with the all factions playable mod and then locked them so they can sell them for over 7 euro. That was the major change in my attitude to this series. Not to mention the lack of basic features that i expected in the game. They took out so many things that were put in Shogun and should have been in Rome 2. Agent cutscenes, family tree, better advantage for killing a general. In Rome 2, they just create generic generals which replace the general who had been killed. So now losing your only family general which is also your family leader makes no difference. Because a new one just appears. Also, the fact that the game just creates random generals sums it up in this moment that happened to me. I was playing as the Julli and it passed the date caesar came to the military scene. I saw he was in the game when i was creating a new army, But!!!!!!!!!. He was with the Junia family. The Junia family. The family of Brutus who killed Caesar. Not to mention his name is Julius. Julli-Julius. But yeah, thankfully he wan't the family leader so i was able to adopt him. And this brings me to the political system. Has got to be the most pointless system in total war history. Why in hell would we use the assassinate a rival family member with the option in the political page for 12,000 denars when i could just end him to his death in battle. Not to mention Gravatias is pointless and is only a negative because it starts civil wars.  It doesn't give you high office positions like in Rome 1. It doesn't get you popular with the plebs or senate. So whats the point. The simple fact that the Ai for rival family only uses the political options on you if you have enough money to counter it. So for example, if it costs 10,000 to adopt a member of your family. They will not try to adopt him unless you have the money to stop the adoption. This means all you need to do is have a generally low treasury and the only thing the Ai will do is attempt assassination. And this brings me to my new point. Just a simple question. If you have a skilled general leading your only army against the enemy, meaing if that army were to be destroyed, your entire nation will fall and the only person who can win with that army is this skilled general, why the ♥♥♥♥ will you try to kill him, potentially bringing about the complete demise of your nation. The same applies to when your army is finally built up and a battle is soon to come. Then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai family kill your general, making the army leader less and losing a huge amount of morale. It just makes no sense. And just 3 more things. The whole point of Capture points are to prevent mosspits. But especially as the greeks, all you need is pikes at the entry points in the gates and the walls and you win no problem. I literally had a levy pike unit with 2000 kills by doing this. Why would you take out the material requirements for certain buildings. Why must a mod fix your mistakes. How in hell can i make a blacksmith with no iron circulating in my empire. And lastly, although many might disagree. The online avatar was a good idea in my eyes. Although people who had played for awhile will generally dominate new players, new players could till win. I did it many times. People with the DLC would think they have the advantage, but with the right movements i would win. I loved upgrading my avatar and giving him new armor aswell as giving my troops unique colors. For Rome 2 there was much potential. The amount of different types of general apperances was huge. Eastern, celtic, roman, dacian, germanic, punic, iberian, greek, nomadic, mix of eastern and greek. But they took it all away and made multiplayer a boring match up game with no attachment to your units. If i lost my veteren samuri unit, i would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. Even if i won the battle, it would be a loss to me. But in a match up, you have no attachment to these units. If they get destroyed, who cares. Personally, i would recommend you buy this game on sale, DLC wise, they are boring. I bought both the Caesar in Gaul and Hannibal at the gates when they were 5 euro and i never even played them. I only played the Factions they unlocked on the grand campaign. If you want a fun total war game. I highly recommend Medieval 2, Rome 1 or Napoleon total war. If you want a newer total war. Get Shogun. It was the whole rotate on campaign map feature and the generated maps aswell, which are better then it is in Rome 2. This game has been a huge failure in my eyes. Poor graphics considering their budget, boring and liveless campaign and the horrible DLC whoring. I got all the Rome 1 DLC including the base game and Medieval 2 and all it's DLC for the price of just 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC in Rome 2. I was stupid enough to pre-order this game. I'll think twice before they release a new one. Hopefully, they detach themselves from the SEGA money monster and start making total wars which they actually put effort into.			"

												Total War: ROME II is a strategy game and the next installment of the Total War series. We return to the age where we will relive the ancient Rome, the greatest empire ever existed in human history. Compared to the first Rome: Total War, this one is completely different in most aspect. Some might think this game is great, some might think this one is not great. This is my opinion.The gameplay, it is clear the game is becoming more streamlined than the previous, settlement are now being managed in provinces, with each provinces contain 2-4 cities including the province capital. Recruitment, public order and food are now provinces wide so you don't have to build barracks or temples in all of your cities. Battles are also improved, with soldier that throws javelin before charging, like the Roman Legion, doesn't have to wait to stand still to throw their javelin. Research tree are also present. Auto resolve battle now has 3 stances with each stances has different advantage and disadvantage. And now, each army or fleet must have a general or an admiral commanding them, and the amount of general and admiral that can be employed is limited, which mean, there will be no army spam in the map. Diplomacy is also improved and there are more treaties can be made.The graphics has also been improved, both on real-time battles and the campaign map. They look even better and beautiful, if the game runs the right way. Unless you're running the release version of the game, which contain many bugs and glitches even to the graphics itself. Unit collision is a mess. And sometimes which is most of the times when the game is first released, there were many texture errors from the menu, loading screen to the unit model, terrain and many more. It was mostly fixed by now.The AI, I think this is the worst part of the game. The AI on battles are somewhat stupid, extremely basic, their morale is also low, losing just 40 men and they start running away even the when they outnumbered your army. They even sometimes didn't move at all and if you play battles without time limit, this could be a problem when you're outnumbered. AI siege weapons don't move at all most of the time. Now with the game has been patched several times, the AI is improving, but still not really good. At least now you can have some challenge playing on harder difficulty.But other than that this game is great since many patch made through. I recommend this.UPDATE: Now with the release of the Emperor Edition, Total War: ROME II is now better than ever. The AI working as they should now although still not perfect. The performance is also great, and I notice that with medium setting, the graphic looks way better than previous medium setting. Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition are now very playable.Rating 8/10			"

												Alot of people have trouble with the menus and stuff in this game apparently, especially if they come from previous total war games. This menu system is easily learned if you have an open mind, so just remember its a little different than past total war games. (At least this is what my total war playing friends told me).Outside of this the game has done a fantastic job of getting the total war formula of diplomacy, sustaining your empire, and war right. You can spend the whole game expanding and listing on revolt. You can expand and then chill and work on economy. Or you could take over the whole world through trade and alliances.

												I do recommend this game but only if you are a person who likes the ancient Romans or similar. The game lacks depth, for example, I have played 300 hundred hours of this game and that has been over half a year. Rome total war 1 was better because of the engine it used. The engine used for this game was meant for RANGED combat, not melee. This is why there is just a complete moshpit and no orginisation what so ever. The ancient Romans didn't break formation like they so easily do for this game. Now I have over the reccomended specs and I still have a frame rate drops. This is unacceptable. Napoleon, Medieval and Empire don't have framerate drops for me, so why does this? Total war Rome 2 was cleary rushed by Sega in order for them to get some more money. This can be seen from the amount of DLCs which have had to been added to the game. The old AI designer was fired? Why? This new one which has creatred the AI for Rome 2 is not the best to say the least and that's putting it mildly. If you have below the reccomended specs, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! This is because when I played with just under it, it barely ran on the main campaign screen, never mind the battles! Even with above average specs, the game still looks terrible! In today's day and age I would expect to see these graphics on the PS4 or Xbox 1. In conclusion if you want a MILDLY historicly accurate Roman game then go straight ahead... but only if it's on sale. But be warned, if you want to play as Sparta etc, you will have to buy the MoneyMakingDowanloadableContent (MMDLC). Out of 5 stars? 3. An average game... hopefully Creative assembly and Sega can top Napoleon and Rome 1 otherwise, the Total war series looks like it will die. Thanks for reading.			"

												Замечательная игра, достойная во всем той самой первой из своей серии, которая открыла новый мир стратегий. Очень хорошая графика, сочетаемая с детализацией и тактическими возможностями. Однако, она наследовала и все недостатки предыдущих, а именно набор одинаковых (в больше мере) штампованных населённых пунктов и локаций, которые начинают надоедать через определённое время. Также ограничение по фракциям, которое потом снимается постепенным введением платных дополнений. За это винить нельзя - это бизнес, и это стоит того. Но вот совершенно, на мой взгляд неудачные дополнения с отдельными малыми картами регионов типа Гальской компании Цезаря и Ганнибала у ворот - совершенно не оправданы. Они не интересны своей скоротечностью и ограниченностью. Во всём остальном - игра замечательна. Правда финансовая и дипломатическая составляющая здесь в совершенном зачатке и, зачастую играют малую роль. Но. Жду продолжения и возможностей играть за каждую из фракций!Wonderful game , worthy of all the very first of its series, which opened a new world strategies. Very good graphics, combined with detailed and tactical capabilities . However , it inherits all previous shortcomings , namely a set of identical ( at least more ) stamped settlements and locations that begin to pall after a certain time . The limitation on fractions , which then removed the gradual introduction of paid add-ons. Can not blame him - it's a business , and it's worth it . But here is perfect, in my opinion unfortunate additions to individual small card -type regions of Gali Caesar and Hannibal at the gates - absolutely not justified. They are not interested in its transience and limitation . In all the rest - the game is wonderful. True financial and diplomatic component here in perfect bud and often play a small role. But . Forward to continuing to play and opportunities for each of the fractions !			"

												Ancient massive armies, bloody politics, and economic power is all in your hands! Command vast armies in your hands!What I think of the recent patches? The game is getting better and better in my own opinion. When it first came it, it was very buggy which I admit that. The campaign was very confusing because without a clear of political system. The biggest disappointment was that there is no avatar mode in Rome II. I was getting hyped and had high hopes about it which I was expecting something big. That gotten the best of me and I should be more self-aware of it.Depsite of that, I am still happy that I got it. There are many who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about it. Then, why you bought it in the first place?Yea, it's called marketing. Customers should have the right to know of their products before making a choice. Didn't I know it was going to have a bad launch?The patches has improved the game and need to go deeper in CA's website and the forums to know how the game work. If you didn't preorder the game, you will have to pay separate to get the Sparta faction along with Greek factions. Others are paid DLC and some for free which that depends  how worthy they are.The another biggest disappointment was that the Beast of War is a wasted 3 dollars because in my opinion should be a freebie and should have focused on making a avatar mode package instead with real time strategy like Crusader Kings II and other strategy to give more fluid campaign in multiplayer.With two disappointments in the way, how does it holds up? It's good, but that not good. Rome II's battles are very damn impressive and I mean it's a beauitful to wreck destruction on destroying things and massive battles.The Army system is much better and there's no need to setup garrison which you can focus on the invasion while your settlements has it's own garrisons. It's a unquie Army system that you can named your armies and navies as you can give them symbol of their standard, pick a army skill, and better understand how you will use your army works.Generals and Agents works the same way like in Shogun 2, but the sad part that family system like in Shogun 2 is not that instead replaced by Political system that no one seems to understand. That's a another disappointment as well.How I rate this game with the latest patch? I give this a 7/10 for unqiue world on terms how Rome II wonderful is, but it has drawbacks.It is better than Rome I? In my  opinion, it's much better and more impressive than Rome I  because I think that CA did their research well except their fantasy units.  Multiplayer is another story.Multiplayer before the patches was broken at the start and it improves better with the patches. It's just like Rome I with a new map choice. It has co op and head to head campaigns in Multiplayer which it has nothing else to do there.Either you love it or hate, Rome II kicks♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This game should be called ""Total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t: Waste of money.""Arty wins every battle. IA sucks hard as hell. No improvement from the first rome. Bugs everywere. Campaign is Utterly crap and nonsense where major nations gets easily destroyed by minor nations, IA is able only to spam cannon fodder armies and stupid agents. Diplomacy is simply awful.The new interface, bulding and research system is 100 times worst then the Shogun II one.  Definitively the worst total war. Don't waste your money, buy drugs instead.			"

												The game did not meet my expectations at release, as it was buggy as hell, performance was horrible and it lacked many features I loved in the Total War series. Since then the game has been patched to a much more playable level, my favorite Blood-DLC was added and the modding community has tweaked the game to a top notch Total War game. It still lacks the family tree, which I greatly miss and the politics system is near moronic and the AI is still not what it used to be for instance in  Shogun 2. I fully agree with all the hate at release, but at the present state I certainly recommend buying this game as it is very entertaining and addictive.			"

												If you are new to the Total War Series, this is an alright game to play, if you are more of a laid back kind of gamer, who doesn't really look for a lot in games,  just entertainment, then it's even better.However I would highly recommend (unless you really love Rome and Roman history) Total War: Shogun 2. This game lacks a lot of content that more serious gamers would appreciate, as has been the trend with the Total War series. It is also based on an engine built for for cannons and gunfire (IE forward, not up and down), not catapults and arrows, as such, it doesn't quite feel like some of the units are doing what you'd think they would.Its got beautiful graphics, but lacks a lot in the sound department. The AI is alright, but kinks can be found and exploited rather easily when you get used to the game. The game is slugish even on better machines, and you may find yourself waiting for the turn to end for what seems to be a rather long time.This aside, if you love everything Roman, this will definetly be something for you to try, maybe look for it on sale though. :)			"

												Take a quick scroll through the negative reviews and note the ""hrs on record"" for each player:309 hrs clocked? Negative review. 166.6 hrs clocked? Negative review.202 hrs clocked? Negative review.272.9 hrs clocked? Negative review.257.8 hrs clocked? Negative review.Do you notice a slight pattern here? Everyone giving this game the thumbs down has spent well more than their money's worth, playing the thing. If the game really is as bad as everyone says it is, then why do they spend hundreds of hours of their lives on it? If the game was as bad as everyone attempts to make out then surely they'd play it for several hours, regret that they purchased it, give it a bad review then leave it to be nothing more than a statistical +1 on # of games they own. They don't however, they spend weeks and months playing the thing every evening/weekend and why do they do this?The answer is simple, it's not a bad game. Far from it, the game is actually very good. Rome II has had A LOT of criticism from die-hard TW fans and I can understand why. There were many bugs on release, the AI should simply be called A as it's certainly not very intelligent and I sometimes find my saved games corrupt after each update. I dislike the city building (as cool as the sharing of structures within a region is) and think they should have kept it moreso like Shogun's. I hate how the game tends to be split entirely with the Tribes (Northern Eu) and the Greeks/Romans (South Eu) as if they are only 2 different playable factions within the game. What I mean is that all of the tribes feel the same, as do all of the Greek nations. So I wish there was more diversity between nations' units and structures. Also, would it be so hard as to create just a few more character models? Seeing an army of 10,000 tribesmen all with the same face and 1 of 2 haircuts is annoying as hell.All of these things frustrate me and this game could have been a lot better but, it's certainly not a bad game that we should all be trying to discourage others from buying, such as Infestation:Survivor stories. The original TW Rome was for many TW fans, the best in the franchise so Rome II had some pretty big boots to fill and unfortunately, many people feel that because it didn't give them that nostalgia they were seeking, ""the game sucked 0/10"". I don't think that is at all fair.Now, is Rome 2 my favourite TW? No, it isn't. I'm not going to lie but, it's certainly worth getting if you are a TW fan, or generally someone who enjoys RTS games. The graphics are definitely the best of all the TW games to date (I don't understand why so many people seem to think Shogun 2 had better graphics, maybe their computers are too sh*te to play Rome II on a high graphical setting) and the DLC is pretty much the same old generic content that you'd expect to find (extra factions and units etc), priced at the amount you'd expect it to be.Rome II is certainly a lot easier to mod than Shogun 2 was, so if you enjoy modding then you also have that going for you, which is nice. You're actually able to hide units now as hills and trees obscure line of sight. You no longer have to be in the forest to be hidden, simply the other side of them is enough. Many units now have multiple abilities, some even passively activate themselves, such as front line melee infantry letting loose a volley of javelins before charging in to battle without your intervention. Even though the AI isn't so intelligent, I still find it much less predictable than it was in Shogun 2 and diplomacy is key to surviving on higher difficulties so, choose your allies wisely or you can find the game to be quite brutal.I've personally enjoyed all those hours that I've clocked on Rome II and will enjoy many more in the future to come. If you're unsure about it, wait until a steam sale but you should certainly get it either way, so that you too can waste hundreds of hours of your own life building an empire to span the entirety of Europe! Killing and conquering all, like a boss.			"

												Review for Emperor Edition: All the updates leading up to and including the free Emperor Edition update have turned Rome II into a great game. They have added upgrades to the culture system, seasons and seasonal effects (both visual and in applying bonuses or penalties), campaign and battle balancing, more playable factions and units, building chain revamps (more variety of buildings and chains), and various performance improvements. The latest update, which upgrades the game to Emperor Edition for free, has modified politics and civil war in ways that are very impactful to your campaign. You have reason to constantly track your family or partys influence, having to assasinate your own generals for fear of sparking a civil war or engage in political actions to improve your influence. Failure to do so results in harsh public order and tax penalties that will really cause you problems if you dont handle your politics correctly. The update also adds improvements to the user interface (color coding various things and reworking the politics screen), although overall the ui is not as visually appealing as in previous games. It also adds the Imperator Augustus campaign, which adds the playable Armenia faction to the Grand Campaign as well. It uses the Grand Campaigns map while adding various roman factions and changes to other factions to fit the setting.Overall the game is as it should have been when it launched last september. However, the user interface still a downgrade from the beautiful Shogun 2 scrolls. You also dont get as attached to your generals as in previous games (partly due to the lack of a family tree and the minimal importance given to aquired character traits). I would have also liked to have seen the return of the system where some settlement buildings were spread out across their territories (e.g. the farms or gold mines of Shogun 2 being represented on the campaign map as potential targets). It got removed in favor of the province system and of armies using the raiding stance in enemy territory, even though both systems could have worked in tandem to greater effect. It would have also made strategic raids of provinces more interesting since you had an additional, strategic target to attack or defend besides settlements, ports or other armies.In short, the game has substantially improved since launch and the Emperor Edition is a testament to that. I give the game in its current form a solid 9/10.			"

												Rome II had a rough start, nobody can deny that. But now that the game is done and all the DLC are out, I really enjoy it!I'm a campaing player, and thus I can't really talk too much about the multiplayer. I've done a couple of matches, but really missed the FFA aspect in it. That was my favorite thing to do in Rome, and I think it's sad that they haven't brought it back. There are a lot of factions (if you have the DLC that is) and enough diversity to keep it fun. But for more info on multiplayer you shouldn't be here, but at other reviews. Now, campaing gameplay! The begining of campaings can be a pain in the bum, but that's a good thing! But what I've noticed is that when you gain enough land and armies, you can just steamroll the rest of the map if given enough time. I haven't really played campaings above the ""Hard"" setting, and don't feel like playing one again, so this could prevent my problem. Multiplayer campaings are a lot of fun, but sometimes they restrict what you can do. For example in the Hannubal at the Gates DLC. If one player is Rome and the other Carthage you can't have peace. This of course is logical, but I feel like in a game you should be able to make your own choices. And before I forget, sieges are still pretty broken. Pikes on a wall etc. shouldn't be a thing!Overall a good game, would recomend it and then get the DLC on a sale. 7/10.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I've waited till all the patches were in place. I've got all the expansions, dlcs and so forth.As a fanatic of previous Total War games (all of them, but Rome, Medieval and Shogun 2 are stand outs) I really wanted to give this game a chance too, without the bug madness and all that.I think over 100 hours of gameplay is more than a fair chance.PROS:- The game runs fast on the highest settings.- The units are detailed.- The UI is convenient enough.- The campaign map is nice, realistic and not too cumbersome.- The army specific traits are a nice addition.- The graphics, on highest settings, are very nice to look at.- Plenty of mods make the game slightly better.CONS- The Game has been stipped down to bare bones.- The AI is laughable at best, both strategically and tactically.- Family trees are gone.- Diplomacy is completely void.- No matter what difficulty the game is too easy (as Rome I've conquered the whole map in less than 100 turns).- Units lose formation, every battle turns into a brawl, or a mosh pit at best.- As long as you field the heaviest infantry possible you win everything.- from a tactical standpoint, all battles are the same, once you have defended a camp, or a city, or attacked a camp, or a city you have seen everything there was to see.- Naval combat is a sad joke.- Even the units and buildings icon look cheap.- The technology tree is non sensical.- City building is limited to a maximum of 6 buildings (usually 4-5) in capital provinces.- Every faction looks different but behaves the same way.Overall 4/10Yes, the game is playable, not buggy (as of April 2015), and looks great. Too bad it's not funny, there's no sense of achievement, and a total failure in terms of strategic and tactical play. Huge let down. "

Most of times the battles are not intense and the soldiers are watching each other instead of fighting. Even the shield wall is broken and often you will see your soldiers break it.

												The game delivered on so many bases it was a shame that it fell flat on its face during the others. Huge battles that play out for more than an hour real time give you a real sense of achievement when you win and a great pit of disappointment when you are crushed. The graphics are truly amazing… until you have a battle which has more than 20units each side fighting. Of course if you have an NVidia Titan or 780Ti, this probably will not be a problem but if you don’t the chances are you will have to lower the GFX right down and play in permanent slow mode. The price tag is still a little high on this game at $79.99 – considering you will be made to pay for extras such as blood and gore. Although it has an almost unlimited amount of play time capturing all the continents from Europe to Asia, I’d have only paid $40 at most knowing then what I do now.  My advice would be wait for this one to go on sale and double check your hardware. Don’t go by the recommended requirements as it will likely not deliver the proper gameplay for this good game.			"

												I've played Empire a lot, Napoleon a bit and never played Shogun and Attila but I can highly recommend this game for the players who wants to see the action. It's not a diplomacy game as all of the Total War games but I can say that diplomacy part is quite advanced than Empire or Napoleon. As a fan of Europa Universalis I think this game still lacks diplomacy but in the other hand, you directly control the army, do manuevers to defeat your enemy, ambush them etc. To be honest, it's quite hard to control a huge army, but watching every single man fighting is the joy that Total War offers. This game is a good one to buy I think but, I have to remind something; you better buy ""Blood & Gore Extention"" because without this one game wouldn't be that fun to play I think.			"

												i wasted 55€ for nothing. i wanted to support Total War because is my favourite type of game. but since the DLC is in fashion and for things that it should be included in the 55€ they demand you another 8 € to play 3 more shity factios or 2,5€ to get the gore mod. it is the first and last time yhat u will hook me with this type of lye. the next total war games i will have will be from www.th3p1r4t3b4y.se you will get 0$ from me.

												This game is solid but  compared to other total wars It realy fell short to a first time player it would be great but I would suggest another total war to a first timer the other ones will show you the real total war not this. This is a over simplified excuse for total war. Also Dont be fooled by the screenshots the game doesnt look what it looks like in the screen shots even on extreme quality. This game has a great system as in all total wars and honestly thats all it has. Its not at all as good as the other total wars play those and dont waste your time with this excuse of a total war.

												It's a fantastic Total war game. Yes, it was crap and full of bugs at release, over two whole years ago. It's been patched tirelessly and now it's great and with mods from the huge modding community is amazing. Don't let the haters who are still mad that they got burned 2 years ago put you off buying this game.			"

												My ninety hours with this masterpiece mostly consisted of a single co-op campaign in which I led my Macedonians to glorious conquest over the pathetic Egyptians and puny Spartan resistance (I tried diplomacy, they drew first blood)This massive game is the ultimate nation building, army building, battle planning, politicing, back stabbing, trade route making experience out there. I will never forget when I fought back invaders from a small garrison with a force of 200 men strategically placed along the ramparts. Amazing visuals with thousands of troops on the screen at once. The sound and music will put you in the mindset needed to conquer and rule as the screams of your enemies echo throughout the world. Full single player and co-op campaigns will keep you busy for too many hours...seriously.			"

												This is a game in which the maintenance of a country is compelling and somewhat complex at times, but combat seems really lacking in control. Most of the times it's just me throwing units at other units and waiting with hope. Unlike Empires, the other total war game I have a lot of experience with, it seems like this game intends to encourage avoiding combat by any means other then auto-calculation.			"

												I have played all but one of the Total War games and I think this is a great addition. My only complaint is that diredting units on the battlefield can still be clunky but no more so than the other games in the series and in fact I would say it is a bit better in this edition than others. It seems fairly well optimized for my PC, but I did have to turn down some of the graphics settings for the big battles when I had troop number maxes out. I run a GTX 760 though and I imagine if you have a 900 series card you should be able to play all maxed out. I got 121 hours of play out of this and did not even do the last scenario in Sparta. I may play that campaign later after a break, 121 hours and I think I have had enough for a bit, lol! I recoomend you get this game if you like the other games in the series. I had a great time with this.			"

												There's two kinds of those who write the reviews on Rome II - those who played original Rome and those who didn't. For those who didn't played it is a good, epic strategy. For those who played - it is a strange (not to say ugly) ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Rome and Warcraft.Endless bugs, absence of the family tree, taking cities without siege weapons, buttons that magically replenish energy, drunken brawl instead of clever tactics - there's much said about all of this, no need to repeat. All this rage is not about bugs, it's about game mechanics, that became RTS in a bad meaning of the term.Particular word about music - it is... wait, is there music already? I'm don't remember. I remember Jeff van Duke's soundtrack in Rome till now, but soundtrack in Rome II - it's a pitiful attempt to depict something epic.Little secret - Rome II Emperor Edition - it is, in fact, final release of the game. First release was alpha, that was released without disclaimer that it is an early access. But whatever, the game is a fail. 6/10, and only for merits of the previous games (excluding Empire, that was also fail). Summary - I was foolish enough to preorder this. In future, I'll buy CA products on 80% sale... maybe.P.S. Wait... CA is developing Alien Isolation? Well, gentlemen, it's the end of the Total War series.			"

												Игра шикарнейшая, прекрасная эпоха, исторические цели и факты, семьи,  жестокий и всеми так любимый и в тоже время ненавистный Рим. Игра стоит того чтобы углубиться, насладиться и прочувствовать все тяготы  эпохи античности. В добавок ко всему, можно не скучать одному, присутствует отличный кооператив.			"

												This game has bugs and it does have features that weren't the smartest move since Shogun 2; however, the game has a fun factor that trumps all of its downfalls.CA implemented certain features in this total war game that will make it harder to play older TW games, and they did in fact put in more beneficial and simpler features than poorly implemented ones.  The game suffers from AI problems and other misc bugs, and I feel it's not nearly as polished as Shogun 2 (one of the most polished TW games after expansions/patching imo), but it has a way better campaign, factions, unit rosters, building/culture rosters, and other features that make it a lot more fun than Shogun 2.I wrote a positive review about Shogun 2 before, claiming it to be the best TW game released ever, and while that's true for the most polished and bug-free total war ever, I feel that Rome 2 will become the better game if it continue to be patched positively.So in summary, I feel Shogun 2 is the better polished and bug-free game.  Rome 2 is the more fun game and better campaign with more interesting units.  It just needs help to improve and polish it.			"

												At this state, the game seem way more polished compared to the clusterfock that was at release. However, doesn't feel an inprovement at all with respect Rome, or other Total War games. After finishing the grand campaign here are my feelings:-This is a couple of things that they have done better but fall into nothingThe political intrigue is more deep now than the mechanics with the shogun, the pope, or the 3 rome factions. However, is completely worthless. I have spend millions of talens to secure promotions, I have only active my family generals, and adopt and bribe any other character, and still I only have a 35% maximum of the senate control. The civil war meter hasen't move from 0 in the entire campaing.The thing about the provinces seems like a good idea, you can also build into several settlements at a time which is nice. But doesn't seem to have a significant bonus. The province control seems rather useless other than the own satisfaction of sorting your own stuff in an arbitrary matter. You can't even interchange settlement in the diplomatic view to complete provinces.-One thing that is actually an improvement respect Rome.The art style is fantastic. It quite similar to Shogun 2 in regard of placing you into the historical settting. Not so much the music though; not bad, but not good neither.-Other than than the game falls flat in many aspect.The AI is horrible. Is worse than other TW games. Most of the naval battles are the enemy waiting there doing nothing. And the diplomatic interchange is just silly. I have multiple faction declaring war on me, only to surrender in the next turn and giving me 5000+ talens in compensation without even having a battle.The combat seems simplify respect other titles. I remember using way more siegue weapons, archers, hoplites and lancers, and their respective special moves. In here I don't have a feeling of actually having to do anything on the battlemap. And to make things worse, the last tier lancers are replaced with swordmans preators, which are cool and nice, but albeit no sustitue for a spear wall.Another thing that I have no idea what is for, the victory/strategy points in the battle map. Previously, if you loose the plaza, you loose the settlement. Now nothing happens. there is a flag that goes up and down but it has no consequence. The only thing that you can use it for is to capture gates and towers, but nothing else.There are bad things with the IU. For example now you can click and draw a unit where what should happen, and what happened before is that you will make a square for multiple selection, and this is quite annoying actually. Another thing is that the tactical map in the continent view doesn't draw the icon if you zoom too much; why?? doesn't make any sense. The diplomatic view could also be mix with the tactical view, they are pretty much the same. When you click a general to figure it out the family you need to click in another 3 menu and look for him manually. The artifact bonus thing, I got 50+ extra at the end of the campaign without use. And I haven't figure it out yet how to build the coliseum. And the slums are horrible and annoying, there is no way to have a multiple settlement view to tell you where are space available and you need to look for them manually or else the slums will pop-up.And finally, the DLC market strategy and promotion/spam aspect of the game is not acceptable. There is a constant reminder to ""buy this other cool stuff"" all over. Just leave me alone!			"

												Looked forward to this game but it ended up being a disappointment.  They shouldn't have tried to fix things that weren't broken.  I've played TW games since the original Shogun, my favorite being Medieval II Total War, which improved greatly upon it's predecessors. Medieval II TW was intuitive.  Unfortunately Rome II was clunky and far from intuitive.  The interface seemed to be a random hunt and peck setup, scattered throughout the screen in a chaotic order.  Many details that added color to M2TW were removed from Rome 2 and then things that created nothing but tedium were added. The unit cards were larger than necessary yet gave no way to know the exact number of troops in a unit by looking at them; you have to guesstimate.  The creators also decided to use a mimicry of old Roman art instead of more appealing and identifiable pictures:  I feel that was an aesthetic, if not functional, mistake.   Management of settlements and provinces was limited and yet clunky.  Most everything is based off fighting penalties and not gaining bonuses.  Overall control leaves much to be desired, yet the AI factions, of course, flourish without fail or penalty. Attilla looks like it made some improvements although it uses much of the same flawed system, so perhaps I would suggest playing that one over Rome 2, but honestly I have not had enough game time on Attilla to accurately commit to that suggestion.All I can say is that Rome 2 has been painfully dissapointing to me, and I write that with sadness as a TW fan.

												why didn't they just improve the classical Rome total war.. with better graphics and physics.. that's all.. why did they have to make like.. a totaly different game? I was betrayed! I hope many people will pirate this game! It's boring.. i can't personaly attach my self to anything.. it's so.. blend and it feels casual.. but the map is huge and you just force yourself to ""conquer"" it .. I found my self fighting with feelings like ""hey.. it has amazing graphics.. yeh, but fighting kinda sux.. I know, but look at the new politics now.. I see but i liked the old ones more.. Hey you can poison a well in the village.. sure, but where are the family trees.. i'd like to LIKE someone! .. You can upgrade your generals... But they feel IMPERSONAL.."" I even tried to get drunk and play like i'm used to play Rome 1 .. oh .. it doesn't work.. it just p....... me more! Fights are joke.. it feels like the soldiers are just standing or walking.. eventually i see a duel.. and it's like instant K.O. In Rome 1 there were so many sweet moments and soldiers were swinging swords, making damage to enemies.. thats fine with me.. i don't need a duels if it means that those are going to be happening ocassionaly, while others are just running around waiting for one enemy to ""join"" a duel. Im so sad i paid that much money, then waited so long for updates.. and now it still feels like ... some generic game about romans that you play few times and forget.. I love Rome 1 and tried to love Rome 2.. but no.. i can't fake feelings.. It looks nice.. good graphics.. enemy react to you ..he can kick you behind.. but that was happening in Rome 1 too and it was obvious part of the game.. so much hyp for this. I'd like to see my city im building, it was possible in R1, You could recognize individual buildings too..  or i'd like to know that one of my generals is a drunker! i miss those things, it was original! you know what.. im going to pull out my old dusty Rome 1 DVD and Im going to go back to the past... again.. just like I do with 98% of the modern games that come out in last 3 years! that's it, Im not buying any modern games! I have spent soooo much money for a stroooong and powerful PC and all for nothing...PS: message to developers: we, the gamers, are not dummies, please, don't implement stuff that simplifies games, because all the fun and thrill is gone and we, the gamers, will stop buying Your boring games..

												I have been eagerly anticipating this game since it was annouced by sega, when it finally came out I was so overjoyed I skipped school just to spend the entire day playing it. After playing a few battles in the campaign I made a painful and excruciating conclusion that this game is a piece of trash compared to their previous games in the series, theres so much problem with the game I dont know where to begin but the most unforgivable problem I found with the game was that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine their using. its so horrible it completely breaks my immersion in the game, gone were the solid line of phalanxes and roman formations as they were replaced with moshpits. In the end I consider rome 2 the weakest and most dissapointing game in the franchise. (The emperor edition made it slightly better but its still not enough to win me back)			"

												Would say a single player company is not that exciting as in other total war games. Did not encourage me to carry on till I would have a world domination.In terms of optimization, I have a PC that runs BF 4 on ultra settigns on 120 fps at least. In this game, I can barelly get 50 on high settings, despite graphics still looking uninpressive. In big siege battles(when there are more than 3 or 4 sides) the game starts lagging super bad, units movement starts looking like they teleport around the map. Have this game if you like to do custom battles, but I don't think it is worth it in the long run.			"

												I love the Total war series but I can't for my life enjoy Rome 2.This is the third time I've given the game a chance and I thought I'd play it as you're ""supposed to"", as a Roman.The whole game is hindered by it's terrible, uninformative UI design that is more confusing than helpful.Sea battles are horribly clunky, unresponsive and just plain annoying. Also, ramming is the way to go, over and over again until everything dies. it feels like the AI cheat. I had a province rebel at me, they attack it unguarded and managed to size controll with a minor force which took quite heavy casualties. The next turn I engaged the same army with around 1k troops only to be faced by 1800 which had suddently magically appeared. And the Rebels where more trained than my standing army!  Later on I dealt with rebels, took the city back but had to fight public disorder which I couldn't lower in any way. So I ended up in war with neighbouring countrys, moved my army away from the town and BAM! New rebel army stormed in and sized controll once again without any kind of warning.Then Carthago attacked.I sailed out to engage one of their minor fleets. Didn't have the movement point to engage them two meters away from port for unknown reason so my fleet stopped in the middle of the ocean, surrounded by enemy fleets. This is when I notice that the army I'd told to garison the town, was loaded on ships following my fleet. I had never told them to load onto the boats at any time during the campaign. Needless to say, it was a slaughter.And this is a few turns after I tried for several turns to get another army onto another fleet but couldn't do it for unknown reason again. It's so frustratingly unintuative, uninformative, cluttered and clunky that I can't even play for an hour without tearing my hair. And on top of that, the whole game look like two steps backwards in graphical quality compared to Shogun 2. I seriously can't understand how they ♥♥♥♥ed up so badly on every level when you look at their last game!			"

												Not a bad game by any stretch but definitly a step-down from Total War : Shogun 2 and the Fall of the Samurai. There is a huge map with large number of opponents but it all feels more oppressive than grand. If you're willing to put a hundred or so hours into the game it will most probably be rewarding but as there is no short-campaign option, more time-challenged gamers will find this too slow paced. The need for large investments of time in each game you play means that it can be almost impossible to see why one faction differs from another (apart from starting position) as the bonuses don't add up to large gains very quickly.The unit cards used as displays for what is in your army don't differ enough and the user interface is unusually cluttered without actually revealing any more information than the previous games in the series did. All in all it means the user will have to have a very long look at the game's encyclopedia before any action takes place. The parent company, Creative Assembly, have continued to release patches for this game but have also continued charging a high price ($80 AUSD base game + $7 AUSD for factions/unit packs +  $14+AUSD for campaigns) coupled with core-game features needlessly hidden behind DLC (Blood and Gore, All the faction packs for the grand campaign). Imperetor Augustus campaign is a good free DLC and there should have been more for free up to the point of writing this. Overall 2.5/5 - The tighter combat and map design in Shogun 2 was more to my liking. I live in a place in Australia were online play is unstable so I can't comment on this game's multiplayer.  "

												Total war makes the best strategy games in my opinion, and they didnt fail to amaze me once again with a great game. Total war rome 2 is a great game and i dont get why some people are so negative about it. It has a few bugs in it okay thats true but its still a great strategy game. The battles dont take to long to load, the campaign map is also great. But the only negative thing is that the diplomacy options are not that great BUT if you download a mod for that then it will get better. I would realy like the total war team to add diplomacy options like : Trading city's with other factions and make the faction surrender and give all of their lands to you. But its still a great strategy game and i reccomend buying it.Grade: 9/10			"

												I want to like this game so much, but it is a let down on many fronts. Rome 1 is better despite the dated graphics. Shogun 2 is better and you get more for your money. Overall an ok game brought down by cutting corners, bugs, and missing features. Also much of the game needs to be bought through dlc which is pretty lame. Battles are odd even after many months of patching. Campaign is 'streamlined' to a point how mcdonalds cheeseburger patties are streamlined steaks. This is the weakest game besides the weird mobile/tablet games. Unless you want to have nice looking soldiers fighting from ancient history I would pass on this. Overall 4/10 reviewed on 7-18-14 which is after countless patches. FIghts feel like amoebas smooshing up against one another till one group routes.

												8 major patches and a mini-expansion later...it is perhaps the right time to review this.When it came out earlier in the year Rome II was a huge disappointment, it had been the game I had been most looking forward to for most of the year, the next iteration in a series I enjoyed immensely and a game I had specifically bothered to upgrade my PC for.On release the game was straight up broken, everything from AI and key gameplay mechanics to turn times and performance was quite simply a mess. Some people argued that it was to be expected from Creative Assembly and was no worse than empire however having played both games (and all the ones in-between) on release I would disagree and say it was actually worse simply because of how poor some of the underlying political systems were along with my own views on some of the directions taken (most significantly the removal of family trees and adoption of one turn per year). Basically to me the game wasn't just broken....it was bad.There is no doubt that within the last 3-4 months Rome II has improved significantly, so much so that I would argue it is actually a fun and playable Total War game. Performance is now at least on par with what you would expect from a demanding PC game, the AI has seen a number of improvements and while not problem free it is more capable and responsive on both the campaign and battle map. The amount of small tweaks implemented have also made the user experience much better including removing the performance tanking 'ghost' unit icons and adding numbers onto the unit cards. More promising mechanical changes have also started to be implemented including modifications to the culture and recruitment systems within the last patch.A huge part of Rome II becoming more enjoyable to play is due to the work of the community and the various free mods developed for the game, adding the steam workshop on release is probably one of the best moves that CA made with Rome II. While not averse to applying mods I generally like a more 'vanilla' experience however Rome II is an exception and I could not imagine playing without 2 turns per year, unit icon and Trait overhaul mods.Despite improvements and mods issues still remain with Rome II, the political systems are obviously half baked and lacking in explanation, the game relies on far too many unit buffs and incremental improvements which are sometimes put behind other systems which despite having played 40+ hours still make next to no sense ('Gravitas', 'Authority', 'Cunning' etc). The AI still displays moments of utter stupidity or non-responsiveness, especially in sieges which will hopefully be further improved upon by patches. I would also say that despite tweaks the 'blobbing' of units is still a big problem, this may be more down to the lack of unit object collision detection that is inherent to the engine CA is now using but units still have a rather nasty tendency to morph into a single compacted blob which doesn't always make for interesting battle mechanics.So overall...I would be willing to recommend Rome II. I think it is somewhat helped by the fact that the time period is probably the most suited and interesting it could be for the series but the game has also improved a lot since release and will hopefully continue to do so. A complete revamp of the political systems along with a re-implementation of the family tree would be highly appreciated however I do not expect this to take place until the inevitable retail expansion. Up until that point we have a fairly flawed but nonetheless fun and working experience that will hopefully be improved upon further into 2014.			"

Review of Emperor Edition/Patch 15 in comparison to Rome 1Battles and SiegesBattles last much longer than Rome 1 and with the inclusion of new features like Line of Sight, Rome II's battles more engaging and generally better. Javelins are devastating if left to do their thing, cavalry if used correctly does exactly what it should, and top tier troops can last a VERY long time.The battlefield AI is on occasion outstanding. On these occasions it can leave you gobsmacked. The AI's usage of Line of Sight and it's ability to wait until the right moment in defensive battles is particularly impressive. Siege AI is passable and often very good, it is good enough but still needs work mainly to resolve ongoing glitches.Oh, and most of the magic abilities are gone :)CampaignWhile the styling and design of the campaign mechanics are up for debate, Rome II's less clinical approach to empire manangement is on the whole more involving, much more maleable and less predictable.In Emperor Edition public order is more complex to balance, and also much more changable. Seasons, wars and other factors can contributed to large changes and overall it is much more complex to manage than previous games - which used 1 single attribute for this - population. Rome II's system is more complex and fickle, and for me this is a good thing. In Rome II you will find yourself destroying buildings and redesigning entire provinces often, something I have never done in previous games.Steamrolling is a thing of the past in Emperor Edition - Creative Assembly have finally reduced player income to sane levels, a good player can still make a lot of money, but no way near as much as in the past/previous games. Late and mid game will be much better now.The updated Civil War/Politics mechanics now actually does something, which is good, but the system as a whole is still in my honest opinion nothing more than a polished placeholder with glaring ommisions, such as dynasties/families - no longer can your character have long lasting bloodlines where their offpring inherit traits, like in Medieval 2 for example.Visuals and PerformanceThe game looks and performs very well with a few exceptions - like when a gate is on fire with a lot of men around it, or when thousands of bodies litter the battlefield.There are a LOT of units in Rome II, but because of the sheer massive amount of factions (around 150 in the grand campaign) many factions and cultures can start to feel a bit 'samey' - hopefully we will see further unit/faction packs/freelc's to remedy this. Overall i'm very happy with visuals and performance.SCORE8.5/10 - A great Total War game.			"

Civil war consists of 16 full stack armies appearing next to one city instead of actually effecting the entire empire. Overall, worse then previous total war games and the only redemption is through mods.			"

												Great game, exactly what you want from the TW series. Continues the long line of grandcampaign inovation that we have enjoyed from the series. Some of the minor factions lack distinct units and as a result can feel like blah. However, the historical major powers are great. Seige play has always something that bothered me about the series because there was not incentive to attack. You could starve out the units and not suffer any damage to your stack. This game fixes that with both sides suffering attrition. As a result you have decent seige fights now. Furthermore, stacks of units regen per turn so you don't have disband and send up replacements.  This make upgrading more desirable as the units produced can surrvive for many campaigns making the turns to build improvements finally cost effective. Before in rome 1 having three more stacks of legions built was always better then a 4 turn upgrad as bigger armies always won an gained you more income.  This is no longer a issue.I don't agree with the ""army limt"" but, it does slow snowballing and allows for epic battles bettween larger empires later into the campaign. Bugs: Mostly ironed out, but some strange AI behavior on the battlefield. In my opinon its not that bad but keep in mind i'm a  fan of the series so I'm used to Rome 1's staionary army bug where you had to wait 45 minutes for the batttle to end.			"

												This game failed across all levels. Gameplay is poor most of the factions are unavailable unless you buy dlc that should have been part of the main game to beginw ith. The AI computer both main map and espically combat is beyond horrible even worse than Rome 1. No family tree you, cannot buy garrison units without a damn general. City building is too limited and buildings effects make no sense how does getting food lower happiness. Sea battles and combined land sea battles need more work. Capture the flags in pitched field battles make 0 sense. In seiges perhapes holding important city blocks it does make sense. Unit cards are beyond confusing. Graphics are not all that great certainly the screenshot slook better than the game running on max everything.  Unit blobs to much and inability to give certain commands like stopping pila from being thrown. Animations of units break down rapidly into poorly constructed affrais testudo appear slike magic rather than disciplined troops forming up. Huge step back from Shogun 2 which was a step forward. This game should only be bought for 75% off from an already reduced price. Side note maybe by the end of 2014 it will be playable unmoded and maybe the opus it was suppossed to be rather than the rushed♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. Creative Assembly and Sega have had only excuses rather than admiting they failed in their promise. They as way of apology only offered one DLC for free and only for a short window as recompence so be weary of this game and those that made it.			"

												I will say. This game was a complete let down. I've been a total war fan since the original Shogun Total War to Shogun 2 Total War... I have purchased every total war game you can name. I thought Empire Total War was my biggest let down until I invested 63 hours of my own time in a constant repeat of the same turn over and over again... hoping it would work its self out. I have invested 812 hours of my time into Shogun 2 Total War which to this day I still love. My last few hundered hours I'd play with my buddy(s) and we would constantly talk about awaiting the release of Rome 2. How awesome Rome 2 will be. How we will conquere the ancient roman era.... Instead we constantly have desync issues.... We can't even manage to get through a fifth of our campaign.... before we have to trash it and attempt another. I am now at the point I don't even intend on attempting another coop campaign with anyone and actually look at just uninstalling the game all together. I love playing Total War Games.... Ever since Shogun 2.... I can't play a Total War campaign alone.... It isn't the same with out your buddy.... no matter how many minutes they take to go through with their turn. If your a kind of person who enjoys playing by your self on a game.... by all means buy it.... but if your looking at taking over the world with your best friend.... then there is no reason to attempt the game. Sorry for the let down ladies and gentlemen.....			"

												Here is the review for Rome 2 from a real fan of series since Shogun (First), and i must add, my favourite was not the First Rome like many others instead i favored Medieval 2 greatly.This one, even with some new good ideas especially for coop playing,  is the worst one in the whole series. The most empty , divided , broken , vane  total-war experience you ever had and they try to sell you pieces of the game which undoubtedly should be in the game, such as greek cities, as dlc's. I don't want to go into details of AI (Artificial Idiotism) in this game , since many other already mentioned about it in great detail. I understand nobody loves micro-managing stuff these days but everything is streamlined in this game now to the point of no strategy. (This is where you should stop reading.)Most unit fights goes like one-vs-ones, only important thing is their stats or tiers (or if theyre pikes, chariots, elephants there is no contest) and you will know which one will win for sure, no place for randoms, if somehow this does not bore you down, you can always get amazing siege ai seizures and if you wait long enough, legolas'(plural) at your towers will crush your enemy,  best part is, you will win even if they don't bother, since the ai will be sending its troops mostly by 2s or 4s. (and i must also add, the autoresolve engine would be telling you ""oh boy you're so dead""). As soon as you go co-op with your best pal, you will encounter MORE GAME CRASHING BUGS (incredibly yeah, more than single player), like being stuck in diplomacy screen with not working escape button and no interaction at all, slow-mo battles, slow-mo after battle miniature duel. When you ask your ally to your aid, and if he/she had client states or satrapies, they will refuse the call most of the time, since the call is made by you , not by your ally and since they refuse to join a war their masters joined , their status as client state / satrapy , will end, with a revolt against your ally.Oh and i really can't believe how my cavalry still unable to pursue fleeing enemies properly! C'mon CA that problem is there since your first game!Months past since the first release, many patches released, its much more playable than it was but most of the issues still remain, people mostly play it with mods, fan boys still defend, but at least they don't assume that this will be a better game than its predecessors anymore. Still, who wants to play this?After Shogun 2, this is a disaster. A MAJOR step-down from CA.Do Not Buy until its price drops considerably then buy if you're a fan of the series.BEWARE this game is way worse than Empire, at least in Empire they created a whole new approach to TW from scratch, which laid the foundation for highly praised Shogun 2 and Napoleon.

(generals' also)traits system sucks and has nothing to do with the way you play.family tree??? (pretty much a no-brainer)other families in your faction seem to have different gold source than you, but when its war with a different faction, the gold on troops goes from your own pool? wtf is that even?besides this they didn't add the super cool stuff RTWI had, that really made you get in the game theme.city view for settlements?choosing your capital? (but they also took out the distance from capital thingy, so i guess its fair)setting an heir?wonders of the ancient world?if you're new to the series, all these probably won't bother you.			"

Allows to manage the map effectively. Its a good thing, really, and i like it a lot.2. Overland map rocks. Its really beautiful.3. Squalor system needs osme balancing, but, in general, its fine.4. Battles are gorgeous. Really.5. Can still play on my crappy notebook :)Bad stuff:1. No walls for small cities. Makes me wanna cry.2. No ""friendly fire"" icon when your missile units wtfpoon your own infantry.3. ""Magical"" battle map abilities. I believe there is too much micro in using those.4. Naval battles ramming sucks. Maybe its my fault, but i just cant get it straight.All in all this game still needs tons of polishing (mods are there and some of them are good) and it will be a gem.			"

												This is the first review I have ever written, and probably the last one. But I am so disappointed with this game that I feel that I must do it. As you can see in my profile, I have been trying desperately through hours and hours of playing, to make this game enjoyable, remembering how wonderful and superb this saga was with Rome I and Medieval 2. If I had never known and played his two predecessor (rome I and Medieval 2), I think I should have enjoyed rome 2, but I knew them and I loved them. Then, the question is inevitable: how can Rome 2 be such a big failure? (yes, it is a big failure, no matter how more patches you bring). Here is my answer directly to Creative Assembly: - DO NOT RELEASE a BROKEN GAME. I can forgive you the first time, with EMPIRE, but AGAIN AND AGAIN this is a JOKE. - If you do NOT KNOW to CODE a  IA to build correctly buildings so they do not auto-kill starving each of his armies… DO NOT ADD this feature to the game!. Or just make the IA CHEAT and give it infinite FOOD!.- IF I play Rome, I expect to fight cataphracts of Partia, or phalanx from Macedon, not ALWAYS LEVY Pikemen, LEVY archers, LEVY swordsmen…  AGAIN, If you DON´T KNOW how to CODE a decent AI, make it CHEAT so they can SPAWN ELITE units.  - Reconsider about making strategy games with the absolutely brain-insanity features like: 	- If I AMBUSH an enemy army I can only use ONE army. (I usually force march my armies to engage IA armies one to one..  It´s crazy!). 	- A spy can poison an entire army of elite+veteran units with a high chance. Where´s the epic in that?. I wan´t “TOTAL WAR”!!!. 	- A spy/diplomat/heroe can´t STOP my army from moving from turn to turn. Where´s the epic in that???. I wan´t TOTAL WAR!!!. 	- …  don´t make me continue… Finally, I must say, because it is true, with all this flaws and design errors, this is a 7/10 game. But as I have written at the beginning, I will always remember Rome 1 and Medieval 2, and I KNOW how GOOD it COULD HAVE BEEN if you have done your work correctly. You have FAILED us, your hardcore fans, and you have FAILED…. HORRIBLY…   And there is nothing you can´t say or apologies to give to erase that in my memory. Please, I beg you, learn the lesson, and try to live and work true to the legacy of games like Rome 1, Medieval 2, Shogun, ….      "

												Total War: Rome 2 is now over a year old, if you are like me and you are a huge fan of the series there is a large chance you got the game when it came out, heavy disappointment probably ensued afterwards from a game that was buggy, broken and un-optimised compiling together to make a mess of a game.After about a month after the games came out, fixes and patches started to roll out slowly fixing the broken game. I played the game for a good 70 hours during the broken stages of the game playing the game as they fixed it slowly adding to my enjoyment as the game was slowly fixed. However I had a very long hiatus of the game around July time till a few month ago and If we fast forward to 2014 the game got its “official debut” in the form of the Emperor edition or as I like to call it, “The version we meant to make” it’s taken me from a game I found hard to recommend only to those who are hardcore Total War fans willing to wait out the storm to now I can highly recommend this game to those who enjoy the types of games however I have to make clear there are much better entries in the series.The game is a successor to the first and probably greatest Total War game, Rome. Set in the same time period however now you have a hell of a lot more factions to choose from 117 factions, with say about 20 of those been playable of the top of my head including the DLC factions. The game also boasts a few very good campaign DLC with my personal favourite been Wrath of Sparta and Hannibal at the Gates, but each to his/her own if you choose to purchase them along with the faction DLC.Gameplay:The game runs just like all the games before it with a few new game changing implements such as: now Armies are formed under a general, you can’t make random armies and you only have a limited number of generals and fleets that is based on your successes of your empire in the form of prestige. Personally I like this new addition, it makes the game a little harder but does slow down the pace of majorly large factions but adds a tactical edge to the planning of your empire. The problem with this however is smaller, one settlement factions can afford to somehow field a huge, massive one General armies meaning fighting those small settlements is a dreadful thing to have to do time and time again, but I personally think this is to make the game harder so I can tolerate it and with the pace of the game by the time you are 50 turns in large factions already start to appear and that’s when large wars ensue. Another new feature is the region system, now each region has one large settlement and 2 to 3 smaller non-walled settlements. At first I hated this as you can’t add walls to all settlements making it feel like I’m not in controlled of my cities as much as I wanted but later I grew to like this idea for spicing up the game options and means I have to choose my buildings wisely. Overall I love all the additions to the games apart from Slums, Slums and go fornicate themselves but slums are easily avoided just make sure you build in empty slots before they appear.Graphics:The graphics of the game are very well done, at the time of launch for the scale of the game I saw it to be a very beautiful game and even now I think the games graphics are done very well, my full system specs can be seen on my Profile however I have a TITAN Z with a 2560x1440 monitor at 144Hz and the game runs at about 30fps to highs of 90fps however I would still like to see some better optimization in the game as I feel they can do this. The graphics of the game really help sell the environments and atmospherics of the game from the African deserts to the green forests of Europe. I would agree with some that the graphics are not as promised but if I’m honest I don’t remember what we were promised and enjoy the graphics regardless.The games rocky start means I wasn’t very happy with Creative Assembly who I always saw as a very high end professional PC developer who have created flawless games in the past but let’s hope they have learned from this.I can personally now highly recommend Total War: Rome 2. Pros-	Beautiful looking game-	Classic Total War-	Easy level of complex and simple RTS management-	Lots of FactionsCons-	Game can be very easy even on Legendary-	Game still needs some optimization in graphics-	Slums -.--	One region factions have huge armies compared to there size			"

												Rome Total War II Is basically a Re-Done Re-Worked Re-Painted video game from the original Rome Total War. Personally i would say if you were a new player to the series and didn't know which to pick between the two, while the latest and better graphics seems wonderful, i can honestly say you'd probably find a more thrilling and enjoyable experience with the first Rome Total War. This game brings lots of doubts and disappointment leaving you with the remaining fact it's not as good as whats been brought to us before in Total War, it just falls short.			"

Posted: February 6, 2014
												Having been a fan of the TW series ever since Shogun 1 I simply couldn't miss Rome II. So after waiting for a while to have some major bugs fixed, I finally decided to give the game a try.The first thing I noticed at a faction choosing screen is that there were no hints as to what military strengths and special units each faction has, like in previous games. A minor disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless.So, after the game loaded I proceeded to make my first turn. I've always been taking my sweet time in such games, but even then I was surprised that my very first turn took a whole hour. The reason is a completely new interface (minimization is being popularised too much for my tastes in the later years), new features, and the lack of some old ones. After that one hour I decided to play the prologue first, which took me 10 hours, by the way, and didn't explain any of the things I wanted to find out.So, what's there to notice in general:* You can't hire units without a general, nor you can move your armies without one. No more quick reinforcements from the heart of your empire. No more splitting your army to catch up to some weaker enemy armies with your cavalry. Speaking of which, I didn't notice a type of units affecting the overall army speed like in previous games, where hiring a siege weapon greatly reduced the army speed. But maybe that's just me.* Diplomacy has been significally cut. No more political marriages between the factions, no open map trade, no city trade. The only way to get a settlement in Rome II is to capture it, you can't purchase it from other factions anymore.* Several close-located settlements form provinces now. Each province consists of a city, where you can build your most advanced buildings, and 1-3 villages. Happiness is spread throughout the settlements you own in that province. Culture is spread throughout the whole province no matter how many factions own it. Which, in turn, can make alliances a little less effective, because you would obviously aim at owning provinces in whole, without having your ally spreading his culture to your cities, thus affecting a public happiness.* You can't adjust tax rates for each province exclusively anymore. The tax rate is the same throughout your faction. The only thing you can do is to exclude a province from tax collection.* There is no more faction family tree. Totally. The ony people your faction consist of are generals, admirals, and senators, which are fully interchangeable (a general can become an admiral, then a senator, etc.), and there is no confirmation as to whether they are even blood related.* Agents have become more useful. The main reason to that is because they can't die during a mission. At all. The worst thing that could happen to your agent after a failed assassination attempt is the agent being wounded and coming back to work in a couple turns. The only ways to lose an agent are him being assasinated or manipulated with an enemy agent. By the way, manipulating enemy dignitaries to join you is somewhat strange. I managed to capture a druidess and have her spread Latin culture the very next turn. Really?..* Even after so much time since the release of the game it has still got a lot of bugs. So don't be surprised if you get a critical error after winning a long and tough battle.The overall rating:If you are a fan of TW series, I'd still recommend to play Shogun 2 instead. Too many features have been stripped, not many new added in their place. But if you are new to the series and have nothing to compare it to, the game itself is good enough to spend a couple weeks on.			"

												Please, no more poor souls purchase this discrasefull sequel to a mighty predecessor. This game over a year after release is still riddled with bugs, unless some workshop files are added. The developers own content is rubbish and people should be payed to play it. If you purchase this game, be prepared to only be able to have half the bloody content as for moneys sake, the developers have released a gratuitous amount of DLC's to try and suck dry the pockets of devoted fans of this series. My favourite DLC has to be the Blood and Gore DLC, allowing players to see small amounts of blood and gore in combat only   $2.99 US. These things should be released with the original game rather then trying to milk it for every penny. They have abused the popularity of thier previous titles with this discrasefull game. You can't even unlock factions, unlike almost every preceding Total War game. You are able to purchase factions as DLC content which really is just a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Instead of conquering civilisations you just♥♥♥♥♥♥you're money up against the wall and still don't have a full working game.  For anyone reading this review, please save you're money, go out for dinner or buy yourself something nice rather than buying this trash.			"

												I do not recommend this game.Since it was released it took ~15 patches to make the game remotely playable. It still isn't a good product. Why?I was shocked by CA's policy switch in making Total Wars in the recent years. The whole switch to arcadey styles, rushing, questionable and enraging DLC policy, closing mod development support and more.When Rome 2 came out, it was a mess. Unplayable, buggy, awkward in all aspects. Then all that mess about ""listening"" to player feedback, staunchly defending the obvious issues and ignoring them. After 15 patches here we are and I gave the game another shot. Still disappointed with the game mechanics and polish...and then they announce Attila. A reskin(Barbarian Invasion, anyone?) which any modder could make if they actually released proper modding tools and unlocked all aspects. All in all, the Total War series is dumbed-down, and in my opinion not worth buying until CA gets their bussiness together and stop charging reskins after reskins with overpriced DLC(Which should be in the base game anyway).

												I've been a HUGE total war fan for over 10 years. I've played Creative Assembly's games for 100s upon 100s of hours. Rome 1 was legendary! Medieval 2 was grand! Shogun 2 was beautiful! Rome 2 is................ the product of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, stupid, ugly and lack of creativity (oh the irony) all smashed into one. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN CA?I will put this review in different categories. I will compare this product to other total war games. (My playthroughs have been on the hardest difficulty.)The campaign: You start of as a small faction with a limited amount of armies. As you capture more and more cities you get stronger. Pretty basic for a strategy game isn't it? However... you'd expect the AI doing the same right? So you wont steam-roll the whole map once you get strong enough to do so. In shogun 2 there would be atleast 3 other factions in the endgame who would give you a challange. In rome 2 this never happens! Not even a single great empire rises. The AI is almost non-existant! Its like playing chess against a 2 year old!The battles: Where you are supposed to have the most fun! THE BATTLES! It is here where you the tacitical mastermind can shine! And yes! you do shine! ALL THE TIME! Is it because you outsmarted the AI? YES! and no... Outsmarting the AI in this game is like outsmarting a potato. Either the AI doesn't move at all (mostly this happens in sieges) or the AI do the most stupid moves not even you can think of.          Does the battles look epic? yes kinda. The projectiles look awesome! how the stick to the shields, bodies and bounce off things. But the actuall melee look like a mess. soldiers rubberbanding all over the place and bugging out. Soldiers now only fight 1vs1. Which is a downgrade from Rome 1. that game was made 10 YEARS AGO! In rome 1 armies clashed realisticly. In rome 2 armies clash and morph into a huge epileptic seizure. Graphics: The graphics is good. It isn't outdated or anything... but compared to Shogun 2 it is basicly nothing. Shogun 2 had great lighting effects, an amazing set of colors, beautiful water effects and so on. Rome 2 have all that completely removed. They've put in some cool facial animations... or so they say. Never really seen it. other than their mouths opening and closing from time to time. Last words: This game is build upon a game engine designed for Empire total war. That shows. the projectiles works great! But that's about it... The melee was never a key focus for this engine. And thus the battles look stupid and kill immersion as soon as armies clash. If you haven't been a total war fan you might find this game fun. If you are a total war fan and know what this series can do.... then... You will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ As many fans are.			"

												During the rather buggy launch, I was quite unhappy with Rome 2, I had FPS issues even on low settings which made the great looking campaign map a pain to go through, all the models had stupid faces and the naval combat was terrible. But the game has been patched alot now and I feel it's a better game than what it was but it still could be better.Campaign Map:The map during the turn based sections is incredible, the Hyperbolic terrain really makes the different areas feel truely different. It is also huge, From Western spain all the way to Iran in the east - although it isn't as big geographically as the Empire: Total War map, it does feel alot bigger. It would have been alot better with seasons though, which should have been put in there anyway. The cities are huge on the map and you can expand them to fit more buildings but this is so rarely used and the animation is so short that it isn't that important. Foreign nations in the game are way too peaceful, in my Current campaign as the Roxolani on Very Hard I have been declared war on only once right at the beginning of the campaign, In my first campaign as Rome I didn't lose 1 city throughout to the whole campaign on normal and I don't think any nation declared war on me at all, It does get very boring after a bit so I'd advise playing on harder difficulties. The A.I. also very annoyingly requests stupid things for insane amounts of money which makes ending the turn a pain as you can't just leave it for a bit because it gets stuck on them diplomatic requests.Battle:The battles in this compared to the other Total wars are fast; Units brake quite quickly so I find myself using the slow motion sometimes just to command my troops quick enough. The A.I. is quite stupid still - especially in sieges, E.G. they run to the front of the gates sometimes and just stare at it whilst being cut down by archers. The battles aren't particuarly hard either, in my Roxolani campaign and my Rome Campaign I could defeat armies twice the size of mine with just simple flanking and skirmishing as the Roxolani or just standing in formation and letting the opponents attack whilst doing obvious flanking manoeuvers as Rome. The Terrain and the models during the battles do look great and the fighting animations seem ok, but again, they happen too fast so you don't really see them.Creative Assembly (or SEGA) acting like EA:With all these DLC's Creative Assembly is basically screwing people over. Paying to get factions which should be there for free is insane. The series does seem to be going downhill. An Example of these terrible choices is the Blood and Gore DLC, it should have been an option in the main game already! This sort of stuff is that DLC Quest mocks and it is a shame because Total war is one of my favourite franchises.I really can't decide whether to reccomend this or not as it isn't that bad of a game, but I know it could have been so much more. If you are going to buy it wait for a big sale or a proper price drop. This game does get alot of hate and I understand why, but I still enjoy it as it is still a Total war game, but I feel this game is good by its franchise heritage but not its individuality. If you don't have Shogun 2 or any other Total war games and want a Total war game, get Shogun 2 first, then the others.			"

They AI still needs some improvement but the AI on total war games have never been brilliant, it's why they are modable.The patches have greatly improved the game, even in performance.

												After playing for 500+ hours, I can only say this is the worst game in the series. Half the features that made the previous Total War games epic were removed (Family tree, seasons, deep character building, agent videos, faction intros), followed by terrible design decisions (Metal-blowing torches that can destroy gates, magical abilities that can make entire armies rout without any sense at all, Civil Wars that spawn 12 stacks of elite armies in your capital, Armies being able to move across the sea just by walking into it, 2500 base income allowing tiny village factions to destroy superpowers, etc), and bugs/performance issues everywhere.The only good 'things' about the game were expected to be there regardless like better graphics, tech tree, naval battles, no 300 bc Egyptians.Rome II, 1 step forward, 10 steps backward.Edit: After a year of updates, the game is finally playable and most bugs/performance issues/poor gameplay designs have been sorted out. There's only a few inconveniences left such as torches, lack of family tree, shallow character building (3 traits and 1 ancillary only, 2 traits if you include political promotions), but at least they tried.Game went from 2/10 to 8/10 as of Emperor Edition release.

												Rome II is a great game. If you're looking to get your first TW game it's definately worth considering.  As far as single player goes, it has a very bare bones political system compared to Attila, but many players don't mind. That said, that's one of the only  negatives that comes to mind for campaign that's unique to this Total War game. It has a lot of factions with some large variety in them that you just don't find in most other Total War games and can bring you a lot of hours of replayability.Eventually like all other TW games the single player gets kind of old because once you get a good grasp on the game it's so easy to beat the AI. It's not necessarily CA's fault, it's a dautning task to make an AI challening in a game like this, which goes for every TW game. The good news is that Rome II is in my opinion, the best TW game around for multiplayer. Despite there being two newer titles there are still quite a few people playing Rome II ever day of all skill levels. It simply is the best MP experience for several reasons: It has some nice diversity in the factions available, and what may  appear to newcomers to be similar factions coming from the same ethnic peoples, you'll soon learn that there's actually some moderate to large differnces in them.  Yet there's a fairly good balance at play in the game between a large portion of the factions and the differences only become very obvious when you play against someone who is very near your skill level.Atilla is a better single player experience imo because of the challenges and horde system along with a very flushed out political system, but nothing beats Rome II for mulitpayer. Total War Warhammer is very anti-strategic and while it can be fun to do for a while it quickly becomes stale with tons of cheese builds and unit effects making you questions why you're bothering playing it as a strategy game.

												I have to say, upon buying this game on launch I had many issues with it, critical errors and crashes like no tomorrow - but with the various patches that have been released the issues seem to have slowly disappeared and now its just an awesome game to experience Multiplayer Campaign with, I wish the Multiplayer campaign could be more than 4 players, but I guess we can't have everything.If you're a fan of the campaign modes, I even recommend trying out the DLCs, not just the map changes but the time-frame changes and research changes make the game feel entirely different in pacing and progression. I could replay Caesar in gaul nearly a dozen times and I think I will :p			"

												Absolutely love this game. It had a really bad release, full of bugs and unforgiveable idiocy, but the patches have really fixed up the game and it runs like a charm. No doubt it's a bit of a system hog (especially on the highest graphics settings), but the beautiful scenes when two units clash, how javelins actually stick into the units they hit, these all add wonderful effects to the game and really immerse you in your battles.Unofrtunately, Shogun 2 is far superior in terms of the graphics, in my opinion. Regardless, the gameplay in Rome 2 is superb, especially in multiplayer. I've sunk hours into playing with friends, combatting eachother, even playing as the AI during their battles to make things that little bit harder for them! I would recommend this game to anyone, but imo if you really wanna stay interested, play it MP!			"

												Clunky early release aside (which seems to be becoming the industry standard as of late - I'm looking at you EA!), it did take a while for this game to get patched up to playable standard. Initially plagued by poor performance and lacklustre AI, this game made you want to run back to Shogun 2's ample bosom. However, several months in the frame rate issues have been fixed and even the AI has seen some improvements making the game very playable and enjoyable indeed. Having said that, I have yet to sample the computer's siege-game logic in my Iceni campaign!The bottom line is - if you are a fan of Total War, you won't be disappointed.			"

If you've played Rome I or Medieval II, you will have a feeling of what I am talking about after playing Rome II. The graphic visuals are amazing, but it feels like ""something"" (actually a lot of ""somethings"") is/are missing. I just wish they would recreate the exact Rome I or Medieval II with the same graphics engine of Rome II. That would be perfect.			"

												Total War is one of the best strategy franchises imho.Rome II, while not the best in the series, still manages to capture the essence of the battlefield and with the new patches, battles have become more enjoyable.For Shogun II owners, it's only worth it if you like the era the game plays in.For those who don't own Shogun II, you should take a look at it. It's an older TW game, but that means it has had more time for patches and the price is generally lower than Rome II. Overall, it's an okay-ish game that I would recommand if on sale.			"

												Update after almost 2 years.-------------------------------------------------------The game is now essentially another title. No bugs, better and challenging AI, new features. A Total War title as it should have been at launch. Now, with it's price so low and in this state i can wholeheartedly recommend this game.Old Review:I have been playing the series since the first Shogun. My favorite installment has been Rome Total War which i have been playing non stop since its release to this day and especially Barbarian Invasion (and the appropriate mods later on).Total War series have always been a mark in gaming. I would enjoy any other game but i would count the days for the next installment in the series and speculate which time period it would be about. I was midly dissapointed with Empire's launch and the mandatory steam activation but i loved the period so i enjoyed it. Sadly i wasn't able to play Shogun II as i was lacking a proper rig and i made a promise to get back to it later.Rome II came along. I pre-purchased (which i never do) and when i was 30 mins in game i couldn't believe it. Waterdowned battle, erratic AI, broken multiplayer and a walk in the park difficulty even in legendary.So i came back to Shogun II to find that a previous installment was in everyway better than Rome II. Managable dynasty and generals, better UI and micromanagement, heck even the diplomacy works better.Plus CA moneygrabs the heck out of the fans with senseless dlcs. That was the line for me. After many years this will be the last title that i buy full price from the Total War series.			"

												I love Rome 2, but good godly jesus this game frustrates the hell outta me. My computer is to crappy to play this game well so i never had the same problems with the game as all those other people. The ones who were like ""the AI is an idiot and its not challenging enough"" or people who are like ""even on extreme settings its not as good as Shogun 2"" and blah blah blah. I remeber my first review of this game when i was to excited to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about the fact that it never♥♥♥♥♥♥♥worked. *sighs* how i miss that. i have no problem with the game itself so far because i have never had a chance in my oppinion to actully play it. But still i like it so if you like total war and rome go ape♥♥♥♥♥♥ im guessing your computer is better than mine.			"

												Like many other I love Total War series and play since Medieval II. But this serie is going all the way down!!- No family tree (and current ""family bussiness"" is so absurd)- Has no audio tracks whatsoever (what happened all those good trakcs since Medieval II?? really??)- So called and promised ""intrigues"" lack depth.- Play style of game is totally ABSURD. Armies cross over your land while their terratories desimated. You take your enemy's lands and he keeps taking your lands and so and on..It just makes the game longer and nonsense.- Armies/navies always stop near enemy armies JUST BEFORE THE EDGE. You just cant attack , it is like there is an invisible wall and you just cant reach enemy army for a reason whatsoever??! You just keep chasing and chasing until you realize you just spend hours and hours spending on this crappy game and achieving nothing.I honostly expected really more from  Rome II but it seems only thing that developed is graphics.This game is not worth buying unless there is like %70 discount or something. I pre ordered this game but I will not pre-order any Total War game again. NEVER!			"

												What can be said? As this is my very first Total War game, I don't have anything to compare it to, although I hear some of the previous ones should be better?In my experience this is a very good game, which could ofcourse need some polish or unit variation as a lot of them just seem like reskins. Luckily we have a BIG modding community to do those left-over chores which the devs have long since abandoned. If there were not any mods or DLC's, then this game would be on the verge of being a negative review. The DLC's are kind of a must, as they bring in a lot of new playable factions, and even some good new campaigns! The modding support is probably the biggest plus for me, so to sum it up:The good+ Great replayability+ Good graphics+ Lots of different factions to discover (IF you buy the DLC's)+ Different battle modes+ Micro- and macromanaging, not in the negative way!+ Absolutely great to play with friends!+ A huge variety of mods+ SPARTAThe bad- Not a huge amount of different units (mods make up for this though)- Boring music (there's a mod for other types of music)- Bad perfomance in big battles (even for the better rigs)			"

												Fun when it works. DON'T BUY AT FULL PRICE. The actual value of this game is at 75% - only then is this damaged game at a fair price. Even a year on from the intial debacle of a launch, the game has issues. Not to mentioning the blatant profiteering with dlc which, adds minimal amounts of new gameplay. Unfortuantly, I love total war too much and love is blind so, I have it and still play it.			"

												This game was too glitchy at launch, I have had my fun with this but the glitchiness I have expereinced is sometimes annoying. The AI is just stupid, and too passive if you ask me. I would like if if the other nations would be more colorful like in Total War: Shogun II. By more colorful I mean the nations wouldn't just be Friendy, Passive and Aggresive. There were more shades to how they reacted to what you did. Also the AI's combat is terrible, watch as your neat perfect assault formation gets ruined the second you hit the enemy. Once your formation is ruined all the people group up in a horrible moshpitty blob. I have played a lot of co-op in this, it's passible but didn't bring much to the table from Shogun II. Honestly I could go on and on about how Shogun II was better gameplay-wise and how it is a finished game, so you can tell that I reccomend Shogun II over Rome II as it is finished and it's just more fun in my oppinion.P.S.; I have 40 more hours of gameplay on Shogun II than Rome II (Shogun: 121 hours, Rome: 81 hours)7/10			"

												This game displeased an entire generation of Total War fans. Of course those were the fans that I did not agree with at all. This game finally does the series justice by returning to its roots and becoming a strategy game again. Ever since Empire and Napoleon it has been a multiplayer that also had some strategy to it. The added little gems make it much more fluid of a game and it stops the old problem of having to make 50 armies just to maintain order. Order is now about city and region mangement and no longer reliant on masses of troops.The units are well expanded from the original and the seige part of the game especially is much improved. The bells and wistled have been stripped so it is not as pretty to look at any more. You have to read instructions and listings to learn your units and buildings etc...It is an old fashioned war game for old fashioned war gamers like me. I play it with Steam offline because I don't want to be bothered while playing. I like it that much.			"

												Comparing Emperor Edition to the 1.0 game is like day and night. It took them a year but at least they fixed the game.This game offers many unique factions to play with (I ll go to the DLC policy later) and the vanilla factions are a nice mix of hellenic eastern barbarian roman and carthaginian culture.  The time period is in my opinion a great playground and every campaign (while your early tactics are similar for the most part) is different. For example one time i saw the Etruscan Empire sacking Rome and on an other campaign they got rekt by turn 5. This makes for the most part the game fun to play and it offers a unique challenge everytime.  Now going to battles. The game engine is faulty yes, but the issues were at last fixed. Some problems are the game engines fault not the developers fault. For all of you complaining they cant use the engine from Medieval II and Rome I they would basically use a 10 year old game engine.  The warscape engine suits archers peltasts etc very nice but the cavalry fights in particular are a bit clumpsy. The infantry fights look much better in comparison to version 1.0 but it seems that there was margin to improve. About OP units and OP strats, they exist in pretty much every game, this is how it works. This is where modders step in. CA doesnt have endless time for balancing tests etc they need to release a new game in a certain period (Many people see SEGA as the issue here i am not oging to talk about that). Now coming to DLCs. In my opinion a big reason this game recieved a lot of hate. You make a game in the ancient time and we have to pay for the Greeks? Well not all of the Greeks we got the Diadochoi for free which had the most power in the hellenic world during the time period the game is set but its still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you dont like a DLC just dont buy it dont spread s*** to Hades and back. Yes you can see me criticizing the Greek States DLC but you need to understand that CA is business. And they (just like all other companies) want to make money. DLCs such as Nomadic Tribes and Black Sea colonies are in my opinion a good idea they are just new unique factions with not so good rosters so if you play TW competitevly you wouldnt be in a disadvantage because you couldnt play as the Attalid Pergamon(Derpamon). Coming now to modding of Rome II. PFM and Assembly kit are very user friendly programms(although PFM likes to crash). There have been many overhauls from complete to campaign ones. And if you see the overhaul-fix mods as a bad thing you are wrong. Mods exist to make the game even better so that the casual player can experience a better game. CA is there to fix the problems, mods are more of a help to the problem fix.UI.The cards are not exactly brilliant(Hard to distinguish first cohort from eagle cohort at a quick glance if you are new for example), but they work. And yes there are mods that change them incase you dont like them.The lists on the campaign map (forces provinces etc) are an awesome new feature allowing you to see the positions of your armies and agents at a glance. Now naval battles.Yes even in emperor edition are buggy but if i am not mistaked in Rome IIs days the naval battles were the best we had even with the bugs but you need to take into account the fact that naval battles were something of a new thing back then and as with new stuff, it takes some time for them in order to be optizimed and provide you the ideal gaming experienceBut but but but...If you have played older Total War Games like Medieval II or Rome I you may find the game ""too simple"" (eg the buildings) Sure its simple for an experienced player, but players new to TW series need a place to learn the game and in my opinion it does that well. And if you think that Rome II is inferior to Rome I i will agree with you. BUT BUT BUT....If Half Life 3 ever comes out you think it is going to be as good as Half Life 2? I don't think so.The game surely was a disaster upon launch, but its a solid game now.8/10Buying the DLCs on sale is a very prudent and sound idea			"

												Original review a few months after the game launched.  Updated review (08OCT14) is below this.steaming pile of broken crap.  CA was the ONLY company I was a fanboy for anymore, and theyve lost my loyalty now.They put out patches that beta testers have TOLD THEM WERE BROKEN, and are pushing DLC when THE BASE GAME STILL DOESNT F%$KING WORK.Dont buy this, EVER, until its on sale for 5-10$ and it actually works.  Dont support this crap, wish I had my pre-order money back.Updated as of 08OCT14, a bit over a year since release.  The game... is now playable.  Not great, not amazing, in no way better than anything before it except Napoleon(which isnt saying much), but playable.  Doesnt freeze, turns dont take 10 min each to load, AI is still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but they ""buffed"" it by giving it advantages.. aka more income than the player to support more armies on harder difficulites.  So... AI is still a joke.  But you can get some enjoyment out of the base game.  The majority of my playtime though is with the radius mod.  Totally overhauls the whole game, makes it much more enjoyable.  It is also 100% multiplayer and achievement compatible, though to play the multiplayer youll need to make sure you both have the exact same mods installed, or just radius mod.I definitely still will NOT recommend spending full price on the game.  CA is still pushing DLC, and now have announce a whole new title, Atilla.  ..and Rome 2 still isnt fully ""fixed"".  So... dont hold your breath.  But, for 10-15$, especially if you use the radius mod through the workshop, you can now probably get your money out of this game.  I for one though will never again pre-order from CA.			"

												Guide on how to Rome II:Step 1: Decide to play the Grand CampaignStep 2: Select the Roman factionStep 3: Start researching economic techs. (You see if you have all the gold your enemies won't have any to raise armies with!)Step 4: Disband all armies to ensure that no rebellions happen. (How can someone revolt when there is no army to back them?)Step 5: Destroy all buildings (Buildings are expensive and there are much better free buildings)Step 6: Wait until all the open building slots are taken by slums (This will give a place for the poor people to live, and there by, increasing public order.)Step 7: Now that you've successfully quelled all possible public disruptions before they could happen, you can focus on the real problem, diplomacy!Step 8: You see if you've followed step 2 correctly you should have all the gold by now, and the other factions will be jealous and want your gold, so simply give them all your gold!Step 9: Now that the neighboring factions have all your gold they will want your territories as well, so you will need to allow them to take all your territories (This is to avoid any ""negative diplomatic relations"")Step 10: Victory for Rome!This review was brought to you in part by: The Carthaginians			"

												Total War: Rome II is a strategy game based on the Old Roman Empire. Now, most fans of the old TW series says it's ""meh"" Because it requires less ""strategy and intellegence ..."" But I do enjoy it very much, the fighting scenes, the way things were done such as buying new buildings and units were alot easier and do-able. It does take Intellegence to place units, flank, and pollitics are alot .. Harder persay. Now, I do agree, it doesn't take alot of intellegence to hit a guy in the head with a javelin or a rock or such, but hey, cmon... It's b.c.250... Graphics are amazing, and the game is quite addicting, Worth every penny.			"

												Did they fix the bugs? No. Fixing some of the bugs, but leaving game-killing bugs in place does not count as fixing the bugs. One of the main bugs was the inability to disembark naval units despite the presence of space on the map. I held off buying Rome II because of the problems with Shogun II, and got the Empire Edition. First playthrough, and I can't disembark my units in the Prologue. I also can't pull the ships back and try again. So, all the time I spent getting to that point has been wasted.  So I would recommend holding off on buying this game for another year and then check back to see if the bugs are fixed. I feel burned by CA over this, since the Empire Edition was supposed to be their ""we've got all of the bugs worked out"" edition, not their ""we need more of your to buy our buggy game"" edition.

Its made notable improvements to Rome I but the AI in this game are pretty crap compared to Rome I. This can be seen not only on the real-time battle field but also on the campaign map. I play on medium and i find it easy. Diplomacy is kinda useless and the construction and recruitment menus are worse than before. It is still a good game and if you like the series, get it!

												After TW:Rome I wait a loong for a Rome 2. After shogun 2 i have a ""dream"" about thst Rome 2 will be a great game. And after realse of game I was......The worst game in TS series (I don't have Napoleon). I spend about 750+ hours in game ( but a lots of time try to modding this game). Shogun 2 is much more better then Rome2. I like the ancient time, but I don't feel this ancient times in this game. Game is very poor with aspect which we had is previous game in TW series.What is the worst with game:- Poor AI diplomatic ( But I think this is in all game from TW series.)- Stupid AI on strategic map and on battle field. AI will attack cites even if AI don't have any chance to win a battle, or stupid stuff like: dtupid movement of armies on campaign map, it's look like - What the hell I have to do, what the hell I do, ups I forgot. SO AI will move between two points in map for few round when enemy army siege his cities.- AI in sedge battles is ...... .- Poor soldiers animations in battle. ( Shogun 2 have beautiful fight animation )- Unit's formations: the way how they look like, animations, hole units behavior. Units never hold their formation as they should have. Testudo formation and the phalanx look terrible and soldiers behavior is idiotic. When I remember how this look like in old TW:ROME. Rome units fight in tight formations. They where learn to fight in formation, they don't brake formation, but in game we have great solo fight battles. - Shogun 2 have better graphic ( in my opinion)- General experience tree is too simple, and whole general system I never care about generals, If he die I take other one.- Stupid rebellion system. Rebels armies is always spawned near cites, always with 4 units, and start plunder your region. Stupid AI behavior. - Very stupid and simple auto-resolve system (autobattles). I try to fix this system, I spend a lots of hours for test in this game, but this system is broken. example transport fleet is win battle VS naval units. SO why we need naval fleet. I make a mod to fix that but a land battles are hard to fix. Poor units like levies are able to win with elite army. - Game become bored, after when you conquer some lands. It's too easy. - Only few cities maps. So after some time you know all buildings in cites, You use the same strategic and game become more bored. The game have so many bugs, deficiencies that is to hard to say all of them.What is in plus:+ Nice region/provinces system.+ I don't know, it this on plus but a huge numbers of patches for game (after resale the game was unplayable I was im shock when I sow the game in my first play)+ Some new options in game like Some diplomatic options but AI don't use it. + Ability to play with mods.+ Divide et Impera MOD - without this mod or similar mods the game is unplayable, boring and too easy.+ Divide et Impera MOD+ Divide et Impera MODThis is not en error I write 3 times about Divide et Impera MOD. This mod is a this something what make that I'm still play in ROME 2. Without this mod I give about 5/10 points. With this mod I give 7/10I really try to love this game. The game look beautiful on screen, in trailers. I like this time period, but I don't feel it in this game. SO If you bay this game don't play in vanilla, try to DL some mods which fix and change a lots of game aspect which make this game playable, and better. At the end I can tell something what ROME 2 makes with me. After this game I start hate CA (devs.), that's why I will not bay TW:Attila. Probably I will never bay it or buy it when the Attil will cost 5 euro, or game will have a huge modification, which fix a game(something like DeI mod). Rome 2 was too bugy, unfinished, too simple for me. Attila will look similar. Probably Rome 2 is the last game in TW series, which I bay. This is how I start hate TS series after Rome 2.For this who never see this game after release, and how this game looks like watch this review  


YouTube™ Video: Total War: Rome II Angry Review 

			Views: 3,584,759		

			PROS & CONS Breakdown Here: http://angryjoeshow.com/2013/09/total-war-rome-ii-angry-review/		

P.S. Sorry for my English.EDIT I forgot to write about naval battles- System of naval transport units. Land units are able to enter on sea without any time need to board/build transport ships. It's idiotic. When you attack a cities from sea not only naval units fight with you on sea but a city garrison too, with their transport ships. They got a ships, they build a trans. ships in few minutes. This part of game is terrible.- Naval battles are terrible too. Trans units are better in naval battles against real naval units. So fleet with trans units will always win battle against real naval units. Boarding party is really crap. You need to touch enemy ship and boarding starts. No hooks, ropes, ramps, but ships are connected like with super glue. At this time (ancient) the ramming was the main strategy in naval battles. In Rome 2 this is boarding. What is the best even ships which don't have ram try to ramming you. Empire and shogun 2 have better naval battles. And the biggest argument why I don't recommended you this game is ""THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED"". Game have so many bugs, errors, unhistorical aspects or unthinking aspects, and we got now Attila. So we never see a new patch for a Rome 2, none of bugs or aspect will be fixed. This♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. But if TW Attila were a DLC for Rome 2 I will say this game should be RECOMMENDED. I even bought DLC Atilla for Rome 2 even for 20-30 Euro. Attila have some fixes which should be in Rome 2 long time ago. So that's why I never bay any TW series game any more. They leave unfinished game like Rome2 and publish new with similar bugs, error to pull out from us, as much money as they can..			"

												Good pathing, good controls of the game, easier grouping, and better formation controls. Basically it improved total wars overall battle to an easier yet more advanced system. The campaign side of the spectrum is a massive and the newly added faction system makes for a worthwhile event that will keep you from just building up troops and picking your generals properly. Overall with all the patches it's one of the best total wars to date.			"

												Guide on how to Rome II:Step 1: Decide to play the Grand CampaignStep 2: Select the Roman factionStep 3: Start researching economic techs. (You see if you have all the gold your enemies won't have any to raise armies with!)Step 4: Disband all armies to ensure that no rebellions happen. (How can someone revolt when there is no army to back them?)Step 5: Destroy all buildings (Buildings are expensive and there are much better free buildings)Step 6: Wait until all the open building slots are taken by slums (This will give a place for the poor people to live, and there by, increasing public order.)Step 7: Now that you've successfully quelled all possible public disruptions before they could happen, you can focus on the real problem, diplomacy!Step 8: You see if you've followed step 2 correctly you should have all the gold by now, and the other factions will be jealous and want your gold, so simply give them all your gold!Step 9: Now that the neighboring factions have all your gold they will want your territories as well, so you will need to allow them to take all your territories (This is to avoid any ""negative diplomatic relations"")Step 10: Victory for Rome!This review was brought to you in part by: The Carthaginians			"

												This game is awesome. All of the people who say it was terrible were the people that rushed CA so they had to release rome II early, unfinished, as they still worked on the game. Then the people said the game was crap. Well you rushed them and made them release an unfinished game! Next, the patches covered up almost all glitches, but ones like after a character ranks up they turn grey indefinatly, or the character rank often doesn't show are still remaining, but almost all are gone, and people are STILL complaining. And even the people that do hate it have played 300 hours of it, and posted about 10 youtube videos of them playing it. And yes, they removed the family tree, that sucks, but there are so many new features! Like how people need attention, or recruiting mercenaries,  which all are just awesome! Anyone who hates this game just seems like a 5 year old supporting his opinion even though he has been proved wrong.			"

												An amazing game. Ok it had a really rough start. Infuriated me, yes, but the community and the continuous effort from CA makes the experience really enjoyable. I would recommend that players pick this game up if ever they're interested in the era or History that's included here.  Especially now that mods have kicked it up a notch and gameplay seems to be pretty stable if not good.			"

												The game is a broken, buggy mess, if the AI manages to put up a fight you still aren't very lucky because you get to watch an ugly mosh pit of a battle completely devoid of any tactics where you spam ""magic"" abilities that buff stats etc like it was LoL.The sad truth is, even if they fix the bugs the game has been streamlined and had most of it's features ripped out as part of their actual Metatcritic Analysis method of removing nearly complete features if they wouldn't ""improve the metacritic score"".Avoid, there's a reason it's on sale so early on in it's life.

												After TW:Rome I wait a loong for a Rome 2. After shogun 2 i have a ""dream"" about thst Rome 2 will be a great game. And after realse of game I was......The worst game in TS series (I don't have Napoleon). I spend about 750+ hours in game ( but a lots of time try to modding this game). Shogun 2 is much more better then Rome2. I like the ancient time, but I don't feel this ancient times in this game. Game is very poor with aspect which we had is previous game in TW series.What is the worst with game:- Poor AI diplomatic ( But I think this is in all game from TW series.)- Stupid AI on strategic map and on battle field. AI will attack cites even if AI don't have any chance to win a battle, or stupid stuff like: dtupid movement of armies on campaign map, it's look like - What the hell I have to do, what the hell I do, ups I forgot. SO AI will move between two points in map for few round when enemy army siege his cities.- AI in sedge battles is ...... .- Poor soldiers animations in battle. ( Shogun 2 have beautiful fight animation )- Unit's formations: the way how they look like, animations, hole units behavior. Units never hold their formation as they should have. Testudo formation and the phalanx look terrible and soldiers behavior is idiotic. When I remember how this look like in old TW:ROME. Rome units fight in tight formations. They where learn to fight in formation, they don't brake formation, but in game we have great solo fight battles. - Shogun 2 have better graphic ( in my opinion)- General experience tree is too simple, and whole general system I never care about generals, If he die I take other one.- Stupid rebellion system. Rebels armies is always spawned near cites, always with 4 units, and start plunder your region. Stupid AI behavior. - Very stupid and simple auto-resolve system (autobattles). I try to fix this system, I spend a lots of hours for test in this game, but this system is broken. example transport fleet is win battle VS naval units. SO why we need naval fleet. I make a mod to fix that but a land battles are hard to fix. Poor units like levies are able to win with elite army. - Game become bored, after when you conquer some lands. It's too easy. - Only few cities maps. So after some time you know all buildings in cites, You use the same strategic and game become more bored. The game have so many bugs, deficiencies that is to hard to say all of them.What is in plus:+ Nice region/provinces system.+ I don't know, it this on plus but a huge numbers of patches for game (after resale the game was unplayable I was im shock when I sow the game in my first play)+ Some new options in game like Some diplomatic options but AI don't use it. + Ability to play with mods.+ Divide et Impera MOD - without this mod or similar mods the game is unplayable, boring and too easy.+ Divide et Impera MOD+ Divide et Impera MODThis is not en error I write 3 times about Divide et Impera MOD. This mod is a this something what make that I'm still play in ROME 2. Without this mod I give about 5/10 points. With this mod I give 7/10I really try to love this game. The game look beautiful on screen, in trailers. I like this time period, but I don't feel it in this game. SO If you bay this game don't play in vanilla, try to DL some mods which fix and change a lots of game aspect which make this game playable, and better. At the end I can tell something what ROME 2 makes with me. After this game I start hate CA (devs.), that's why I will not bay TW:Attila. Probably I will never bay it or buy it when the Attil will cost 5 euro, or game will have a huge modification, which fix a game(something like DeI mod). Rome 2 was too bugy, unfinished, too simple for me. Attila will look similar. Probably Rome 2 is the last game in TW series, which I bay. This is how I start hate TS series after Rome 2.For this who never see this game after release, and how this game looks like watch this review  


YouTube™ Video: Total War: Rome II Angry Review 

			Views: 3,584,759		

			PROS & CONS Breakdown Here: http://angryjoeshow.com/2013/09/total-war-rome-ii-angry-review/		

P.S. Sorry for my English.EDIT I forgot to write about naval battles- System of naval transport units. Land units are able to enter on sea without any time need to board/build transport ships. It's idiotic. When you attack a cities from sea not only naval units fight with you on sea but a city garrison too, with their transport ships. They got a ships, they build a trans. ships in few minutes. This part of game is terrible.- Naval battles are terrible too. Trans units are better in naval battles against real naval units. So fleet with trans units will always win battle against real naval units. Boarding party is really crap. You need to touch enemy ship and boarding starts. No hooks, ropes, ramps, but ships are connected like with super glue. At this time (ancient) the ramming was the main strategy in naval battles. In Rome 2 this is boarding. What is the best even ships which don't have ram try to ramming you. Empire and shogun 2 have better naval battles. And the biggest argument why I don't recommended you this game is ""THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED"". Game have so many bugs, errors, unhistorical aspects or unthinking aspects, and we got now Attila. So we never see a new patch for a Rome 2, none of bugs or aspect will be fixed. This♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. But if TW Attila were a DLC for Rome 2 I will say this game should be RECOMMENDED. I even bought DLC Atilla for Rome 2 even for 20-30 Euro. Attila have some fixes which should be in Rome 2 long time ago. So that's why I never bay any TW series game any more. They leave unfinished game like Rome2 and publish new with similar bugs, error to pull out from us, as much money as they can..			"

You know what? F*** PHYSICS! THIS IS TOTAL WAR ROME 2! 10/10 would buy again! 
A Screenshot of Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition
By: Austria-Hungary > Prussia




  That is a great example of stuff that goes on in this game! Though, to be fair, it could partialy the fault of a mod I had was to ""improve naval combat"". ANYWAYS that pic should make you want to buy this game 420/69 would buy again. To be supr srius this game has it moments, and is finaly in a playable condition. The multiplayer is pretty balanced, but has way too many metas to be the most enjoyable thing to play. I couldnt say if you want this. The strong points are: Great graphics, amazing detail, good voices for the most part, good amount of variety in factions/units. Bad things: Start of a paid pay to win game(factions that you want like athens, sparta, odysrian kingdom, and many others you have to pay $7 usda for each pack of 3 factions, and the fact that you have to pay for blood and gore that should be in the game anyways, FURTHER MORE you have to pay for units packs.) They have a good PR department beacuse whenever they release new unit packs they give free units, and buffs to factions for free. So you decide after that info if you want the game. I find it enjoyable in shorter 2-3hr sessions.			"

												I have put hundreds of hours into Rome: Total War, And waited years for II, but what do I get? Nothing... literally nothing, I booted up the game, and Nothing started, I tried every solution under the sun, and still...Nothing.  This is not the worst part, the worst part of my 'experience' with Rome II is the 'help' (And I use that word loosely)  I got for this game - breaking problem, I went to the forum's, and explained my problem, All of the people before me had  been able to play the game before, so all their solutions, (that mainly didn't work for them anyway) were for people who'd started the game. but I digress, I got in contact with an admin/moderator, who after 2 weeks or so of speaking back and forth, just stopped answering me, I guess they thought "" Oh well, I can't figure out why this is happening, lets just stop listening to him, who cares about the customers anyway, right?"" As they say, Ignorance is bliss, and they havent responded after 3 months or so... but hell, I've only wanted this game for years...			"

												I started my true path to PC gaming in 2012 as a 13 year old kid playing Rome: Total War on a very old laptop. I loved that game, best and only game I had truly played that was actually mine. And then fast forward to about 2015. I have a new but still crappy laptop, Rome barely works on it and so I play Medieval 2 and that becomes my favorite game. I then see something on sale, Rome 2 Total War. I heard a lot of bad stuff about this game, but they had a free weekend so I decided to try it out. Yes my laptop could barely run it, but I had such a blast that I just had to buy the game. Fast forward to a month ago, I had nearly 150 hours on that game and I had just gotten a new PC. I stopped playing the game due to the fact that half of my hours were there due to waiting for the End Turn or through super slow battles as my laptop was trash. Now I play it on my new PC, and I absolutely love this game. I don't know why. It was such a horrid gaming experience but still a fantastic game and I kept on getting sucked into playing it. Compared to other Total War games this is still a great game. Not the Empire Total War sized catastrophy everyone remembers it as, but a legit good game. Better then even Shogun 2: FOTS. (Although I haven't played Empire nor Napolean just because I hate the guns) So if you haven't played this game in awhile I suggest you do now. Forget the horrendous DLC and just get the ones that interest you. I only have the Blood and Gore and the Greek States culture packs. And download either the Radious mods or the Divide Et Imperia mod. Nothing is better than watching a couple pila throws destroy half a unit.			"

												This game is in a lot better state right now than at launch. I originally bought it when it came out, but still kept playing the older total wars as this one wasn't well optimised, and just wasn't finished. I recommend this game if you are a fan of the total war series, probably not the best title in the series if you're just getting into it. Also wait till there's a sale, £29.99 is overpriced, it's decent now and I really like the campaign but..The one main thing I don't like about it, but isn't affecting me recommend the game because every game does this now. And it's the DLC and add ons. Extra campaigns fair enough, but £1.99 for the blood and gore (which if you buy this game you are more or less going to want) thenit's kinda silly. Overall a good game, decent enough but not a series best			"

												This is a very good game but it has it set backs, i'll start with positives and negative results(positives) the historic relations to the original Roman empire are well donethe game play is moderate and the map is excellentnot to mention the characters ridicuous insults are make me laugh my♥♥♥♥♥offthe choices with deplomacy and economy are awesomeand finally the forms of soldiers and and military are amazing (Negatives) This game can get VERY slow and has many bugsdepending on how well equiped your troops are it can get frusterating with batles and siegesThe loading on this game is very very slow even though my windows 8.1laptop is fast with most high graphip games, i often have to 5 to 10 minutes to start the campaign so #%&* you SEGAand at last if you click some thing that is important by accident there's no coming back unless you save before hand(Result) the game has some issues however as tedious as they may seem I think this game is 7 out of 10 So the question is how long will you go for Rome?

												Theres just something about it that doesn't feel like the old rome total war that I know and love.  Part of it is that I hate the naval combat I guess, like, really want to just disable it entirely.  The controls for ships are so clunky.  Land to land batltles are par for teh corse with a total war game.  The graphics are good, and rome is no longer arbitrarrily seperated at the beginning of the game.  I guess I'll give it a recommended, but... something just feels off.			"

I put massive hours into that game playing as multiple factions. At first all the new changes to the campain really kind of overwhelmed me. But once I took the time to learn it I greatly enjoyed the new feautures. If your a fan of the Total War series buy this. If you where a huge fan of the first Rome Total War, WHY HAVENT YOU BOUGHT THIS YET!!! Lol			"

												If you are a Total War fan avoid this game at all cost. The bad release, held back content for DLC greed, and over all bad form are just what the forums are full of. 12 patches later some of the launch bugs are fixed but you cannot fix what's wrong with this game. The AI is totally scripted and although you can break the linear campaign play by avoiding most political shanghia from ""allies"" you still get the same super stack factions that have to be scripted to do something stupid because they could just roll you off the map if they kept going. The building systems leave little to no variablity as you almost always need food and pub order just to build stuff. The the monetary system is so freakin ridiculously out of wack you end up with millions and have factions pleading for huge amounts of money for silly things just to spend down. A civil war that has no rhymn or reason just randomly pops. The combat is just blobs nothing like Rome 1 was. The AI cheats in several ways; not following the same economy as you, cavalry that has more moral than typical, ambushes when army was in clear sight...ect. Instead of the tactical battles that were the norm for this series you instead have a series of power ups that your generals ""earn"" so combat turns into a pause-fest unless you're quicker than snail snot ona hot day. They only difference in gameplay through difficulties are stat manipulations and nothing the ai does is situationally relative, hes just better.... All in all I knew the TW series was dying, I had thought Empire was it's death rattle. Sad to see it still spit up a few more titles before its collapse into this mindless arcade clicker. Thanks for the memories, of the early titles.....			"

												This is probably the only review I've given for a game, and I've done so because I've never felt so ripped off in my life for buying this over-hyped POS.  I'll start the slow clap to CA for the fantastic marketing of this game. I've played since Medieval I, and was blown away with Rome I when it first came out. I think CA knew that a majority of their players felt the same way, and made Rome II to be something much more grander than the original with their siege of Carthage video and the new Rally Point teasers. I pre-ordered...and CA played me well I'll give them that.I played through all the patches, but I think it's safe for all of the players to assume that nothing CA can do will bring back the immersion and strategy that the prior TW games brought to the table. I swear to you, I've never even bothered to look at the general's traits because they don't matter. They die before they become significant. All that matters is grinding them to commander, general, infantry commander II, and great leader and bringing them to your ""training"" Providences to pump out level III gold units for the rest of your armies so that you can steam roll the AI. Rinse and repeat. I've played many factions, and every time Rome is annihilated very early before I can even fight them...in a game called Rome II. Seige AI? Ha...just send out your useless plebs to attack their ladder units, and then slaughter the rest of the army at your gates when they abandon their ladders. Battles? Just use your infantry line to hold the enemy (after you take their skirmishers out with your calvary) while your javelin units get at least 200+ kills and eventually lead to the route of the enemy unit. No real strategy at all. You can use a different faction, but the same strategy always works. You can't lose unless you purposely try to. The series has been dumbed down beyond belief. This is probably the only time I felt like I was scammed into buying a game based on past reputation and hype. CA, for me, has lost all credibility. I'm not saying I won't play again (because there is nothing else out there like the TW games), but I'll be sure to buy a game after it's ""Gold Package"" with all the additions is on sale for $25 (being generous), and the reviews for the game are above 8.0 out of 10 on the average. You'd be a fool not to do the same.			"

												Still full of errors after 9 patches. Improved diplomacy compared to previous Total War games. Combat however feels inferiour and city management is stupidly simplified.EDIT: Still a ton of errors after 12 patches. The AI acts horrible during sieges and can't perform the most simplistic tasks. I wonder if anyone of the developer team actually ever tried the game out or if they are just incapable of creating an AI that works at least similarly to how it worked in Medieval 2 or Rome 1.EDIT2: Some major things might have gotten fixed. But #neverforget. Wouldn't recommend any CA game to anyone ever again. it took them 2 years to fix the horrible major bugs in this game but the gameplay is still inferiour to some predecessors. Medieval2 was the last one in the series with a sturdy gameplay.			"

I could play it for  a day straight (As I have done on many occasions). Whether you are in command of a Barbarian horde trying to destory civilization. Or the Rpoman Empire istelf trying to tame the barbaric tribes of the north, this game is highly immersive from the mangement for your empire to actaully controlling your armies every detail is amplified to give you the feeling of being in the ancient world.

												At first, as you will know there were bugs, it was infested with them. Bad AI too.Apart from the dull soundtrack (which can easily be fixed with the 4 part music mod) and the dull colour pallet (which there will be other mods for) it is a good game. I had to change the collision on mine because I hated this clustering going on, but it was not unbearable, it was just slightly irritating. The good points are:Few crashes, they only happen with lots of mods (55)Best current AI on any total war to date. (It actually is)Great campaign in most playthroughs, but can get too easy.A few minor critisisms are the removed family tree (happy to see it making an appearence in Attila)You have to have someone leading an army and you can't just select a few units, send them out to kill a few rebels and come home or have 3-4 units of light cav wandering around your borders to scout for enemy armies. Lots of the units looks very similar their faces) and none really look majorly different. Voice acting is minimal, it could keep the game very fresh if people had different accents.Cities never tend to look very different, barbarian cities are all the same, same with greeks and romans, same with eastern factions. Characters feel expendable because they have no real meaning in your family, in Med 2 I would be both sad and scared when my King died, they usually had great influence in the world and my faction could easily fall apart after their death. I think what makes this so good is the superb modding community. Champloo, Wolfman and many more who made me play this game. Overally it gets 60% good, though if I had not seen the majesty of Med 2 and Rome 1, it would probably get a higher mark. I just hope Attila can do better.			"

The only thing about it I don't like is how some of the major factions get wiped out in the beginning of the game.

												I have just recently joined the Total War series, and adore this game. It is more challenging than the other Total War games have played (Empire, Napoleon), and much more encapsulating. The politcal system and siege battles are a bit tricky due to some AI problems, but that seems to be the extent of it. I simply love this game and what Creative Assembly have done with the series.

												Empire, Conquest and Glory. These are three words that describe Rome Total War 2. I highly recommend that you play this game. I could play it for  a day straight (As I have done on many occasions). Whether you are in command of a Barbarian horde trying to destory civilization. Or the Rpoman Empire istelf trying to tame the barbaric tribes of the north, this game is highly immersive from the mangement for your empire to actaully controlling your armies every detail is amplified to give you the feeling of being in the ancient world.

												This game was terrible at launch I’m told. I got the game about a year after release, right before emperor edition, it's now an amazing game in campaign and multiplayer. I would recommend this game to anyone getting into total war for the first time and anyone in general. I played Rome 1 and medieval 2 for a sh!t tone of hours, this is by far the best total war!			"

												Very disapointed with the game, it had the potential to be something great. Why do I recommend the game you may ask, is because it's the mods (DeI) that actually make the game seem worth while, with the potential for CA to redeem themselves with future tools to add to the present beta toolkit it would allow for far more freedom in modding the game.

												Rome II Emperor Edition is a great game.  Rome II is the best game that CA has made this far.   Easy learning curve.  The diplomatic concept is fine.  It could be improved for sure but that is not an issue.   The tech tree is visual and perfect. The realism of battles is addictive. Graphics are high above average.  Apart the missing family tree and the management weakness of the economy, Rome II, after a year  and some months, is now a great game that you must have.8.5 / 10			"

Mine is from 2010 build, from components of 2008. so yeah 6 years old tech.... can't compare with modern PCs.I recommend this game so much, i enjoy playing it have over 100 hours of play and still have not finished a single campaign yet!!There is so much to do and the modders in this game are great.The only downside of this game is the price, and the DLCs are really expensive + there are no more Original only players playing this game all have DLCs - making it harder to find somebody in Multiplayer games (all are red - different versions).

FPS is fixed in most instances, for me at least using a gtx 660ti Boost 8 GB Ram 3.0 Quad Core on Very high/Ultra SettingsNow please lets see ""Atilla"" be a finely tuned and finished game on launch please :) Then im back on board CA!

												Base Game: 710A fun eploration of this period of our history, but lacking the simple components of total war games that add to the base campaign and battle components. Would have enjoyed: family trees, balanced agents, a heirarchical government that is better presented, visible skill trees. This entry is also poorly optimized, not fully utilizing available cores and not taking advantage of the gpu. Also, dlc to death. Poor battle AI. The lack of city walls is also disappointing, but this may have been due to the poor AI performance during seige battles.Modded Game: 8.5/10The community has been amazing. Divide Et Impera is my current go-to for total conversion of Rome II for a richer, more challenging experience. More diversity between factions, more historically accurate units, expanded/revised building and skill chains. Overall, much better than the base game+dlc.I recommend getting this game on a summer sale, so you can it and all of the dlc for a more reasonable price. This game and the mods available make a very enjoyable total war experience. Modding is made very easy with steam's workshop, simple browse and click on what you want.			"

												This would be a great game if the development team stood up to their managers and focused on shipping bug-free games and DLCs instead of shipping broken products and patching it over and over again just to satisfy some ridiculously short deadlines. This is simply an insult to the customers who pay for this product.It came out a year and a half ago, they shipped out many DLCs since then, but the core game still feels like a beta product. I deeply recommend that the development team moves to agile test-driven development and change their business culture to quality production instead of ""fast-food"" production.			"

												Total War Rome 2 has many improvements to its predecessor, however, gameplay still isnt really fullfilling nor satisfying.I would not recommend a single Total War game as of today, since they are all similiar.After awhile i have the impression im playing a stupid game, which makes me think it is really intelligent & smart & complex & ....IT is not 'What you see is what you play..."", but less.Playing historical battles could be exciting, but in history every battle was unique.In Total War every battle is just so random, there isnt any relation to what is going on in tactial maps compared to those actions on the strategical map. Armies don't give up early, if there is a more important goal for example, etc. etc.Everything is so blatant, boring, without crispness, quirks & inspiration.It is just a glimmer, of what is promised. Maybe this kind of game needs still some time to evolve. Conclusion:Not recommended, unless you really have a strong passion for computation.PS:Games for good tactical combat gaming are CoH and MoW.			"

												...Months and months after the release...The game has improved dramatically. The release was rocky; I was one of the lucky ones who got to play from the release. To say the game is in a similar state as the release (Or, at least from my experience, buggy) has not played the game recently.The game has an inferior ""feel"" to shogun 2. I can't pinpoint what exactly causes this... I suspect that, perhaps, the in-campaign maps are not as stunningly beautiful as those in shogun. The game also has a few ""logic problems"". For example, when defending a point after fortifying it, the game has a tendancy to automatically force one into the least advantageous position. Come on! If I were fortifying a position, I'd do it from the top of a hill, all the better for my giant fireballs to crush people!This said, TWR2 is quite fun to play. CA has done a lot to fix the game, and my FPS are finally jumping up. A widely varied unit roster is good to see, in comparison to shougun. Some of the controlls have changed since shogun, as well. For example, a pike phalanx is told to attack by clicking through the enemy unit, not clicking ""attack"". Tactically, this is more intuitive, but can be rather confusing for veteran players of past TW games.I strongly advise buying this game...on sale. The gameplay has not improved enough since shogun 2 to justify spending 60 bucks on TWR2. 40, or perhaps 30 dollars would be closer.Wait till the summer/fall/christmas sale, buy the game, go crazy.

												So, let me toss my hat into this ring. Rome II released a fair bit buggy. AI was too aggressive against the player, but not each other. There was a weird glitch in Gameplay everyone complained about I never saw (And was fixed within the second week patch). When I first played it, it was funnish still, but all these new diplomacies out of reach due to overly bizarre AI was the main issue. Not so much anymore. AI follows a state based on their relationship status to you, which is based on if you're war with their enemies (+) or with their friends (-) and follows a fairly sensible pattern, where someone at 150+ relations won't declare war on you unless you attack someone in that is their defensive alliance (But if they are afraid/good enough friends, they'll peace out fairly quickly.) Someone at -200 is undoubtly going to declare war on you, even if they have to launch a naval invasion to make it happen. The AI does get afraid though, The selecuids at war with everyone suddenly found Galatian Barbarians running rampant over their stuff, and they peaced out with a massive gold gift to avoid further destruction. Combat AI is mostly good, especially in field battles. If your line is too short, they will flank you with their infantry. Sometimes they go with a lopsided strategy against your weak flanks to try to break them and sweep into the side. Cav will chase your archers round and round unless you counter them. They use scout cavalary to try to find your people if you hide in the forest rather than marching around aimlessly. Combat AI gets a little weird in city sieges. THey kind of understand how to defend, in that they'll move to fill gaps you break in the wall, defend the right areas, put archers to counter movements. Without siege weapons, you'll get punished trying to climb the walls. Attacking though it's a bit weird. First it'll move up ladders, and if that fails, they'll attack your gate (AI has siege gear, but never allowed it to get to my walsl before). Most of the time this still goes straight forwards, but this does allow your archers to pepper them freely, despite ladders on the walls. Though since the ladders appear to be made out of adamintine, that's probably for the best. Once trhough, they tend to just stream their entire force through. Archers, cavalry, infantry, everything. Combat stats are pretty nice. Morale is still a big deal like Shogun 2, though even the most untrained levy is not nearly as much of a pansy as the Rise of the Samurai Levy units which would take one casualty and panic like the world is ending. Some morale seems a bit ridiclous (Killing 119 Thorax Swordsman in a group and yet the last one still fights on) but most respond to shocks like hard shock cav charges pretty well. Generals are important to maintain morale and their abilities are really helpful. They also have other bonuses that vary heavily, like reducing unit cost or improving everyone's skill, or reducing enemy morale. Army Groups now are permenant things that build traditions as well that outlive their generals and can be reinstated if they are wiped out. These can represent a key doctrine certain groups employ. Combat can get a bit slow and sloggy though when you have spears in defensive position and all they have are is spears. BRING A SWORD. Will admit, combining Shield strength into armor and missile accuracy into missle damage on the stat screen is a bit weird.Campaign isn't like Rome 1 where Population is the only important stat and money is infinite. Population is still important, population growth allowing areas to gain new buildings to make more money. Money really varies though where you start. If you start as Parthia and take over Iran, that's a free money from the trade goods and Eastern bonus to towns (Local COmmerce bonus+10% bonus from Being Eastern.) Whereas Rome is very tempting to go full military, and you'll wind up bankrupting yourself in your war against Carthage, unable to pay for reinforcements and navies. Campaign other nice note: Nobody plays that similar. Geography and unit types are nicea nd diverse. Now, some, like Parthia, play totally different from most others. Parthia plays like a Steppe Horde that got some full plate knights. They also get bonus damage on all their ranged weapons. Even after a 15% bonus, Rome's slingers and javs still do way less damage than parthians, and that's not mentioning the archers. Slinger: Normal 18, Parthia: 21. Jav: 39, Parthia 45, Archer: 27 Parthia: 32. Cretan archers of some hellenic factions have the 32, but those are a tier 3-4 unit. Parthias get those archers from a tier 2 building... that also ride horses. Rome has Legionaires. Sparta has a diverse set of units based aroudn their social stratifications, Athens has a few nice cavalry, Macedon with their units, Egypt with their mixture of native Egyptians and greek things, Pontus and Selecuids with mixture of eastern and hellenic, Galatia as he invading gauls. Lots of fun. 86%, Would recommend.			"

												Takes me back to the old Europa Barbarorum mod for Rome TW 1.Very impessive graphics for high end machines, The fact that your fleets can get involved in coastal land battles is amazing and adds tactical depth, historical accuracy is improved dramatically over the vanilla Rome TW 1 but not as good as say EB! Would defo reccomend especially at the price of 15 quid :)			"

												(This review is post 8.1 patch) After a bit of a terrible launch, Rome 2 is now starting to look like the game that was shown in trailers and the promo material.The A.I is starting to become smarter than it was; but it is not really a challenge for a Total War veteran. On the campaign map the A.I also spams agents quite a bit, so if you have cities near your enemies, prepare for your buildings to get burned down or your wells poisoned. The user interface can has became much better now. Numbers actually show up on unit cards now, and tool tips are on almost everything. But, the battle U.I is still rough in places. The unit cards don't really show that they're shooting, being shot at, in melee or routing. The icons for alerts of units being shot at by archers or javelin throwers can be mixed up with wavering/routing. The unit cards flash red when they're being hit by missile units and for, especially me, thought that that unit was wavering/routing, as I didn't have the battle advisor on.			"

												I really wanted to Like Rome 2, but the one big selling point for Rome 2 was Coop Campaign, and it fails at every turn ""LITERALLY""Desync after Desync...  (multiplayer campaign) Patch after patch of ""FAIL""The game runs a little smoother then right after release, but not what it should be.The A.I. seems ok one battle, then completely worthless the next.Naval battles are a complete joke, I mean it, they are absolute garbage, my advice to you is to Auto Calc every naval battle.Again,  the CO-OP is completely borked beyond belief, even a year later. I'm not sure if the DEVs just gave up, don't have the ability or talent to fix it, or just do not care...  At any rate, the DEVs have created a pile in terms of multiplayer, one of the only reasons I pre-ordered Rome 2, and i'm not happy with campaign CO-OP in any way, shape or form.My System Specs ""FAR"" exceed what is recommended, and on DAY ONE the game ran like trash.Now a year later I don't have any real issues with performance, but Rome 2 is not optimized at all.This game for single player is ok, not stellar, not any sort big improvement, nothing special.CONCLUSION: Rome 2 Total War is worth about $20.00, so ANYONE that pays $60.00 for Rome 2 after looking into all of the bugs/desyncs/lack of optimization/junk multiplayer, is a ""FOOL"".If I would have known about these issues before I pre-ordered Rome 2, or even if I had beta tested Rome 2,  then I would have waited for a sale on Rome 2 when it hit $20.00..Unfortunately I did ""ZERO"" research on Rome 2, at the time it was being developed, and all of that I was busy with other things, and thought that they couldn't possibly ""BUNGLE"" what many people consider to be the FlagShip of the Total War series..   Buyer beware.			"

												As someone who pre-ordered, originally, I could not have recommended the game, as I essentially paid for a Beta in terms of bugs and polish. This still galls to this day and I would not pre-order a Total War game again.After many patches and post-polishing, I can cautiously recommend this as a decent addition to the Total War franchise. Its overall mechanics aren't super, such as the nerf to culture change, where you now have default culture that cannot be converted, leaving permanent unhappiness in conquered territories of a foreign culture.The battle mechanics are solid, although there are some clear carry-overs from Shogun 2. They never did families or the in-depth politics as promised. Despite that, the game is still fun, although it can get a bit stale when you get to a big empire stage against other similarly big empires. The AI does not always function as intended still, although the related game-breaking bugs have at least been eliminated.A lot more time was spent with attention to history this time around, no ancient Egyptians, you now get proper diadochi. Some factions rosters are a bit sparse, and non-playable powers aren't worked into the system of buffs/tradeoffs you get choosing a faction or family for the playable ones.Many of the faults and gripes can be fixed with mods, but it shouldn't be on the shoulder of the modwright to carry a game.Ultimately, get this on sale in a bundle, there's many hours of game to explore, but it's not worth full price, in my opinion. And the DLCs are some of the better and more fun content.			"

												I don't know what everyone is complaining about, I love Rome 1 and have played it for years but Rome 2 adds so many new features and improvements. +New agent types and actions+Providence system that I think adds more strategy to the campaign. It forces you to decide what resources the towns produce, where Rome 1 had cities that were money makers/fortresses/everything.+Tech tree, simple, but there wasn't even one in Rome 1.+Food system, need to keep it up in order to support your armies. +Naval combat that is simple yet enjoyable.+Land and sea battles at the same time!!!+Leveling system for indavidual armies and generals, being able to name your armies is a plus too.+Seige battles are so much better, so far, AI has proven to be way better than Rome 1.+Culture mechanic, can be used as a weapon and adds more depth to city development, also gets around the terrible cultural difference that you can't get around in Rome 1.+Touches on some inner politics, not too much but adds more immersion with the actual generals/statesmen.+Garrison units, less micromanagement of city garrisons, more of a personal preference. The few complaints I have:-Rome 1 started with everyone starting with clean slates with diplomacy, had more of a sandbox feeling in how diplomatic ties developed. Rome 2 tries to force the diplomatic relations to historical accuracy.-Instant fleets, but not that big of a deal because the ships they get are terrible. An actual navy can easily destroy them.-From what I've seen so far, no family trees.Overall, Rome 2 has way more features than Rome 1. I still love Rome 1 but saying that Rome 2 dumbs everything down and simplifies the game is complete ignorance. There are some things from CA that I disagree with, but as a game, Rome 2 is better.

Posted: July 28, 2016
												First of all: I'm kinda a veteran in this game series and the major reason I bought this game was because of this, I was a fan of it. But after playing it a lot I simply cannot recommend it unless you get it for free, then you may kill some hours with it.First the pluspoints: Ofc the marine battles are kinda the best advantage over the old Rome: Total War (1) and they're fun, though really messy and hardly controllable with like 40 ships (unless you pause the game). The new region boni are nice as well, the interface is good and looks nice. There might be some other good points that I forget to mention but that's jsut because the bad points outweigh everything else so hard. Let's get right into them:First of all: The AI. Where should I start? It sucks in battle, it sucks on the campaign and sucks overall. It's diplomatic behavior is sometimes just plain stupid and senseless and it will never be able to lead a large scale war. Once you've established yourself as major power, the rest of the game is kinda grinding.Siege battles which pose the biggest possibility for epic gameplay are - at least as defender (let's be honest: that's nicer) - just totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. There's still a lot of bugs in the AI's behavior with siege ladders (like not using them at all or in a really stupid way) and it's strategy; well, 9/10 games will look like this: The AI will focus all it's power on one side, even when greatly outnumbering you, you use your garrison one 2, 3 keyspots where you kill all, if any up climbing enemies and after you killed them all, the AI will rally it's cavalry for a useless, stupid attack on your gates, just to get killed by towers. I'll leave it and that, even though there's more bad about the AI.The battles in general: Surely core of the Total War franchise, the battles still have a lot of bugs in this version (and I doubt there will be updates fixing them) which kill all the fun. One of the biggest (and probably easiest to solve) problems is the missing ""Hold-Position""-button we know and love from Rome 1. This will lead to your formation breaking when you tell your units to attack and any kind of archers - let's say thay engage Legolas-style fights without his skills.The archers... Wish that was there only problem. Not only that they always have to set themselves up facing the enemy, possibly moving into the front battle when you want them attacking flanking enemies, they also have MAJOR issues targeting enemies with any kind of obstructions (including walls, buildings, rocks etc.) nearby. ""Oh, I'm so gonna lure the enemy to this cliff so my archers will send a hail of arrows down there"" - nope, not happening. ""I will let the enemies on my walls and then make a shooting range out of them with my archers nearby, muhaha"" - ye, try it. Will work in 1 out of 5 attempts, so go ahead.I don't know how many archer battalions (and also battles) I've lost due to unexpected, senseless behavior of these ranged units. You gotta watch them more than a pyromaniac with gas & lighter.And now my 3 major issue: Campaign AI and diplomacy. First one advice: Like in previous TW games, allies aren't worth the trouble. Basically, they won't ever rly help you (even though there's a nice lil' ""ally target"" feature in diplo screen), take away cities that you desperately wanted to conquer yourself (maybe because you just lost them) and they'll only get you into wars that you do not want. You like showing mercy and building up a team of vasalls? Well, ♥♥♥♥ you. They only pretend to be your friends. I do admit that they're less backstabby than in Shogun 2, but that's probably just due to them being too stupid to succeed.And there's the major problem with the diplomacy: Trading cities isn't possible (and there are no mods to solve it). Not only do I think it's making it less immersive, it also hinders realistic peace negotiations and worst of all, as mentioned above, allies will steal your cities, if you don't plan ahead or if you rely on their help in defense. ""Oh, I just recaptured that city that surprise army conquered from you. You want it back? FU ♥♥♥♥♥, it's mine now. Just declare war on my and ruin your rep, I am after all your loyal, helping ally since ages ago.""To sum it up: Don't buy it. Don't. It's maybe fun for a really short time but if you're keen on immersion and have some standards like I do, you probably won't enjoy it for long. I can garantuee you won't fight 10 battles without some really annoying issue that destroys all immersion.			"

												As a fan of the series it pains me to say it but Rome II was an utter disappointment upon release. I am sure the game has improved with patches over time. But I have to ask...why did it need patches to begin with? They claimed they invested more resources in AI but it sure as hell didn't seem like it upon release. I was so disappointed with the game's launch state I have not felt the motivation to come back to it after its many issues. The fact that ROME II has stripped so much of what made prior Total War games interesting was another disappointment. Gone were the little movies for assasinations etc. Gone were the battle speeches that we got in games like Medieval 2. There were some good improvements such as towns having their own garrisons so your other guys can go out and fight. But then your limited to how much influence you have in the world. At release I had one instance where I was the strongest faction and had some allies. But the diplomacy AI was so broken it seemed like all my allies were wiped out and then every little♥♥♥♥♥♥ant country declared war on me. Speaking of countries and factions...turns took way too long. In multiplayer you would even desync. I have owned every Total War title up till now with the exception of Attila. In fact it was Rome II's disatrous launch that made me indifferent to Attila. Again many of the issues I outlined above may have been patched since. But reading through the other reviews of the emperor's edition? It appears the game still has issues with long turns and loading times. The other big issue I have is the constant faction DLC whoring. The fact they had to have another edition to get the game in the state it should have been upon release is unacceptable. With the patches the game might be enjoyable but I would wait for a steam sale. With Steam refunds now though you could try it out and get a refund if you don't like it. Lets hope that steam refunds discourage a repeat of Rome II. I learned my lesson with Rome II. I will no longer be preordering any future Total War games. Your better than this Creative Assembly. Its up to you to make me fall in love with the Total War series again.			"

Now left with a game that doesn't work, through no fault of my own, and no refund. If developers had said gameplay was limited to 345 hours would never have bought the damn thing as far as I am concerned both Steam and game developers are in breach of contract either give me my money back or give me a working game, same goes for the copy of Shogun 2 which no longer works. Will be lodging complaint with Consumer Rights. Great game non existent / lousy aftersales, think before you buy any more in this series!			"

The razing to the ground-function is great, and as a player of the Total War series since day one, I can say this is by far the most difficult yet most entertaining one. Smart AI, a lot of strategic options and a great diplomatic menu. The only downside is that trade isn't worth jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the tribute state option is almost irrelevant in a diplomatic way. Even if you have an army outside their last city, which is right about to fall, the still won't admit defeat, something Rome II was much more realistic about.

												The initial problems of Rome 2 have been fixed for the most part due to patches. The high price of DLC means you will just have to wait for a sale, but the Imperator Augustus campaign that comes with the Emperor Edition far exceeds the original grand campaign because of the new tech trees and different sub-factions. Being able to play with almost all factions in the grand campaign allows for countless replayability due to the different play styles. I have been a long time fan of the Total War series and love this game. It alot more detail when it comes to public order and cultural influence than the first Rome and is much more accessible than Attila. I would recommend especially when it is on sale due to the long amount of hours and replayability this has.			"

												I recommend this gameIf you like chess, go, or risk you will as wellWARNING     IF YOU'RE SLOW, so is the game. IF YOUR COMPUTER IS SLOW, so is the game [with the exception of downloading certain graphical mods , deselecting the ability to view other player movement and using the advanced graphics option (at the top of the page under graphics, under options under the menu that comes up when you press the esc key)]SUGESTION    Get it Now! while it's cheap, and if you are reading this when it isn't less than 30 dollars on steam get it another time while it's cheap and make sure you get it online in an area with a good internet speed and an ether net cord (cord for direct internet connection) because it's a pain in the you know where to download from a disc.  Spend money on the game the expansion packs seem worthless though with all the cool mods.

												I want to love this game but it is so broken and the solution of using mods to fix this games issues just doesn't cut it. I enjoyed all of the total war games up to this point even empire with all its flaws but this game feels like rome total war 1 on arcade mode x2. Battles are over before they start and I can hold Athens against all odds with a single unit of peasants. African tribes stomp Carthage into the ground. The list just goes on with dlc after dlc and stupid easy ai even on hardest setting (as pretty much all that changes in you get more unhappiness and the ai gets a ton of cash each turn making it wave on wave of crap troops). TL;DR creative assembly how far you have fallen. don't buy, don't follow, wait for new game engine.			"

												I would give this game a 3/5 score overall. When knowing the total war franchise is like giving a F- to this particular game. While it is much more in depth it seems to lose significant substance when compared to shogun 2 total war. While i will continue to play this game with my friends and by myself. The fact that i was amazed by rome total war original as a little kid and playing this game just dose not match up.			"

												As a fan of the series it pains me to say it but Rome II was an utter disappointment upon release. I am sure the game has improved with patches over time. But I have to ask...why did it need patches to begin with? They claimed they invested more resources in AI but it sure as hell didn't seem like it upon release. I was so disappointed with the game's launch state I have not felt the motivation to come back to it after its many issues. The fact that ROME II has stripped so much of what made prior Total War games interesting was another disappointment. Gone were the little movies for assasinations etc. Gone were the battle speeches that we got in games like Medieval 2. There were some good improvements such as towns having their own garrisons so your other guys can go out and fight. But then your limited to how much influence you have in the world. At release I had one instance where I was the strongest faction and had some allies. But the diplomacy AI was so broken it seemed like all my allies were wiped out and then every little♥♥♥♥♥♥ant country declared war on me. Speaking of countries and factions...turns took way too long. In multiplayer you would even desync. I have owned every Total War title up till now with the exception of Attila. In fact it was Rome II's disatrous launch that made me indifferent to Attila. Again many of the issues I outlined above may have been patched since. But reading through the other reviews of the emperor's edition? It appears the game still has issues with long turns and loading times. The other big issue I have is the constant faction DLC whoring. The fact they had to have another edition to get the game in the state it should have been upon release is unacceptable. With the patches the game might be enjoyable but I would wait for a steam sale. With Steam refunds now though you could try it out and get a refund if you don't like it. Lets hope that steam refunds discourage a repeat of Rome II. I learned my lesson with Rome II. I will no longer be preordering any future Total War games. Your better than this Creative Assembly. Its up to you to make me fall in love with the Total War series again.			"

												unfinished, ""features"" are look good on paper, but lack any depth.  This game seems to be ungodly oversimplified. While some of this is good towards the end game, when there is alot of manage, it makes getting to that end game feel empty. It is hard to get immersed. The map is built in such a way that there is no need to have any strategy, as all moves are reduced to a corridors. Combat is repititive, sea combat is painfully dull compared to Empire and Napoleon, which themselves had issues.Frankly, at this rate I don't think I will be buying anymore total war titles.			"

												I have played all of the Total War games and I found Rome 2 to be the worst launch of them all.   The game was buggy, the AI terrible and the turns took forever.That being said, since the patches over a couple of months, the game is much better performance wise, turns zip past about as fast as other games in the series, the AI is not as bad both in battles or in its strategy on the campaign. The graphics are really good, the battles are satisying if a little too short, and the campaign feels epic.Of course not everybody is happy with the design choices; a lot seem to want an updated gfx engine for the first Rome game.The developers continue to tweak the game based on community discussions, and things are going to get even better, I am sure.I dont think many people would be disappointed with their purchase if it was released today.

												I started playing Rome 2 in March of 2016, I read that at launch it was a mess, but by now it is pretty stable, at least to me, as a new player of Rome 2 who didn't experience its begginigns, I'm yet to find bugs or problems like crashes (none in the 57 hours of gameplay I have at the time of writing this review). I have been playing the original Rome, and Medieval 2 for some time now, those were my first 2 total war games, and I love them, but I'm fastly getting close to equal the hours I have put to those games playing Rome 2, and that is because I find this game very different to them, yet, amazing.First thing I noticed before buying this game, was the ammount of DLC it has, and a lot of them are just ridiculous to be sold as such, like the Greek culture pack and blood. Blood, as a DLC, and not as a graphical option, really? Nevermind, I payed for those 2 on sale, and I will get most of the rest when they are on sale again, NEVER on the normal price, because I don't support what SEGA is doing here.Another thing I noticed that is different from the original Rome and Medieval 2, is the workshop integration. You can find some amazing mods made by the community, from small ones to improve your gameplay and experience, textures to improve graphics, and complex yet high quality overhauls like Divide et Impera. Like I have been saying, this game is really different from the other 2 I mentioned, it took me a little while to get used to the new system of conquest and managing cities, and now I'm loving it, and the battles are improved as well, that nice feeling you get when using the cinematic camera while charging to your enemy is just priceless. I recommend this game, I don't support what SEGA did here, again, but the game in itself is great. If you can, get it on sale, because the DLC is just not worth the whole price, I just whish this evil market strategy changes in the future.			"

												Diplomacy! I have played many games in the Total War series. This is the first one (IMO) that allows you to deploy diplomatic strategy with good effect. This really gives you a new way of planning your expensionism. E.g. 1) I make strong allies, help them in war. Though they have a city I need for my region. By creating unrest with agents I get the city to rebel and I conquer without damaging. E.g. 2) When I have no intention to spread further in a certain direction (north), I help a local faction by teaming up and target (that's an option now) adjecent territories. I reinforce while he leads the attack. This way I gain a very appreciative friend, with a territory that closes my border (like a buffer). Now I can fully dedicate my forces south			"

												Rome II lacks the theme that games such as the original Rome: Total War and Shogun II had. Never did I once feel like I was in the time period. Rome II suffers from its simplified designs and arcade-styled approach. Everything feels lackluster and many of the game mechanics hurt the game, overcomplicating your experience. The unit rosters are poorly made and most are copy-pasted and reskinned. Combat feels rubbish, though the campaign experience is a tad bit better. I have to commend the amount of artistic content put into the map. All in all, Rome II is not a terrible game, but a very hollow one. It fails to deliver to what Creative Assembly had promised fans. I recommend skipping.			"

												unfinished, ""features"" are look good on paper, but lack any depth.  This game seems to be ungodly oversimplified. While some of this is good towards the end game, when there is alot of manage, it makes getting to that end game feel empty. It is hard to get immersed. The map is built in such a way that there is no need to have any strategy, as all moves are reduced to a corridors. Combat is repititive, sea combat is painfully dull compared to Empire and Napoleon, which themselves had issues.Frankly, at this rate I don't think I will be buying anymore total war titles.			"

												I have played all of the Total War games and I found Rome 2 to be the worst launch of them all.   The game was buggy, the AI terrible and the turns took forever.That being said, since the patches over a couple of months, the game is much better performance wise, turns zip past about as fast as other games in the series, the AI is not as bad both in battles or in its strategy on the campaign. The graphics are really good, the battles are satisying if a little too short, and the campaign feels epic.Of course not everybody is happy with the design choices; a lot seem to want an updated gfx engine for the first Rome game.The developers continue to tweak the game based on community discussions, and things are going to get even better, I am sure.I dont think many people would be disappointed with their purchase if it was released today.

												What a shameful display- hehehe  -1)Enciklopedia- Worst idea ever. From 24 hour gamplay 18 hours spent reading ENCIKLOPEDIA just to find out which   temple to build to get beserks or any specific unit. If i wanted to read  ENCIKLOPEDIA i would go to library, get some example from rome 1.2)Battles  are grand clusterf@@k, no order,no visible battlelines. Some will disagre, but i want to see where are my units not only on tactical map but also on battlefield. Give back faction colors to units so we can see difference in battlefield like it was in rome 1- romans -red, gauls green whatever what colors to each faction. 3) Units- Give us back the clone army. WHY- if i have 2000 or more dudes in my army i dont care about each dudes facial expresions or some another different eqipment. 4) Unit cards- not much difference between them, need to pause game nearly every time to find out a proper unit.5) Magicly appearing and dissapearing fleets whenever army cross the sea6) Agents- wtf this is rome not crusader kings or europe universalis7) Trait trees for generals- good in shogun 2  really bad in rome 28) Diplomacy- really s@@k, dont belive me - try yourselves.9) No general speeches like in rome 1 i really love them.10) NO DARTHMOD, NO FULL SUPORT TO MODDERS FROM CA, And the list goes on ....  . There are some good things and really nice improvements, but they just dissapier in the amount of  bugs and clusterf@@ks in game. Rome 2 devs why you couldnt just make improved rome 1, insted of making this clusterf@@k.			"

												Let me start by admitting that Rome II was launched before it was ready. Because of this, it experienced a rocky start and brought out the Rome II haters in full force. However, CA has worked hard by patching these issues as quickly as possible. I can honestly say that the game now runs EXTREMELY good on my computer and displays unrivaled graphics excellence in a turn based strategy game. Rome II is revolutionary in the Total War series by giving you much larger cities to fight in and the addition of amphibious landings which are nice additions to the series. I own every Total War game besides the first Shogun, and therefore have been fortunate enough to watch this series get better and better with every release. Conquring the known world never gets old! Rome II is unrivaled in its abilty to give you an awesome turn based empire building game and ALSO include beautifully rendered battles. When you attack or defend against a rival army, Total War games give you the ability to be the general on the battlefield and lead your troops to victory personally! Rome II also has a great modding community that allows you to play the game just about any way you choose! Rome II battles are a little unrealistic in the speed at which units move and the fact that transport ships are almost as strong as actual war ships I wish it would be slowed down a bit, and more strength given to warships, but there are plenty of realistic mods that do this for you. The Steam Workshop makes it easy to install and use these mods. CA does a great job balancing this game, but again takes away some realism because of this. Roman units are not as tough as they were in real life, but again there are mods that can fix this for you.I LOVE this game, and am always excited when I have time to play! Keep up the good work CA!!!Long live the Republic!SPQR			"

												The amount of haters and naysayers here is astonishing. Yeah, sure the game had to be patched up due to bugs. Sometimes the AI doesn't make good moves and ends up undoing itself. Maybe it takes ages for the AI to set up siege. But the gameplay itself is very, very good. Controlling armies of Rome, Carthage, Egypt, Macedon and other superpowers of the time across ancient Europe and fighting it out for domination sounds good, doesn't it? And this game excecutes it well, by having sieges, coastal battles, ambushes and many other features. The campaign interface is a little confusing to start with, but gets easier to understand after the prologue. Also, even though some parts may not be historically correct, it's a game, right? It's not meant to be an educational experience. All in all, I found this game addictive, and that it played well, even though I'm on a laptop.8.5/10			"

I'll buy it when it's fully functional. The next tactic of SEGA is probably to ABUSE the ""EARLY ACCESS"" on steam.. for x years...Also SEGA; Probably gonna start abuse the 'WORKSHOP' aswell to let the community add all the mods and  fixes to REPAIR UR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME? this is madness. cause Sega's CO-Workers seems not to be that effiecient compared to the community in problemsolving.DON'T SUPPORT THEM.

												Best strategy game by far.Realism +many choises of strategy+graphics+variety of factions +same units for many factions -unfixed lags,bugs even after 3 years of realise -charging people for blood dlc which should have been included to original game while price is already so high -Hate you developers ,but like this game.

												I've changed my opinion on this game since they have finally gotten off their asses and improved the AI, Graphics Optimization and somewhat on stability,  but it still doesnt excuse the massive budget for a game that has less polish than it's predecessors.I'm also still pretty uncofident over the stability of this game,  I can't wait until I get to turn 100-110 and the save becomes corrupted and unplayable. go team.

												I love it. All I see is pure hate from people about this game. Sure there are bugs, but the game is still very playable. I love it and have put tonns of time into it. As well as you can mod the crap out of the parts you don't like. Amazing game, I love every last bit of it.			"

												If you like this type of game and love all the Total War games ,   then buy this and play it ! Ignore all the hate the game gets , because in reality, there is nothing broken or extrememly buggy from my POV what-so-ever.Also ,with mods , for example the Radious mod, the game is 100x even betetr !

												Now that this game has been cured of its problems and rubbish design choices, it really is a spectacle to watch. Great campaign map with easy to manage cities and more detailed political ventures if you want to go that deep. The battles are great fun to watch and play, especially with the new battle camera. If you like total war or roman culture then go for it.			"

												My biggest complaint having played since Shogun is that the units bonuses make no sense what so ever.  Italian Spearmen are by far the most OP units in the game, and can't be beat by melee specific infantry units.  Little to no tactics involved with the combat compared to original total war in which certain units benefitted significantly from fighting specific units with weaker stats or weaknesses.Sea combat is very boring, can very easily win just about every battle with fire or ramming over and over as AI doesn't know how to compensate.Graphics are fantastic, visual effects are great, but game play overall is lack luster.  Would not recommend spending the money on it until its no more then $20 if that.			"

												This game is a wasted opportunity.Been playing total war games for a ""while"" now (shogun 1 anyone?) and imho Rome 2 does not represent a significant step forward under many aspects.It actually feels very bland and in some cases it's simply worst than its predecessors. Sorry I love the franchise, but in all honesty can't recommend this game. Get Shogun 2 instead, a really good game. Or Medieval 2 with all those great mods.  "

The only bad thing I can say about this game is it is kinda dumbed down compared to other Total War titles but its still a great game.			"

												Although it had some major graphic problems at the begging I would say it is a good try of bringing the ancient world much closer to anyone.From my part naval battles still needs to be far more realistic and gain back the need of being played for hours, advancing unit's experience as Shogun II so generously provided to its players.Must play before you die . .

												This Game is a mixed bag. Let's start with the bad thing. They are: the AI, which is very bad.... they tried to fix it but still is not good enough. Units during combat become chaotic and in turns in to a massive cluster f**k. The game had some performance problems but I have played it today again and it run very smooth on high settings (My rig is 3570k OC, EVGA 660ti 2gb, 8gb 1600 RAM CL9). The good thing about this game is... the scale. There is nothing like fighting with 3000 Romans versus a horde of 7000 barbarians. It also innovates from the previous iterations of Total War. It adds features like Land and Naval combat on one map. It has some limited politics but not as in depth as Crusader Kings 2. Overall I hated this game when it came out but the recent patches seem to have addressed most of the issues and now I found myself playing for 8h strait. I don't know much about multilayer as I haven't spent much time playing it. I don't like the fact that they put soo much DLC out for example they knew that people will want to play as Sparta so they decided to charge for it. If you are a fan of games like Crusader kings 2 or Civ 5 only buy this game if you miss the lack of advanced combat. Thank You for reading this review. It is my first review and I hope I can make more in the future. "

												This game is a fine example of the classical stuggles that occured before the Pax Romana. It also shows the passing time with uses of the older Roman tri-line formations consisting of; Hastati, Principes, and Triarii, while also including the later Marion reforms with the induction of the modern uniform legions. While I love Rome this game does have it's faults. I would give this game a 7/10. It introduces new and cool things but it is not as polished as Shogun 2. There are many bugs and frustrating gliches in this game which makes it very hard to enjoy. Also ♥♥♥♥ Oathsworn. They are the strongest unit in the game in my opinion. Theu have extremely good stats overall but they have a ridiculously high melee defence making them all but unkillable in close combat. Great Job			"

												If you would ask me upon release, I would say, don't waste your money. But the progression of the game-state since launch is truly impressive and I can't wait to see what else CA will do with this game. I personally would recommend it to one of my friends if the price was a little lower. At its current state, I would say buy it for sure if it is ever on sale for $30 or less, but at $60 I feel as if it isn't worth it unless you're a fan of the franchise, especially with all the cheap games you can get on Steam.

												Brand new to the game, but I actually kindof like it. Granted, I have not played RTWI or anything else in the Total War series. However, Total War as a whole is very interesting. The biggest downside for me personally is crashing and replay glitches. As mentioned, this game has some serious bug problems. It also crashes (for me) unpredictably. EDIT: Crashing seems to have been fixed in the last updateIn terms of gameplay (I assume the whole Total War series works this way), it feels like a hybrid between Civilization and Age of Empires. Like Age of Empires, you can command your troops on the battlefield and organize formations in real time (except even better: you can pause it offline! Drives me crazy in Age of Empires!). Like Civilization, you can persue diplomacy, setup trade, and manage military positions from one province to the next in turn-based campaign. There are a few elements which really cannot be compared to either. Cinematic camera and inter-character communication is one of them. It does really feel like something from the movies. This game is probably even more combat dependant than Age of Empires, and far more combat dependant than Civilization. You are pretty much forced to wage wars of expansion, not just sit back on your haunches and make the world your friend. In Age of Empires it is theoretically possible to win by creating a wonder and develop such a powerful defensive network that few dare attack, and those who do suffer (I have never seen it happen except VS AI). In Civilization (AI games, I can't do online for some reason), you can use science, ""diplomacy"" (i.e. monopoly on city state puppets), and culture to avoid war, just as long as you have a significant military to intimidate the opposition. In RTWII, you pretty much have to take stuff over as part of the overall victory condition. I have to say, I have never played anything quite like it. A very interesting franchise, when it works.[I am not going to give it a /10 rating, because I have no idea what it would be]			"

												Before everything: DO NOT buy this game, buy the excellent original Rome and you won't be disappointed.The original Rome: Total War was ten times better than this product of pure greed and reliance on old glory. Shogun 2 was the last good game of the franchise.The permanent army experience and naming feature is the only reason I still sometimes play this game. It allows me to role-play and create my ''Legio Marinae Corpus'', ''Leonidas' Spears'' or ''Alexander's Own Horse Guards'' etc.  Again: it is the ONLY reason I still, SOMETIMES, play this game.I have played every Total War game ever, so I have quite some experience with the series.With these basic statements in mind, we can continue onwards.No more pre-battle rousing general speeches. No more ''forward! - oi!'' unit responses.No more the g*y green Brutii or the boisterous blue Scipii and, of course. the ravaging red Julii.No more ''g e n i t a l?'' for ''general?''No more universal, international mercenary convention regarding green uniforms. No more the screeching women, Amazons in Estonia, falxmen, bastarnae.Joke aside, although some of the above are really missed...Now for the real fallacies:Selling factions for ridiculous prices that should have been ingame.IF YOU WANT TO SELL INDIVIDUAL FACTIONS, make the game cost 30 euros and every faction 1 euro. I would NEVER, ever play with, for example, the stinking Gauls, or the Parthians, so THAT would be a good move. But NOT paying 50 euros for a game with 10 factions and then selling 20 other factions at 6 euros per faction. No, no!No more city swapping in diplomacy.Still lvl 9999 armored hoplites and scythed chariots/elephants/entire cavalry divisions in risen slave armies and in bandit armies. SLAVES SHOULD HAVE INCREASED MORALE, MAKESHIFT SPEARS AND SOME SWORDS, SLINGS AND CLUBS, NOT ELEPHANTS AND GOLDEN HOPLITES. Bandits should be a tad little bit stronger than that.Greedy DLC spamming with features that should have been in game already.Sea battles decided by numbers. Still the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ diplomacy.Family system easily understandable by 5-year-olds (almost non-existent). Politics system ditto. A 2000 legionnaires-strong unit is still called ''legion'' and is the largest tactical unit available.A 160-men legionary unit is still called a ''cohort''. The blood&gore DLC, although it costs mere eurocents, made me the most angry. Seriously? SELLING blood, wounds, animations for weapons dealing wounds, and blood-stained tunics and shields OUTSIDE THE STANDARD PRODUCT? With modern technology. graphic cards, graphic standards in games? GREED! GREED! GREED! SHAME ON YOU!I am not buying another CA game until they return to what they were, which I highly doubt. Do not buy this game even on a discount. Their sales have fallen by 70% because they are a pack of greedy scoundrels. Do not support them! Do not let them live on the glory of the good, old games.Oh, yes, the good things about the game:Sea-land battlesUnit graphicsand, well...Cavalry yelling ''macaco''Infantry yelling the incorrect yet good-sounding ''legio parati''.The permanent army status, gaining experience and traits for the whole army, ever onwards.The horn sounds when you give order to attack. Epic every 20th time. Other 19 times: lousy, dysonant.That about does it. Now go and play Rome: Total War. The first one!			"

												This Game is a mixed bag. Let's start with the bad thing. They are: the AI, which is very bad.... they tried to fix it but still is not good enough. Units during combat become chaotic and in turns in to a massive cluster f**k. The game had some performance problems but I have played it today again and it run very smooth on high settings (My rig is 3570k OC, EVGA 660ti 2gb, 8gb 1600 RAM CL9). The good thing about this game is... the scale. There is nothing like fighting with 3000 Romans versus a horde of 7000 barbarians. It also innovates from the previous iterations of Total War. It adds features like Land and Naval combat on one map. It has some limited politics but not as in depth as Crusader Kings 2. Overall I hated this game when it came out but the recent patches seem to have addressed most of the issues and now I found myself playing for 8h strait. I don't know much about multilayer as I haven't spent much time playing it. I don't like the fact that they put soo much DLC out for example they knew that people will want to play as Sparta so they decided to charge for it. If you are a fan of games like Crusader kings 2 or Civ 5 only buy this game if you miss the lack of advanced combat. Thank You for reading this review. It is my first review and I hope I can make more in the future. "

												This game is a fine example of the classical stuggles that occured before the Pax Romana. It also shows the passing time with uses of the older Roman tri-line formations consisting of; Hastati, Principes, and Triarii, while also including the later Marion reforms with the induction of the modern uniform legions. While I love Rome this game does have it's faults. I would give this game a 7/10. It introduces new and cool things but it is not as polished as Shogun 2. There are many bugs and frustrating gliches in this game which makes it very hard to enjoy. Also ♥♥♥♥ Oathsworn. They are the strongest unit in the game in my opinion. Theu have extremely good stats overall but they have a ridiculously high melee defence making them all but unkillable in close combat. Great Job			"

												I really wanted to like this game.I was a big, big fan of Rome 1, and really enjoyed Empire TW too. However, this is just not as good as the original Rome. It feels like for every step forward graphically, there has been a step back in gameplay terms.The family tree and associated events are missing, robbing the game of character and your attachment to particular units. You can now only move an army if a general is in command, which is overly restrictive as you can no longer split armies. Upgrading cities and technology makes no sense - it tries to be Civilisation but without any resource requirements. Also, most annoyingly, the distance from which reinforcements can join your battle is immense - armies from anywhere within the province a battle is taking place can join as a reinforcement. As some provinces are more than a screen in size, this feels particularly silly. That army from across a mountain range you need to scroll across to find? Yep, simply because it is in the same province you can expect to see it advancing upon your position in a few minutes.Odd and average.			"

												On september this ""game"" has it's first birthday. so we are 12 patches in, looks great visualy, still feels like♥♥♥♥♥♥when trying to play more than 1 hr. not worth the money, dlc are laughable, efforts for patching this horrid experience are wasted. it was broken from the start, it was a joke on gamers. in the begining i was defending C.A. saying that it is not their fault sega pushed them a year earlier for release, but well, they had to ♥♥♥♥ it like every other big company. DON'T BUY THIS GAME, instead, soon there should be a release of europa barbarorum II for medieval 2 kingdoms. we should be paying for that and not the money-snatching piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥C.A. dared to release. EDIT: And i will continue this rant because people come to me to defend c.a. Ok pay attention now, this piece of trash you come shoving up my face telling me it's finaly fixed, it is AFTER A ♥♥♥♥ING YEAR. i don't pay for a car now to get it working next year, or order a pizza with my card to get it 365 days later. That brings us pretty close to the date c.a wanted originaly to release this crap. Hmmm looks like sega is a thieving company then, abusing consumer's money with fake promises. i don't want to play rome 2 now, i have much better games to play like MEDIEVAL ♥♥♥♥ING 1. I wanted to play the game when i paid for it, or prepay for that matter. And where does this leave c.a? well frankly i don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore. one thing i have seen is when devs loose their job and go hungry and indie, they tend to think more of what they are producing, and how they are selling it. The day C.A. goes kickstarter and indipendent without ingrates with suits and suitcases  is the day they will have my money, untill then, i love T-H-E -P-I-R-A-T-E B-A-Y (funny how i had to spell that so it whon't show as swearing. jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ) more than them.NEW EDIT (emperor edition): FIXED! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Btw Europa Barbarorum 2 is out for testing, just ignore this heap of dung and move on.NEW EDIT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THESE GUYS ARE THE BEST BRITTISH COMEDIANS EVER. free wekend tryout (because sales as they tell uss where great ROFL ♥♥♥♥ING COPTERS) followed by an announcement for the new total war title. TAKE A WILD GUESS WHAT IT IS....not empire 2, not warrhammer, not medieval 3, not china or any setting players have been litteraly begging to see on this game since the begining. NO. It's gonna be ATTILA TOTAL WAR. YEP, it's not a mistake. Like napoleon they are going to sell you an expansion in the price of a new game, where i guess they are going to try and fix the previous turd they released. are they even serious man just quit your jobs already or something, i mean please....

												Game is unpayable, many people are saying that it dumps frame rates and they are not wrong. I can run the game perfectly during battles on the highest settings but when i get to the campain map and move any unit into a settlement the frame rates just fall to an unplayable level. Could be an awesome game but who know i cant even get to the bones of it.			"

												It's a bimbo of a game; so much beauty but no brains. CA has gone wildly astray with both Shogun and now Rome II. The game has a massive map, beautifully rendered cities, but it doesn't use them to create a compelling strategy game. The tech tree is dumbed down, the diplomacy system leaves much to be desired and the urban and infrastructure development is very shallow. Developments to eg public order and dynasties have potential to make a difference but are poorly executed.The result is that you go from one stunning battle to another, but that is all there is and you can get pretty bored of that. If CA would use the beautiful citiscapes to create a new interface on civic managmenet with a detailed political, economic, tech and social/dynasty systems the game would be much more immersive and enjoyable. As it is don't bother with the campaign, just enjoy the battles straight from the start menu as that is all the campaign has to offer anyway.			"

												TOTAL WAR ROME 2. It should be renamed CA's POS! Even post 8 patches there are still glitches like the black box and there are still major fps drops; but the thing I hate the most is that CA is releasing freaking DLC for this game while most people still cannot play it because of its unoptimization. CA claimed that this game would ""be able to run on virtually any machine:"" well whoever said that must've been fired, because this game is the complete opposite. I sat all night long playing Total War Shogun 2 until my dream game, the sequel to one of the best Total War games, came out; then my eyes were assaulted with the horrors of Total War: Rome 2: there were framerates constantly dropping from 30 to 15 on low settings (on my moderate PC), unfathomable bugs, and an overall experience that put me one step away from the series. Therefore, after long patching, I believe you should not purchase this game, not just because of its glitches but because of its somewhat mediocre gameplay overall: Battles are 90% men marching and 10% actual fighting, the campaign and battle uis are both terrible and hard to use (the best thing you can do is move your cards wherever you want). My final rating is 6/10 DO NOT BUY THIS POS GAME			"

												After a horrible launch The CA has failed to deliver the most basic requested features and instead went all out on the DLC whoring, 3 campaigns @ 15 euros each, and a ♥♥♥♥♥on of smaller dlc's that add units and factions.Now call me old fashioned but I prefer to unlock factions through skill, as in having to grind to wipe out factions to be able to play with them instead of having to fork over some cash YET AGAIN to play what should have been in the base game.As if that wasn't enough, they actually have the nerve to charge you 7.50 to be able to play Sparta & on top of that 15 to have a campaign that focusses on sparta, things like this are the reason that after 14 years I'm done with total war series.If a company can be so low as to knowingly leave out features (family tree) just to force old school fans of the series to purchase the reskinned version (atilla) while forcing them yet again to either pre-order or pay extra to get access to day 1 DLC then I do not feel the need to pay for their games anymore, sure i'll give the cracked copy a try, but i'm pretty sure i'll delete it within an hour just like I did with Rome 2.

												Prime example of what greed does to good Game Developers. I bought Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai for $5 and you bet your♥♥♥♥♥was worth it, but when ALL the Total War games are on sale for $5 you STILL have to pay $60 for this game, which by the way has released a year ago, and that alone is just an example of greed, greed, greed. You know what else released a year ago? Just something random, Assassin's Creed Black Flag is about a month younger than this game, so not quite a year, and I can buy it for $17 on Amazon, hell I paid $30 for the Mass Effect Trilogy and got 3 games. Not to mention the endless DLC whoring is on a whole new level for this game as well, just another way to con you out of your hard earned dollars. They may have also just made a few bug fixes and slapped a brand new name ""Emperor's Edition"" on it, but I've been playing for less than an hour and I've already crashed twice.. Crashes should have been fixed a long time ago, and I'm still seeing many bugs as well. Now for gameplay? Combat is boring, there is NO tacticality to it whatsoever, just big slug fests until one side routs after maybe a minute or so, regardless if they're veterans or not. Naval Combat is so horrible I don't even want to talk about it.. This doesn't even hold a candle to Shogun 2.. Spend $5 on this wonderful sale and get something worth it. I beg ANYONE who reads this review. DON'T GET THIS GAME. YOU WILL REGRET IT.			"

												First of all, I am not rating this game based on CA's strategy to pour out useless DLCs. Most of the DLC are next to useless, and priced so high, but you can choose not to purchase them, so the DLCs should not be taken into account. Unlike Crusader Kings 2 DLC that introduces new mechanics, TW Rome II DLC usually only introduce new units, new battles, and new campaigns. The campaigns may have new mechanics, but the mechanics only limited to that particular campaign, so I conclude that DLCs is not so important.Now on to the game.VisualsVisuals are pretty, the details of each units, buildings, and terrains are great. This is a Total War game anyway, so some individuals in units will look alike, but that should not concern you. Differences between units are quite good. Only few units in Roman are look alike to each other. Tactical GameplayBattles are great, there is nothing to worry about that. Early builds ""mash-up"" are not existing anymore. Though there are some concerns of AI pathing, especially when trying to sally out from your fortress, or getting through the breach in the walls. In these two particular situations sometimes the AI still gets to bunch up and refuses to get into the breach, which in siege battles have serious repercussions. Ladder/siege tower mess has been fixed too, units are not stuck again in the walls and have difficulty navigating the walls like previous Total War series. Individual units also have good abilities which can be used in battles, for example Testudo Formation in Roman legions. Archers and ranged projectiles units sometimes also have options on their ammunition, increasing ways to play the battle.Naval combat is not really my expertise, but it is good nevertheless. The usual wind is there. Most of the naval combat are resolved by ramming, so position is key, which are shown well in the game. Boarding actions are also shown in better hand to hand combat animation, and as always, ship sinking is shown beautifully. Strategic GameplayThere are not much changes from the previous series, that have to be admitted. There are some new ways : for example you have to build the cities and its villages, not only you build the cities. There are also a Civil War mechanic, and some small Roman politics. These all changes are small, and in no way compared to Crusader Kings II politics machinery. You can kill, bribe, etc. like in Crusader Kings II but the effect is somewhat lighter. The AI is also annoying, and seems a little bit stupid. Most of them kept asking for gold in exchange of peace treaty, while in fact your nation is the strongest military. It makes no sense, smaller nations will ask for peace treaty/NAP and give bigger nations tribute, in this game small nations force bigger nations to give out gold. Though in diplomacy sense, it is way improved than the last Rome Total War series. You don't have to send a diplomat agent anymore, and the actions of your nation to other nation will also be viewed positively/negatively by other nations.Conclusion :For Total War players, at the current build it is great to play, and great to have.You don't have to buy the DLC, I got one DLC from some bundles. Maybe I will buy them in future, but not now, they are priced too high for nothing, especially the blood and gore that should be in the game at the first place. "

												Fun in a variety of ways, but very time consuming.  If you like playing the turn-based game, you can do that and let the computer manage individual battles.  If you prefer the real-time strategy, you can do that, too.  I found myself mostly playing the turn-based portion, especially later in the game, but it can become very time consuming to manage your empire as it expands, and it requires a lot of micromanagement to make sure that you don't over-extend yourself and wind up getting destroyed (just as the Roman Empire did).

												Now I am going to write why this game isn't bad, to help stop all the warding off fans that is going on, this game deserves buyers in my opinion, but too the the point! In terms of this game, reviews are full of people saying ""It's so laggy!"" ""Unplayable!"" ""Crashes all the time!"". Well I can honestly say it was, but not anymore, and honestly bugs only affected a small shouty crowd of people who need anger management classess. I was infact affected by a start-up crash that happened only for a few days before the devs fixed it, and believe me, the devs have fixed all but a few bugs. Now too the game itself. One of the only negatives I have to say of the Campaign was the Political Interface, which isn't the point of a Total War game anyway. I can blame CA for getting people hyped on better Politics but again, it's a game based around a fantastic Battle Sim. The Campaign was buggy to start, again I experienced issues but I (Unlike some) was patient. This took a couple of weeks too fix mind but all was good. I thought that the battles had gotten better and graphics took a big leap and honestly, don't base your decision on all the release reviews.			"

												Do you like a game+DLCs that cost a meal that could feed 50 Africans and still be as immersive and fun as adding dead rats in your basement? Do you like constant patching that makes any and all mods, no matter how simplistic or complicated, big or small, completely obselete and crash your game mid-load, like an abusive grandmother who decides to beat you half to death just because you mended her very shiitty, rotting quilt? Are you ready for the experience of more Total War games, along with the rest of the AAA genre, being hardcoded to the degree that adding any and all modifications requires the equivalent of doing plastic surgery on your unbelievably ugly dog? Are you ready for game modifications to be outlawed entirely and to bow down to our AAA overlords who wish to monopolise and otherwise basterdize the industry with shiit, so much so that pretty much all games may one day literally be hardcoded with complicated patterns featuring the word ""shiit"" and ""dogturds"" and ""monkey_dongs"" and ""filthy_peasant_consumer""?Then my dear comrade, Total War: Rome II is for you.

												Rome II: Total War had many troubles at the release. The game crashed, it froze when you ended your turn and when it didn’t freeze it took you 10 minutes to wait because only then all the other factions did their turns. I got a very good PC with good specs. but I couldn’t run the game on the highest settings which is quite ridiculous and the game was lagging as soon as the battle started (bad optimisation)  So Rome II wasn’t that enjoyable at the release. But after the patches done so far I’m enjoying this game a lot. The game now runs perfectly and I can run the game without trouble on the highest settings. Rome II total War is a mix of turn based and real time strategy game and as soon you get attacked you got the choice to either simulate the battle or play the battle real time and command your army. When attacking a city you, as a spectator and commander, can see how your troops are climbing the walls capturing victory points, etc. The graphics are also very nice in this game and the sound effects are also perfectly done. However in Rome 1 when you started a battle your commander would give a speech to the army which was like one minute (you had the choice to skip that) but in Rome II the commander doesn’t give a speech at all. When the battle starts he says one thing and that is supposed to be the speech. Also the weak factions are way too strong and it’s not realistic a small tribe can destroy the mighty Rome (happened to one of my campaigns when I was playing as Sparta) I still think that should be patched.The last Total War game I played was Napoleon and I didn’t enjoy that game that much and it’s very nice to see that Rome II has so many improvements comparing to Napoleon.Verdict: 7/10			"

This review was written after 400h of gameplay and 8 pathces.Rome II: Total War is the sequel of the original Rome: Total War, released in 2004. If you have not played the the original, and you like Real-Time Strategy games, then you will like Rome II. If you have already played the original game or the other Total War games (Medieval, Shogun, Empire), then you'll probabily hate the sequel.For those who are new to the Total War series, I will briefly explain the game: Rome II: Total War is a strategy game about conquering lands and building an empire, using diplomacy, trade, agents and, of course, war. You control one nation, with its own strengths and weaknesses. There are two main moments in this game: the campaign map (turn-based) and the battlefield (real-time). The campaign map displays settlements and cities throughout the lands and armies and fleets, and when it is your turn you may chose where to send your forces, to engage diplomacy or improve the buildings in the cities you own (wich can provide benefits such as better soldiers or more income for your treasure). Once you decide to attack an enemy force or city (or if a enemy attacks you in its turn), you switch to the battlefield. In the battlefield, you will deploy an army composed by the forces you had in the camapign map and then fight your enemy in a real-time battle. You control battalions instead of individual soldiers, and must watch for their morale, numbers and how tired they are and use wisely your soldiers. After the battle is over, you switch back to the campaign map and the forces involved in the battle advance or retreat accordingly to the outcome of the battle.Good features and improvementsRome II: Total War added important features to the previous Total War games.The first is the Army Instances: you may issue orders to your armies use forced marches, travelling faster but being easely ambushed, to build defesive positions, being unable to move but gaining defensive bonuses or to loot the land, advancing slowly but earning money.The provincial system bounds smaller settlements to large ones, making all ot them share bonueses from buildings. Also, you can issue Edicts to provinces you control entirely, giving bonueses to achieve specific goals (better income, faster recruitment or improved public order).Public order has a index that goes from 100 (very happy) to -100 (the province rebels), and it is more realistic than the previous system in which it took two turns to a perfectly happy city go berserk after a minor change in taxes.There is a large variety of units. Balkanic spearmen, Iberian spearmen and Arabian spearmen look different from each other, which increases the perception that you are in a vast world inhabited by many different cultures.Amphibious battles are certainly one of the better improvements: ships fight in the sea while armies clash on the land. Artillery ships can bombard a city's towers and a vessel full of legionaries can disembark to aid their allies in mainland, or even disembark directly inside a enemy port to capture the city.Last and least, the game is truly beautiful and you'll watch one of the most realistic graphics in the market.Bad features and what was left behindMany important features from previous games were stripped in Rome II: Total War.There is no more family tree, which displayed your faction leader's family. Even if it seems a useless feature, it greatly improved immersion in the game. Without it, your generals became uninteresting characters.The game is corrupted with bugs: aside from graphical issues and good computers being unable to maintain a steady rate of FPS, the game crashes too often.The game was extremely streamlined: the buildings options are shallow, characters have few and uninteresting traits (in Rome I, a general could have dozens of traits that reflected the path of their lifes), transport ships spawn instantly making fleets near useless, siege battles are almost worthless playing (in fact, many siege battles now do not even include walls...) and all agents (Spies/Dignataries/Veterans) do basically the same thing (assassinate, slow enemy forces or slow down construction in enemy cities).Units in the battlefield now possess arcade abilities. On exemple: many spearmen have a speed boost ability that enhance charges. It seems ok at first, but why spearmen? Can't a Roman legionary run faster for a while? Some abilities like a ""form phalanx"" or ""form shieldwall"" should be, and are, availabe to pikemen and soldiers carrying shields, but generic abilities like ""run faster"" should not be ""active skills"", but ""passive skills"" available to whoever can run faster. In Medieval 2: Total War, if cavalry had enough space to run, they would deliver a devastating charge, but in Rome II: Total War heavy cavalry simply have the ""devastating charge"" button. Arcades abilities such as ""run faster"" or ""improved charge"" kill the realism that was supposed to be the most remarkable feature of Total War.AI has never been anything close to clever in previous Total War games, but in Rome II: Total War it is even worse. If the AI is defending a city, it will hold its position it doesn't matter what is happening around them: they stand idle and happily get butchered by your arrows and artillery, and if your actually sneak into the city and take the central flag in order to win, there is a great possibility that the defending units will not respond to that and simply keep watch over the main gate.Naval battles are broken, terrible after the pathces but unplayable at release. Many times your ships will simply stop responding to your orders, and they do not seem to know some basic laws of physics (gargantuan battleships moving fast suddenly stop when a small vessel attempts to board it).Last but not least, the main problem with Rome II: Total War is that this game uses the same engine as Empire: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War, it's called Warscape. It worked fine in Empire, when most battles consisted of musketeers shooting each other, with fewer meele fights than any other Total War. But Rome II: Total War relies mostly in meele fights, and it is a problem, because it demands many units interacting at the same time - but Warscape only allows two units interactiong with each other with ""kill moves"", choreographies with two units that only start when both are in the right position. It means that most units will juts walk around the battlefiled until they are in position to do a ""kill move"", and if a soldier is surrounded by ten enemies, only one will actually attack. Also, units are less able to hold their positions in battles and lines are easely broken due to the lack of collision between units. In the end, the game fails to deliver what it promissed: the epic battles that made Total War a legend.ConclusionRome II: Total War is a good game. It is beautiful. It is huge. But it is not what the community was expecting, and not what was advertised. If you never saw a Total War game before, you may enjoy Rome II: Total War, but will enjoy more the other titles: Medieval 2: Total War, Napoleon: Total War and Shogun 2: Total War (considered a masterpiece).If you know any other Total War, you will realize that Rome II: Total War is hollow shell of the former games. You can have fun, but the thought of what this game could have been will follow you through all your campaigns and diminish your experience with the game.A good definition of what is a good sequel is one that makes the original unplayable, because it improved so much that you do not want to play the original anymore. Rome II: Total War failed to do that, because it even failed to recreate the atmosphere, the immersion and experience of the original Rome: Total War. And, obviously, failed to enhance the experience.			"

I bought Shogun 2: Fall of the Samurai for $5 and you bet your♥♥♥♥♥was worth it, but when ALL the Total War games are on sale for $5 you STILL have to pay $60 for this game, which by the way has released a year ago, and that alone is just an example of greed, greed, greed. You know what else released a year ago? Just something random, Assassin's Creed Black Flag is about a month younger than this game, so not quite a year, and I can buy it for $17 on Amazon, hell I paid $30 for the Mass Effect Trilogy and got 3 games. Not to mention the endless DLC whoring is on a whole new level for this game as well, just another way to con you out of your hard earned dollars. They may have also just made a few bug fixes and slapped a brand new name ""Emperor's Edition"" on it, but I've been playing for less than an hour and I've already crashed twice.. Crashes should have been fixed a long time ago, and I'm still seeing many bugs as well. Now for gameplay? Combat is boring, there is NO tacticality to it whatsoever, just big slug fests until one side routs after maybe a minute or so, regardless if they're veterans or not. Naval Combat is so horrible I don't even want to talk about it.. This doesn't even hold a candle to Shogun 2.. Spend $5 on this wonderful sale and get something worth it. I beg ANYONE who reads this review. DON'T GET THIS GAME. YOU WILL REGRET IT.			"

												Now I am going to write why this game isn't bad, to help stop all the warding off fans that is going on, this game deserves buyers in my opinion, but too the the point! In terms of this game, reviews are full of people saying ""It's so laggy!"" ""Unplayable!"" ""Crashes all the time!"". Well I can honestly say it was, but not anymore, and honestly bugs only affected a small shouty crowd of people who need anger management classess. I was infact affected by a start-up crash that happened only for a few days before the devs fixed it, and believe me, the devs have fixed all but a few bugs. Now too the game itself. One of the only negatives I have to say of the Campaign was the Political Interface, which isn't the point of a Total War game anyway. I can blame CA for getting people hyped on better Politics but again, it's a game based around a fantastic Battle Sim. The Campaign was buggy to start, again I experienced issues but I (Unlike some) was patient. This took a couple of weeks too fix mind but all was good. I thought that the battles had gotten better and graphics took a big leap and honestly, don't base your decision on all the release reviews.			"

												Do you like a game+DLCs that cost a meal that could feed 50 Africans and still be as immersive and fun as adding dead rats in your basement? Do you like constant patching that makes any and all mods, no matter how simplistic or complicated, big or small, completely obselete and crash your game mid-load, like an abusive grandmother who decides to beat you half to death just because you mended her very shiitty, rotting quilt? Are you ready for the experience of more Total War games, along with the rest of the AAA genre, being hardcoded to the degree that adding any and all modifications requires the equivalent of doing plastic surgery on your unbelievably ugly dog? Are you ready for game modifications to be outlawed entirely and to bow down to our AAA overlords who wish to monopolise and otherwise basterdize the industry with shiit, so much so that pretty much all games may one day literally be hardcoded with complicated patterns featuring the word ""shiit"" and ""dogturds"" and ""monkey_dongs"" and ""filthy_peasant_consumer""?Then my dear comrade, Total War: Rome II is for you.

												In comparision to Shogun 2 it is really bad.  City battles are boring, despite of great models. There is a lot of skill trees but charakters dies pretty fast so you won't have much time to actually use their abilities. Also despite having much greater culture dieversion than in shogun 2 all factions are pretty similar. It is not bad as a game in general but is bad as a Total War game. "

Rome 2 is another step in the TW series towards a wider audience. Quick sum up: + a large world map ranging from Ireland to India including a lot of historically accurate details+ heavy emphasis on cultural differences in tech trees, unit rosters and faction strategies (eg Hoplites aren't available to non-Greek factions unless as rare and expensive mercenaries)- the unit variety has been improved since Shogun 2 but remains poor compared to older TW games- a good deal of game mechanisms included in previous episodes have been ""streamlined"" (publisher slang for ""butchered""). The end game is much simpler to manage. Winning a campaign isn't as challenging as it used to be.- the siege AI sucks just as usual... nothing to see here, move along.+ rich and highly detailed graphics, especially the combat animations, for what it mattersVeterans may be disappointed and you'll sometimes face some frustrating issues, but to be fair Rome 2 offers great fun overall. It's also the sort of games which can keep you busy for hundreds of hours. Bugfixes and community mods can only help though!			"

												I've been a fan of the Total War series since Rome Total War.  This installment of series makes many changes, both positive and negative, but the ultimate sum of the equation results in one great game.  It's true, there are many aspects of the game that have been changed, some for the better and some for worse, but I give this game no less love.  There's nothing missing or added to this game that breaks the Total War formula, so unless you're hung up on the little things like no more family trees, or the fact that units can be transported across bodies of water without dedicated naval units, then this game is nothing short of amazing.  I can understand the gripes of the Total War fans that cry foul for some of the changes but, at its core, it's still a fantastic game.For people who aren't Total War players:Any fans of turn-based strategy will enjoy the dynamics of the campaign map, while also getting a huge thrill out of the real-time battles that are inevitable.  The amount of depth in this game is staggering and accounts for countless hours of enjoyment and fulfillment.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I tried to like it, but I just don't.  So many of the things that Rome 1 had are simply gone in Rome 2 .. the game is nothing like the first.  The music was very dissapointing .. that was such an immursive quality about Rome1 that I liked.  The politics in Rome 2 are silly and I don't even care.  The characters .. well .. there is no family tree in Rome 2 so I don't care about the characters either.  The interface overall was very disappointing.  That damn floating dialog box following my cursor everywhere telling me that something was a swamp, or a forest ... WTF?  ... SO annoying! The thing I liked most was the ability to play so many different cultures.  But I did not notice any difference playing one culture or another.. same music .. same feel ... same disappointment.Uninstall ...			"

												I'm a self confessed Total War fan'boi'. I would not recommend this game. I feel dirtied for having purchased it. I didn't get it at release because of the current state of main stream releases; bring it out with a plethora of bugs and fix them as they're reported. I managed to dodge the mess that was this launch where the game was fundamentally unplayable. But it wasn't worth the wait. The game that is here now is a sad lament for what Total War games used to be. I've genuinely reinstalled Medieval 2 TW with 'The Third Age' mod to try and forget that this is where the series ended up. The game isn't very pretty. By modern standards it's actually quite clunky, in particular the campaign map which is quite simply ugly to a modern market. But who cares about the graphics; The gameplay is where the game really lets you down. The battles are tedious, easy, and feel less like fights between individual soldiers (a hallmark of the series) and more like you throwing elaborate rocks at scissors and avoiding the papers. The intergration between naval battles and land battles is embarassingly clunky, and offer hundreds of immersion breaking exploits such as landing a crew of peasants in the middle of a major city and taking it whilst the AI twiddles thumbs on the walls. There are mods that can salvage this, but it isn't fair to review the game on a modded version. The campaign management just isn't fun. You can tweak it with the mods again to rectify that, avoiding some of the now infamous 'agent spam' from the AI or also infamous 'pointless politics' which always culminate in scripted events whether you manage the country wonderfully or mash you face on the keyboard each turn. Building an invasion force becomes laughably easy on lower difficulty and pointlessly difficult on higher difficulty, tweaking the numbers rather than the ability of the computers. All in all, this had the framework of a masterpiece. I enjoyed my time on it and if you're an absolute die hard fan of the series like me, then come on , we both know you have to buy it. But I know that if you are like me, you may also shed a tear when you see the list of DLCs, including playing as some content they originally made for vanilla but are locked until you cough up  a tenner. I'm not sure if the worst part of this game is that I can't play as Athens if I don't pay money equivalent to a whole new game, or if I also have to pay more money if I want to put the graphic settings on gory.

												As I am about to cross the 500 hour mark, I can say this, I have easily got my money's worth. Though there has been rocky points in the game with bugs, AI glitches, graphics issues and pathing issues, I can confidently say MOST of those are behind us. It is true that people should expect a complete product on launch, but the devs have not and are still not giving up. Here are some highlights that also answer some negative responses you will likely find;-New multiplayer games are now working and are fun to play though it is limited to 2 players on campaign-The AI acts much more intuitively, though not perfect, they are still working on it and it can pose a challenge especially on legendary.-New factions are added for free and in packs for a minimal cost even when not on sale, this is not required to play or gives anyone an advantage in any way-Graphics are gorgeous and scale very well, the leaks in code are gone-Unit balance is fine with a ""paper rock scissor"" setup for every unitBottom line most of the crap you read is over with, and the game is well worth full price of $60.

												CA Drops the ball again. Maybe I have become spoiled by great games like Crusader Kings 2 but the continued poor depiction of history and historic terminology (ie the use of gravitas for some reason as a core stat when dignitas or other words would be more appropriate for a core stat), as well as the failure to include old RPG features like a family tree has made this unplayable for me. I found this frustrating with the Empire series where I strongly felt the lack of a true faction leader and I was hoping that after Shogun, they were attempting a return to form. But they really weren’t. And this is not even going into the huge AI issues and other problems others have spoken of.I will say this, CA, a company that was once one of my favorites, has pretty much consistently delivered poor products on release SINCE the beloved first Rome. In the past this wasn’t a big deal and I was fine with it because they usually released splendid Add-Ons (Barbarian Invasions) which would make the base game have better features and then the Modders would come in and make fun historical campaigns that I still play to this day. The problem is that I don’t know if Rome II has the elements of a solid base game for the Modding community to make this into a lasting CA title.  "

												Been waiting for 8 years (even though Rome Total War 1 was released ~10 years ago) and I get slapped with this pile of pig manure. Couldn't play for the first few hours, as this game is terribly made and optimized. Especially since it's running the warscape engine, which is more towards projectile warfare rather than melee warfare and accompanied with one on one combat focusing only on kill animations to determine the death of a soldier. Battles just become huge blobs of clusters, with formations breaking really fast due to these ridiculous kill animations. To make this game even moderately enjoyable, it had to be modded very HEAVILY. More details on how terribly designed the game can be watched by,

And unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this game, as I was looking foward to this since Rome Total War 1. But being a hardcore Total War fanboy, I tried and tried to enjoy it. It also upsets me that they are releasing these pointless $15 DLCs that add virtually nothing to the game. And $15 is just too much for something like that, epsecially with a broken game. But, they proceed to release DLCs instead of trying to fix the game, or perhaps as a stretch create an entirely new engine. Honestly though, I'll probably fall for CA's next Total War game, and preorder it, just to be dissapointed again (but everything can change if they make a new engine).This game can't be fixed, as the game is broken to its core. Its design and mechanics are terrible. And again, the core flaw is the engine itself. I don't really care for bugs, as they can be easily fixed with patches, but a game that is broken down to its design can't be fixed. You have strip the entrie game to its bone and rework it. Essentially creating a new game.			"

												Rome 2 is quite underated. Creative Assembly has put much work into making this game have incredible graphics and cinematic epiccness. Some of the technical aspects can have a learning curve, and there have been some hardware troubles, but this game overall is a wonderful game. Good job.			"

												A Well rounded game that has provided me countless hours of enjoyment (around 3000 hours).When compared to watching a 2 hour movie for 10 dollars. I have got my moneys worth with this game. I wish that they didn't stray into the magical realm with the new upcoming warhammer total war but I understand you have to give the players what they want even if its steam punk meets harry potter looking crap that has gears with no function what so ever.

												A huge letdown given the original Rome TW's success. IT IS NOT worth giving your money to CA after this mess. The battles are a chaotic mess with horrible collision problems that cause units to bounce off eachover resulting in battles looking more like mosh pits. In addition to this, many features that have been standard in Total War games like loose formation and guard mode are gone. The campaign map is another letdown with poor diplomacy that feels mostly pointless. Very little depth on a whole with the city interface that just makes the game even easier. Veteran players will have no problem with the campaigns long but boring campaigns that lose all challange after maybe five hours of play. This wouldn't be such a huge problem if campaigns didn't last 35-40 hours. If your looking for a fun strategy title this isnt what your looking for. Pick up the original Rome TW or maybe Medieval II with mods.			"

												Look, you may notice I don't have much time put into this game. Why? Well, let's start out with the issues that make this game pretty hard to approach. 1. Optimization: Seriously, this is a PC ONLY GAME! Yet, compared to something like BF4 and AC4, games that were made with consoles in mind first, then PC, this game runs like garbage. I was having fps drops into the teens... ON THE MAP! And before you go ""Well, your computer must be low spec."" I'm running the game ABOVE recommened hardware! I have a 3rd generation i5 and a gtx 660 2 GB with 8GB of ram! That's above the recommended hardware. And no I am NOT running the game Maxed out, I'm running it on mostly high (which in this game is equivalent to medium), even though I can run Shogun 2 maxed out just fine.2. False previews: Even running the game maxed out on the benchmark, the game looked nothing like the footage we saw from the ""alpha"". Napoleon looks better than this...3. WAY too much DLC: I know TW has done this in the past with Napoleon: TW, but at least then you were only missing out on a few units (besides the one bigger DLC for the spanish campaign) and those units only costed maybe $2. This time around they are charging $8 for Greek States like Sparta and another $8 for Nomadic Tribes! They know everybody wants to play as Sparta, so instead of having it in the main game they decide to have it as DAY ONE DLC! That's just crap. And let's not forget they are now releasing an expansion, even though the core game STILL has MASSIVE issues. 4. Battles: So they are still using the same engine used in Empire and above. The issue is that the engine was desinged for more modern combat and guns. It worked in Shogun 2 because you generally didn't have to have thousands of men attack each other, it was more organized and there were some guns here and there. This game is ALL hand to hand (well, mostly swords and spears) combat. So of course, the engine just doesn't work. The battles go REALLY fast (I took over a city and killed around 1,000 men, in 8 minutes, something that in Shogun and Napoleon would have take around 20 minutes and above) and since the AI is so dumb all you really have to do to win battles is send a few horses or guys to flank, and then just watch (which is hard to do becasue your FPS hits the floor).5. UI: This is the final reason and really the main reason I quit playing so fast. The UI is just cluttered and really hard to get around with. Managing cities is just akward compared to Napoleon and Shogun 2. Maybe playing through the campaign would explain it better, but I don't play TW for a story and scripted battles, I play it for my own little playground that I can have awesome and long battles, sieges, and diplomacy where I can stab smaller nations in the back or make a nation's allys turn on them and make them weaker. Also, the lady that explains things is REALLY annoying, I never really liked how they did that with a lady always bugging you to ""Do this and that and upgrade this or check on that."" But at least in the past I could figure it out on my own and mute her.Overall the two biggest issues for me is framerate and the UI. Maybe when the game is better optimized and I can finally stomach through the campaign with out my eyes hurting to figure out the UI, the game will be better. But considering the game has already been out for 4 months and they seem to be focused on DLC now, I doubt that will happen. Certainly not worth $60 even if the game gets fixed, that's just a dumb price for a PC game (where they are normally $50 or below at launch) At least wait till the Summer sale and maybe then it will be patched more.EDIT: So, I decided to go back and try out Rome 2 again, after playing through a decent chunk of the campaign, I must say I WAS having FUN with it. So now you may be asking ""why is the review still negative???"" well simple, city battles (which is what you'll be doing a majority of the time) are just...not good...at all. In the forest, where you can set up ambushes and take advantage of hills the game is actually pretty fun and it's quite a sight to see a guy get gutted by one of your loyal men, but in the city the AI just goes WHAAAAAAT????? It's just cluttered, you can't flank (well, not very well) because the city is so linear and the AI just sits there in the middle of the city where the flag is in this big ball of guys. This was an issue in Napoleon as well, but city battles then were more about taking over buildings and shooting from there, raining cannon fire from above, and shooting enemies accross bridges. This game is mostly melee of course, yet the city lay out is very similar to Napoleon it seems, which as you can imagine, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK! I have yet to ran into a ""game crashing"" bug, but the more I played, the more I just wanted to play another TW game that has more depth than this. I gotta be honest, it's the worst buy I made during the steam sale mainly becasue of how expensive it is. I just can't reccomened this game to anyone at it's current price. And now CA is working on a new Alien game so I think even they have given up on this game. Just avoid it, hopefully the next TW will fix things and be a step in the right direction (and if it's a melee focused game, CA PLEASE MAKE A NEW ENGINE and AI)			"

												The hype, the tension for this title after Shogun 2 was massive for me and others that love the Total War franchise. Unfortunately the game lacks in many area's, the biggest area's are, number 1: The AI, which doesn't have a clue how to fight a battle, Number 2: The broken siege battles which have men dancing around at walls, men not climbing ladders properly and god for saken stupid AI movements. The game all seems a bit rushed in development and yep! patch 8 nealry and cleary that says this title was not ready for release and SEGA wanted to cash in quickly.Now I do recommend this game, WHAT!, I hear you cry, after the above words stated, well yes, I say this because I love the franchise and it's still a good real time battle game to get your teeth into and if like me you love the Roman era than it's fun to play for about an hour or two, yes unfortunately it's not as gripping as the previous games in the franchise and things are rather easy once you learn the new systems.Give it a go but don't be dissapointed when battles become a bundle of troops forgetting their military formation training or when the AI decides to do wierd things on the battle field. Fixes are coming thick and fast so hopefully the game will become more enjoyable very soon.			"

												All right. Where do I start?The game is not the best Total War to date. In my opinion Medieval II holds that honour.But this is definitely a good game. Besides the rough start it had, it has managed to live up to most of its potential.If you want something good RTS, set in the time of the Gladius and Caliga, I can really recommend this game.Do not heed the butthurt haters who keep hating on the game. It works as it should now.Also, plenty of free DLC - you can't deny that.Audio: Great effects, and good timing for the soundtracks, though the soundtrack itself... They could crank up on the instruments, the violins and the overall intensity.Graphics: A small hiccup here or there. Overall good graphics. Though it does crave a bit.Gameplay: Fun game to waste some spare time with. Don't expect it to keep your full attention past the 150 hour mark though.			"

												I'm a long time fan of Total War games, from the original Shogun - Total War onwards. That was a great game: building castles, recruiting units, expanding through battle, placing my archers on hills overlooking the battlefield with heavy infantry up front, watch the enemy get mowed down and continue my advance. Since then I've bought most of the sequels. But the past few games, I have been disappointed more and more. Mods needed to address certain issues, too much DLC for things that should have been part of the game, little to no improvement to AI, bugs, bugs, bugs. So after Shogun 2 came out, which was the last game I bough on pre-order, I waited to buy TW:Rome 2. I read nothing but negative reviews and saw videos about a laughable AI and buggy game. I sighed a sigh of relief. But I've loved these games for so long and the game seemed interesting, so I bought the latest edition when it was on sale, hoping that all bugs and other issues had been fixed.Shortly after buying Rome 2, I started to play a game, playing the Roman faction, but was almost immediately hit with an uprising, which of course consisted of a much larger army than I had available. So I quit, disappointed. Fortunately there are plenty of alternatives.Today, I decided to try again. I chose Britain, wondering if I could start the British Empire a bit sooner. So I start off with one province and an army, already at war. Fine. I work my way to the confusing and cartoonish interface, ignoring the useless advice of my adviser, and build up my economy and my farming skills. Then I notice my army is dying. In my own city. Due to famine. How can my army already be too big for my food supply, when this is the army I started with? But I am already addressing that, so I don't worry about it. Attrition takes care of nearly all of my troops as I research upgrades and build a fishing village, but the food shortage never abates. Then an enemy army enters my lone province. It is about twice the size of my own army was, but my army is now a shadow of its former self. The game crashes and I restart. Then I send my lone spy against it to poison its food supplies, hoping to reduce it in size. Success! My food shortage is also finally taken care of, by building another upgrade. So obviously the next turn two more armies from other factions turn up in my province, marching to within striking distance of my own city. It seems as if I can't just replenish my troops or combine two or more low strength units to form one full strength unit, as I could in previous games. But both enemy armies are also larger than my original army and my army has had one turn to recruit an additional unit and recover a bit from the attrition. Looks to me like I'm doomed, three large enemy armies in my only province, ready to attack me. Why would I even bother to continue this game?Moreover, why would I bother to try again? With one crash in the few minutes I've spent on this game today, I'm not sure I would not be forced to manually save each and every turn. Why would I spend time trying to understand the cartoonish interface, when I will probably be crushed by the AI randomly declaring war on me early on? I'm not even sure that late game I won't be forced to spend most of my time waiting for the AI to complete its turns. I really wish they would spend more time on bugfixes and testing before releasing these games. The original Shogun was a work of art, even by today's standards, although the graphics are obviously outdated. In contrast, recent games look great, but play very poorly, if at all, and feature way too much obvious money grabs in the form of DLC. They feel much more like they have been produced on assembly lines and shipped out whenever the due date was reached on a marketing department's calendar. I can't help but feel that the developers must be disappointed themselves as well. They are probably aching to actually finish their product, but are forced to work on the next title. I wonder what their sales figures look like. Total War: Warhammer looks like another case in point. Beautiful to look at, but too expensive, probably filled with bugs, and certainly with money grabbing DLC. Sorry, maybe I'll give it a shot when it comes on sale, maybe I'll just pass on it entirely. I had hoped they would have learned from all the feedback from their earlier games, especially from the debacle that was Rome 2, and mended their ways. I don't see how you can keep a games company afloat by alienating your core audience. But apparently they have chosen the EA way. Just grind out game, after game, after game, hoping that people will keep buying them, and not notice their defects until afterwards. Sorry, but I'm not going to fall for that any more.			"

												I got this game around October since my computer wasnt ready in time for the early release, so i wasn't victim to many of the bugs and glitches people encountered in september. i love the classical antiquity theme and CA have done  a great job with Rome 2. If you are considering buying this game, but aren't sure because of all the negative comments, don't worry, the patches have done  a lot to help reduce the issues with the game. it's fun to play, even if you are  beginner, since it's prolouge tutorial helps you get to grips with the core mechanics, as well as the new concepts like provincial edicts. The graphics are amazing, even if you dont have the best computer in the world, you can enjoy it at a medium level and the DlC helps add a boost of historical authenticity. I can't comment on the multiplayer, since i dont  really go for it on total war, but the co-op campaign seems excellent. sure there are a few minor things to deal with, like the inavoidale squalor that seems to be everywhere, but the modding system can easily help, a feature greatly improved by CA.A great game, i would highly recommend this series to any player. As far as i'm concerned Total war is the best strategy game, not civilization or europa universalis.then again i am very biased since i only have a combined playing time of 15 minutes for them. "

												Total War has a long, illustrious history. The pinnacle of which was Empire: Total War. That is about as fine as they come. Since Empire we've had Shogun 2 and now Rome 2. I found Shogun 2 to be underwhelming and now with Rome 2, the downward spiral into obscurity continues. Pros: 1. Phenomenal graphical potential if your hardware can handle it. 2. Cinematic camera mode. Makes it quick and easy to get a glimpse of the action up close. 3. Strategic camera mode. A nice zoomed-out tactical camera option that's very reminiscent of Supreme Commander.4. HUGE world map.5. Decent in-game Encyclopedia 6. ""Continue Campaign"" option right from the launch screen in Steam.Cons:1. The UI is unnecessarily huge and impeding 2. The In game advice cannot be turned off. No matter how many times I click ""suppress advice"", I still get it. If you turn it on ""Audio only advice"" to avoid getting the extremely poorly animated advisor from popping up, It still pops up, only with no text.3. Animations were underwhelming. Units looked like little paper-doll clones.4. WAY too much DLC for extra cash. The only one worth getting (and should've come standard with the game) is the Blood and Gore DLC. Makes me feel like I bought an intentionally bare-bones game with the intent to sell me DLC later.5. Standard Total War long load times.6. Research trees are small and boring.7. Ultra high system requirements. It's a real hog. Crashes and freezes way more than I care to mention. I've been steadily reducing graphics settings in an attempt to improve stability. 8. Infuriatingly clunky political system controls.9. Voice acting became repetitive and corny after the first hour.10. Generals have magical. ♥♥♥♥ing. powers. That you have to manually control in battle. Conclusion:Rome 2 stays true to its Total War heritage. I jumped in and it felt familiar and comfortable. It's a weak and unworthy successor to the original Rome though. The resource management is basic, and the empire building is rather shallow. Empire: Total War felt deep. I felt invested in that masterpiece. I feel very little with Rome 2 other than disappointment at wasted potential. It's a big budget game that's worth no more than $30. 73/100			"

												Like a lot of people, I waited for a few months until I considered Rome II after its disastrous launch. While some people still claim the game was not fixed following eight patches, I still took my chances, and bought it when it was on sale. Call me a sucker, but I love the Roman Era, and the Total War franchise. Before I installed any mods to the game, I played the vanilla for awhile to see how bad it was. Maybe I was not looking hard enough, but it performed like any Total War game I've played. Yes, the AI would do some stupid stuff now and then, but every Total War game I've played has the AI occasionally making stupid choices. My biggest gripe about the game is how poorly optimized it is. I have a mid-tier rig, so of course I'm not running it at max settings, but even on medium or high, the game experiences texture pops, and significant frame rate drops every so often. It's clear Creative Assembly wanted to make the game next-gen, but left many of their loyal fans who don't have a nice rig out. So if you don't have a high-end rig, don't be surprised if you run into these problems. After awhile, I installed the Radious Total War Overhual Mod (Highly Recommend), and since then, I really haven't experienced any issues with the game. I've been playing a multiplayer campaign with my friend, and it has gone pretty smooth. So far, my time playing Rome II has been mostly enjoyable especially with the Radious mod. However, I do not recommend paying full price for this game as CA does not deserve it. Wait for it to go on sale before considering it. It's a fun game, but it could have been even better had CA, and Saga not pushed it out the door so early. If you're not really into this franchise, don't waste your time, but if you are, and you've been on the fence due to the mixed reviews, my opinion is that the game is in working shape, and better with the Radious Mod.  (I give it an 8/10)			"

												The Total War series has always been my favorite RTS series because of the realistic and cinematic battles that have never been repeated in other games. Each of the total war games have been almost a piece of art, providing interesting and strategic gameplay unlike other RTS games. I was quite excited on hearing the reveal of Rome 2 and have look forward to it ever since. As soon as I was able I bought this game in prerelease it was pretty excited before the release of the game. When the game finally was released however I was extremely disappointed after playing only two battles. I Immediately jumped into the combat by playing custom battles and quickly began to realize that the AI (advertise on being the best AI in total war history(really just watch the videos)and ended up being the worst AI I've seen in a video game. My first battle the AI decided to throw all 2000 of its troops at a single unit of Calvary allowing me to simply surround the destroy the enemy. Another battles I found that the enemy AI often would commit  on the strongest side of my line or simply refuse to attack me even though they are the aggressor. If you're curious on what I'm talking about simply look at the many  videos that display the ridiculous AI. When playing the campaign I was also quite disappointed by the AI other factions on the campaign map. The UI also feels unfinished along with the tech tree and a lack of a family tree. If you asked me what I truly felt is the biggest problem of the game my answer is simply the game was not finished. This game was not only disappointing but it really made me distrust this company and will make me more cautious on future releases. I will probably never preorder another game due to this experience and I urge anyone not to purchase this game due to the fact that it was not finished. Instead of fixing many of the problems that are in this game they have decided to make DLC  to squeeze out as much money out of people that were willing to purchase it. This review may seem very harsh however my hope is to see better games from creative assembly in the future and hope that Sega never pulls this ever again.			"

I do not have the best of PC's and it seems to run fine with the higher settings on, even with some of the larger battle with up to 6 full armies the frame rate is still smooth. The new Campaign map is stupendously expansive, when launching my first playthrough as Rome I am still finding the game enjoyable several months down the line, the map is that big! The foes that you encounter are also varied from the ruthless Germanic tribes to the bands of ferocious elephants from Africa. You have to adapt you play style for each faction using certain factors to your advantage to obtain victory over your enemy. Truly is a superb game, a game where no bugs have yet to be encounted, when it was on sale for £14.99 I could not believe my eyes as this is a mind-blowing price for a game with so many hours of monsterously awesome playtime.

												Pros- Better graphics(Could be a con too because the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥on all settings antialiasing doesn't even seem to work and SLI is not compatible so my GTX 690 is running at half speed)- Large map, unit skill tree- Army stances- Many mods in the steam workshop to try and fix the game- Well... that's really all that I can think of currentlyCons- Expensive and overpriced. This game is not worth $60, maybe $30.- If you loved everything about the first game you're going to be dissapointed. Total war Rome II took everything we loved about the first and limited it or removed many features that made the original game good.- Food limits on army- Limits on maximum number of armies- Can no longer split armies with free will- Skill tree is unorganized and weak(+5% increases very low to do anything) use a mod- Family tree was removed- Bad politics system- Many graphical bugs- DLC isn't worth it, the blood and gore DLC only adds a blotch of red on the enemy because the graphics are bad.

												A huge step back from its predecessor in almost every way, Rome II is the most disappointing TW game since Empire. With that being said, the modding community is excellent and there are many mods which transform this relatively mediocre game into a masterpiece. But this is not a review for the mods, it's a review for the main game. While many of the problems this game had a launch have been fixed, the core gameplay still has massive problems. If this game looks interesting to you, go purchase the original Total War: Rome. That game is a true masterpiece.			"

YouTube™ Video: Hercules - Disappointed

			How disappointed are you? For 404 error pages, attribution given below. This is a short clip from the Sci-Fi TV show: Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.		

No wine in the entire Caesar in Gaul campaign map when it's required for several buildings...0/10.After wiping out every single faction in the entire Caesar in Gual campaign as well as conquering every settlement possible it never congratulated me on my military victory for winning... Why? Because it was waiting for me to make atleast ""80 units"" for some stupid ""chapter objective"" quest that in my opinion was irrelevant. In other words I could have won the campaign with only conquering half the map instead of the entire map... lame.Also my guy clearly stabbed Julius Caesar in the face in the cut scene on the main map and he's still alive... On top of that the advisor said 3 times ""The enemy general is dead"" in 3 seperate battles against Julius Caesar and he's magically alive on the campaign map. He didn't die until I wiped out the entire Roman faction...I would have liked to seen armored war dogs (yes that existed) as well and why would the carthaginians not be able to use armored war elephants? That was available in Rome 1 and now you take it away and make them seem as if they were far behind technological wise? Also war dogs have horrible path finding where they easily get stuck on large siege equipment and seem to be extremely stupid and untrained as they run straight into spears in a phalanx formation rather then flanking when there's no one beside that unit...Much better:

												I held off buying this game for almost two years hoping that the bugs at launch would be fixed. The game runs stable, but the AI is still terrible. Nothing new from a Total War game, but I'm very disappointed that the core mechanics are fundamentally broken.I disagree that the game is ""dumbed down"". Towns are streamlined, but the minor province/capital system works really well  and makes more sense than every province having a town the size of Rome like in the previous game. You no longer need ships to embark/disembark units, but navies now disembark their own units to patrol the coasts or help out in a siege against a coastal city. Many of the added features just don't make any sense to me. There's an intrigue system involving control of the senate with small events that pop up ala CK2 that can affect your family's influence and power. I have no idea what any of it means.The first major complaint I have is there's no family tree to give you an idea who you family is. If your family head dies, they are replaced by... someone. The second complaint is I have no idea what the influence does. If I make my family member a general, I lose influence? If I adopt someone into my family, I lose influence? Why do I even need influence if I control all of Rome's armies and cities?  Rome 1's solution of splitting Rome into 3 allied factions the dissolve into civil war wasn't perfect but it was much more intuitive and  a lot more fun.The city happiness system has been made much harder. I think what they were trying to do here was prevent steamrolling entire countries with a couple full armies.  Once you conquer a province, you need to keep you army around until you culture eclipses that of your conquered foe and put down any rebellions that pop up. On paper I like this, but I feel like the math is ♥♥♥♥ed up because a rebellion popped up nearly every other turn in the same province (or slave rebellion). I don't know if I built the wrong buildings, but I spent nearly 10 years running back and forth between the same cities in Northern Italy putting down rebellions turn after turn. Something isn't right there. Overall, I don't understand why Rome 2 turned out how it did. Shogun 2 and it's expansions were probably the most polished games in the entire series, yet the sequel feels unfinished.			"

												The launch was a complete mess full of bugs, bad design choices and poor performance. After dozens of patches it became tolerable, however it's far, far from what it should have been: the ""remake"" of one of the best games ever made. Shogun 2 is the way to go if you want a top Total War experience.3/5			"

												Total War: Rome II was a Pyhrric victory.On one hand, Creative Assembly and SEGA made a lot of money. That's great for them, I'm sure it'll keep them warm at night.On the other, it left the fans bitter toward the developers and the producers, having been tempted by virtue of its predecessors. Where Rome I - for its time- was a phenomenal game, Rome II has failed to live up to its hype. Perhaps we have just grown older.Coming on to the Emperor Edition of Rome II, we have finally recieved a game worthy of the series' reputation and the money spent acquiring the thing.Rome II set out to change the series, which is an admirable goal almost achieved- but not worth alienating its established audience.Technical issues appeared, of course. One of the most off-putting was the change to the campaign's factions. Fans requested a more in-depth faction system, and CA divided the world according to numerous historical nations and tribes. It sounds good on paper; the sheer amount of factions, however, breaks the flow of the game by extending end turn times and slowing AI growth, so that the player's empire--once established--has no clear rivals, such as in Medieval II.Some of my pet peeves include the Faction DLCs- the worst of which is the Greek States DLC that cost me more than reasonably- and the odd lack of historical battles, which I fear may also become paid DLC. My will to make this game work paid off when I picked up the nomadic Tribes free, but it will take more than a few new cultures to fix this game. I particularly dislike the campaign AI, which takes its quantity-over-quality armies and finds the most isolated lands nearby to carve a short-lived empire before my army can sweep in, and I am forced to manually fight an easy battle that, if autoresolved, would have had my legions scattered. The political system is difficult to comprehend, as little clear indication is given of how it actually affects the game; it's no better (and not much worse) than Rome I's system. Similarly, character levelling is difficult because they die off quickly, and there is no longer an ability tree- you are choosing abilities blind.I found that many players complained about issues that simply required them to have had experience with past Total War games, or to have simply done a little exploring of the game to understand. The two that stood out for me were the battle AI and the new province system, and those issues and solutions are respective of each other. Let's face it: Total War's AI has never been top-quality stuff. I take it many of the complainers weren't around when it was making the same poor decisions in the previous games- that said, it is somewhat odd that CA hasn't yet developed a more advanced AI to give the seasoned commanders a proper challenge. As for the province system- it works. Move on.Luckily, most of the issues stated above are able to be fixed, whether it is by the developers themselves or by the now supported modding community. Negativity aside, there have been many great additions to the game that I hope will remain. The province system brings a level of strategy to building your empire, as you must now choose your buildings carefully, rather than simply your build order (arguably, that was present in Shogun II but grouping the cities into provinces shares their effects which improves the system). In battles, the men talk to each other and give the feeling that a battle is really going down; the cinematic camera works very well with this. Unfortunately, the unit-vs-unit AI is hard in my PC, and I can't view the battles up close. You can also now choose to fight replay battles again (Note that they're called 'replays' and not 'recorded battles'- as such, don't expect to be able to relive your finest battles exactly as they went). Just remember: almost everything that made Total War what it is is still here.With everything said about the DLC, if you have the money I believe they're all worth it. The campaigns can give you access to neat mods on more detailed maps, and the paid DLC factions are certainly worth buying if you take a particular interest in those cultures.It's still big, epic Total War. Buy this game on sale (like any game ;3 )			"

												This is not the level of quality you've come to expect from a Total War game. Aside from issues like AI and graphics, it doesn't feel like you're playing a story. It's very hard to be immersed and invested in your campaign in this game, similar to how you were in the previous Total War games. You'll probably have to ask a game designer why that is, but all I as a comsumer care about is if it does or does not entertain. And this does not entertain to the level I had expected.			"

												Rome 2 Emperor ******* Edition! Is it worth your hard earned money and time?Let's seeFirst of all, I am regular gamer, with 20+ years in gaming. So, I have seen all the TW titles. I am not paid by any gaming company and I speak truth.Secondly, RTW2 is a good game. YES. RTW1 is an old game, so is Medieval TW2. Sorry, they were good 15 yrs ago, now they are redundant. That is true.RTW2 has sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics, we have to say that. Promotion system is totally bugged and strange.However, after ""only"" 17 patches, they got it right! If you check prices of TW games, the TWR2 will be still the most expensive one. Some mods, like DEI, make it harder and more challenging and more ballanced.I just wish they spoke with Paradox team who did the famous king Arthur game. That game had story, even though controls were like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Now, you will have Warhammer on the market soon. Modded Attila basically with elements from Warhammer world,Buy it on sale. On meantime, enjoy this one. And if anyone says to you that Rome 1 is better than Rome 2, you are free to call him OLD. "

It has some of the worst design I have ever seen in a strategy game. The interface now is totally ""Streamlined"" which just means an extra click here and shiny green bars instead of numbers. The B team made this game not the people that brought us the original ROME total war which was at the least fun to play.  Stay away if you want anything like previous instalments such as shogun 2 or Med 2 Total war. Shame on you CA.The AI is totally backwards compared to other total war games and that is really saying something. The heart and soul of this game is missing.			"

This game runs better than Emipre does. framerate is good. sometimes the AI gets a little off in the battles but in the campiagn they are very intelligent. Diplomacy actually works unlike previous titles (atleast on Hard) The hate for this game seems unjustifed. I would give it a solid 8/10 not Strategy game of the year but good.

												Obviously a step back in Total War series.The campaign. It's true, it has a huge map and a wide range of units but:     - Only playing in legendary you will feel that the game is ""a little"" hard. In any other mode is too easy.     - After playing some hours in campaign you are bored because always it is the same,     - You can't feel inmersed in any way. What will you do for Rome, Carthage...? Nothing, just wait until the civil war arrives and after that, there is nothing more.     - Big battles, it's true. However you can't see anything unlike Shogun 2, where you can watch how men are dying. Here men die cause they are suffering epilepsy in middle of the battle.     - They promised ""you won't fight in cities always like Shogun 2 because the armies stay inside"". The truth, armies don't stay inside... but you are always fighting in cities with militia armies.     - An excellent AI, who makes armies with two thousands of slinges or javelin man.Multiplayer.I can just say ""No comment""Conclusions: after 8 patches we're still waiting the game that they had promised. I'm not going to tell the bugs there are and there were in the game, you can watch it in their forum and ""patch X solved following bugs"". Maybe in two or three months more the game will be good... MP, you can forget it, they had planned Battle Arena and this game is empty in that aspect.			"

												This review is going to be longer than most I typically write.Im going to start by touching on various bases:The Campaign/Grand World Map:Total War has always been known for scale. This game is no exception. Creative Assembly has created a hugely detailed, highly interactive(It feels like it was built for touch, sometimes), and deceptively simple interface. The map terrains and army models are of extremly high quality, as should be expected from the developers.The Battles:As always, Creative Assembly has come out on top in terms of qualities and looks; the feel and details of the units and battlefield are astounding, and the sounds that go with entire Roman Centuries slamming into Celtic Tribesmen make the experience complete. The Blood&Gore packs only adds to the completion of this experience.The AI:This is the game's biggest flaw. The AI in battles can be....well, predictable. Challenging, but like all AI, supremely predictable. This is only doubled by the sheer idiocy of the AI on the lower difficulties, and the fact that the only reason the AI will win on the hard difficulties, is not by outsmarting the player, but being able to control biggers amounts of units, faster.Other than the AI, Total War: ROME II is a great addition to the fantastic series that Creative Assembly has created. While it lacks true political integration(much like that of Medieval 2, with its Papacy roles and elections, or even Rome 1, with its approval ratings of the Senate and Plebs), Rome II is still a lot of fun, not just by yourself, but with friends.In my opinion, SEGA should have delayed the release a little longer, to let Creative Assembly finsh the game. But we can't have everything.			"

												Okay, here's my verdict on Total War: Rome II. When I was looking into buying this game, I read through some of the reviews, many of them being negative. This really surprised me, seeing all the previous games, (Empire Total Warout, Shogun II, etc) were all quite awesome. So, disregarding the many negative reviews, I went out and bought it anyways. And that was the best decision ever. As I was playing the game, it came to my why so many people were hating this game. There is no easy solution. You can't just shoot your way out of everything, as in Battlefield or Call of Duty. If you are expecting a quick and easy thrill, stop, hit the back arrow, and buy a FPS game. This game is not for the faint of heart. It's a strategy game for crying out loud! So all the reviews complaining about how %$#&ing hard the game is, you should really just get a life. As I said before, if you don't like games that go deeper than point and shoot, you should never play the game. Also, about all the comments of the glitches and such, I'm pretty sure that they are all fixed now. I have not experienced any yet.So now down to the business of actually reviewing this game:Pros:-Graphics are jaw dropping. I've been playing on medium, but I have seen the ultra high graphics on a friend's computer, and if you've the hardware to do it, it's really worth a look!-With the added 4TPY(4 Turns per Year), your generals and agents last longer. Also, the seasons look really good too.-""Money is the sinews of War"" Those of you who have played the first Rome will probably remember this quote (If I quoted it correctly). This saying is especially true to this game. Never have I had such a involving economics in a game. Your every action will effect the game outcome, from the generals you hire, to who you make treaties with.Cons:There's not very many cons.... just a few for me: -What is with the unit cards? They look like cave drawings! These always looked better in previous games. -The encyclopedia. Total War, what were you thinking? What you had in every other game, up to Shogun II, was working perfectly fine. Now, it's dependant on the internet, is not laid out nicely, and is a pain to use. Bring back the old one please!-And lastly, a bit of nostalgia from the first Rome. Anyone else remember when you could click on a city, and view the city in real? As you flew through the city you could see the barracks you built, and that lovely shrine to Athena.... Why? Why is that gone?Overall though, I love this game. Every time I sit down to play this game, I put on my laurel wreath and say with conviction: ""Veni, Vidi, Vici"" (I came, I saw, I conquered!)So really, if you want a challenge, I dare you to play this game. Otherwise, just go back to whatever else you play.... "

												I have tried the other games in the total war franchise. How can people even begin to call this game a heap of crap in comparison to the other titles in the series? Are we even playing the same game? If CA released games like Empire or Medieval 2 today, I can garuntee it would get♥♥♥♥♥♥on like no other game before. How can people complain about the graphics in Rome 2 when they are the best in the series. This is the first game in the series that has a serious graphical texture to it. I simply can't get over how cartoony the majority of others look. The music in this game fits perfectly, and as a student majoring in music at the University of Toronto, I like to think I have an educated opinion on the subject. This game demands background music, and it delivers. It is not riddled with melody, because that would simply be too distracting. The rips in the french horn, and the glorious moments from the brass section capture the modern view on Rome excellently.When I first booted up Medieval 2, I was surprised to hear that a Kyrie was playing on the menu screen. At first, I thought they had actually brough medieval music into the game, but once I entered the game, I was met disapointing upbeat synth. Rome 2 has a huge emphasis on diplomacy. Whole alliances of several smaller states rising up against my larger empire removes the old steamroll that was found in the previous total wars. In empire, once I became larger than any one of my neighbors, I was usually able to steamroll my way across the land. In Rome, each civilization is a challenge, and their much more aggressive behaviour makes it even harder. However, there are a few options, such as the ""threaten to declare war"" option, and the ability to ask for/give land, that I sorely miss from past total war titles. However, this lack of options does NOT mean that Rome 2's diplomacy is broken, and if anything, the diplomacy in Rome 2 is stronger than any other title seen before. The political system is not as complete trash as most people are saying it is, but it is definetly several steps back from the previous titles. CA sorely needs to implement a family tree system, and create a logical political system ASAP. Another thing that I miss about Medieval 2 is the numerous traits that generals gained. Generals had so many traits that eventually I could get to really know them as people. In Rome 2, there are hints at the general's personalities, but nothing as emersive as Medieval's. The seiges suck. But after playing empire, where the ENTIRE REASON I stopped playing was because of the crappy seiges, and how rediculously frequent they were, seiges in Rome 2 feel amazing. The AI has gotten much better with seiges, but they definetly need improvement. This includes, waiting to build seige equipment before attacking, and attacking with all said equipment all at once, instead of a few at a time. Also, giving the AI the ability to attack from multiple angles is sorely needed. I believe these issues can be fixed however. One important point to note is that seiges are much less frequent in this game. The majority of the battles i fight are out in the field and absolutely glorious. The AI, contrary to popular belief, uses the terrain to it's advantage. I had one battle where the ai used a massive sand dune to move its entire army, and thereby get right behind my balistas. With the use of provinces, the number of walled cities has significantly been reduced, which therefore reduces seiges. The size of the map also lends a hand to the increased number of field battles.Many people are saying Rome 2 is drop dead easy... Rome 2 is the first of the total war games where I have actually lost a campaign. The AI brilliantly attacks vulnerable cities, and effectively uses agents to cut off armies from eachother. The AI is very VERY clearly the best I have seen in the series so far. One important factor to take into account when looking at Rome 2 is that there is now a restriction on the number of armies one may have. This MASSIVELY improves the game, and I feel like not a single person has touched upon the subject. In Empire, the AI would have hundreds of small armies running around, making it impossible to strategically place my own armies. With a restriction on armies, I now have to strategically place my armies once ive reached the limit in the late game, as opposed to simply pumping out 10 at a time in the late game, once money no longer matters. This restriction on armies now grants the possibility for one to actually have their empire crumble, as opposed to being unstoppable with unlimited armies. People are complaining about how clunky and bad naval battles are. And while I agree, the AI isn't the smartest, it is not nearly as bad as people thing. People need to realize that ancient naval battles simply were not very tactical, especially when compared to the naval battles in the napoleonic era. This grants the illusion that naval battles are broken, but in my opinion, they are exactly as boring and free of strategy as they would have been in the ancient world. In terms of bugs and crashes, I have experienced very few. I had an issue with my game not loading past the title screen, but this was easily fixed. The only major bug i found was with the balance of power back in patch one, where every faction i encountered thought they were exactly as powerful as myself, even though I may have been an absolute superpower. This ended up destroying diplomacy, especially as a barbarian faction, as many barbarian factions wont trade/join confederation if they think you are not a total badass. Some are saying that pikes need a buff. I have never seen more♥♥♥♥♥♥in my life. Pikes are easily the most powerful units in the game WHEN USED EFFECTIVELY. The units themselves are next to the level of the mob, as they should be. When placed in proper positions, pikes absolutely wreck. People simply need to learn to play the game to apreciate their power.Another issue with the game is the auto resolve option. While it is broken, and generally kills more units than you should lose, I don't have a problem with this issue. It forces you to actually play most battles, which should be the entire focus of the game, practicing battles and getting emersed into how your empire is forming. If the entire game could be auto resolved, I would have little connection to my empire, and the history of its expansion. This game now has a stigma against it for being terrible, and people are failing to see that. It has it's issues, but they are so minor that they can easily be ignored. This game is the best in the series that I have played. I have heard great things about Shogun, but I would not be able to get past the lack of variety in the game, and the narrow portion of history that the game has to go off of. With Rome, there is so much history to explore, recreate, and change. If you are a fan of the series, do not buy into the crap that these dramatic haters are giving this game. Look at it objectively compared to the rest of the series, and you will know that it is one of the best.			"

												it's like... they murdered everything that made TW amazing, took out all the detail, ""streamlined"" everything to ""approach a wider audience"", then looked at a bunch of really good features from competing strategy games, and implemented them in the worst way possible. It doesn't even feel like TW any more, except battles, but they're still worst than ever, and they seem to get worse with every patch.I think if you're new to the series, you'll probably think the game is good. If you've played it since, like, Empire, you'll probably think it's ok. If you've played since Shogun 1, or Rome 1, you'll know just how pooh this game is, and you'll have more fun playing any other TW.I don't recommend this reminiscent husk of a legendary series. Rome 1 is better, go play that.			"

												Buying the game now because its a deal? Excellent move, by buying it now you've avoided the Godawful state the game was in at release, and dodged the crucible that we  loyal fans of the franchise suffered through to create this brilliant end product that your about to buy at 1/4 the price we bought it's POS (practically)beta for, which make no mistake is a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Changing gears, This is now an excellent game. Was it a year ago? No, it was terrible. Now though this is likely one of the best in the series, superior AI to previous games, pretty well ballanced multiplayer, and loads of content. there are a lot of people what will tell you this game is terrible, because they bought it at launch and still have the bad taste in their mouth of having SEGA put a giant steaming dump on a plate and selling it to loyal fans for $60. The game now is no longer the bloody excriment of of a constipated poo that was rushed out too quickly. we can only thank The Creative Assembly for the transformation this game has taken, through over a year of hard work 16 patches have saved the name of perhaps the most beloved game in the franchise.The AI has gotten at least 3x better, and now is at an incredible place, the game is far more polished, it looks at least 2x better and is more optimized for low end PCs. The DLCs are decent, terribly expensive for some not so great factions, but hey your probably gonna buy those on sale if at all. I WOULD reccomend this game, It is in fastastic shape and only getting better, it has an incredible community and terrific support from its makers. If this game got a new metascore I would guess it moved to the low-mid 90's.			"

												FOR ANYONE THINKING OF BUYING ROME II ON SALE:After 100 hours:Rome II is largely playable right now. It runs fine on my 6950 + i5 2500k at High settings with AA.The game is still easy, even on max difficulty. However, the AI seems largely more active in terms of diplomacy (declaring war on you, asking for trade agreements, asking for help in wars) and creates quite large empires in the endgame, which are great news.Overall, I'd say that this game's best feature is in the variety of units and factions. It has a gigantic world map and an unprecedented amount of factions, a reasonable amount of which are playable (and a new one, Baktria, is on the way). This lends some great longevity and entertainment value. Also, the new province system is pretty pleasant to manage, altough the simplified building choice is a definite negative point. Overall, the UI is objectively simplified compared to the previous games. It's up to you to decide if you like it or not, I personally enjoy it.The siege AI is awful. It doesn't respond to slingers depleting their ammunition at them. It also engages in fruitless attempts to climb walls with two isolated units of ladders (which get destroyed) and then attemps to burn the gates with a few units while their friends stand 50 meters away. Never seen them use anything else but ladders, altough other people have seen it use siege towers and such.Multiplayer is stripped of depth and most good things introduced in Shogun II are gone. It is barebones and the co-op desynchronizes frequently. Some units are too powerful (elephants and chariots).Overall, it's an enjoyable game with a ton of flaws. Graphically, it's good with mods, and okayish without them.I'd give it a 7/10 for the singleplayer, 3/10 for the multiplayer.To clarify: this is after 7 (!) patches. The game at release was utterly broken. Hopefully this will help you in your purchase.			"

												As a highly anticipated title and a successful franchise (and me being a huge total war fan)  Rome II is quite the dissapointment.  New players to the franchise may enjoy it more then old players who are used to the challenges in previous titles.  Its also accompanied by a list of glitchs which they continue to fix, but lets face it its been out for a while now a lot is still broken and there seems to be some performance issues even on high end machines. They continue to patch the game so hopefully they can balance out the game more to make it worth the 59$ asking price.  Also they should consider making the game itself 100% playable rather then put out add-on content for a game that plays like something barely out of beta.- Poor Campaign AI [I've beat the campaign twice on Legendary, it can be rough at first, but once you learn to stabilize your economy and keep provinces happy, Food/Money are no problem as you progress.  I ended both campaigns with millions, the hardest part is the civil war, but its not as hard as it is annoying.  Once the civil war ends factions fall easily one by one- Poor Battle AI [Again on legendary the battle AI is sloppy and lacks tactic.  Peltasts are over powered, Ballistas are over powered.  AI sends its cav at your flanks to early, which results in Melee vs Melee while you sweep your cav in and clean up the enemy missle units.  Every faction fights the same as well so its all predictable.BloodPack addon - the charged addition of some gore is also a let down.  Blood spray/splattering is awesome, but the blood detail on dead/hurt units is very sloppy also you have to look very close to see dismemberment if at allCeaser in Gual - I havent yet purchased or played.  No opinion other then it SHOULD BE FREE to all the people who preordered the game and delt with the sloppy unplayable first few weeks of Rome 2's release.  SO i've yet to give in and contribute another 15$ toward this franchise.Graphics: 7 / 10 [Great detail in city's/towns but some units need to be better optimized]Audio: 7 / 10 [It works]Replay Value: Moderate/High [You wont put the time in as on previous titles]Multiplayer: Online Battles / Co-op campaignControls:  Same as other total war titles, very sloppy during lag, dragging units to redirect them results in sticking and units not deploying.  Double clicking to make units toggle run on/off can be annoyingOverall: 7 / 10Things I feel could help balance and make the game better.- Rather then catapults & Ballistas having 4 siege weapons per card.  It should be 1 per card.  So if you have 4 Giant Ballista's in your stacked force, rather then 16 Ballistas on the battlefield you will only have 4 (1 per card)- Peltasts accuracy/range/damage Nerfed.  Peltasts are as effective as archers and more deadly then Auxillary.- Some variation in tactics for the AI factions.  The tribes would have different tactics then lets say sparta.  Maybe tribal factions should try more ambush's and rely on a more ground//melee strategy with minor ranged support.  - Better battle strategy.  In previous titles enemy forces would move in close and you'd have a ranged exchange while infantry supported the ranged units.  I'd like to see more of that rather then infantry rushing in then being supported by their ranged units once the infantry clash begins- Fixed blood & Gore (more like Shogun 2) Rome 2 gore looks like a sloppy mess.

												Rome 2 is a fine continuation of the proud Total War series, but it could be so much more. It added new features that are very exciting to explore, like the new Line-of-Sight function, the province system, the internal politics, the army progression and other stuff, but a refinement of these points is necessary. That the internal politics is nearly just a mask of the realm divide, as there is no way of avoiding civil war through clever play (and the fact that you are better off just ♥♥♥♥ing with the system and getting it over with early) and that politics disappear after the single civil war, is just a shame. It could have been an extremely fascinating feature for the campaign play, which has always lacked after the battles in total war games. I have absolutely no idea why they did not add governors to the game, as they could both add to the politics and the new province system. Overall, the experience is quite fun, if you don't experience any of several game shattering bugs and that they are continuing to update the game should make for a very fine game in the end. I just hope they learn from this games' mistakes and improve upon the newly added features in their next game.			"

It isn't even in an alpha state. The graphics are also horrible, even on ultra. The god damn textures are so bad that it doesn't matter if I zoom in on the battlefield or out, I can never see anything because of the flickering mess. The trees doesn't even look like trees but just an orgy of ugly lines. The nine year old predecessor RTW 1 is 100x more pleasant to play and watch than this disgrace.The price was already very high and I can't even play it, no matter how hard I try.

												First of all I'll say I've only played 2 total war games, this one and shogun 2 so I'll mostly be comparing them. Quick overview for people who never played before, campaign is a large map with many settlements owned by many different factions which you must ally with or defeat to win. Gameplay is split into 2 parts, the turn based mod when you have the overview of every settlement and you can increase your armies/navies or build new buildings for you settlements. The other part is when there is a conflict between 2 opposing forces, you are given an arena of sorts like desert hills or plains or a city and you must defeat the other army, this is mostly done by killing enough of the opposing force that they run away. There isn't any base building or new units in the battle mode, only what you had when you attacked/got attacked.In comparison to shogun 2, the city defences are much more fun since the enemy can't just climb every wall and get inside they either have to burn the gates down or use siege units to break down/scale the walls. The graphics and UI feel a lot worse than shogun 2 and the AI has taken a noticeable dip as well. It has improved considerably since it was released but the patches have slowed down now so I expect it won't change much more and at this point I'd still say it's worse than shogun 2.7.5/10			"

												Very fun game, spent hundreds of hours on this. It does have many problems and aspects I miss from previous games. Firstly I believe i miss the family tree system from Shogun 2 and the diplomacy system feels weak.The engine used in this game doesnt allow for proper impacts and thus stats play a huge aspect and formations do not, recent updates have improved it ten-fold but still needs improvement. Feel the Mods help alot with these problems and work around them.I love the feel of the different factions and variation to Shogun 2, that is a major victory for this game. I do feel that by playing for so long you do pick up alot of minor things that you dislike however all in all i did spend over 850 hours so far on this game so feel despite everything it is a winning game and deserves some recognition for the effort the developers have put into updating its problems. Would have liked it polished at start but still i appreciate there continued effort.			"

If you havent bought this game, ya should... Or you should at least pick it up when it goes on a steam sale. Also when I first bought this game I had a subpar computer and have since upgraded. The Turn waits are way faster (idk how much of that is patching our the new I7 4770) and the battle much much larger (thanks to modding). So though it is still enjoyable on older systems, in my opinion if you have a decent rig this game is a must.			"

												at launch this game had some serious issues, it was one of the worst total war games available. now at patch 9.1 and with a healthy assortment of mods its been mostly ironed out. framerate was the biggest problem. fair warning this is a game that will run poorly on even the heftiest of machines. Very CPU limited and still no sli support.However i play at 2x normal unit sizes and have mostly stable fps as of now.There's a solid strategy game here. There are layers of customization at the campaign map that were missing in other total wars, and there is a real diversity of playstyles between the different cultures (my biggest complaint from shogun 2)overall, if you're willing to do a little work getting it optimized and modded to your liking its quite fun.

												Rome II is a game I wanted for years. I used to dream of it. The only problem is that the singleplayer can be a buggy piece of garbage and the multiplayer coop desyncs. The multiplayer battles can lag if someone you're playing again has a Pentium II and I actually have to pay £1.99 just to get some blood? The cinematic mode for battles is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.A great addiction to this game would of been clan based modes for competitive play.			"

												I am a huge Total War fan, from the original releases.  What I don't own of the total war games I still intend to purchase.  This game has great graphics and epic battles.  For those who feel AI or diplomacy etc are an issue, just download free Radious Total War Rome 2 mod, it's free and makes the game quite a bit more competitive with the proper balances.			"

												It's like original Rome Total War but 20% cooler. U can fight on the ground, u can fight on the sea, u can even fight when u go from the see to shore or DIRECTLY to enemy city. Cool-named legions, mighty roman gods, provinces with resources and more and more and more...			"

												Rome 2 is a great game, too bad that after a few months of having it, it decides too stop working. Totally worth the money and effort of buying the game only to get half-way through the Gaul campagin and for it to stop working.			"

												Very much enjoying Rome. As a strategy game it's excellent (though bear in mind I haven't played any of the other Total War games). Complex, exciting, graphically impressive and never patronising. I've also played it on a couple of different computers and it copes reasonably well on lower performance systems without sacrificing much of the experience. Additionally, as a Classicist, it's incredibly historically accurate! Not necessarily what you might look for in a game, but if you want a faithful and accurate depiction of Roman culture, society and history, you can't get much better than this in a game!Highly recommended.

												So you are sitting here, going 'hey, I feel like ruling the world today, but there is just far too much 'murica going around to do that....' So what do you do? You go out, you be a man, and you buy this game. In lazy terms here is my review of this game,HOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ BALLS THAT WAS THE MOST STRATEGIC FUN I HAVE EVER HAD EVER!!!! Okay, my spear infantry are holding the front line with a spear phalanx, as my peletasts throw javalens over their head, as steel clashes on shield from the enemy army, my archers are too busy shooting down elephants with flaming arrows to notice the charging platoon of mounted swordsman about to decapitate them, but no worries as my skirmishers send gigantic flamming balls of hay into their horse hides from the cover of hiltop trees. You want a brilliant strategic game set in medievil times that is historicaly correct, physically correct and bloody ♥♥♥♥ing graphicaly brilliant, well this is it. How far will you go for rome, mother ♥♥♥♥er. 9/10			"

												I like this game. I have stood by it since it release. This game is actually what got me into the rest of the total war series. The game still has bugs, but the modding community truly has done a great job at making the game what it should be. I was dissapointed by the Beast of War DLC greatly. It didn't hold up to what I expected from the developers. The other DLC really don't need to be bought either thanks to the modders. Overall the game needs modding to be good, but I would still recommend buying it. Lets all hope the developers make the game less buggy and release more DLC's that actually add things, instead of adding a unit or two to a few factions. Cough, cough Beast of War. Still though as long as your okay using the Steam workshop to mod, I would recommend the game.			"

												This game is just amazing, the ammount of things you have to pay attention to while building armies, expanding cities and conquering enemies to expant throughout Europe, is immense, as much as turn based games seem to get repetative and boring Rome 2 is nothing like it. There is nothing like spending a large amount of time moving your troops into a position and completely obliterate your opponent because you had the downhill advantage. Everything in this game is done with perfection and detail, if only I had the computer to run it on its highest setting... I highly recomend it to people who love strategic games and don't mind spending many hours into one gameplay.			"

												To be honest, Rome 2 was my first Total War Game, I've always been aware of it, but I've never gotten around to playing any of them. Then I saw this with all the pretty stuff and was like, ""Hey, maybe this wouldn't be a bad place to start!"" So I get the game in a sale and maaaan I just lost hours and hours to it. There were plenty of times where I was saying to myself, ""My god...this game is kind of broken."" But I personally didn't see any of the crazy stuff I've seen on other people's games, probably because I came in a few months after release. I've been enjoying it and at about 250 hours in I decide I want to play the other Total Wars because of how everyone says, ""The others are soooo much better."" What I'm saying is, the game was a nice expierence and it introduced me to a great series I can't wait to drown in, for now I have the original Rome Total War and I'm planning on losing even more hours to it~			"

												Highly playable if slightly flawed when launched, I have come to thouroughly enjoy the game. Having stuck with it through the numerous early patches a good balance of play has been achieved now, allowing for a mix of gritty battles in the mud and statesmanlike behaviour in the senate.			"

												I bought 2 copies of this game only so I could play co-op campaign with my brother.  However, I found out too late that since he has his game on a Mac and I have mine on a PC, we can't play because we have different game versions.  When you're at the game's main menu screen, you will see a number in the top right corner.  Our numbers are different, and therefore we can't connect in a multiplayer battle or campaign.This is advertised as multiplayer, and that might be true for the majority of players, but it doesn't work for Mac vs. PC multiplayer games.  Some more experienced Mac people might be able to do a workaround, but be warned.			"

												After waiting 2 years of optimization and a sale on the emperor edition, i finally bought Rome 2. I've been playing total war since Rome 1, i avoided Rome 2 because i anticipated the terrible release after the lukewarm beta leaks.I read a lot of people ranking Rome 1 , Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 above Rome 2 even after the Emperor edition.Those people are ragers completely stuck on the terrible Rome 2 release, and obsessed with Rome1/medieval 2 mods.Rome 1 and Medieval 2 engines are completely outdated and no amount of ""historical accuracy"", scripted mechanics that bloat the engine, or unit reskinning, can make up for core programming obsolescence.At the time of this review, Rome 2 is the best TW on the market. The map is beautiful, the combat works well, the UI is good, the new province mechanic is very smart...The graphics even on ultra are a bit disappointing but ENB mods will fix that.Buy it !			"

												The worst thing about this game is that it had the potential to be the best Total War in the series. As it is, it falls short. Ignoring that, however, it is a pretty decent game. Although there are only around 10 or so factions that you can play as, there are a huge amount of minor factions on the campaign map which adds a lot to the atmosphere and diversity of the game (as well as the time it takes for a turn to finish lel). This was a welcome addition in Empire and it is good that they have kept it in successive games rather than reverting to the swathes of ""rebel"" settlements that plagued Rome 1 and Medieval 2. Graphically, it is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ I personally think Shogun 2 looked better. I don't quite know what it is but there is something ""off"" in how it looks. Music is pretty decent, not as good as the first Rome's but it isn't bad. The campaign map does look delicous though.Now for things I don't like. Ship combat is severly ♥♥♥♥ed. Ramming a ship head on does basically the same damage as ramming it from the side, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This basically nullifies manouvering as AI ships just come straight at you and there is nothing you can do to curb the damage. I intensely dislike how they removed buildings outside of the main province centre. I loved how in Shogun 2 and Empire you could raid farms, mines, lumberyards and ports. I also don't particularly like the ""streamlined"" province management which has one big city and then several smaller villages. In theory it is great but it means cities like Syracuse, Rhodes, Sparta and Memphis are basically reduced to villages while large cities like Capua are completely ♥♥♥♥ing removed because they needed to put in some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little village that was on the coast. Too many rebellions. I have to dedicate far too much of my military resources to wiping out rebellions. There is also little reward for completely destroying a rebel army. You'd think that slaughtering an army to the last man would increase public order for a little while but no. It is also pretty inconsistent and nonsensical. My single worst province is Italia which has right from the start been a♥♥♥♥♥♥that is constantly having rebellions. Illyria on the other hand has been a model province and has been extremely happy with my rule. One might think that I was playing as a Barbarian faction but no, I am playing as Rome. All in all, it is a decent game. Patches are still coming out fairly regularly although besides the public order issues (none of which the AI suffers from of course) and the ship damage few of the annoying issues can be fixed.  7/10.>Italians>White			"

												I quite enjoy the game, there are some improvements and nice additions from Rome 1 but also a few mis-steps. The sheer amount of paid DLC is frustrating to say the least, especially as some of it was clearly seen in pre-release trailers. Also the fact blood and gore is a paid add-on instead of just a button you can toggle on and off is absolutely ridiculous. But as you can see from my time played it is still and enjoyable game and recommened especially if you can get a bundle on sale. A must for any lover or Rome 1 or Roman history.			"

Now it's a very good game.You can play hours in solo without boring feeling. By the way mods can destroy that feeling of boredom if it were to occur.Pros :+ Awesome solo with more than 200 provinces to conquer+ Unlike Shogun 2 the game integrates cultur. Germanic tribes don't have same units, buildings, tech and graphisms than roman, carthagenese, arabs, gallic, ....+ Mods offer a lot of new units for improve the diversity of armies, new system of diplomacy, new graphics, ...+ You can play the campign with one friend which is awesomeCons :- The IA is still quite stupid (but some mods change that)- No family tree like in Shogun 2 or Attila which is a real problem for me "

I currently have 630+ hours on record for the game which was only due to the hard-work of the modding community. Although it can be a fun and interesting game at first, after a while you soon realise that the decent graphics and voice-acting of Mark Strong and Brian Blessed can't make this game anymore than what it is... a Kinder Surprise with the toy removed. The betrayals that happen ingame is nothing compared to Creative Assembly's betrayal of long-time, hardcore Total War fans..			"

												Being a long time fan of Rome: Total War, I went into this game expecting a great experience. After a sorry start Creative Arts has really made a game that, in my opinion, is the best stratgy game I have ever played. You really can get emotionally involved. For example, when an experienced general, whom you have put alot of effort into dies, you can't help but cry a little. You really feel like you are living and dieing with your men and you want them to survive. The graphics are fantastic too, both on the battlefield and on the map. Agents can do alot more and the diplomacy options are simple to use but at the same time very complex in the sense that you have several ways to subdue your enemies and allies. The economic system is great too. You have to balance your military buildings with your economic and you need to ensure that you have enough food for your population and growing armies. As far as unit balance goes it may need a few tweaks but overall you don't feel like your being treated unfairly. All in all a great game. 10/10.			"

												After all of these patches Rome II is finally a must have game for any of you who love ancient warfare,historical atmoshpere(even though there are some wrong historical facts) and generally the  Total War series! P.S consider before you spend 15euros for the dlcs. Better wait for sales.			"

												quite lower graphic than shogun 2 , but the gameplay is cool. The campaign map is beautiful. Updated AI is very very intelligent. When you siege enemy's port, you can send your army from ship to walk into the city and occupy. I think if you are strategic fans, you shouldn't miss Total War : ROME II			"

												Very fun game, spent hundreds of hours on this. It does have many problems and aspects I miss from previous games. Firstly I believe i miss the family tree system from Shogun 2 and the diplomacy system feels weak.The engine used in this game doesnt allow for proper impacts and thus stats play a huge aspect and formations do not, recent updates have improved it ten-fold but still needs improvement. Feel the Mods help alot with these problems and work around them.I love the feel of the different factions and variation to Shogun 2, that is a major victory for this game. I do feel that by playing for so long you do pick up alot of minor things that you dislike however all in all i did spend over 850 hours so far on this game so feel despite everything it is a winning game and deserves some recognition for the effort the developers have put into updating its problems. Would have liked it polished at start but still i appreciate there continued effort.			"

												I played Rome: Total War, Medieval 2: Total War, Empire: Total War and a bit of Shogun. But I have to say that this one is the best right after the original Rome: Total War.Here is why:The old Rome was a genius blast with an atmosphere drowning you deep into the anctient world. I played a hundred of hours, different factions, different approaches..Of course, with the great plus of nostalgica i prefer the old Rome. But!This game is also a very enjoyable piece of work. I play the game with the radious mod, which gives more detail to the armies and the campaign itself.The variety and deep of the game without letting you getting confused is what i appreciate most. Or watching your little soldier fight to death. Pros:- Very detailled (not only modded)- Awesome fights- Need tactics on the campaign map and in fights- light diplomacy- A lot of modsCons:- Maybe not deep enough for some people. I love these kind of games because you can do much more stuff than just fight. I recommend this game to everyone who wants a strategy game that does not goes ""too"" deep into it, leaving enough room for some bloody action.			"

This by far is still better then attila. There are some problems that mods have fixed but should no have needed to like the amount of darn ai agents that they spam aand how ur agents can suck. but over all this  still a great game			"

												Rome 2 was a horrible game when it released. It was full of game breaking bugs such as dead AI, turns taking more than 5 minutes to complete, huge FPS drops from doing something simple like clicking on a city and so many more. Now that it has received almost 20 patches and is finally fixed it is no longer one of the worst games ever released - it is merely the worst Total War game ever released.What I like: The graphicsWhat I dislike: Literally everything else. The ""politics system"" is neither politics nor a system, it's a broken idea that doesn't do anything. You can go through an entire game without ever opening the politics tab and you won't notice. The music is bland and boring and doesn't bring the game to life like in Rome 1, Medieval 2 or Shogun 2. No family tree, making important people within your empire faceless, nameless and pointless. Generals and important people in your realm are non-entities. In previous Total War games losing a beloved faction leader or general could break your heart. In Rome 2 there are no beloved faction leaders or generals and when you do lose one they are instantly replaced by some other faceless non-entity.The list of things this game got wrong is almost endless. I find it impossible to become immersed in its setting, I feel nothing when playing it. I've tried very hard to like it as I spent £34.99 on it and have been a fan of Total War since the days of Medieval 1, but I simply can't. It is truly horrible. "

												I loved total war shogun 2 so i decided to pick this game up on sale and have enjoyed it.  While most of the game is ok I do have a few major complaints.  First off is how long it takes to transistion between turns due to ai moves this is most notable in the beggining of a campaign due to the sheer number of factions.  Secondly armies seem to take forever to move compared to shogun 2 (number of turns not actual animation speed which can be sped up).  Third it does seem like there is a bit of imbalance in terms of a small number of heavy units being able to route much larger armies.  The province system also feels a little cluncky compared with land management in shogun 2.  My last issue is that sea combat feels like it was a last minute addition when compared with the amazing feel of land combat.  A little thing that felt wrong was the lack of you generals opening cinematic speech.  If you are new to the series go play shogun 2 it is an amazing game which this is not the only thing i thought was better was that each faction has its own units other than that shogun 2 wins on almost every count.  I would only suggest picking this up on sale and after you have played shogun 2 to the point that if you ever see an army of naginata samurai and archers again youll go screaming through town in your underwear.

												If this was the first total war game in existence i might have recomended this game.Why you shouldnt buy this game- Poor AI.- Poor graphic optimization.- Poor modability.- Stripped down City building.- Stripped down combat, and tactical control over units(ability to group and decide formations)- They decided to implement a combat style that revolves around control points when assaulting cities which if implemented correctly could have been good.- Poor naval combat.- Poor balance of units.- DLC all over the place with units and features that should have been on release.Why you might consider getting this game, if your a total war addict just like me and loved rome1.- Mods can provide an refreshing experience even though its a harder game to mod than rome 1 or even medieval 2.- Even though naval combat is poorly implemented with mods you might achieve a good degree of fun.The vanilla experience of this game is terrible, even the multiplayer is bad in this game compared to the previous titles.In my opinion if your looking for a good and modern total war game to play go ahead and buy shogun2, but if you really are looking for a rome 2 id suggest going for mods of rome 1 they outshine Rome 2 by miles.And notice the date of this review they still havent fixed or improved the game to the point of being good for release.

												Happy to see most of the pathing fixed over that last few months with the apparent exception being the seige equipment, whom must be handled carefully lest they become mutinous and ignore all command and reason. Still very pleased with the provincial system of Rome 2. The recent update has only made things better. Now it's much easier for your nation to avoid devolving into a riotous mass without a temple in every city and town.Only other complains are related to the way some territory lines are draw, such as a town holding ownership over a small stretch of road on the far side of a dense forest; the ability for computer players have their sailors stop an enemy ship in the ramming animation, only to board it killing all on board;  and finally, the ability for pikemen to materialize their massive spears and force push heavy infantry back to the far end of the spear whilst being stabbed in the chestAs a side note, the glitch where sailors will return to their ship after boarding, by jumping clear over a third ship that has rammed its way inbetween is amazing. Their bionic legs are truely a sight to behold. Thank you for this and thank you for continued support for this game.			"

												Summation-AI-Graphics-Variation-Campaign Map-UI-Gameplayif you want gameplay get shogun 2 or medieval 2 or an old Total War and mod it.if you want the era get rome 1 and for graphics mod it.if you want graphics get shogun 2.Rome 2 does nothing better, it is a horrible blend of all the total wars with 'streamlined' elements.Rome 2 Total War failed to enchant me in the same way any other total war game has done.I have 91 hours on record which is low compared to other total war games. Rome 2 offers nothing which other total war games and even mods dont do better. The main issue is, undoubtedly, the AI - it is so incompetent and just downright stupid the entire game becomes a grind with no challenges ever raised other than the question of if your rig can handle the huge amounts of rabble the AI insists upon fielding. The armies it composes while no longer 90% slingers are terrible. Every army, no matter the faction, is composed almost 60% of skirmishers, 30% of the lowest tier of spearmen and then 10% other units are usually artillery with amybe one or two units of cavalry and all the AI generals are infantry which is the worst general type until possibly late game because it is your only access to high tier shock cavalry.Now an army of skirmishers isn't always terrible it can be used effectively but the AI doesn't do so. It sends its skirmishers unsupported towards you to try to barrage you but unless you are afk then it just lets you charge them with your cavalry or even heavy infantry. From there the rest of its units will engage the meat grinder and you ar invited to rear charge them as you meet no opposition in doing so, the only unit you may have trouble with the the one oathsworn general which can be annoying to break. Every battle goes like this.I said the graphics were a negative, which i'm sure many people will be surprised at. They are not bad persay however they are also not even in the same league as Shogun 2 and i prefer Napoleon's graphics over this. The main reason is everyone looks smudged, even on max with unlimited texture memory and whats more it looked better in the demos they previewed. I appreciate there is a lot more work to due because there are a lot more factions but they are not as phenomenal as was promised and they are very lackluster compared to Shogun 2. Not only are they worse technically the unit cards are awful, they are some of the ugliest artwork i have seen in a long time.Not only are the graphics worse than Shogun 2 the sound design is no where near as good, the music is worse than rome 1 and the combat sounds do nothing to inspire.The game is clunky at best - the UI, in attempts to streamline it, has been made into an inefficent mess which is painful to use. The 'tactical map' is pointless and serves no purpose - the minimap is just as good and the maps are still so small that you can see everything anyway. You cannot view routing enemy units with any form of map which is infuriating since it is more imnportant than ever to kill every last man in the unit because of huge replenishment rates. There is no fire at will option for units with pila removing any utility they had and making counter charging mandatory which just results in both armies clashing in the middle haphazardly.Ships are so unresponsive - you try to turn, ram or board and they bob slowly before spontaneously combusting because or everyone leaping off because no observable structual damage had occured. The AI boards you even if you tap them and if you attempt to ram them then you better instantly kill them else they're going to board you. Naval battles may as well be removed and thanks to quick march i found myself never even making boats especially due to the inordiante upkeep costs and everyones pocket inflatable massive ships which are larger than dedicated boats and far more efficient for crossing any body of water you need to because the 'fast rowing' allows you to traverse the entire medditerainian in 3 turns.The building system has been made into a joke. You no longer have any reason to upgrade past tier 2 buildings since the benifits do not outweight the negatives in most cases and money is not even a factor. I was earing well over 25k after <50 turns and while the 'economic victory' demands 80k/turn you really stop caring at around 25k and frankly i stopped even bothering to look at what my cities were doing which is a huge shame since for me 1/2 the fun of total war was the strategic element perviously i loathed automanage but now in Rome 2 i pine for its return although i have no doubt it would be completely useless.A problem i have had with not only Rome 2 but other recent total wars with this is the limitations on how many buildings you can make in each city. It does not add any strategic element, you do not have to carefully consider where you need to place your buildings and have no reason to build anything other than markets everywhere because it isn't worth a slot to make a barracks near the frontlines especially in Rome 2 where they are shifting so fast it is pointless to try.However the shifting battle lines isn't due to any AI actions or surprise attacks, the battle lines shift in one direction: towards your enemy. Every turn i conqure 2/3 cities, and this isn't even after 80 turns or so, because the AI not only poseses no threat but the replenishment system is absurd. Any losses i suffer from a battle are instantly replenished because with only 25 food i have +40% replenishemnt and while that not only breaks gameplay it makes no sense, where do i find elite praetorians or spartan heroes in the middle of britain?Although there isnt much differnce between any of the factions so it doesn't surprise me. The one thing Rome 2 could have had over Shogun 2 was faction variation but the variation that there is is pitiable - Every faction which uses swords also has pila even the greeks have pila and they all function in the exact same way. The differnce, other than asthetic, between the gauls and romans is that the galic units are just worse variations for the same cost. The all serve the same purpose and function in the same way. The greeks are the same only use spears instead of swords and forgo their pila. Mobility and utility are all gone you have three unit types: ranged, heavy infantry and cavalry.The politics system is laughable i honestly dont even know how it works and it seems to do nothing at all. It serves as a medium for the other AI houses, of which there may be no members, to randomly assassinate your generals. Though not that it matters since they can be conjured for free anywhere and none of their traits do anything meaningful. The final nail in the coffin to me, and a huge slap in the fact to Total War's great modding community, is the current DLC practices. This has to be mentioned and it does matter, it is not a matter of dont want it dont buy it, it directly effects the game and in a negative way. Faction packs are an outright insult to modders. Charging for content present is unacceptable and should be punished. I don't blame CA for this i blame SEGA and as a side note i would abvocate avoiding any SEGA game of recent date CoH2 and now this have made me lose any faith i may have misplaced in SEGA.And god damn it people stop praising them to high heaven for patching the damned thing! We are entitled to a working product and they are obliged to patch it! It is not some great act of charity!The worst total war for a long time. It pushes no boundries which at least emprie tried to, its graphics are worse than shogun 2's as is the sound design, it has terrible AI and gameplay which somehow modders seem more capable of creating, the campaign map is so simple and mundane it becomes a chore, and it has horrendously prolonged campaign victory conditions.(nobody read this did they :( oh well im typing it while mining and i dont blame you)			"

This is second in my list (Behind Medieval total war).  Im going to break this review into four parts: Battle, Campaign, Graphics, and Overview.Overview:Rome 2 total war is an amazing game. It's loads of fun that will keep you glued to your screen for hours. If you get it though, get it on sale. Because $60 is too much for a two year old game. Plus, you NEED the greek states pack to fully enjoy this game. That add Athens, Sparta, And Lipidus* (*Really bad seplling, soz). And that eads me onto my next point, beware of the DLC. They nickle anddime you to death.  Like, they have a tab on the main meu dedicated to dlc you havent bought yet. And on the campaign tab, they have all of there DlC Campigns listed with the grand campaign to remind you to buy ore DLC! (as if the game isn't already expensive) But get over that, its an amazing game.Battle:Battles are a lot of fun. If you do a custom battle, you can select any map, by simply clicking somewhere on a map of the entire campign map (basically, there is hundreds of maps) There are bunchs of factions to choose from, adding to the customizaable aspect of custom battles. The unit cards are creative, they aren't scrrenshots of the unit, they are cards made to look like art from that time. The UI is easy to get used to, and very helpful.  As usual, the battles are very stratigic, and fun to watch you legionares slay barbarians in droves. Dont let the odds fool you. Ive won battes Ive should have lost many a time, and im terrible at battles! Naval battle are the best. I actually enjoy them. They are short, lasting 2 - 5 minutes on average. I could go on and on, but in short, battles are amazing an work really well.Campaign:The Campaign map looks great. It actually feels like you are looking over the world. The campign is fun, but takes some getting used to. the UI is very confusing, but once you figure it out, it flows well. Diplomacy is strange, like I'll be Rome, and a tiny facton wont want to do a non agressive pact. but once you bribe them with money, they comply. Wars work well, with new stances making it more stratigic then past total wars. Its hard to conquer other nations, but ROme wasn't built in a day!Graphics:Very Very taxing. the reccomended specs are lies. i can hardly run this on high, much less very high, ultra, and extreme, and i have a very decent laptop. but, the game looks amazing. That's all i can say. It looks amazing.Rome 2 has its flaws, but they are few and is a very good game and comes highly reccomended.			"

												Despite all the negative reviews and comments this game has had I think its a great game. The graphics are good and the campaign is gripping and exciting, most of the time. I think the difficulty levels are a bit skrewed up though, it could just be me. There are a few negatives, the load times are a bit too long, the splitting up etc of troops is also a bit wrong, the unit cards are also a down grade, but despite that I think its still a good game and no other game offers this kind of gameplay yet.

												Being a long time fan of Rome: Total War, I went into this game expecting a great experience. After a sorry start Creative Arts has really made a game that, in my opinion, is the best stratgy game I have ever played. You really can get emotionally involved. For example, when an experienced general, whom you have put alot of effort into dies, you can't help but cry a little. You really feel like you are living and dieing with your men and you want them to survive. The graphics are fantastic too, both on the battlefield and on the map. Agents can do alot more and the diplomacy options are simple to use but at the same time very complex in the sense that you have several ways to subdue your enemies and allies. The economic system is great too. You have to balance your military buildings with your economic and you need to ensure that you have enough food for your population and growing armies. As far as unit balance goes it may need a few tweaks but overall you don't feel like your being treated unfairly. All in all a great game. 10/10.			"

												Completeing caesar in gaul on legendary with mods is the only reason i give positive.Still a disgrace that no proper Anti aliasing was ever included. Horrid jagged edges on max settings (Shogun 2 looks sharper). Patch 17 after a year makes this an enjoyable enough total war with mods.The whole civil war, events, senate influence, generals upgrades feels defunct --> Buy Attila.Solution: ""Goggle"" : reshade 1.10 with SweetFX 2.0 (Amazing AA sharpness)Solution: ""Steam Workshop"" : Radious mods (fixes alot ingame)			"

												An absolutely amazing addition to the Total War franchise, Rome II goes to greater lengths to immerse you not only in the history but also in your factions progression. The ability to name your armies/ fleets and have them gain fame and notoriety in the world really stood out for me. It's one of those mechanics where you easily become emotionally attached to your armies and are able to craft destinies for each one.I'd definitely recommend buying this game.			"

												The game has very similar mechanics to any other total war accept its different enough to have its own title, the campaign map is easy to control and the battle mechanics are astounding. I have issues in the past on different computers of it not running properly and have spent over £700 on a gaming computer to play games like this but for anyone who had a relatively old computer, or bad graphics card or processor, it WONT RUN NICELY... itll be slow, clunky and simply no fun to play. Also the DLC costs way to much, some DLC's being £6 and others beign £10. It also, for me, experienced lag spikes at rare occations but enough to be noticed.LOOKS AND FEELS AMAZINGIF YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTERWAY TO MANY DLC'S THAT AMMOUNT TO WAY TO MUCH MONEYWONT RUN HOW YOU WANT IT ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PROPER GAMING PC			"

												After playing this game for over 350 hours from the very beginning, I'd thought I'd give my personal views on the game. As I'm sure many of you are aware, the release for this game was by far the worst of any CA games with poor AI (especially with the capture the flag mode in particular), crash issues and a generally poor game performance. I've stuck through it though due to my experiences with previous titles like Shogun and Medieval, and the perseverance on my part has been rewarded, sure there have been high and low moments like the excitement with the release of the campaigns and the disappointment of the Animals and the Women of Mars DLC, but the version you will be buying is a great leap from what this game was in the beginning, but note it isn't perfect as the AI still needs some tinkering, especially in regards to siege battles, but it is a very playable and fun experience.Overall- Pros: 1. Without DLC the variety of cultures has a good diversity from the Iceni in Britain to the Parthians in the Middle East2. The Emperor version and it's revamped Political and Civil War systems allows better immersion into the game3. With a very active modding community on steam workshop, you can find even more things to play and have fun withCons: 1. Despite the vast ammount of work put into fixing it, the AI in battles and campaign can be problematic2. A large ammount of very interseting nations such as Sparta and Thracians are restricted as DLC, as such some of the more interesting factions are out of bounds for those who are either anti-DLC or incapable of purchesing them.Personal Score: a decent 7/10			"

												Another great addition to my favorite game series. Although it did start with a rocky start. This game doesn't live up to the full potential of the original Rome game or even Shogun 2, but it is still a good game. I would still recommend it due to the upped mechanics like more units and such. The city expansion they added is a nice feature that I have yet to fully enjoy due to my lack of playing the game.Graphics: 8 - Looked horrible at first, but fixed after later patchesSound: 9 - Very good soundGameplay: 8.5/9 - Good gameplay, was fixed with patchesStory: 9 - You can create your version of Rome!

I didnt have a problem, another problem is people said that its to easy even on the hardest difficulty. But i cant even understand that, cause its plenty hard, and ive beaten most of the total wars on harder difficulties.Not saying its not possible, just saying it wasnt a cake walk as they claimed			"

												Best Total War game yet.  Still has some AI combat pathing and command issues (I don't think they have changed this too much over the series), but they combined the best parts of the more recent Shogun game, improving city development, introducing provinces, and adding a technology tree.  If you liked Rome I, or any of the others in this series, this game is for you!  If you are new the series, this is the best place to start.GG  I give it 8.5/10			"

												DJ's two-penneth and first impressions for those interested in the Total War franchise.  If you're not interested, then why'd you click it? The AI does seem a little oblivious to the world around it.  I'm not convinced by the battle speed, as I find I keep pausing  more than I ever used to in previous TW editions simply to issue orders and keep up with the dim AI.  I do get a sense of my gang's bigger than yours is the AI method and that's it.However, more positives than negatives for me - excluding launcher/fps issues.So far I quite like the emphasis put on the agents this time around.  I'm used to the spies to see the 4 corners, but I've literally only just learnt that you really do need them, as my campaign is about to crumble.  I have in the dying throes of my campaign now generated a truly mental water-poisoner to soften up a garrison before your seige (93% chance of success!) and a strong champion attached to your general enhances the melee ratings of your army etc.  Not sure about the diplomat yet, I think I needed her for 'religious conversion' as with medieval?  Next time I will be more prepared.I like the effort CA put into city growth/food/public order.  Steep learning curve, but actually it all makes sense once you realise it has a wealth of 'tooltips' to break up the bar graphs.Diplomacy seems harder, i've negotiated trade routes and within the next few turns almost the entire world has declared war on me within 15 turns of starting as Egypt.  Must learn about that... doesn't seem quite right to declare war on someone you've never met or live near.  My enemy (1) was not their ally/soverign state or anything.I like the enhanced graphics with some tweaking - the  'prettyness' of the heat haze over the pyramids for example, the fauna and flora is quite relaxing whilst campaigning.The campaign turns are taking a good 10m as there's plenty to do (and the fps type glitches slow matters) that seems compulsory this time around.  Not sure about the political part yet as yet to play as Rome.  Promotions of your family memebers does what exactly?Overall lots to learn and strategy techniques to refine regards the city/empire building which will keep me playing.  Battles are battles and the essence of TW, i'm hoping the topography will be more impactful this time around when I reach europe.  Only done a few sieges/defences and meh, but i'm hoping that's because I haven't the level ups yet for epic seiges.Armies walk on water into navies I don't like, and the reinforcement range seems to big to me.  Three auto-resolve battles between the same two opposing armies in a single turn is meh... one of you just die off will you!  Likewise the new 'tactics' option seems mute.  Stances for armies/navies is new, raid/ambush/tab march, but means an endless cycle of remembering to change it when you right click and nothing happens because you put it in a 'stance' last turn.Oh yeah, the [insert] battle cam is awesome.  I really like that, very immersive and for the one liners it's fantastic.  The audio actor/actress scripting is top notch for the game.  Multiple accent attempts too!Well played CA, there's enough refreshment to keep me amused and away from Napoleon & Empire for some time to come.			"

												Rome 2 total war is a fun game. It suffers from some poor AI choices, in terms of building in settlements and battle movements. (even on harder difficulties) I was sadden to see the multilayer go back to the old style, rather then keeping the Avatar campaign that shogun2 featured. All in all it is a game that you should get when it is on sale like now for only 15$ US. The DLC offer new units and a couple fun and interesting campaigns. Again something i would buy on sale, although they are fun, the content is not worth what they want full price.  Enjoy.... if you like it pre-purchace Attila as it is the same engine.  "

												So much hatred for a pretty good game... Well, the whole thing begins with lots of bugs, but as patches were out they fixed many of them. It's a decent ""Total War"" game with much better graphics, but less freedom. What I really disliked was that there are no world events, though this feature was already out from ""Empire: Total War"". AI diplomacy is too weak, for more factions to make up for the extremely challenging Mongols and Timurids in ""Medieval 2"". It makes you feel that history is too generic and does not touch you. Battles and tactics are once again outstanding, and I really liked the idea of joint land and naval battles. It even features an impressive soundtrack, even though many have reviled it. It is a bit unfair to give such a superb strategy game a dismal 4.0 out of 10, just because it does not meet some pretty high expectations. After all, it's much superior to ""Rome: Total War"" to begin with. I wanna give it 8.0 form10.0			"

												This game has recieved so much negative feedback, i cant say it doesent deserve it though. When Rome 2 was first released it was an absoulte mess AI was absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed and the graphics performance was pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Dont get me wrong though the game was still fun, but the plethora of bugs and glitches made it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥sometimes. Rome 2 has recieved alot of patches since then and for the most part its been fixed, the ai is no more stupid than any other total war game. To really get the full total war experience though; i recommend you install a few mods first as they vastly improve the game.Divide et Impera is one the best mods currently out there, along with the improved roman formation mod.I also hear that the Rome:total realism team is working on a mod for rome 2 so theres still alot of hope for this game.The base game is decent, Its good. But please dont spend 60 dollars on it. Wait for a sale unless your a die hard total war fan.All in all i do recommend this game, just not at the price its at.PS: DONT BUY THE DUMBASS DLC ITS RIDICULOUS! CA EXPECTS US TO PAY FOR CUT CONTENT... NO! JUST NO!			"

												This game is just amazing, the ammount of things you have to pay attention to while building armies, expanding cities and conquering enemies to expant throughout Europe, is immense, as much as turn based games seem to get repetative and boring Rome 2 is nothing like it. There is nothing like spending a large amount of time moving your troops into a position and completely obliterate your opponent because you had the downhill advantage. Everything in this game is done with perfection and detail, if only I had the computer to run it on its highest setting... I highly recomend it to people who love strategic games and don't mind spending many hours into one gameplay.			"

The game has some bad AI (in the fix...) and is still buggy. After patches and patches of the game, it's stable enough to now play. I recommend using mods like Radius or other mods of your choosing.

												I`m a big fan of all the Total War series games. Thought the years i have completed all of them more then once. There is a massive improvement over previous Total War games in ROME 2, however i don`t like the limited number of armies which a player can support. They are not sufficient to defend your empire and expand later in the game, especially on higher difficulty. Also it loses some of the epicness. There should be more armies available instead of relying primarily on local town militia to defend the cities from rebellions and incursions. Shogun 2 total war remains a better game for me only because of this.			"

												 Personally, I believe the game is now stable enough to buy, play, and enjoy...to a extent.Good:-Some degree of difficulty when set on hard, most surrounding nations will make things hard by declaring, although a little annoying but some can be sensable.-AI wont rush directly at you at the start, they'll usually start forming their units or wait for reinforcements THEN charge in semi-organised mass at you-Province system is pretty decent-Defensive Alliances, military alliances, trade agreements, and non agression pacts make this game's diplomacy more fun and sensable.-Cool combined naval and ground attacks-Campaighn map is relatively lag free ( That I've noticed, can't say the same for battle map )-Great maps, beauitiful city layout, plains layouts, and anyother map looks really good.-A lot of different factions with different units unique to them-A fog of war, forcing you to have to go meet the other factions-Decent sized map with a lot of cities-Large armies-Active and great modding community to fix some of the things wronfg with the game (Such as morale, battle AI, etc. )BAD:-Siege AI stands outside walls or on beaches and takes javelin fire very rarely retaliating.(This seems to only happen on certain maps for me, Like on Karalis they will stand around and do nothing, yet in Roma they seem to be unstoppable.)-Morale for professionable units is kind of annoyingly low, even if they are winning they will still rout.-Battle map lag, makes directly commanding battles annoying-Auto resolve does not account for fortifications when doing auto resolve on sieges, so if you have a weak force in a city with great fortifications, you have to fight it out.-Political system is useless, I was hoping to have to juggle the Senate and actively try to find their approval and engage in politics, you really don't need to bother with the Senate.-AI doesn't seem to pursue diplomacy logically. Like if you have Carthage devastated and you are about to take the last city, but want peace so you can use a Legion elsewhere, they will most likely refuse.Overall, I rate the game a seven. Not as great as Medieval 2 in my opinion, but stable enough to buy for 20-30$. You still might wanna wait for a sale, but it isn't as much of a waist if you but it for full price. Ny suggestion, go watch a few recent Lets Play's and make your final descion on that. "

Personally I hated the Shogun game, it really comes down to OPINION. Rome II is awesome, looks awesome, and there may have been bugs at the start (apparently, though I didn't experience any), but the game runs fine. If it's lagging or not working right, you probably don't have a good enough computer, it's really simple. So, my overall review of the game is - get it, it's awesome! If you liked the first Rome, or Medieval, or Napoleon, I'd expect you to like this game, but then again I'm just one person saying I really liked it. Don't just listen to my opinion, but don't let the popular trend of joining the bandwagon and hating a game just for the sake of hating it to be ""cool"" dissuade you from considering a game either.

Better graphics, new mechanics, AI, factions, realism, more immersive gameplay, diplomacy etc. with which to build an empire!Although a bit of a letdown when it first released because of a hasty release with bugs and such, pretty much all issues have been fixed or are being worked upon, ensuring a gameplay experience without any technical problems.Personally I'd prefer the diplomacy options to be a bit more refined, especially the way allies and vassals behave and can be controlled or asked for help.Quite some content is additionally available as (unfortunately payable) DLC's, but quite some Free-LC's have been available as well,adding new content.A bit overpriced, especially if you get all the DLC's, personally I'd suggest to just stay with the vanilla version +fixes and Free-LC's, they are more than enough to grant hours of gaming fun, as well as battles and campaigns that are never the same.

												This game is amazing. I can't say what are the problems with it, apart from some balancing at the multiplayer battles. Everything else is PERFECT!!  Sure the game had its flaws, but they were completely overwhelmed by the good work that C.A done, and all of their careness with the community. Now with the Emperor Edition, it is even more safe to say that Total War: Rome 2 is one of the best strategy games ever made.			"

												Total war: Rome II started out in rough condition, but after a year of solid patching culminating into the Rome II: Emperor Edition it has become one of my favorite games ever. If you are new to Total War, Rome II is a massive scope historical strategy game centered around the birth of the Roman Empire starting at 272 BC. At this time, there are massive amounts of cultures and conflicts with different people vying for power and for survival. Even Rome starts the game with humble amounts of land and power. It will be up to you to recreate the glory of the empire OR extinguish the dream of power for the Romans and have your own people dominate the world.Rome II has a massive amount of factions (around 120) with 32 being playable! not only are there so many factions, but there is considerable diversity between factions, especially between different cultures. Greek factions (including Sparta and Athens) boast powerful hoplites, spear infantry with very heavy armor who have the ability to form a hoplites wall which boosts there defensive capabilities significantly. Rome has it's famous legionairies who can form testudo formation where they lock their shields in a dense formation making them resistant to incoming archer fire. Eastern factions field powerful cavalry such as heavy armored cataphracts who devastate anything on the charge. Nomadic factions have entirely horse armies fielding mostly a giant horde of horse archers showing their preferred way of combat. There are so many unique units and armies to face depending on where in the world you are fighting.The campaign map is extremely large which is pretty typical for Total War games and has a ""province"" system where there can be anywhere from 2 - 4 cities within a province. There are many types of buildings  each colored coated ranging from city center(orange), military(red), industrial(brown), agriculture(green), sanitation(cyan), ports/docks(blue), temples(purple), and city commons(yellow). City center buildings are the main building and is present in every single city but can be upgraded to provide various bonuses (including more resources if that region has a strategic resource). Military provides the ability to recruit powerful units into your armies and provide garrison soldiers if the city is attached. Industrial provides mostly large amounts of wealth at the costs of food and public order. Agricultural building provide mostly food (in which your empire and armies would starve without) with a bit of wealth. Sanitation provides public order, some wealth, some culture, and many of bonuses depending on the faction. Ports are only available if the city is a port but can be branched to form military ports where you can train powerful fleets or trading ports where you can make more money. Temples are largely used for improving culture (culture problems can lead to large public order problems) and flat out public order bonuses at the cost of food. City commons are highly branched ranging from libraries (improving reseach time), gladiator games, wine traders, slave markets, and many more.The battles in total war are the hallmark of the game. Battles are massive in scale and provide a large range of tactics to defeat your enemy. Your armies are divided into units, comprising of 80-160 soldiers in a unit (depending on the unit size selection). You can have 20 units in an armies and up to four armies can be present for both the attacher and defender each. Do the math and you can see battles with over 10,000 individual units that you can zoom in and look at fighting for their lives. After the fighting occurs you can see the carnage wrought by your generals or your enemies as thousands lay dead. Truly awe inspiring and glorious. As far as tactics, there are stratagems available on both the grand campaign map and the battle maps. On the campaign map, you can move your armies into various stances such as raiding, defensive (where the army forms a fort), ambush stance (where you can make your army invisible to other forces and can ambush them if they fail to detect you), and forced marched which allows armies to move twice the distance BUT are guarenteed to be ambushed if caught in this stance! There are also bridges, forests, mountains, rivers, and other choke points on the grand campaign map that you can use to give yourself an advantage. On the battle map, there are large differences in terrain including dense forest, hillls, desert, rivers, bridges, and snow to utilize to help your armies achieve victory. Bridge can hold off massive amounts of troops using only 1 unit, forests can hide units allowing you spring quick ambushes, hills provide bonuses to those at a higher elevation and also you can hide units behind a hill if the enemy does not have line of sight. Snow and rain make units tire faster and have trouble recovering, fog makes ranged units' accuracy lower, etc. You can always use the terrain to your advantage!In summary, this game has incredible replay falue fielding so many factions where most are very diverse in terms of units, buildings, culture, events, and starting location. The province system forces you to spread your own culture, take strategic resources, and specialize/synergize your cities into maximizing your economy. The campaign map is highly detailed with many terrain factions to use when facing enemies. The battles are unrivaled and are extremely addicting fielding thousands of soldiers. Excellent DLC content with other campaign maps.As for negatives, there are no faction intro videos like other total war games. The game had a bad release due to various bugs and glitches and blatant oversights (though almost everything is fixed in my opinon). End game is too easy even on the highest difficulties. Lots of DLC that is enjoyable but you have to pay extra money for.			"

												If You've Ever Wondered, What Is The Very Worst Video Game Ever Created??? Well... ""Rome II"" is worst than  ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial""....what does is ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestria""????? (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial cartridges, considered by some the worst video game ever made and blamed for contributing to the downfall of the video game industry in the 1980s.Some gamers had speculated that thousands or even millions of the unwanted cartridges made by Atari were buried in a landfill in Alamogordo, about 200 miles southeast of Albuquerque.The game was a design and marketing failure after it was rushed out to coincide with the release of Steven Spielberg’s 1982 hit movie, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and it contributed to a collapse of the video game industry in its early years.Atari is believed to have been saddled with most of the 5 million E.T. game cartridges produced. According to New York Times reports at the time, the manufacturer buried the games in the New Mexico desert in the middle of the night.)believe me Rome 2 is worst than this			"

												I've noticed something about these reviews after having bought the game that I did not notice earlier. Nobody has ever taken it upon themselves to try playing with a friend and then reviewing the multiplayer. When playing this game with a friend it can seem totally different than playing alone. Imagine, for instance, you are the Spartans and your friend is Athens. You and your friend push through Epirus on your way to Macedonia. You could have weeks of fun with your friend trying to take the different cities and towns. I have only been playing for a few days with my friend and have already fallen in love with the multiplayer. I think this game is totally worth the bugs and graphical issues if you are playing with a friend.			"

												EDIT: I initially wrote this review two months after Rome 2 was released, which I think is obvious given my reaction to it. Total War games are, since Empire, not known for being in a particularly high-quality state at launch, but Rome 2 really took the biscuit. It was dreadful.Anyway, fast forward seven months. It's almost the end of June now, and Rome 2 has received 13 patches to date, as well as two main DLC expansions and several ""free-LC"" updates. The second of those major DLC expansions, Hannibal At The Gates, brought me back to Rome 2, and I have to say that the state of the game is far improved. Those awful ""capture the flag"" bits are gone, the technical performance of the game is better, there are more factions, more units, more features, more everything. The HatG mini-campaign is (annoying Agents aside) about as close to a perfect Total War campaign as I could ask for, and the factions are more balanced. Those unbearable turn-load times I mentioned before? Dealt with. Basically almost everything has been improved.There're still some glaring errors- siege AI remains fundamentally thick-headed, naval battles are still dogged by the AI insisting on clumping all its ships together in a mess when it regroups, and the policy of charging for factions still makes me sick- but the game is in a state where it can be played and enjoyed. That mod that brings the original Rome music into the game is brilliant too!I've left the original review below.* * * * * * * *Given how much I was looking forward to this after the first Rome game, Rome 2 is disappointment in video game form. Technical issues have abounded from day 1- it looks like I've got over 100 hours logged, but most of that was spent waiting for the AI to take its turns. Though this and many other issues have since been patched, it's a mark of how important it is for a game to launch with at least a pretence of smoothness: I haven't gone back to Rome 2 in a month. It's not just the bugs that have killed my enjoyment, it's some quite fundamental alterations to the way the game plays as well as some baffling design choices. As usual, the game lacks difficulty after a certain point, and the game's attempt to introduce a mid/late-game challenge is to spawn rebels with inexplicable amounts of troops instead of, say, actually building up enemies to be a threat. Agents are more of an irritation than anything else; the AI seems to prefer a bunch of smaller armies instead of larger ones that makes fighting them more akin to a game of whack-a-mole than anything else; multiplayer has been utterly eviscerated since Shogun 2. There are some bright spots: the new cinematic mode makes engagements a joy to watch, for instance, and the army traditions help breed attachment to your forces and can lead to some nice emerging stories. Unfortunately this is nowhere near enough to make up for the disappointment of everything else- the AI, the design choices, the multiplayer, the loathesome attitude towards DLC. Avoid if at all possible.			"

												Moderately fun, but far too frustrating to play vs the older Total War games.  In the end it made me break out the original Rome Total War and load that up.The good:- The new way of managing regions by using sub-regions is interesting.- The new army system is interesting, and the stance system makes more sense then trying to find the right forest to hide your army in.- The port seige and mixed army/navy battles- AI does a much better job of trying to counter moves intelligently in battle.- graphics are awesomeThe bad:- The army system means that you can no longer have a small sub-army controlled by a captain cover a separate path, or travel by itself between regions.- The controls are frustrating to learn- Units didn't seem to always obey the commands I gave, even before battle was joined.- New system means that cities now have to specialize in something- Have to reinforce/build troops directly at the army- No control over what types of garrison forces are placed in cities.- I had to have graphics turned down to medium on my R9 270 in order to get an average of 22fps, so it didn't really look any better graphically than Shogun II.Total:I would give this only a 5.5-6 out of 10, whereas I give most of the other Total War games 7-9's.

												almost 500 hours in and not a single campaign finished, recent patches have made it playable however its the mods which help make it bearable more than the patches and whenever CA patch the game it ends up breaking the mods.This game may be ready in about 6-8 months however right now its just a game which is neither good nor bad. Its just there for whoever wants to kill 15-20 minutes from time to time. The main problems are.- Terrible collision system due to the warscape engine, unit models move in and out of each other, clipping and sliding are a great part of every combat interaction, especially with cavalry charges.- Battles feel arcady, no realism, units rout too fast, pikemen have no real formation and if they try to attack another unit then they have to adjust the whole unti to become perpendicular and face them perfectly before they can begin combat.- Units as a whole are very poor at retaining their formations, so much so that cavalry cna easily charge straight through. - I'd say the political system is terrible however for that to be true you need to have a political system in place. In Rome II there's a series of buttons which all do nothing since civil war is inevitable and can not be avoided regardless of what choices you make and when civil war kicks of its just 10 armies spawning at your capital and you have to call all your armies back to fight this new random unrealistic threat  and CA has explicitly said that this part of the game wont be changed !- No family tree, no decent general development.- The UI is clearly rushed with no thought whatsoever, anyone who hasn't played this game would look at it and say its a placeholder and CA's current work ethic is contrary to their claims, instead of giving the game a real politics system they're busy releasing small unit packs, something which modders can already do (and to a degree, better than CA)- No decent expansion packs, small mini campaigns such as Hannibale at the gates and Caesar in gaul include unlocking unplayable factions (which modders have alreay done), a few cosmetic changes like a few new models and new research names along with campaign maps smaller than the vanilla campain map while adding NO NEW FEATURES WHATSOEVER. I and many others do not expect things to change soon,there are far more problems that this, take it from a person who has spent almost 500 hours playing this game and about 5  of those hours were playing the vanilla. As i said the mods make it playable and add life to a dead game but its also a tricky business and not everything can be modded since CA has hardcoded some things making it impossible.Final verdict, I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE. Wait about half a year and if you see the devs making significant changes to address the concerns that ive placed here then feel free. These are not just my complaints these are a summary of every total war fan today.you may disagree on what ive said but one thing is certain.THIS IS NOT THE TOTAL WAR THAT YOU LOVED AND CHERISHED. THIS IS A MUTATED AND ILL VERSION OF THE MUCH LOVED GAME SERIES AND CA ARENT GOING TO PULL OUT THE DEFIBRILLATORS ANYTIME SOON !but please do tell me when they do, dont worry i'll wait -_-			"

												This is one of the best strategy games out there. You can play multiplayer campaign and help your buddy control the land or fight each other and see who can hold the most. Or you can just do a regular battle against anyone. But not just the multiplayer is amazing. The campaign itself gives you a really accurate story of Ancient Rome and many other provinces. So buyt Total War : Rome II today and start conquiring provinces!			"

												I have read a lot of bad reviews for this game, and maybe it is only because I got the game after the major patch but I don't see it.  I think the idea of the armies having a legacy and the upgrade system surrounding armies and generals is far better than any so far.  You now raise armies instead of having tiny groups of units spread out, and not having to garrison troops is very nice.  All in all this is a great total war game and I would highly recommend it.

												Three weeks has gone and it's still unplayable. I am not even talking about the AI now, no the fps is so low that even on low graphics it still is on 15/10 fps. It isn't even in an alpha state. The graphics are also horrible, even on ultra. The god damn textures are so bad that it doesn't matter if I zoom in on the battlefield or out, I can never see anything because of the flickering mess. The trees doesn't even look like trees but just an orgy of ugly lines. The nine year old predecessor RTW 1 is 100x more pleasant to play and watch than this disgrace.The price was already very high and I can't even play it, no matter how hard I try. This is the biggest waste of money I have ever put on a video-game. Oh yeah, Sparta is a DLC.			"

Its like the 'end game' 'or 'replay' button after victory did the opposite or something. I didnt want to 'replay' and once that was set, you HAD to beat it again toadvance in the campagin.

Overall I would say this game has the elements of strategy in place but forgot technique and narrative somewhere along the way.  There are much better strategy games out there than this arcade-style spam fest and I personally prefer a game with a bit more narrative/context.  The game should leave the player engaged and wanting to play the campaigns, this game does not.  Wait for a sale or do not purchase.			"

Posted: September 28, 2014
												Hmm I see still no neutral way to comment on game, so guess Ill have to use the thumbs down.Ok first off, this isn't so much a bad game. This game could very well have the best graphics of any Total War game Ive ever played. Ive also been very impressed with Creative assembly and their Total War sries for providing great strategy games, historical notes, and a realness to the campaigns that just isn't on other RTS games. Sadly, this game has alot of problems that other TW games dont have, thus the thumbs down.The cons of this game:Soldier cards while in battle. They're black shapes of men, like ancient artwork. Which is really annoying in battle. Cause, while Im trying to move my troops around to engage, and hopefully, get the best results from the engagement, I got to keep hovering over the troop cards to ensure Im not sending my slingers to the front and my spearmen to a slingers position. The fact that, 2-4 versions of the spearmen are available, and only difference is how they are holding the spear, only adds to the confusion.The Grand Capmaign. Where to begin with that? Ill start off with, the map. Feels like the Ice Age is over and the cavemen are now starting to form tribes, despite the fact the starting year is listed as 272 BC. Next, the map is only so big. Yet, there is SO many Ai tribes, with strange, unheard of names and every shield emblem imaginable.  Its hard to believe the map is even big enough for all of them. The campaign also needs help explaining the different researchs, how to increase food production, etc. Felt like the more I researched, the less production! And, didn't seem to be any farming building to build. Yet, my soldiers were dieing of food shortage.Battlefield camera controls. They stink. As you go left and right, it swings you in a wide arc, making it hard to be sure your even moving towards the units you wished to move/command. Which then makes it tough to do your battle plan and ensure you dont take heavy loss's.The units seem to not be numbered. On medieval TW or Empires TW, you might recruit a unit of 45 calvary. On Rome, you dont seem to have a set number of soldiers in any unit.The few pros I did find:The battles are a bit realistic. I saw a horse riding away from the battle, riderless. Empires and Medieval dont have that.Each general character you recruit, his army is given a name and can choose an emblem, which does not happen on Medieval or Empires.Overall, not worth the $60 price it has. $20 is the highest I would ever pay for this, if I ever chose to buy this game. Its not a bad game and at least worth a try. But its not the best Total War game and I wouldn't recommend it to new Total War fans. I'd recommend Medieval Total War 2 for swords, spears, and archer warfare or Empires Total War for much better experiences.Note: I bought Medieval Total War through Amazon, not Steam, thus why Medieval TW aint on my Steam library.

												Warning; This review is only inteded a certain demographic.-Those who intend on inted on purchasing the game late-Those that want to buy it and much of the DLC on sale (somewhere along (50-80% off)-Also this is from a player who is a total war vet and also played the last games-Otherwise you might find this game and review quite appaulingThis game when if first came out was launched in a very incomplete state, the Co-op campaign was completely bugged out, many of the essential features like the ability to throw pila while stationary were completely missing and the battle ai was so damn drunk you could easily walk around them and capture the city square without them even noticing. But now since CA did a major facelift on this game I think I can say that this game is for the most part complete.Some of the things they added from the last iterations -The ability to view the entire campaign and battle maps by using the tab key-Added greater diversity of game machanics e.g. melee attack, armor penetration, health. -It's much easier than before to keep a coherant line you can even assign subordinate ai commanders to take over and soft lock formations.-The amount playable and non-playable factions in the game is both refreshing and even somewhat overwhelming and each one brings with it it's own unique playstyle adding months of replabiliy. Like for instance if you play a Germanic faction you must try to create a coalition in order to gain power.-As always the graphics for this game is beyond astonishing especially if you have a decent computer. You can make out even small details like the insignias on units to the small projectiles being thrown throughout the battlefiels. However, some cons that still need to be adressed in my opinion-The family tree and political system in this is a complete joke, most of the things you really have to worry about is just the commander traits and army traditions.-Compared to other games like EUIV, the diplomacy options have improved but still lack big options. -Many of the on map resources seem to be too common to have any real value. Unlike Shogun 2, most of the buildings in Rome 2 can be constructed in about anywhere. -For various reasons many of the major factions seem to be too passive for their own good in some playthroughs. In a playthrough of Rome, I was able to get to Carthage several times withought any real resistance. (Experience may vary). Overall I consider this a pretty good game overall, but still shy of the level of depth of Shogun II. I would defenatly recommend this to people who want more of a variaty in unit selection and enjoy the ancient era.			"

												I am a long time Total War fan. I've own and have played all of them (including other Creative Assembly titles like Viking: Battle for Asgard). I've over the years become a loyal customer since I felt like I always got my money's worth.Rome II has ended that and made me lost my faith for Creative Assembly altoghether. I had patience when they were sorting out the bugs at launch, month after month after month. Now it is mostly playable, but is it fun? For the most part: no. There's no driving force behind the game, nothing that keeps me wanting to come back for more. Some other reviewers have already gone into detail, but some of the issues are of a graphical nature, but also that just that conquering new provinces on the campaign map becomes dull. I also tried out the multiplayer coop campaign with a friend, but just as with Shogun II it eventually becomes unplayable due to glitches and bugs mostly relating to desynching.I don't know what has happened to Creative Assembly during the years, but they no longer seem to be the same. Now I also noticed the new Hannibal title has day one DLC, which makes my stomach turn even more. My recommendation? If you want a grand strategy game, this isn't it. Go back to the older games, or look for a Paradox Interactive game. Creative Assembly has lost it's place as king of the hill and they are going to have to work hard to come back to it.			"

												New Total War Players; If you are thinking of getting into the total war series i would suggest Attila unless you really want the Roman era  Buy this on sale if your looking for an army management game with strategic battles.  It can be complex at first but extremely satisfying when you overcome difficult battles.  Diplomacy is in the game but it isnt complex or intelligent enough to make it seem real.   You make peace, you trade, you WAR.    Your goal in this game is to conquer the world, not build the first space ship.Old Total War Players;   I am disgruntled that they haven't implemented any successful type of unit movement or physics system in the way units interact with eachother or the environment;  Managing units climbing castles, or on the castle walls is a nightmare.   The physics of the armies charging into eachother in Attila (and all recent TW entries) seems to have taken a step back from the Medieval 2 version where two giant armies charging into eachother would create a thunderous explosion.   Now the armies seem to stutter step their way into the opposing army and then they kind of stand around and watch eachother while a few guys kill eachother.   I enjoy these games enough to keep coming back but never until the prices are 50+% off.     Total War has an expensive DLC regime that is expensive and ""unfriendly.""   There is something wrong at Creative Assembly when new entries take a step back in many areas while they still can't improve on some of the weird problems that have been around for 10+ years like wall battles during seiges, general unit movement and interaction, and unsophisticated AI.  I would be more forgiving AND loyal if they didn't turn around and fleece me for DLC that doesnt really improve anything.... its just a new coat of paint			"

I've enjoyed the game for what it is, sure, but i've played total war games for years and got my fufillment in just one campaign. People new to the series should steer clear of this one as, whilst you'll likely enjoy it, it doesn't properly deliver the full total war experience promised.			"

												This is a good game, not great and probably not living up to its advertising, but still quite enjoyable.I am one of the lucky people, who never had any technical problems, well aside from AI not being able to attack fortified settlements - particularily from the sea.The graphics is amazing, the gameplay is somewhat simplyfied, which is somewhat enoying. The forced march stance, as well as the ability of army to sail the seas is particularily stupid decission. The traditions of the armies and the whole system of provinces on the other hand, were quite briliant solutions, though personally I would like to see more buldings.Unfortunately the single worst thing about this hame is its DLC history (and future seems no better). CA or sega refuse to understand, that any modder worth the name, is well capable of changing few textures or (if given tools to do so) slightly change the campain map. The dlc's that are currently being sold are little more than that. It is very unfortunate, that the franchise and the firm responsible for such a great expansion pack's such as Barbarian invasion, kingdoms, or more recent ""fall of samurai"" is now wasting both our and their time making stupid lame DLC which add few units and change few skins - something bellow avreage modder is able to do - instead of changing the gameplay, introducing new mechanicsas we should expect from them.I however still recommend this game, it is a good game, and whoever is claming otherwice is either lier, or had a technical issues that are likely to be solved by now. I however strongly advice against buying any DLC's because the only way of stopping selling of useless crap is by not buying it.			"

												Rome 1 Total War used to be my favourite game of all time. While the initial release of Rome 2 was a nightmare to be quite frank. Creative Assembly have worked incredibly hard to patch the crap out of the game. What do we have now you ask? An amazing strategy game set in the most interesting period of World History.If you have never played a Total War game before, Rome 2 is a fantastic place to start. The game has been streamlined, yet kept its strategically focused campaign map and tactical brilliance of the battlefield.If you're in Australia, use a key site to order a Steam key, as SEGA price gouge the crap out of us.Game on Imperator!

If you like the Time period then you will love this game. Although the AI is very passive and idont really declare war. And if they do they will give you a peace treaty the next turn. 9/10			"

												I bought 2 copies of this game only so I could play co-op campaign with my brother.  However, I found out too late that since he has his game on a Mac and I have mine on a PC, we can't play because we have different game versions.  When you're at the game's main menu screen, you will see a number in the top right corner.  Our numbers are different, and therefore we can't connect in a multiplayer battle or campaign.This is advertised as multiplayer, and that might be true for the majority of players, but it doesn't work for Mac vs. PC multiplayer games.  Some more experienced Mac people might be able to do a workaround, but be warned.			"

												total war: rome 2 definetivly brings the strategy game back to life!it combines the slower paced provincial government (mostly the construction and managment off various buildings throughout the empire) and cpmmanding armies to kick♥♥♥♥♥* the construction part off the game is very detailed; its possible to choose from 4 main categories; town centre, military, civil or aggricultural buildings. each categorie has smaller sub divisions which allows you to choose what is best for your expanding empire. research and greater stability will get you acces to higher level upgrades.*for the military part its a deffinitive advantage to learn the combat system (generally ranged in back, spears/sords in front and cavalry at the side and grouped attacks on smaller detachements) and fight your own battles. the auto ressolve works fine, but also dpends on commander skill. so a layer may be actually beat an enemy the AI can not. it certainly works well (in dry weather at least) with the units responding well and the distances not being overly long. the troops also seem to be well balanced and the bonus system (as reward for victory) is well thought out and very usefull to an able and foreseeing commander.

												After having tried out tons of mods, I can safely say the community has saved this game from being a total waste, so I'm rewriting my review.I'll say it now, had it not been for those mods, I would have ditched this game a long time ago. I would be sad that I have more playtime in Rome 2 than Shogun 2 now, but only because I tried so hard to make this game worth having in my library. I'm somewhat glad to say that I've succeeded, but I'm still disappointed I had to resort to mass modding to make the game enjoyable. After the amazing experience that was Shogun 2, I expected so much more from CA. Playing Rome 2 after having played anything earlier in the series like Medieval 2, Rome 1 or Shogun 2 can be a bit of a let down. Thinking of the advantages Rome 2 has over those games I can only think of...better looking units/graphics? The province system? I guess the Campaign map size is more or less the same size?Still, time has passed, the bugs have been mostly squashed, mechanics have changed, there still aren't any family trees or agent cutscenes, but there ARE tons of awesome mods by the community to change the ancient world in your own image. If you can get this game on sale, I say go for it. For full price, I'm not sure I can still say yes, but the mods really are worth it in the long run.			"

												Well, I will try to be as short as possiblePros:+ Modding community+ Good atmosphere, revisited time period+ Detailed battles with many options as formations, traps, etc, etc+ Replayable. Different and interesting missions and objectives (up to some point) which are specific to each faction are a sure guarantee that you are going to spend a lot of time playing this game.Cons:- After all those patches, A.I. is still incredibly stupid when it comes to battles. It just acts suicidal every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time. It is almost impossible not to win a battle given how easy the AI is to lure into ambush or how it does not attack certain units with their corresponding opposing troops (like cavalry - pikemen/spearmen). Instead, they just rush everything head on, expecting miracles. I really can't comprehend why CA could not implement this simple rock/paper/scissors mechanic in the game after years of patching.- Lame diplomacy. I know a lot has been written on the topic by what bugs me most, again after years of patching, is the lack to give away a region to anyone - even for free. For example - I play as Rome, maintain good relations with the Raeti and the Nori, I decide to turn my focus to Carthage and Iberia so I rely on my allies to keep my back (with some help, of course). After they lose some of their regions, I decide to intervene with my nearby stack so I recapture a territory that was belonging to my allies just a few turns ago. Astonishingly, I do not have the option to return the region to its rightful owner and instead I have to spend resources and time developing that region or just leave it be reconquered by my enemies (which of course is something I would not want to do). Same happens even if I tried to give the region to a client state/satrapy. On top of it, if playing as some barbarian factions, it is possible to ""liberate"" a region, instantly forming a military alliance with the liberated faction - which means the option of capturing and immediately ceding a region is somewhere in the game - just not given to us all this time, not even possible to be modded out. Do we need to remind CA how many times in the course of history, after the end of a war, territory was readdressed between belligerents? Instead, in Rome 2 owning a region is only a direct consequence of military occupation. B O R I N G- Broken trade. Now, again, would someone explain to me why (yes, again after years of patching) the trade issues with Sparta and Dacia were never sorted out? It is not a bug per se, but just an incredibly lacking in terms of common sense and logic game mechanic. For those who are not familiar: the game requires you to have a direct route to your capital in order to trade with a faction. Sounds logical as long as you do not play as Sparta and try to keep Athens as an ally or a client state. Because, if you do play as Sparta, you can go out, capture the entire Mediterranean if you wish, but as long as Athens is not yours - you cannot trade WITH ANYONE EXCEPT FOR ATHENS (or the corresponding faction that owns Athens). What if I wanted to keep Athens as an ally? Nope, you are not even offered to have trade-passing rights, so even if Athens was an ally or a client state - even then you cannot trade with anyone except them. Of course, that would be a minor nuissance if you could change your capital - but then again - NOPE, you cannot do that for reasons incomprehensible by human logic... With Dacia things are a bit less annoying since it borders a lot of other regions. But you cannot trade across the Danube even though historically rivers were used mainly for that - trade. Instead you have to circle around in order to start trading with those factions south of the river (or north of the river if you are coming from the south)I still recommend the game. I enjoy it. The modding community is great, and the game is quite flexible in terms of modding. However, the issues listed above are sometimes driving me crazy especially knowing that after all this time they still haven't been fixed (and they were all discovered when the game was released). What is even worse, CA has announced that they are not planning in implementing the ""give region"" option because ""it was not historically accurate"". Just wtf when it is exactly the opposite.			"

												Simply boring overall.  I also experienced a video memory leak after playing just a hour or two.  Tactically I found the command interface sticky.  Overall I would say this game has the elements of strategy in place but forgot technique and narrative somewhere along the way.  There are much better strategy games out there than this arcade-style spam fest and I personally prefer a game with a bit more narrative/context.  The game should leave the player engaged and wanting to play the campaigns, this game does not.  Wait for a sale or do not purchase.			"

												Hmm I see still no neutral way to comment on game, so guess Ill have to use the thumbs down.Ok first off, this isn't so much a bad game. This game could very well have the best graphics of any Total War game Ive ever played. Ive also been very impressed with Creative assembly and their Total War sries for providing great strategy games, historical notes, and a realness to the campaigns that just isn't on other RTS games. Sadly, this game has alot of problems that other TW games dont have, thus the thumbs down.The cons of this game:Soldier cards while in battle. They're black shapes of men, like ancient artwork. Which is really annoying in battle. Cause, while Im trying to move my troops around to engage, and hopefully, get the best results from the engagement, I got to keep hovering over the troop cards to ensure Im not sending my slingers to the front and my spearmen to a slingers position. The fact that, 2-4 versions of the spearmen are available, and only difference is how they are holding the spear, only adds to the confusion.The Grand Capmaign. Where to begin with that? Ill start off with, the map. Feels like the Ice Age is over and the cavemen are now starting to form tribes, despite the fact the starting year is listed as 272 BC. Next, the map is only so big. Yet, there is SO many Ai tribes, with strange, unheard of names and every shield emblem imaginable.  Its hard to believe the map is even big enough for all of them. The campaign also needs help explaining the different researchs, how to increase food production, etc. Felt like the more I researched, the less production! And, didn't seem to be any farming building to build. Yet, my soldiers were dieing of food shortage.Battlefield camera controls. They stink. As you go left and right, it swings you in a wide arc, making it hard to be sure your even moving towards the units you wished to move/command. Which then makes it tough to do your battle plan and ensure you dont take heavy loss's.The units seem to not be numbered. On medieval TW or Empires TW, you might recruit a unit of 45 calvary. On Rome, you dont seem to have a set number of soldiers in any unit.The few pros I did find:The battles are a bit realistic. I saw a horse riding away from the battle, riderless. Empires and Medieval dont have that.Each general character you recruit, his army is given a name and can choose an emblem, which does not happen on Medieval or Empires.Overall, not worth the $60 price it has. $20 is the highest I would ever pay for this, if I ever chose to buy this game. Its not a bad game and at least worth a try. But its not the best Total War game and I wouldn't recommend it to new Total War fans. I'd recommend Medieval Total War 2 for swords, spears, and archer warfare or Empires Total War for much better experiences.Note: I bought Medieval Total War through Amazon, not Steam, thus why Medieval TW aint on my Steam library.

												This is a fun game, and the only reason I give it a negative review is because of the crap business practice they're using.  Every free weekend of any game I have seen on here has put he game on sale during and after the sale, but not for this one.  They wave the hefty $60 fee infront of your face as you play the game, making it painful for those of us who can't simply drop that kind of money out of nowhere.  But hey, what do you expect from SEGA?			"

												I am still a huge fan of the for Rome Total War. I have mixed feeling about this, though keep in mind I only played for a few hours.Firstly one of the big things I noticed was the game looks amazing, seeing the big battles rage on was very satisfying. There were a few times where controlling the unit in ships was a little dicy and sometimes they were bugged out, either stuck against a wall and couldnt move or were still locked in a boarding battle with an enemy ship that had sunk but were unresponsive to orders.It felt sort of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in a certain way. Everything was just a different colored texture of something else, except for rome. It really took away the sense I was fighting in a huge diverce and complicated world when everything looked almost exactly the same.The campaign was confusing at first, and I couldnt quiet figure out why my population were so damn unhappy all the time despite putting nearly all my attention into increasing puplic order and taking no slavesAll in all the game was pretty solid and the multiplayer battles were really fun. I cannot reccomend this game due to its price tag still being so high and its absurd amount of DLC on top of it.			"

												After its buggy release that was pretty much unplayable for me I stopped playing for over a year and went back to the much better stable TW games. It was not just the game breaking AI and capture the flag problems but the terrible optimization that made it impossible to play on my laptop.Now after 16 big patches its a different game, runs smooth and is now my favorite of the series, there are still a lot of features missing that were in previous TW games (some of which are returning in TW: Attila) but on the whole its a solid game now and the Mod community have built a large library of enhancements over the last year.Its well worth trying now if you have been put off by the negative reviews it got on release.

												though the games current state before wasnt its best, the game actually had some improvement overtime. at first since i pre ordered it i had my laptop expecting quite nice preformance or at least decent due to i could run shogun 2 on there quite niceley with high end graphics but expectations cut me up with majoir lag issues that did improve a bit with some patches. the game its self is quite fun they really improved the battlefeel but have still bugs to bust out and campain well, i mean personally it wasnt Much a problem but it could have striped less features in my opinion cause i did miss those cut sceane videos and the variety they had. the variety is still nice but i see why people were mad at that and i dont blame em cause yes they did strip features, probably made it more user friendly but for Rome II overall im a mixed guy to my opinion on this game to be honest. but if theres a good tip to share its that this game IS REAL demanding to your system, people claimed that higher graphic cards get the bigger piece of enjoyment here and i got a new rig recently built it myself and with a higher end card vs the mid-low my laptop had i probebly gota agree with those people as my experiance with the game improved vastly with this new desktop. if your to get this game and enjoy it well especially the battles then id recomend a high tier pc also for the battles id recomend a morale mod cause i do also agree with the morales been drastically decresed as when i played i think it was around 11k men the battle ended 6-7min and it was a big♥♥♥♥♥city battle so yea. and with no morale mod i had some normal battle go for 11-12 min not even 11k men so that was alot better. i also recomend this game if u wanted to see that medieval theame come back to tw again away from japan cause i did have a favor of rome tw but soon after i really just played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of mods for medieval 2 tw and shogun 2 till this game came remade, and again even though my expectations were beyond the roof i still enjoyed the game a fair share (even more on my new rig) cause for my love of that time periods theame. also if theres one thing in my opinion i think the game got quite head on it was bringing the time period back and they got the feel back on quite nicley. in my opinion get the game when sales come through the door and make sure you got at least a decent rig cause again my laptop ran several new titles Great but my new rig ran this one ALOT better, with still glitches / bugs to bust out the games progressing alright i just hope the content they add later will improve experiance with the game even more to match many peoples expectations (especially for us people who pre ordered it) and raise my opinion from my bit mixed opinion to a good opinion on the title. also compatibility and several gameplay problems i hope areadressed too the unit collision dilema for instance. lastly the workshop i forgot to mention has added to the games favor as mods were bolstering out day one, i think well over 50 mods were out the first like week it came and they kinda add to the experiance too like as i mentioned the no morale mod and several others like the popular Radius TW mod adds quite enjoyable additional features as well. My verdict is probably 7-8 out of 10 with my new rig (games current state) i personally enjoyed alot the return of the roman age but awaiting fixes and hopfully additional features, then i could probably score it higher.

I think the difficulty levels are a bit skrewed up though, it could just be me. There are a few negatives, the load times are a bit too long, the splitting up etc of troops is also a bit wrong, the unit cards are also a down grade, but despite that I think its still a good game and no other game offers this kind of gameplay yet.

												This game is fantastic except for the fact that they got rid of the family tree. not cool man. I like building a dynasty/legacy. the general mechanic sucks in that way. mods that go up to 12 turns a year make it a little better. the battles are great. AI is solid. the character models are gorgeous, which oddly enough is a problem. they are so gorgeous, but there are so many of them, and they are so unique and awesome looking that it makes it hard to pay attention to any of them at any given time so it just sort of becomes a huge overstimulating mess if you zoom in to watch any part of the battle. also, the battles are way too fast paced. even enormous battles sometimes last about 10 minutes, which again, makes it really hard to enjoy any of the visuals. also, every total war game before this one had better castle seige mechanics. the cities in this one, just seem WAY TOO BIG. the battles always happen on basically 1/10th of the entire city, and the AI annoyingly takes advatnage of this and sends units to the opposite side of the city to attack, making castle seiges just a total pain in the butt. Shogun 2 is better than this game in pretty much every aspect. however, i could not help but enjoy playing as the macedonians and re-taking over the success states. this game is fun, its just disappointing due to the fact that literally every game before it was better. if you love history and the total war franchise, shogun 2 is the best one. this one is good, but arguably not even as good as medieval 2. now they made a medieval 3 and did not make it as a big money grab and actually took their time with it and did not make 50 DLC's...then i would pay attention to this franchise again. i recommend rome 2, but shogun 2 is better. be Athens and conquer trade in the mediterranean. super fun.

												If this was the game CA released to begin with, it would've ranked up as one of the best in the series. Beautiful visuals and an enormous attention to detail, interesting and varied unit rosters for each faction, a thematic soundtrack, a yuge and engaging campaign map full of dozens of nations and tribes with legit working diplomacy (an enemy of your enemy will actively seek to trade with you or seek a military alliance for example), battle AI that managed to surprise me by using formations effectively and actually trying to outflank me and finally (in my opinion) a more visually interesting and streamlined UI.It's not perfect by a long stretch; true to the series it can be too easy (especially as Rome) and upping the difficulty doesn't make the AI smarter, it just lets them cheat with more money and better stats, 1 year per turn means your generals drop dead from old age before you've even had a chance to properly level them up, the AI will sometimes not attack you during sieges or tire its units out by running them all over the map for no reason and the performance is pretty awful for a game of its age, although I did find upgrading my Radeon drivers to Crimson 16.9.2  boosted my framerate by nearly 20fps!If you're a fan of the series but have put off buying Rome 2 because of the awful state of the game at release, you're a fan of the time period, or you just fancy building an empire - definitely pick this one up. Highly recommended.			"

												Great game, and in its current state it is nearly flawless(if you ignore the usual quarks of CA game engines, I however have had zero crashes since the Emperor Edition was released a while ago. Great replayability, great graphics, a huge thriving modding community, and the DLC isn't all just a money grab/if you just buy what you want almost everything enhances the gameplay options alot. Not to mention this game has a lot of FreeLC that has been released since launch(like the Emperor Edition for example, and its whole seperate campaign.)If you're a roman history buff, or Total war fan I can't recommend this game more, however if you're looking into this title expecting the Total War series to have taken a new direction, or hoping some features you may not like have been removed etc, I hate to disapoint but it is just a total war game through and through and true remake of the original Rome total war, with of course many more updates to the game's mechanics, and even a few removals(not being able to gift territorties was one that really stuck with me).

												The game looks very nice, but the broken AI ruins it. Enemies go up to your walls and look at your settlements while you murder them, leaving their ladders behind. They ambush your army, only to run up and look at it, their general charges in and dies horribly as the rest of their army retreat across the field to stand in a big blob and wait for your slingers to throw rocks at them until you run out of ammo. Then you charge them with everything you have and they break and flee. And this on legendary difficulty... avoid this game.			"

												The game has very similar mechanics to any other total war accept its different enough to have its own title, the campaign map is easy to control and the battle mechanics are astounding. I have issues in the past on different computers of it not running properly and have spent over £700 on a gaming computer to play games like this but for anyone who had a relatively old computer, or bad graphics card or processor, it WONT RUN NICELY... itll be slow, clunky and simply no fun to play. Also the DLC costs way to much, some DLC's being £6 and others beign £10. It also, for me, experienced lag spikes at rare occations but enough to be noticed.LOOKS AND FEELS AMAZINGIF YOU HAVE A GOOD COMPUTERWAY TO MANY DLC'S THAT AMMOUNT TO WAY TO MUCH MONEYWONT RUN HOW YOU WANT IT ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PROPER GAMING PC			"

												After 3 years, I'm still coming back and playing this for hours on end. I finally won my first campaign as Parthia, because I would always just start new campaigns. I'd say the strongest point of this game is the start of campaigns, when literally anything could happen, any AI faction could rise up and become a major player. You can play the same faction infinite times and your experience would be different each time.However, the biggest problem I have with the game, the reason why I was never finishing campaigns, is how stale the endgame is. It gets super repetitive once there are only a handful of factions left, and there's hardly any diplomacy at that point, just conquest after conquest. The politics ""mini-game"" seems tacked on, or not fleshed out to its potential. And Diplomacy can sometimes seem strange, factions refusing to trade with you even though you have tons of resources and they have none. Every once in a while a faction will declare war on you right after agreeing to a treaty.But in the end, the strengths of this game come out on top. Battles are epic, especially when they're between two powerful and advanced factions. The growth system for cities is ingeneous, and the wide variety of cultures at play insure a unique experience for each faction (outside of the Greek city-states). This went from one of the worst Total Wars at launch to one of the best. It's in my top 5, maybe arguably my top 3 with Rome and Shogun 2.9/10, would recommend.			"

												After waiting 2 years of optimization and a sale on the emperor edition, i finally bought Rome 2. I've been playing total war since Rome 1, i avoided Rome 2 because i anticipated the terrible release after the lukewarm beta leaks.I read a lot of people ranking Rome 1 , Medieval 2 and Shogun 2 above Rome 2 even after the Emperor edition.Those people are ragers completely stuck on the terrible Rome 2 release, and obsessed with Rome1/medieval 2 mods.Rome 1 and Medieval 2 engines are completely outdated and no amount of ""historical accuracy"", scripted mechanics that bloat the engine, or unit reskinning, can make up for core programming obsolescence.At the time of this review, Rome 2 is the best TW on the market. The map is beautiful, the combat works well, the UI is good, the new province mechanic is very smart...The graphics even on ultra are a bit disappointing but ENB mods will fix that.Buy it !			"

												There is so many bad reviews of the game. But understand something, these reviews came fromm the release of the game. Now it's a very good game.You can play hours in solo without boring feeling. By the way mods can destroy that feeling of boredom if it were to occur.Pros :+ Awesome solo with more than 200 provinces to conquer+ Unlike Shogun 2 the game integrates cultur. Germanic tribes don't have same units, buildings, tech and graphisms than roman, carthagenese, arabs, gallic, ....+ Mods offer a lot of new units for improve the diversity of armies, new system of diplomacy, new graphics, ...+ You can play the campign with one friend which is awesomeCons :- The IA is still quite stupid (but some mods change that)- No family tree like in Shogun 2 or Attila which is a real problem for me "

												After having tried out tons of mods, I can safely say the community has saved this game from being a total waste, so I'm rewriting my review.I'll say it now, had it not been for those mods, I would have ditched this game a long time ago. I would be sad that I have more playtime in Rome 2 than Shogun 2 now, but only because I tried so hard to make this game worth having in my library. I'm somewhat glad to say that I've succeeded, but I'm still disappointed I had to resort to mass modding to make the game enjoyable. After the amazing experience that was Shogun 2, I expected so much more from CA. Playing Rome 2 after having played anything earlier in the series like Medieval 2, Rome 1 or Shogun 2 can be a bit of a let down. Thinking of the advantages Rome 2 has over those games I can only think of...better looking units/graphics? The province system? I guess the Campaign map size is more or less the same size?Still, time has passed, the bugs have been mostly squashed, mechanics have changed, there still aren't any family trees or agent cutscenes, but there ARE tons of awesome mods by the community to change the ancient world in your own image. If you can get this game on sale, I say go for it. For full price, I'm not sure I can still say yes, but the mods really are worth it in the long run.			"

												total war: rome 2 definetivly brings the strategy game back to life!it combines the slower paced provincial government (mostly the construction and managment off various buildings throughout the empire) and cpmmanding armies to kick♥♥♥♥♥* the construction part off the game is very detailed; its possible to choose from 4 main categories; town centre, military, civil or aggricultural buildings. each categorie has smaller sub divisions which allows you to choose what is best for your expanding empire. research and greater stability will get you acces to higher level upgrades.*for the military part its a deffinitive advantage to learn the combat system (generally ranged in back, spears/sords in front and cavalry at the side and grouped attacks on smaller detachements) and fight your own battles. the auto ressolve works fine, but also dpends on commander skill. so a layer may be actually beat an enemy the AI can not. it certainly works well (in dry weather at least) with the units responding well and the distances not being overly long. the troops also seem to be well balanced and the bonus system (as reward for victory) is well thought out and very usefull to an able and foreseeing commander.

You now raise armies instead of having tiny groups of units spread out, and not having to garrison troops is very nice.  All in all this is a great total war game and I would highly recommend it.

												This is a good game, not great and probably not living up to its advertising, but still quite enjoyable.I am one of the lucky people, who never had any technical problems, well aside from AI not being able to attack fortified settlements - particularily from the sea.The graphics is amazing, the gameplay is somewhat simplyfied, which is somewhat enoying. The forced march stance, as well as the ability of army to sail the seas is particularily stupid decission. The traditions of the armies and the whole system of provinces on the other hand, were quite briliant solutions, though personally I would like to see more buldings.Unfortunately the single worst thing about this hame is its DLC history (and future seems no better). CA or sega refuse to understand, that any modder worth the name, is well capable of changing few textures or (if given tools to do so) slightly change the campain map. The dlc's that are currently being sold are little more than that. It is very unfortunate, that the franchise and the firm responsible for such a great expansion pack's such as Barbarian invasion, kingdoms, or more recent ""fall of samurai"" is now wasting both our and their time making stupid lame DLC which add few units and change few skins - something bellow avreage modder is able to do - instead of changing the gameplay, introducing new mechanicsas we should expect from them.I however still recommend this game, it is a good game, and whoever is claming otherwice is either lier, or had a technical issues that are likely to be solved by now. I however strongly advice against buying any DLC's because the only way of stopping selling of useless crap is by not buying it.			"

												A fresh take on the highly successful Total War series.New region management system, that enables large regions with many cities to be managed as a whole.Large variety of troop types relevant to home region.Limited amount of units allowed in action at any one time, brings a more tactical strategy throughout.Fantastic visuals and audio.Main campaign is long and involving.Possibly my favourite Total War to date.

												Rome 2 provides a great empire-building strategy with epic Battles presented with the newest graphics. Even though there are still some bugs I really enjoy the game - it enhanced several problematic areas form Rome 1 such as the possibility of naval battles and sustainability of the empire - giving me another round of my possibly most loved game of the 21st century so far. The positives: - combat is (usually) swift and smooth - graphics are fine - allies actually work - new army stances - good MP campaign - nice mods available - intuitive and clear UIThe negatives: - AI is still dumm - Few repeating battlefields - I would expect more - Sieges are mishandled & the city design is lacking at places (such as gaps in walls!) although the building textures are beautiful - The ""intrigue"" side is useless at best, annoying at worst. - Diplomacy still limited and AI is illogical, albeit it is easy to navigate - ""Oversimplification"" of economy, cities and empire manegement in generalOverall I'd say this is one of my less played TWs, and while being a solid game it was certainly not the best TW by a longshot. MP is fun even after a while, but SP gets boring relatively fast.			"

Five-Total War's later and, as much as i enjoyed this game; I feel as though it's a step backwards from the benchmark that Rome: TW raised. Would still recommend though. 7/10			"

												As a fan of strategy it is only natural that I am a fan of the Total War series, that said I was hesitent to get Rome II at first for reasons that many of us are aware of, at launch it was a buggy nightmare that will cause people to doubt Creative Assembly for quite a while, that and Shogun 2 was excellent enough to not need to move on. Many months later combined with a sale day I was tempted, but first consulted a friend about it. He assured me the game was now very much fixed so I decided to go for it. Put simply I was not dissapointed.One thing I liked right from the get go was the fact that for the main campaign, known as the Grand Campaign, the map is huge and whether your commanding the Roman war machine or fighting against it you will be there a while and there will be many battles to be had. Most of the series signature features are there, the map, agents that serve various purposes, huge epic battles. That said the family tree is gone sadly, and I do mis it quite a bit as it made me feel even more invested in my game, families still exist but in a somewhat different form that instead plays a part in your chosen culture's internal politics which you are tasked with balancing rather than straight up dominating due to the risk of civil wars that can arise because of the internal factions within your government. Building on this is a system where events will happen and you will have to decide how to deal with them, with the outcome having effect of the political situation within your culture. Mileage will vary on whether or not this a good replacement for the Family Tree but it is a good system nonetheless.Overall I enjoyed Rome II just like I enjoyed Shogun II, that said many will argue that Shogun II is the smarter buy right now due to be noticably cheaper and I am inclined to agree. That said if you are itching for more total war on an even bigger scale and you spot it on sale go for it, and happy conquering!			"

												To be honest this is easily creative assembly's most impressive and immersive title to date, with a greater variation of battle types that can now accommodate both land and naval forces. The most impressive Battles take place when attacking or defending one of the major capital cities of the ancient world, and managing a fleet of reinforcements as you defend a siege provides a brilliant challenge. These encounters are just as intimidating as they are exciting, making the addition of a top-down, tactical viewpoint near essential. If you are in to turn based strategy games then i would advice you to give this game a shot, its well worth your money, i give it a 9/10.			"

												I am a long time Total War fan. I've own and have played all of them (including other Creative Assembly titles like Viking: Battle for Asgard). I've over the years become a loyal customer since I felt like I always got my money's worth.Rome II has ended that and made me lost my faith for Creative Assembly altoghether. I had patience when they were sorting out the bugs at launch, month after month after month. Now it is mostly playable, but is it fun? For the most part: no. There's no driving force behind the game, nothing that keeps me wanting to come back for more. Some other reviewers have already gone into detail, but some of the issues are of a graphical nature, but also that just that conquering new provinces on the campaign map becomes dull. I also tried out the multiplayer coop campaign with a friend, but just as with Shogun II it eventually becomes unplayable due to glitches and bugs mostly relating to desynching.I don't know what has happened to Creative Assembly during the years, but they no longer seem to be the same. Now I also noticed the new Hannibal title has day one DLC, which makes my stomach turn even more. My recommendation? If you want a grand strategy game, this isn't it. Go back to the older games, or look for a Paradox Interactive game. Creative Assembly has lost it's place as king of the hill and they are going to have to work hard to come back to it.			"

												New Total War Players; If you are thinking of getting into the total war series i would suggest Attila unless you really want the Roman era  Buy this on sale if your looking for an army management game with strategic battles.  It can be complex at first but extremely satisfying when you overcome difficult battles.  Diplomacy is in the game but it isnt complex or intelligent enough to make it seem real.   You make peace, you trade, you WAR.    Your goal in this game is to conquer the world, not build the first space ship.Old Total War Players;   I am disgruntled that they haven't implemented any successful type of unit movement or physics system in the way units interact with eachother or the environment;  Managing units climbing castles, or on the castle walls is a nightmare.   The physics of the armies charging into eachother in Attila (and all recent TW entries) seems to have taken a step back from the Medieval 2 version where two giant armies charging into eachother would create a thunderous explosion.   Now the armies seem to stutter step their way into the opposing army and then they kind of stand around and watch eachother while a few guys kill eachother.   I enjoy these games enough to keep coming back but never until the prices are 50+% off.     Total War has an expensive DLC regime that is expensive and ""unfriendly.""   There is something wrong at Creative Assembly when new entries take a step back in many areas while they still can't improve on some of the weird problems that have been around for 10+ years like wall battles during seiges, general unit movement and interaction, and unsophisticated AI.  I would be more forgiving AND loyal if they didn't turn around and fleece me for DLC that doesnt really improve anything.... its just a new coat of paint			"

												Warning; This review is only inteded a certain demographic.-Those who intend on inted on purchasing the game late-Those that want to buy it and much of the DLC on sale (somewhere along (50-80% off)-Also this is from a player who is a total war vet and also played the last games-Otherwise you might find this game and review quite appaulingThis game when if first came out was launched in a very incomplete state, the Co-op campaign was completely bugged out, many of the essential features like the ability to throw pila while stationary were completely missing and the battle ai was so damn drunk you could easily walk around them and capture the city square without them even noticing. But now since CA did a major facelift on this game I think I can say that this game is for the most part complete.Some of the things they added from the last iterations -The ability to view the entire campaign and battle maps by using the tab key-Added greater diversity of game machanics e.g. melee attack, armor penetration, health. -It's much easier than before to keep a coherant line you can even assign subordinate ai commanders to take over and soft lock formations.-The amount playable and non-playable factions in the game is both refreshing and even somewhat overwhelming and each one brings with it it's own unique playstyle adding months of replabiliy. Like for instance if you play a Germanic faction you must try to create a coalition in order to gain power.-As always the graphics for this game is beyond astonishing especially if you have a decent computer. You can make out even small details like the insignias on units to the small projectiles being thrown throughout the battlefiels. However, some cons that still need to be adressed in my opinion-The family tree and political system in this is a complete joke, most of the things you really have to worry about is just the commander traits and army traditions.-Compared to other games like EUIV, the diplomacy options have improved but still lack big options. -Many of the on map resources seem to be too common to have any real value. Unlike Shogun 2, most of the buildings in Rome 2 can be constructed in about anywhere. -For various reasons many of the major factions seem to be too passive for their own good in some playthroughs. In a playthrough of Rome, I was able to get to Carthage several times withought any real resistance. (Experience may vary). Overall I consider this a pretty good game overall, but still shy of the level of depth of Shogun II. I would defenatly recommend this to people who want more of a variaty in unit selection and enjoy the ancient era.			"

												I love the Total War series. I've played Shogun, Rome, Empire, Shogun 2, and now Rome 2.I would rate Shogun 2 to be much better than its predecessor, but Rome 2 feels like more of the same. Still, more of the same isn't a bad thing. The graphic obviously improved, additional factions are welcomed, and the campaigns are challenging. Although unfortunately, I found the sea battles to be more of a chore than anything.It's a 7/10 for me. I hope they'll be releasing Empire 2 soon. I want to see how that stacks up against Europa Universalis IV. Currently my favorite strategy game of the decade.			"

												I should be thankful that someone told me this was on a free weekend; this games been out for a while now and I'd still not seen what sort of crap I was missing out on for myself...Minimal expectations in mind, I took my time to look at all the playable factions; theres a ""decent"" amount regardless of DLC, however the number of actual nations is just so vast compared to other games.Anyway, picked the Kingdom of Pontus in what is modern day turkey or so, and soon as i started playing I was hooked.Diplomacy has improved slightly since Shogun 2, AI nations actively try to earn favour and security from their neighbours with a will to survive rather than conquer others, unless survival means to conquer (unless their barbarians, to which they will only listen if you're giving them a swirly).On a strategic view battles now feel more important to me, due to the lack of armies; it makes victory more valuable and losing will have a relatively severe affect on the security of your nation, leaving gaps in your frontlines; and in that respect wars should be planned accordingly.Knowing the crushing details about this games release, I feel that most of the ideas and details have been decently ironed out over the past year or so, thought it is missing a few things that would have been nice to include, such as trading territory. Still I genuinely think the 30 hours I've put into it was time well spent.			"

												When I first ever heard of Rome 2 being announced, I flipped out. Being a huge fan of the Total War series, even Spartan: Total Warrior, I was pumped for this game. Then, it came out. Bugs, glitches, idiotic AI, and more problems ruined this game. Luckily, however, I watched a review of this game before buying a while ago. Now, fortunately, I have heard that the bugs are gone, the AI is mostly fixed, and the game is now playable. When it went on sale, I knew I had to add this to my collection, and I have to say, it was worth it. TL;DR: The bugs are gone and the game is now playable, fun, and worth it if on sale.Now for some specifics.Pros:- Decent graphics- Fun and addicting grand campaign mode (like always)- Fairly easy to learn for newcomers- Challenging, but fun, even on lower difficulties (I might just suck)- New features added which I always wanted in the first Rome: Total WarCons:- I legitametly can not think of anything that takes away from the experience of this game, thus ruining the point of a pros/cons chart. Thanks Volvo.Verdict: 9/10   Worth it if on sale, but not the full asking price.			"

												Great game, and in its current state it is nearly flawless(if you ignore the usual quarks of CA game engines, I however have had zero crashes since the Emperor Edition was released a while ago. Great replayability, great graphics, a huge thriving modding community, and the DLC isn't all just a money grab/if you just buy what you want almost everything enhances the gameplay options alot. Not to mention this game has a lot of FreeLC that has been released since launch(like the Emperor Edition for example, and its whole seperate campaign.)If you're a roman history buff, or Total war fan I can't recommend this game more, however if you're looking into this title expecting the Total War series to have taken a new direction, or hoping some features you may not like have been removed etc, I hate to disapoint but it is just a total war game through and through and true remake of the original Rome total war, with of course many more updates to the game's mechanics, and even a few removals(not being able to gift territorties was one that really stuck with me).

												The game looks very nice, but the broken AI ruins it. Enemies go up to your walls and look at your settlements while you murder them, leaving their ladders behind. They ambush your army, only to run up and look at it, their general charges in and dies horribly as the rest of their army retreat across the field to stand in a big blob and wait for your slingers to throw rocks at them until you run out of ammo. Then you charge them with everything you have and they break and flee. And this on legendary difficulty... avoid this game.			"

For the sake of this review I will ignore that the game had a terrible launch.First off the game is waaayy more playable with the patches, the campaign isn't a mess and is actually fun, the campaign works. Unfortunatly I don't play Total war for the campaign; I play Total War for the battles and Rome 2's battles are bad, not terrible just bad.First off the audio has not been improved the music sucks life out of the game and the voice acting is well Sh*t. The other sound effects (sword and shield clashes, marching etc) are good however I would prefer to hear someone screaming from being killed instead of the sound of metal clashing.The animations are rubbish, the kill moves are unrealistic; soldiers slide across the floor to set up for the moves and when they do the kill moves look staged. Also the soldiers can be killed by a none kill move or a simple stab however the soldier that died has the same animation as if he got hit by a projectile and this looks stupid. The soldiers rubberband (this is more obvious in slow motion). There is still no unit collision; the units stop in perferect synchronization when they ""clash"", also when you issue a order all of the soldiers in the unit respond at the same time like robots it is not realistic. When two spear units clash they leave a gap and only one or two soldiers in each unit will fight eachother. The User interface in the battles is still stupid they still use the art style for the units and there is no guard mode. There are many more issues with the game (like how the light can refelct off sand) but I can't be bothered to explain these issues do not buy this game or its dlc.			"

												Exellent Historical game, the only game tha reflect true history of that ages , special the pelloponesian war the new DLC is amazing , although that miss one factor the Platees city state that was allied to Athens and be sige by Sparta at the start of the war 431 BC - 427 BC , in game that area belonge to Biotian League allied to sparta , thus that is not a factor not to love the latest DLC . As for the game you have the oportunity to re wrigh History of the anchien world , you can see powers such Athens - Sparta - Macedonia Kinghtom to change the fate of Hellas and became what history denied to them . Looking forward for more Historical times from Total war series , Keep on make the people to love history seeking it and learn it from a game .... so non unhistorical people being in our times that believe false efects and false statments that their coverments trying to make them believe .

												first of all the game gets a 95 out of a 100, while it may offer repetitve gameplay after the initial challenges of starting your empire the game is one of the greatest strategy games of all time especially after it had the emperor edition but even with the update it still offers a repetitve gameplay because of the extremely large campaign , and it is one of the most time consuming games of all times.and without doubt buy the game and enjoy :)			"

												Well, first of all it's so funny to see negative reviews by the people who actually played the game several hundred of hours anyway :DI keep enjoying the TW series since the Shogun times and Rome2 is also an awesome game.Of course it has some flaws just as every one of the previous TWs had, like very repeating animation (a lot of units from different factions fights and moves exactly the same way, however some of them, like greek hoplites could use phalanx and fight like they really did IRL, but the real romans military tactics is not illustrated in Rome2 accurately enough, said but true..), also the variety of battle maps is pretty low, naval battles looks too awkward (well, at least for me, but I am not a fan of TW naval battles at all, I usually use to just skip them). Also it's very annoying that you have no option to move your units on a global map or just hire them without a general. I personally have some feeling of a lack of technology developement, economical action and buildings functionality deepness - it's so easy to imagine some additional features and functions for these aspects that could make the game more deep, interesting and historically accurate, however the developers decided to make it just more simple, that's why the game becomes a little boring on a global map. That is also pretty weird that you are not allowed to check the ""4 turns for a year"" option by default. It is available as a custom mod in a workshop, however your agents become overpowered with this modification.Overall, Rome2 is really a very atmospheric and enjoyable game. Battles are so spectacular, graphics looks awesome. It has a large modding potential, just take a look on the workshop. UI is more logical and useful, comparing with the previous games of the series. There are a lot of units and factions, that makes Rome2 a very replayable game. Diplomacy works even better than I expected. A lot of multiplayer options..If you bought the game just as soon as it was released and you was dissapointed by all these bugs, game balance and AI issues, let me give you a piece of advice not to do so and wait until a game is fully tested by the early-buyers and polished by the developers with the early-buyers's feedback help. It's just as simple as that - if you don't want to be disappointed with a game you are waiting, just dont buy it too early and wait for some patches to make it finished, developers nowadays usually don't release completely finished games.Also I wanted to say that SEGA sells the ""blood and gore"" DLC separately not just because of it's greed, but eventually mostly for avoiding the original game from getting the mature rating.

												I have to say when I reviewed this game I give it a NO. But I have to say Emperor Edition really made it better. Still don't like how all the dlc cost more then the game it self. The modding are good but not a lot of good ones out there. Some thing they fix they should of not Like the garrison they made it lower. Love the new politics <Still wish they did something for Rome to be with the Senate> Also for Rome should be able to cheang there Color to the house you pick. The Ai is a lot better In my roman co-op as we where going to in germania they made a confederations and pushed us back to the ALPS so we had a hard and long war just to take back Gaul and some of Germania. When I see rome 2 Community saying that AI still sucks I have one word STOP PLAYING ON EASY. I love how the AI goes for the capture points and making me and my friend fell back in the citys roads. Love how the AI no longer run cav in pikes any more. Diplomacy can still use some work tryed to pay this one gay 5000 for a trade but he turned it down ?.?. The Navy battles are a lot more fun now that land armys can not beat Navys. I love how the buff the archers but wish they added archer to ever one( but thats what mods are for). They should add a turn timer to the game  where it can take 2 turns for a year to pass or 4 or 8 or 12 what ever you like. I think they should add more build slots Don't like how towns/citys do not have full building slots been waiting for a mod to add full build slots but nope I what the videos back when a spy try to kill some one and that. Also for Speeches made by generals befor each battle.			"

												As a player who started the Total War franchise with Rome II, I love this game. The campaign and multiplayer aspects are fun and engaging, if time consuming. Yes, the game will crash every now and then, and in order to get the full experience, you need a very powerful computer. Sure the AI might not be the best, but is it ever? I think this game is much better than any of the other Total War games because of its massive potential, great graphics, features, gameplay, and UI.			"

												Great game! I have played all the total war games and each has its pros and cons. Rome II plays great, I really like how many factions there are and the politics that you have to deal with. Only being able to build troops with a general and not being able to leave troops to protect a city without that general always present has been difficult to get used to and makes protecting your citys difficult but it does give a new appreciation for stratigic placement of advancing armies and defending armies. One thing I was very disapointed with is not having any hero like troops who have special abilities and are really powerful like they had in Shogun 2. I really like to be able to get attatched to a couple of my troops trying to decide where they could be best used like you could with the hero units in Shogun 2. I thought champions would be like that and would appear on the battle field but this is not the case. Other than that, the game is great and I haven't experianced any bugs or problems with the game.			"

												This game has been really up and down for me, but I'll go into detail as to why. I love the TW series and have played everything from the original Rome to now. So I was obviously expecting some of the issues that arose around release involving lagging, video quality problems, crashing and AI difficulties. But those have thankfully been ironed out now, so we're left with a game that's stable, but more importantly, heavily moddable. Some of the things wrong with this game are easily fixed with some of the more popular mods available in the workshop, like the AI being completely incompetent at times, sailing their only fleet out to the middle of nowhere and leaving their capital undefended while you're camped on it with significant armies.I've found that it's very easy to get bored during some of the longer campaigns, because it's so simple to find yourself repeating strategies for different factions. You'll learn the best direction to expand in and subconscously follow it in most of your campaigns. It's a trap I fell into a few times and had to consciously avoid doing it to keep the game fresh. Try different things every game, different strategies, different directions. That's how I've gotten the most out of my time playing. The DLC's are good if you can get them on sale, I wouldn't recommend paying full price for any of them, The game in general is a lot of fun. The battles are realistic for the most part, the strategies you can employ are widespread and the unit diversity is good. The city/economy building is also a lot of fun, trying to find ways to stick a knife in someone's back while you're sharing a border and multiple allies is always an interesting struggle. There really is something for everyone in this game if you want to find it. I'll recommend it to anyone chasing a decent turn-based strategy.			"

												This is yet another incredible game in the Total war franchise that dare I say, challenges its pretecesor, Rome Total war, as the best stratefy game of that time period.  From great graphics to an easy battle interface and simple troop movement, it truely is one of the best.  The only downside I can find is that there is DLC, which should come with the game in my opinion.  Also, some countries, such as Sparta, are not playable in the campaign, even with DLC.  Other than that, it is overall a fantastic game.			"

(I'd recommend Hannibal at the Gates, for one.) Also, be sure to mod this game, and it'll prove to be fairly competent.			"

												In a game such as Rome II Total War you cannot give an accurate review without a detailed account of the ‘Spear Brothers’, one of the most revered,  blood thirsty and - at times - gangrenous of all the units in this medieval role-play-simulation game. If the Brothers of the Spear were not written into the game, we would likely never have seen the likes of the Total War franchise; it is said that Tim Ansell, the mastermind behind Creative Assembly who developed the game in 1987, had a dream were the Suebian Spear Brothers came to him in the night, laden with documented plans for the creation of such a game series. Whether this is entirely true or not we cannot be sure, but we can be sure that the Spear Brothers will continue to inspire a generation of video game players, young, old and even those not born yet.The Germanic tribe of the Spear Brothers is a tribe hardened by horrific war. At the time of Rome II, iron supplies - especially in West Germany - were very sparse. It is no surprise then that the Spear Brothers, the mighty warriors, were given priority of the metal for their dreaded ‘Spear Brother Spears’ or ‘framea’ in their own tongue. It is murmured in legend that the larger the man, the larger the spear. We have no reason yet to doubt this, according to the many geophys surveys that have been undertaken to find the truth of these giants of the battlefield.It would be a crime to end this review without mentioning the battle cry of the Spear Brothers, due indeed to the fact that few have ever survived it. One account comes from a Briton monk, Jasper, who whilst riding Maurice, his donkey into battle, witnessed the most ferocious and worrisome cry he had ever heard from the mouths of the Brothers of the Spear who he was gradually trotting towards. He could see the blood spurting from the ears of his own brothers, drenching each other in crimson pain. The horses were bleeding too while they manically ran into each other. Jasper, who now believed he was entering the blood and fire occupied Seventh Circle of Hell, only survived because when he eventually reached the front line, all the Britons were dead and the Spear Brothers had gone back to their tribes with haste, blood thirsty for more combat with their own peoples. The tale goes that Jasper lived the rest of his reasonably long life with Maurice, entrenched somewhere in the Aiguilles d'Arves in France, safe from the devilry of the Barbarians. It is said descendants of the Spear Brothers (SB) continue fighting, albeit virtually; if you are lucky enough to encounter one, be wary, hold fast and please remember ‘The Story of Jasper & Maurice’.

												First i want to say this is one of the few games i've played that you can actualy play again with a reply value even after you beat it more then once, there are so many factions to choose from and ways to beat the game, if you want to rule the world (the roman world that is) as a tradeing super power you can, you want to be a political super power you can, and if you want to make it simple and just smash all your enemies beneath your soldiers boots......guess what! you can! so if you love a good stratagy game and have time to put into it this is your game. I think the only thing that can make this game one people would turn away from is how long a campaign can last. i played one story for over a week! i have over 400+ hours on this game over a long period of time and i will keep coming back over and over!

												From a general who became ""Emperor"", to a emperor who became the ""Tyrant"", to  a tyrant who became bored from no more allies to annex and real estate or trade to conquer and lack of enemies to crush before the might of Roman hordes....10/10 I'd reign dominion and get bored again.

This one is my favorite, but not necessarily the best, its true that it has bugs and that its very expensive, but the attention to details is amazing and the graphics are pretty good, plus the AI can also be very challenging. Overall this is a must have for any tactical or strategy gamer, however I recommend to wait for a sale like the Christmas sale or the Summer sale because getting this at 54,99 € is not a smart idea, and it could drive you mad that you spent 54,99 on this ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; and then you are going to write a bad review.

												Even though this is not my favorite setting / timeframe, this is my favorite Total War.The controls and interface feel a lot smoother for me; I used to feel like every battle in Empire or Shogun was a struggle against the game controls and UI, but I don't have this problem in R:TW2 anymore.The campaign map is huge with a large variety of playable factions - and the DLCs add extra campaigns and even more factions. There's no hard time limit, and the game doesn't feel as much of a race as previous TW felt. The dinasty and culture systems are really interesting and add some extra depth to the strategical side of the game.			"

A fairly decent computer is needed to run it well on high settings especially during really large battles (there will be alot of them). They are releaseing updates for it fairly regually so the bugs are quickly being ironed out.If your a fan of the total war series or of Rome then i recommend this gamemy overall score for it 7/10			"

												EDIT: I initially wrote this review two months after Rome 2 was released, which I think is obvious given my reaction to it. Total War games are, since Empire, not known for being in a particularly high-quality state at launch, but Rome 2 really took the biscuit. It was dreadful.Anyway, fast forward seven months. It's almost the end of June now, and Rome 2 has received 13 patches to date, as well as two main DLC expansions and several ""free-LC"" updates. The second of those major DLC expansions, Hannibal At The Gates, brought me back to Rome 2, and I have to say that the state of the game is far improved. Those awful ""capture the flag"" bits are gone, the technical performance of the game is better, there are more factions, more units, more features, more everything. The HatG mini-campaign is (annoying Agents aside) about as close to a perfect Total War campaign as I could ask for, and the factions are more balanced. Those unbearable turn-load times I mentioned before? Dealt with. Basically almost everything has been improved.There're still some glaring errors- siege AI remains fundamentally thick-headed, naval battles are still dogged by the AI insisting on clumping all its ships together in a mess when it regroups, and the policy of charging for factions still makes me sick- but the game is in a state where it can be played and enjoyed. That mod that brings the original Rome music into the game is brilliant too!I've left the original review below.* * * * * * * *Given how much I was looking forward to this after the first Rome game, Rome 2 is disappointment in video game form. Technical issues have abounded from day 1- it looks like I've got over 100 hours logged, but most of that was spent waiting for the AI to take its turns. Though this and many other issues have since been patched, it's a mark of how important it is for a game to launch with at least a pretence of smoothness: I haven't gone back to Rome 2 in a month. It's not just the bugs that have killed my enjoyment, it's some quite fundamental alterations to the way the game plays as well as some baffling design choices. As usual, the game lacks difficulty after a certain point, and the game's attempt to introduce a mid/late-game challenge is to spawn rebels with inexplicable amounts of troops instead of, say, actually building up enemies to be a threat. Agents are more of an irritation than anything else; the AI seems to prefer a bunch of smaller armies instead of larger ones that makes fighting them more akin to a game of whack-a-mole than anything else; multiplayer has been utterly eviscerated since Shogun 2. There are some bright spots: the new cinematic mode makes engagements a joy to watch, for instance, and the army traditions help breed attachment to your forces and can lead to some nice emerging stories. Unfortunately this is nowhere near enough to make up for the disappointment of everything else- the AI, the design choices, the multiplayer, the loathesome attitude towards DLC. Avoid if at all possible.			"

												With all of the talk going on around this game when it was released, people were not happy. Bugs, glorious bugs everywhere and people demanded quick fixes. It took a while with lots of patches coming out over the next month or so but now, i believe the game is at the quality everyone expected back at launch. to be fair, i thought it reached that point a few weeks back but i wanted to be sure before writing a review.I highly recommend this game to anyone who as every played any total war games before and even if you havent, anyone who has played a strategy game will find this game one of the most amazing strategy games around. I've played many hours on this game and still am I nowhere close to finished. Its a great game full of long and different content, which if you play the same content over again e.g. Romes faction. you'll find a different outcome to your previous game.			"

												One of the better games in the franchise, I`d like to say. Sadly, every Total War game is good, more or less. Yes yes, there are some aspect every now and then that could have been improved upon or some mechanic that did not work as intended, but looking at it`s completeness; Well made.Total War: Rome II is a strategy game that incorperates aspects of both RTS (Real Time Strategy) and turn based gameplay. Think of it as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of King Sid Meier (Civilization) and harlot Westwood Studios (Command&Conquer) with some EA-phylis on top.You play on a world map (Well, THE world map.) and control a faction representing historical nations/tribes and so forth during this timeperiod. You micro manage cities in a rather simple format, controlling influx of trade, food, slaves and all other things that makes the world go around. You do this by building different buildings, stomping uneducated Gauls into the dirt and the occasional diplomacy (Aka, siege engines).The game is a rather realistic depictation of roman era warfare and the amount of different units and their intricacies is staggering. + beachhead battles? The D(day) is strong in this one.If you enjoy entertaining the idea of forming shieldwalls, javelin/archer crossfire and the occasional barbarian-balls-to-the-walls-with-big-two-handed-swords charge, then this game is for you.My most enjoyed game in the franchise is most definitely Total War: Rome, with Shogun so close behind that it`s hard to differentiate. I enjoyed Shogun a tad bit more than Rome II because of the weaponry. I`d like to point out: I love archers. Archers is love, archers is life. If I become a dad, I am naming my son: Archer, or it`s fairer twin: Archerette.♥♥♥♥ THE ROMANS AND THEIR GOD DAMN JAVELINS! Not that they aren´t as effective, if not more so.Why are you still reading this wall of text!? Go topple some walls already! Buy buy buy!			"

Posted: January 10, 2015
												I really wanted to like this game. I've been playing Total War games since Rome 1 and I'm a big fan of the series. That said, this series has fallen a long way and is nowhere near what it used to be. It is tedious, clunky, and not very much fun.Honestly, I'd start with some positives, but there isn't really anything in this game that hasn't been done in other TW games and done better. If it were anything, I'd say the way you now have some control over how your generals develop and the army levelling system that adds a bit of tradition and character to your armies and navies.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The game overview map is the first thing you have to deal with and it is poor. It looks about as good as Medieval 2 did, maybe worse. Add to that the fact that you have to go to an entirely different map mode in order to zoom out and it's a step back. Army movement is cumbersome and although the different movement types seem like a good idea at first, you'll be super annoyed when your army gets ambushed because you forgot to go back to a regular stance. Cities look decent and change as you build certain buildings so that's a nice touch but not exactly ground-breaking stuff.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next up is the completely useless politics system. You can pretty much ignore this feature of the game. It is one of the least immersive aspects of gameplay I can remember from any game, ever. If you play as Rome you will control one of three factions, all with their own perks and drawbacks. Within this system, you can gain power against other houses and gain promotions for members of your faction which provide more perks. All of your generals and admirals will come from these characters. All sounds interesting until you actually start playing the game and realize that absolutely none of this matters. Press a button, get perks. Press another button, lose perks. And to totally honest, with all the other numbers and stats flying around, you'll never notice or really care if your army recruitment costs are reduced by 3% because one of your characters became quaestor. The character system from Rome 1 and Medieval 2 had more depth to them and they weren't all that particularly deep to begin with.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next up is provinces, cities, and army recruitment. Another step back. The province system was, once again, a decent concept that was very poorly implemented. Basically, each province contains anywhere between 2-4 cities. There is a provincial capital and the rest are minor settlements. If you own each settlement in a province, you can enact an edict which gives you yet another perk. Of course you have to manage public order. Within cities themselves, you have a limited number of buildings you can build in each one. After awhile, the combination of buildings that you need becomes very dull and formulaic. Each minor settlement needs a farm. Each province needs a temple for every 2 settlements. You'll end up building all trading ports and market settlements as the interior of your empire becomes more secure. You'll end up going through and removing all military buildings because there's no point having a barracks in Carthage when you own 100% of Northern Africa. Tedious. Boring. And don't get me started on how completely asinine army recruitment is now. You no longer recruit through the cities  but directly into the armies themselves as long as you are located in controlled territory. Not only is this pretty unintuitive, it's also never explicitly mentioned if all the military buildings in your province have an effect on one another or only units that come from that city. I'm sure I could have found out but with all the different things affecting your troops, it really wasn't worth knowing.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Diplomacy in this game is also a joke. There is no depth to it (which isn't exactly a new problem for TW games). Still though, it would be nice if it were possible to interact more with other nations and if states that were Reliable played like they were reliable and Devious nations played like they were Devious. Honestly, it feels like Diplomacy is just a waste of time since you're just going to crush them in a few turns anyway. Maybe I'm a little spoiled here coming from Europa Universalis but diplomacy in a grand strategy game is kind of important.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Now for the supposed bread and butter of this series, the battles. Possibly the most disappointing part of this game. The graphics are not good quality. Troops look alright but the environment is terrible and don't make sense. Take a look around and you start to wonder how it's possible you're fighting on a completely flat plain with a 10,000 ft mountain off in the distance every single time. The sound is bad and you'll hear and remember everything the characters have to say after 2 battles. Lack of any remotely effective range weapons really makes the battles stale. You won't even use Velites after awhile because all they do is rout or skirmish behind your lines and then throw spears into the backs of your principes because you forgot to turn Fire At WIll mode off. Cities are pretty cookie cutter with little variety. It will feel like every time you just march your infantry in, rout the enemy, then chase them down with your Equites. Pretty much every single time. It definitely does not help that there are shockingly few varieties of units. All in all, the battles are just not fun and you'll probably end up auto-resolving quite a few.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I bought this game for $15 on the last day of the Steam Holiday Sale. I told myself to wait because I knew there was a high probability that I would not enjoy this game. I was right. I'm not upset at the money I spent on it. What I'm really upset about is just how disappointed I am in this game. It's really making me question whether or not there was anything all that special about the TW games I played in the past. Paradox Interactive is really pushing the frontier on strategy games at the moment and without the joy of the battles in TW, what you're basically playing is a crappy, buggy version of one of those games. I cannot discourage everyone from buying this game strongly enough. I think some people could find it fun, but there are so many better games out there that you should really look for one of those. Technology, competition, and time have far surpassed anything that Creative Assembly have come up with for awhile now and they are most certainly trading solely on their past glories. I will never buy one of their games ever again. :(			"

												Has taken me more than year to be able to conjure up a review, and I'm still not overly sure. My sessions still often end in ""Rome II has unexpectedly crashed,"" I have unmodded legendary saves that won't load, and I cannot play for nearly as long as on the original Rome without getting bored.My main concern is that my current legendary campaign, although almost complete, is no fun at all. Diplomacy on legendary seems to be something that escapes me: factions half way across the map declare war for no reason when I have good integrity and it is near impossible to sue for peace with anybody but, if you do, they often declare war again a few turns later. The battles are not neccessary challenging but the constant spam of agents and armies from every side make it such a grind to make progress. CA said they were limiting armies to make battles more meaningful with bigger impact; however, with a restricted number of armies, it just turns into mine being holed up, fighting many meaningless battles that take a couple of turns to recover from, with enemy agents constantly limiting their movement!The modding community is, for me, the only thing that rescues this game as most of the crappy features in the original (save politics, family trees, and awful unit collision/charging) can be altered. Admittedly, a lot has been fixed since release, but there are still many things that seem inherantly broken to many paople; I really think I only play because of my interest in the time period, and due to a huge amount or nostalgia for Rome I.

												I've played this game for about 270 hours and i've loved every second. The learning curve can make the game seem hard or off putting, but once you learn the basics and a blast, and with hundreds of mods, and a still active muliplayer community the game's still very fun and easily my second favorite total war. :)			"

												As a player who started the Total War franchise with Rome II, I love this game. The campaign and multiplayer aspects are fun and engaging, if time consuming. Yes, the game will crash every now and then, and in order to get the full experience, you need a very powerful computer. Sure the AI might not be the best, but is it ever? I think this game is much better than any of the other Total War games because of its massive potential, great graphics, features, gameplay, and UI.			"

												I bought this game for my crappy mac, and it would not run. Since this game looked AWESOME (PS, it is!), I decided to spend around $600 to build a desktop. After three hours of video watching, manual reading, and carefull deliberation, I suceeded in building it. This game runs smoothly with max settings on my pc and is DEFINITLY worth buying! Total War is Love, Total War is Life. Buy or Die. I rate 8/8, great job mate!I didn't build the pc just for this though.			"

												I bought this on release, and was sorely dissappointed. AI was broken, the UI was irritating, the small number or armies and unit choices made strategic choices non existent (every army had exactly the same makeup).I recently reinstalled it to see if anything had changed. It hasnt. This game is still vastly inferior to Rome:Total War 1 in every way except graphics. AI is still broken. Strategic choies are still non-existent. Skip it. Go back and buy Rome;Total War 1 if you havn't already.			"

												In the years that this game has been out I still to this day have to play it on the lowest settings. My rig I thought would totally destroy the requirements for this game:Nvidia GTX 680 4GB superclockedAMD 8150 3.6 Ghz eight core32gb of ram (16gb usable)Windows 7Playing at 1080pBut no this game is still nearly unplayable at every turn and being a HUGE fan of the original Rome Total War I have to say that this was a huge let down. I thought it would be fixed I didn't buy it for nearly a year because of the terrible launch of this game. Also the fact that there is 85 dollars in dlc is absolutely absurd and the fact that some of these dlc came out back in the day when it was unplayable for nearly everyone. To me this game isn't even worth buying on sale unless you KNOW for a fact that you can play it. I'm guessing my major issue is that I have an AMD processor and this game only seems to be optimized for Intel processors which is also insane because a lot of the market uses AMD so another mistake by this once great company. I hope this review helped some people I know it was nothing about the game but to be honest I can't really play it that well sooooo theres no reason to say anything about it.			"

												TL:DR:  8/10I pre-ordered Total War Rome II but only just started playing the game due to the amount of negative backlash levied at the game from launch. Now I have finally started to play the game and I have really enjoyed it - but I should note that I am not playing the purely ""vanilla"" version of Rome II. After much reading I decided to download Toons' ""All in One Mod"" for Rome II and it is really good. So please note that my subsequent comments are coloured by having played the mod.Rome II does some things really well compared to previous Total War games (of which I have played most of them). I really like how the Auto Resolve for battles has been addressed, whereby it shows you the likelihood of victory based on the battle stance you take (aggressive, balanced, defensive) and also the percentage of troops you will have left for each choice. The enemy AI is also well balanced and fights well in the field battles as well as on the diplomatic side of things. I really liked the addition of the Pros and Cons listed by each faction for why they like or dislike your nation. This made it much simpler to determine why they might reject an offer as opposed to past TW games where it was infuriating to be rejected and not understand why. Having naval support during battles is a nice touch also and builds upon the naval warfare introduced in Empire, even if it's still quite clunky at times.The Spies and Heroes/Champions are also much better designed in this game than the previous Rome and Empire. Now you can assign perks to the individual agents and level them up as you desire. I remember thinking in Empire ""What is the point of the spy! His chances of assassinating someone is barely 20%!"" Now I have used them to great effect in weakening cities, garrisons and travelling armies. A great improvement all round!There is also much more opportunities to conduct war in the political arena with assassinations and securing promotions etc. This has been greatly expanded from Empire and the previous Rome and adds a broader dimension to the game.One thing that I don't like so much is the way armies can be split and travel. It is impossible (as far as I can see) to transport troops from one army to another unless the General travels with them in tow. This may well be more thematic but I feel that it hinders the game play a bit. I also completely disagree with CA's decision to make this such a DLC heavy title/franchise. Some additional campaigns and so on are fine as added DLC to me but adding a Blood and Gore mode and other minor aesthetic changes that were already in the game files and just required ""activation"" is ridiculous. Companies need to stop selling us half-completed games! But all in all I thoroughly recommend Rome II - especially if you seek out a mod like I did. 8/10			"

												Do not by this game.I'll start with some of the good points.- The graphics i think are very good, both in battles and on the campaign map but mainly in the battles with the close ups on individal soldiers, effects and looking on the battle as a whole.-Diffrent factions- unlike shogun 2 for example the factions all have different soldiers and there are loads of them giving the game much more re-playability.-there is loads of strategy involved and you can control your faction in loads of different aspects (if you like that kind of thing) .Now why you shouldn't buy it. unlike many people my problem with it is not the early software issues or how the soldiers fight or anything so detailed in the gamplay. My problem with it is much worse, it is incredibly boring.-The politics and all that is fantasticly dull and is way too complicated, especially if your playing as Rome.-The game is really restrictive in how you can play. In old TW games you could have as many armies as you like. The games  were much less complex. In Rome 2 your number of armies is limited based on the size of your empire and those armies have to have generals. This leads on to the fact that the generals are too important and complicated and i couldn't care less about them.-It takes ages to do anything. You have to spend about 2 hours playing each battle endlessly pausing and playing and, God, the clicking, so much clicking. Then you finish the battle and re-enter the misery of the campaign where you cannot, due to the army limit and the fact that settlements take so long to become happy after being captured, capture any more settlements in less than about 79 million turns.-There's just too much to think about when your playing. Food supplies, people's happiness, technology and buildings, politics and diplomacy, generals, armies, settlements, recruitment, navies, it goes on forever.Basicly the game is too complicated and boring for most human mortals.

												First i want to say this is one of the few games i've played that you can actualy play again with a reply value even after you beat it more then once, there are so many factions to choose from and ways to beat the game, if you want to rule the world (the roman world that is) as a tradeing super power you can, you want to be a political super power you can, and if you want to make it simple and just smash all your enemies beneath your soldiers boots......guess what! you can! so if you love a good stratagy game and have time to put into it this is your game. I think the only thing that can make this game one people would turn away from is how long a campaign can last. i played one story for over a week! i have over 400+ hours on this game over a long period of time and i will keep coming back over and over!

												Total War: Rome 2 has developed in to something very enjoyable for the ones interested in the total war genre and time period. After the Emperor Edition update the game really feels polished enough to uncover the core experience. The glaring issues have been washed away mostly and there remains a core idea of the game that somewhat works enough to enjoy it.Heavily recommended for the fans of this time period. Seeing the nations you read about or watch in movies or TV series in action with nice graphics and a good turn based system is a great experience. Rome 2 could have been another great game like Shogun 2. It didn't end up going that high up in the quality scale but that doesn't mean that it is not a very good game.Must play for the fans of the time period and the total war series.85/100			"

												Ok so were do i start. I wouldnt say i recommend this game, because although i have over 150 hours on it, i felt that it wasnt worth that amount of money, maybe 30 dollars at the time. Its a way easier game than any other total war series game, the AI is stupid. On the 6 or 7 campaigns i hace played, no more tan 10 times the AI attacked my cities, but only when there were no soldiers on them. Also, the AI army is very basic. You will never found a high rank army with the best units on an AI army that can be at least a match for you, but mostly levy pikemen and scouts and so on. It is very easy to win, the only thing is that it takes time to conquer all the provinces. It is truly amazing how stupid they are. It seems that major factions are always on the defensive strategy, as they are weak and stepped on by smaller factions. Jesus what a waste of 50 dollars. But hey, i love being a Roman and conquering everyone, and the graphics are awesome. Maybe by playing at legendary difficulty it can be a good gamne			"

As for the game you have the oportunity to re wrigh History of the anchien world , you can see powers such Athens - Sparta - Macedonia Kinghtom to change the fate of Hellas and became what history denied to them . Looking forward for more Historical times from Total war series , Keep on make the people to love history seeking it and learn it from a game .... so non unhistorical people being in our times that believe false efects and false statments that their coverments trying to make them believe .

												Ran horribly badly on my Mac. All the banners would get stuck as black boxes on screen until I couldn't see what was going on at all. Tried different graphics settings to no avail. Moving the camera around was awkward at best and a disaster at worst. Fine that it pans and you can move forward and back, but there appeared to be no way to rotate the camera. Then sometimes the camera would take off moving on it's own and I wouldn't be able to control where it was going at all. Also didn't really seem to be much of a strategy to the game, Just move your units around and attack. Maybe it gets better further into the game, but I found it simplistic. With all the other problems, it wasn't worth trying to continue on with it very far.  Needless to say, I deleted the game before even finishing the prologue. Glad it was a free weekend and I didn't purchase this, but can't recommend any other Mac user make the purchase.			"

												I have never been very keen on Tactical/Strategy games.  Not because they're bad, I am usually bad at them.  But when I checked out Heir of Carthage playing this I was very impressed with the details and I just had to buy it for myself!The game is super fun, being complex in every-way.  You really have to spend time learning the different aspects such as Politics, Diplomacy, Warefare and Economy command.  I have just under 80 hours on my belt and I have yet to fully understand the mechanics of Rome 2.  It's a fun filled investment!Unfortunately, there are some really cool factions, such as Sparta and Athens that you would like to play that you cannot unless you purchase over-priced DLC.  Sparta are a faction in the Grand Campaign yet are unplayable.  I honestly find this mindblowingly frustrating!  I paid £9.99 for Wrath of Sparta and wrongly assumed that would unlock Sparta to play in the Grand Campaign.  Turns out this is incorrect and extra DLC must be purchased.  I personally would prefer CA creating the full game without the DLC so when we purchase Rome 2, it feels like the full game.			"

												I think it's a really good game, one of my favorites... I can only recommend it, if you like history and strategy games this game is for you.If you have a strong PC, and money than buy it, it has a very long and good campain, and a good multiplayer mode.Tha only things I hate, are the DLCs, and that's why i don't buy this game... but still recommend it			"

												Right now, sure the game is way better as compared to the launch version, boy I had a load of fun from that one. Still wait for sales, I suggest 75% and above, then just grab all the content for a low price. Now at that point, this game is worth that price mark. I find that none of the DLC is worth their pricing. But hey it's a solid RTS so sure.			"

												I have thoroughly enjoyed rome 2, but at the same time this could have been so much better. I never played rome 1 or medieval to death and maybe that explains why i'm not constantly feeling cheated at the game just blatantly not being as good as those. Everything is beautifully presented on the map, the icons and the buildings etc, but this games problems are not interface related. For starters, the warface engine used in the battles destroys the experience in battle. Infact the only fun i have in these anymore is either A) Using my OP units or B) performing basic battle tactics....almost all of which are enough to outmanouevre the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI.Combat is completely broken. The engine insists on having men perform 'kill moves' in completely scripted stab then withdraw scenes.....instead of just stabbing the ♥♥♥♥ing guy infront of you to death quickly and efficiently. The roman and barbarian, eastern and hellenic units all fight thus in the same basic way- the only way to break the deadlock in the later stages of the campaign on VH or legendary ( After you've butchered you're way through the customaryshockingly bad start faction surrounding your home province ) is to get more and more OP Units which eventually spoil all the fun of combat in the first place. With no family trees, you're practically invited to use a 4 turn per year mod in order to get better invested in their life and victories....but all this does is make them massively overpowered, twice i fought large scale battles outside alexandria against full stacks of egyptians and both their commanders were level 10. This from a faction that hadnt actually gained another full province in the first 90 turns....they just sat in their homeland accruing tarits and getting more and more unbalanced.The building system is poorly explained at the start ( not helped by the terrible encyclopaedia system) and the whole system of commerce/politics not really explained. My seleucid campaign was eventually ruined/spoiled after i conquered an african tribes final city in about turn 10. this conatined one of their own factional military buildings.....yet somehow allowed me to recruit silver shield swordsmen and royal cataphracts - massively OP late game units.Agents are totally overpowered. As a consequence i now find myself agent spamming on every save i do....simply because they are broken on this game. DO NOT USE 4 turns per and then use agents. The spies ability to 'poison provisions' in an enemy army- sometimes killing as many as 400-500 men, and the champions 'raid' ability ( inflicting damage to every building in a town or city) are just some of the highlights. By the end of the game they are more powerful than standing armies.The online unfortunately loses the avatar conquest features from shogun 2, which i personally enjoyed. Yes the try -  harding some people were willing to go to just to level up a smidge more was just unenjoyable, but i still felt the game benefitted. Online battles are still fun, but ( in a similar way to medieval 2 and particularly shogun 2) are often decided by whoevers overpowered units perform better in the long run. In the hands of a competent ( slightly evil ) player the syrian armoured elephant is capable of such destruction as to be utterly ridiculous. This made all the more galling ofcourse by the fact thet whenever the ai has control of them they seldom get 25 kills.....Ultimately this game is not as good as rome 1 in alomst all comparable things. Shogun got a bit of a free ride because of its beautiful presentation-though the combat was still broken, though this game was robbed of that because of the state of the ai and presentation at launch.I dont want to give it any kind of rating as i hate scores but at the end of the day if you are new to TW you should not be playing this first when rome 1 and medieval 2 exist, unless you're a graphical manic like me.Ps. The expansions to this game , caesar in gaul and hannibal are very good, adding interesting new factions and different settings obviously...but would have benefitted from some napoleon esque scripting in their layout- rome for example are 9 times out 10 hammered in CIG by all the ten-a-penny barbarian factions, spoiling the expansion a tad.

The animation and the combat looks amazing especially when you throw a few more bucks into the blood and gore DLC. The only problem I have with the game is the lack of a Free For All gamemode which was probably the best gamemode in the game. but this game is a definite buy!			"

												First i want to say this is one of the few games i've played that you can actualy play again with a reply value even after you beat it more then once, there are so many factions to choose from and ways to beat the game, if you want to rule the world (the roman world that is) as a tradeing super power you can, you want to be a political super power you can, and if you want to make it simple and just smash all your enemies beneath your soldiers boots......guess what! you can! so if you love a good stratagy game and have time to put into it this is your game. I think the only thing that can make this game one people would turn away from is how long a campaign can last. i played one story for over a week! i have over 400+ hours on this game over a long period of time and i will keep coming back over and over!

												Total War: Rome 2 has developed in to something very enjoyable for the ones interested in the total war genre and time period. After the Emperor Edition update the game really feels polished enough to uncover the core experience. The glaring issues have been washed away mostly and there remains a core idea of the game that somewhat works enough to enjoy it.Heavily recommended for the fans of this time period. Seeing the nations you read about or watch in movies or TV series in action with nice graphics and a good turn based system is a great experience. Rome 2 could have been another great game like Shogun 2. It didn't end up going that high up in the quality scale but that doesn't mean that it is not a very good game.Must play for the fans of the time period and the total war series.85/100			"

												TL:DR:  8/10I pre-ordered Total War Rome II but only just started playing the game due to the amount of negative backlash levied at the game from launch. Now I have finally started to play the game and I have really enjoyed it - but I should note that I am not playing the purely ""vanilla"" version of Rome II. After much reading I decided to download Toons' ""All in One Mod"" for Rome II and it is really good. So please note that my subsequent comments are coloured by having played the mod.Rome II does some things really well compared to previous Total War games (of which I have played most of them). I really like how the Auto Resolve for battles has been addressed, whereby it shows you the likelihood of victory based on the battle stance you take (aggressive, balanced, defensive) and also the percentage of troops you will have left for each choice. The enemy AI is also well balanced and fights well in the field battles as well as on the diplomatic side of things. I really liked the addition of the Pros and Cons listed by each faction for why they like or dislike your nation. This made it much simpler to determine why they might reject an offer as opposed to past TW games where it was infuriating to be rejected and not understand why. Having naval support during battles is a nice touch also and builds upon the naval warfare introduced in Empire, even if it's still quite clunky at times.The Spies and Heroes/Champions are also much better designed in this game than the previous Rome and Empire. Now you can assign perks to the individual agents and level them up as you desire. I remember thinking in Empire ""What is the point of the spy! His chances of assassinating someone is barely 20%!"" Now I have used them to great effect in weakening cities, garrisons and travelling armies. A great improvement all round!There is also much more opportunities to conduct war in the political arena with assassinations and securing promotions etc. This has been greatly expanded from Empire and the previous Rome and adds a broader dimension to the game.One thing that I don't like so much is the way armies can be split and travel. It is impossible (as far as I can see) to transport troops from one army to another unless the General travels with them in tow. This may well be more thematic but I feel that it hinders the game play a bit. I also completely disagree with CA's decision to make this such a DLC heavy title/franchise. Some additional campaigns and so on are fine as added DLC to me but adding a Blood and Gore mode and other minor aesthetic changes that were already in the game files and just required ""activation"" is ridiculous. Companies need to stop selling us half-completed games! But all in all I thoroughly recommend Rome II - especially if you seek out a mod like I did. 8/10			"

												Ok so were do i start. I wouldnt say i recommend this game, because although i have over 150 hours on it, i felt that it wasnt worth that amount of money, maybe 30 dollars at the time. Its a way easier game than any other total war series game, the AI is stupid. On the 6 or 7 campaigns i hace played, no more tan 10 times the AI attacked my cities, but only when there were no soldiers on them. Also, the AI army is very basic. You will never found a high rank army with the best units on an AI army that can be at least a match for you, but mostly levy pikemen and scouts and so on. It is very easy to win, the only thing is that it takes time to conquer all the provinces. It is truly amazing how stupid they are. It seems that major factions are always on the defensive strategy, as they are weak and stepped on by smaller factions. Jesus what a waste of 50 dollars. But hey, i love being a Roman and conquering everyone, and the graphics are awesome. Maybe by playing at legendary difficulty it can be a good gamne			"

												Do not by this game.I'll start with some of the good points.- The graphics i think are very good, both in battles and on the campaign map but mainly in the battles with the close ups on individal soldiers, effects and looking on the battle as a whole.-Diffrent factions- unlike shogun 2 for example the factions all have different soldiers and there are loads of them giving the game much more re-playability.-there is loads of strategy involved and you can control your faction in loads of different aspects (if you like that kind of thing) .Now why you shouldn't buy it. unlike many people my problem with it is not the early software issues or how the soldiers fight or anything so detailed in the gamplay. My problem with it is much worse, it is incredibly boring.-The politics and all that is fantasticly dull and is way too complicated, especially if your playing as Rome.-The game is really restrictive in how you can play. In old TW games you could have as many armies as you like. The games  were much less complex. In Rome 2 your number of armies is limited based on the size of your empire and those armies have to have generals. This leads on to the fact that the generals are too important and complicated and i couldn't care less about them.-It takes ages to do anything. You have to spend about 2 hours playing each battle endlessly pausing and playing and, God, the clicking, so much clicking. Then you finish the battle and re-enter the misery of the campaign where you cannot, due to the army limit and the fact that settlements take so long to become happy after being captured, capture any more settlements in less than about 79 million turns.-There's just too much to think about when your playing. Food supplies, people's happiness, technology and buildings, politics and diplomacy, generals, armies, settlements, recruitment, navies, it goes on forever.Basicly the game is too complicated and boring for most human mortals.

												Rome II is both a grand strategy turn-based game, as well as RTS. In Rome II's campaign you have the option to select from several different classical civilizations, each with their own advantaged and disadvantages. The campaign operates like any other total war game. You must balance economy, diplomacy, military and navy, and now in Rome II, politics. Territories have changed since previous total war games. Now several territories are grouped together in provinces in order to help manage them more efficient. Players must also be able to balance public squalor, and food in their nation. Public squalor has a negative effect and can lead to revolts. A way to combat this is to build certain shrines, entertainment buildings (like a coliseum), or public sources to water like aquaducts and fountains for example. However some of these come at a price and will deplete your food storage. Many of the buildings have trade offs and benefits, but other buildings can be built to counteract these. Rome II was released unfinished, and littered with bugs, but since its release it has fixed many crucial issues making it a playable game. Not to mention the fact that there are a plethora of mods and addons out there that improve the game, or even change the game completely.>VERY IMPORTANT<This is a perspective of the single player gameplay in Rome II, not Multiplayer as I do not play MP.Gameplay 8/10+Game plays great now with few to no bugs that I have come across since its plauged release day. Most have been fixed or are undergoing fixes and balances.+The UI is a little more streamlined and cleaned up since other total war games, many buttons offer a drop down window with more options to select during the course of battle.+Line of Sight (LOS) system. Rome II offers a new LOS system in which terrain features can block the view of other units offering greater strategic gameplay (moving through forests or behind large hills to hide troops).+Vanilla Rome II (no addons) is relatively fast paced and has recieved negative reviews for its arcade like gameplay. However with addons battles can be more realistic and drawn out than Vanilla.+Tons of units to chose from for each nation, and even more with addons. It's a big improvement from Shogun 2 where you had the same type of units for almost all factions.+40 unit card battles - hugely epic-Vanilla Rome II battles are often shorter than they should be, too arcade-like.-UI can be a little too big during 40 unit card battlesAI (Battles and Campaign Map) 8/10+AI on campaign map are a little more aggressive than they were before. They are constantly creating armies and trying to push into your territory. (However on easier difficulties their armies are usually limited to a few. It's better to play on harder difficulties, more realistic)+AI on the RTS side seek high ground  when it's nearby. They do not go out of their way if it is far away to head to high ground (seen this happen in shogun 2).+AI on RTS side stay in formations, there is far less awkward jumbling of formations ebfore they charge at you.+In large battles the AI will look to flank you with cav and archers-You really have to play on harder difficulties for the AI to perform correctly and create multiple larger armies, and make intelligent decisions on the battlefield. This could be bad for newer players who are not familiar with RTS and grand scale strategy.-Sometimes during an attakc on a settlement, the AI's defending navy will land their forces further away than necessary and those forces will sit there on the beach.-Sometimes the AI will chose to smash into your lines on the battlefield and refuse to commit troops elseware to exploit a victory.-Sometimes after beating another regiment in battle, your unit will sit there and get attacked and not retaliate. ( A little more micro would be required- not a big deal but if you're getting attacked you don't just stand there).Visuals 10/10+Rome II is by far the most beautiful RTS game I've played to date.+Soldiers react to the flow of battle. If you are losing they will drag their feet and have their heads down looking tired and broken. While idle soldiers will cheer and taunt the enemy.+Generals will give a speech before battle. They will recognize the type of army you're facing whether it be barbarians, eastern empires, greeks, or north african empires. (the more you play Rome II the more boring these get since there are so few speeches)+Combat animations are awesome+Gore mod is not as exaggerated as it was in shogun 2. Looks more realistic. -You need to have a pretty top notch rig to run Rome II in high fps with top graphics regardless of what CA wanted (making it playable on any computer)DLC 3/10+Cool new units+Cool effects with gore mod+Fun new campaign-You should not have to pay for these small editions-The DLC content is stuff that was withheld from the release of Rome II in order for CA to make more money off their game. Really its stuff that should already be implemented in the game since day 1.Overall I think it has turned out to be a great game despite features in the DLC section that should have already been added since day 1. That being said, the gore dlc is understandable as releasing a game with a T rating (no gore) opens the game up to a greater audience. Releasing the gore after makes it M only if you buy the gore. All in all I can't wait to see what CA comes out with next.EDIT/UPDATE: Download Divide Et Impera, it makes the game 10x better with more indepth strategy, longer battles, and huge unit rosters.			"

												I am/was a big Total War fan. For the sake of this review I will ignore that the game had a terrible launch.First off the game is waaayy more playable with the patches, the campaign isn't a mess and is actually fun, the campaign works. Unfortunatly I don't play Total war for the campaign; I play Total War for the battles and Rome 2's battles are bad, not terrible just bad.First off the audio has not been improved the music sucks life out of the game and the voice acting is well Sh*t. The other sound effects (sword and shield clashes, marching etc) are good however I would prefer to hear someone screaming from being killed instead of the sound of metal clashing.The animations are rubbish, the kill moves are unrealistic; soldiers slide across the floor to set up for the moves and when they do the kill moves look staged. Also the soldiers can be killed by a none kill move or a simple stab however the soldier that died has the same animation as if he got hit by a projectile and this looks stupid. The soldiers rubberband (this is more obvious in slow motion). There is still no unit collision; the units stop in perferect synchronization when they ""clash"", also when you issue a order all of the soldiers in the unit respond at the same time like robots it is not realistic. When two spear units clash they leave a gap and only one or two soldiers in each unit will fight eachother. The User interface in the battles is still stupid they still use the art style for the units and there is no guard mode. There are many more issues with the game (like how the light can refelct off sand) but I can't be bothered to explain these issues do not buy this game or its dlc.			"

												Firstly, I am new to the Total war Series entirely. I have played CIV V (150Hrs), and the closest material I have in the way of experience to games like this. I did not play Rome TW 1, I jumped on the 75% off sale and have not played it much. What I have played speaks leaps and volumes about its performance as a whole.; its failure to intrigue someone and help them maintain interest is a complete failure. It was 2014 and you get character graphics on the adviser (just a head... A HEAD), portraits that the PS1 would out preform. There was little effort spent in polishing this game. I wish I could say it was just an aesthetic polishing I'm referring to, however I am not. There is a plethora of bugs, including but not limited to your units falling off the map. Hey that’s cool. Who needed the general anyway? Hah.... :(  Units doing nothing, not following orders, formation, or the like. I wish I could talk more on this, but I want to get to the huge flaw of this game. Its major issue: This game does not care about you. It's true. It will not help you, it will not give you the tools you need to move forward. It will be hard, it will not warn you, it will hate you, it will leave you cold and stranded at the bus stop as your fingertips are chilled by the ever so penetrating wind from its constant neglect. It will laugh, as you attempt to make sense of why you have to be a politician and lead the war. Why you have to delegate taxes, when you really just want to kill something. Why a game that looks like a glorified roman chess board turns out to be constant nail in the frontal lobe. Reminding you that you are not worth the effort to love, to care about, or it would have given you the tools to accomplish greatness, and the reason behind the reasoning of being a political dictator while you claim to protect the citizens you bleed dry to fund your growing ""empire"". The game is hideous, the game play is broken, also Rome hates you.  If the developers cared about anything beyond the initial purchase from you, it would have been a captivating experience on a progressive scale of understanding. Instead it assumes you have hopped on forums before purchase or that you will afterward, to make sense of anything. To spend 100 hours learning the game before you can play it. Instead of being able to learn as you go. If I wanted to spend more time in forums learning a game then playing it, I would play EvE online more.			"

												God game, amazing graphics and runs perfectly but can get repetative. I would recommend this for it's amazing battles and for Total War to count EVERY SOLDIER on the battlefeild, large campaign and the multiplayer but there are alot of issues aswell that needs to be fixed. The game is really easy even on legendary, it crashes frequently and the DLC comes to £60 ! I think that Total War just had another too many bad desisions and tried to make a money grabbing attempt at launch. The AI is terrible and the graphics aren't what are shown at the teasers. The Victory Points are a nightmare. The AI can just put all their troops there and just stay there not even attacking just waiting for the timer to tick down.Because i LOVED Empire so much, i can let this one of, FOR NOW.7/10 IGN Would be a Roman Again.

												In a game such as Rome II Total War you cannot give an accurate review without a detailed account of the ‘Spear Brothers’, one of the most revered,  blood thirsty and - at times - gangrenous of all the units in this medieval role-play-simulation game. If the Brothers of the Spear were not written into the game, we would likely never have seen the likes of the Total War franchise; it is said that Tim Ansell, the mastermind behind Creative Assembly who developed the game in 1987, had a dream were the Suebian Spear Brothers came to him in the night, laden with documented plans for the creation of such a game series. Whether this is entirely true or not we cannot be sure, but we can be sure that the Spear Brothers will continue to inspire a generation of video game players, young, old and even those not born yet.The Germanic tribe of the Spear Brothers is a tribe hardened by horrific war. At the time of Rome II, iron supplies - especially in West Germany - were very sparse. It is no surprise then that the Spear Brothers, the mighty warriors, were given priority of the metal for their dreaded ‘Spear Brother Spears’ or ‘framea’ in their own tongue. It is murmured in legend that the larger the man, the larger the spear. We have no reason yet to doubt this, according to the many geophys surveys that have been undertaken to find the truth of these giants of the battlefield.It would be a crime to end this review without mentioning the battle cry of the Spear Brothers, due indeed to the fact that few have ever survived it. One account comes from a Briton monk, Jasper, who whilst riding Maurice, his donkey into battle, witnessed the most ferocious and worrisome cry he had ever heard from the mouths of the Brothers of the Spear who he was gradually trotting towards. He could see the blood spurting from the ears of his own brothers, drenching each other in crimson pain. The horses were bleeding too while they manically ran into each other. Jasper, who now believed he was entering the blood and fire occupied Seventh Circle of Hell, only survived because when he eventually reached the front line, all the Britons were dead and the Spear Brothers had gone back to their tribes with haste, blood thirsty for more combat with their own peoples. The tale goes that Jasper lived the rest of his reasonably long life with Maurice, entrenched somewhere in the Aiguilles d'Arves in France, safe from the devilry of the Barbarians. It is said descendants of the Spear Brothers (SB) continue fighting, albeit virtually; if you are lucky enough to encounter one, be wary, hold fast and please remember ‘The Story of Jasper & Maurice’.

												Without a doubt, the sequel to the lauded Rome Total War pays homage to the spirit of it's predecesors. Despite a rocky release involving optimization & gameplay problems, the studio stuck with it and not only released a multitude of patches, but released many DLC packs, culminating in a FreeLC campaign pack, rounding out CA's second foray into the Classic Roman time period.

												God game, amazing graphics and runs perfectly but can get repetative. I would recommend this for it's amazing battles and for Total War to count EVERY SOLDIER on the battlefeild, large campaign and the multiplayer but there are alot of issues aswell that needs to be fixed. The game is really easy even on legendary, it crashes frequently and the DLC comes to £60 ! I think that Total War just had another too many bad desisions and tried to make a money grabbing attempt at launch. The AI is terrible and the graphics aren't what are shown at the teasers. The Victory Points are a nightmare. The AI can just put all their troops there and just stay there not even attacking just waiting for the timer to tick down.Because i LOVED Empire so much, i can let this one of, FOR NOW.7/10 IGN Would be a Roman Again.

												Now that it's all patched and up to standard, Rome 2 is a fun game.  Great graphics, great faction selection, the scenery looks stunning ... what else can I say?  This game, and Total War games in general, are great among strategy games for their cinematic battles, and in this department, the game delivers.  The downsides might include the fact that some of the faction rosters may be a little repetitive, and some of the names of generals are slightly historically inaccurate for their culture and the time period in which the game is set.  Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10.			"

From great graphics to an easy battle interface and simple troop movement, it truely is one of the best.  The only downside I can find is that there is DLC, which should come with the game in my opinion.  Also, some countries, such as Sparta, are not playable in the campaign, even with DLC.

I don't feel the game is worth more.Base game is pretty bad, worse in most ways than previous entries in the total war series, including Rome 1 in many ways. However multi is quite fun and with some good mods the singleplayer game can be a lot more enjoyable too.EDIT: With the release of the emperor edition I'd say the game has been fixed enough and is playable enough now that it's worth a buy - even at full price.Modding community is going strong with some great mods so it should have tonnes of replayability too.

Some modify the game up a little, but most (at least most of the ones I have) mod textures and add in new units. Beleive it or not, quite a bit of the new units work well toghether and do not crash or lag your game. The over all engine is good, could use a tad bitof work insome area's but not enough to disrupt the entirity of your gaming experience 10/10 XD			"

												I have never been very keen on Tactical/Strategy games.  Not because they're bad, I am usually bad at them.  But when I checked out Heir of Carthage playing this I was very impressed with the details and I just had to buy it for myself!The game is super fun, being complex in every-way.  You really have to spend time learning the different aspects such as Politics, Diplomacy, Warefare and Economy command.  I have just under 80 hours on my belt and I have yet to fully understand the mechanics of Rome 2.  It's a fun filled investment!Unfortunately, there are some really cool factions, such as Sparta and Athens that you would like to play that you cannot unless you purchase over-priced DLC.  Sparta are a faction in the Grand Campaign yet are unplayable.  I honestly find this mindblowingly frustrating!  I paid £9.99 for Wrath of Sparta and wrongly assumed that would unlock Sparta to play in the Grand Campaign.  Turns out this is incorrect and extra DLC must be purchased.  I personally would prefer CA creating the full game without the DLC so when we purchase Rome 2, it feels like the full game.			"

Gone are the complex research trees and individual towns. In a time when roaming bands of outlaws are literally everywhere most towns are incapable of a simple wooden wall to protect them.And there are about 3-5 different designs of town.If you liked how previous Total wars were RTS with Civ like components well then go buy the latest Civ and an RTS.Shogun 2 was a well thought out and nice update. this is a hideous clone of what was once a gold standard.

												I am a HUGE FAN of the total war series and a big history nut. This game was, is, and will be the biggest disappointment i have ever had.Let me just start and say that the game can be pretty fun at times and has its pros, however they are greatly overshadowed by all of the negatives.One word: STREAMLININGThis is probably the simplest total war game yet, and it really takes away from the experience.Now this could be a positive if you are new to these games, but for hardcore fans this is a slap in the face. All of the factions are divided into 3 types (Hellenic, Barbarian and Rome rip offs) ALL OF THEM FEEL THE SAME! The Macedonians feel like the SeleucidsThe Iceni feel like the ArverniEgypt feels like Carthage.and on and on AND ONThe only difference between all of the factions is different named units with slightly different skins.Or some crazy exotic unit like fully armored war elephants that can rip army's to shreds.To add on to thatWALLET♥♥♥♥♥♥br>There is already two full dlc campaigns and a unit pack dlcall incredibly over priced and worthless. But don't worry, there are no over powered units in the dlc'swant to know why?BECAUSE ALL OF THE FACTIONS FEEL THE SAME!The dlc units are  just re-skined units with different names and a funny accent.If you enjoyed the innovative and Amazingly addictive multiplayer of shogun 2 (in my opinion it was a lot of fun, disagree if you want.) If you liked the RPG mechanics of your online general in Shogun 2If you had fun playing with clan mates in a game with full clan support in shogun 2.If you had fun Playing With your own personalized army holding the flag you designed in shogun 2.Play shogun 2The multiplayer in Rome 2?Its badIts terribleITS ABSOULUTLY TRAGIC.Bare Bones and Pointless.Doesn't even include the fun free for all battles that Rome one had.I could go on and on for a lot longer then you are probably willing to read, so i will just let you make a decision.If you are a super hard core fan, get it on a super sale for as cheap as it will getbut just be absolutely sure you want this game before you waste you money.

												Una grande, enorme delusione. Solo a comparare Rome 2 con il suo predecessore di serie Shogun 2, provo ribrezzo. Confronto ai vecchi titoli ok, non è brutto, ma la grafica, la personalizzazione e la schermata e interfaccia di questo gioco NON HANNO CONFRONTO CON QUELLE DI SHOGUN 2. Onore ai Giapponesini :)			"

												Rome Total War II, its a great game in the series, after a few startup hiccups the game is a great addition. A few major highlights in my personal opinion are: Addition of naval battles, a great way how they added these battles with great ships and lovely graphics. a true chance to fight the battles yourself if auto-resolve wouldve given you a loss or too many losses. Do mind, when you have a large navy and attack a city, it will sometimes be difficult to actually land all units. Co-Op Multiplayer, I love playing together with a friend and establishing a massive realm together, also player vs player works great in multiplayer. This was one of the best additions to the game in my believe. Improved graphics.Unfortunately everything has a negative side, below are my personal believes this may be different for you. Historical accuracy, a lot of units or city names lack historical accuracy, as I'm a history fanatic thats important to me. This is not a reason NOT to buy the game though. You now have cities and villages - in provinces - its new, its different, personally i dont like it as you can't wall up every city to defend it. it does give an additional challenge to the game which is good. Battles can become a massive meat grind where neither of the 2 parties is really making any progress in winning.One big downside on this game are all the DLC's for new factions and new units or even to see some blood&gore, you have to pay for every addition to the game, some worth it, some not.Overall, its a great game and i would recommend anyone to buy it if you are into grand strategy games with a historical twitch to it. Just try and see how large your empire can become with legendary settings. "

												the new limited number generals deminish this game to unplayable as Gauls being surrounded and being attacked you cant move units around without generals so you cant support the settlements with a max of 4 generals you cant defend more than 4 settlements then you get rolled over by the ai massing 1000+ force. Reading some other reveiws they claim this is how the roman army would have been IRL no general no controlable force. after the issues with shogun2 and and this game i would not recommend this game anymore.

Brief ReviewTotal War™: ROME II - Emperor Edition. Is a similar and familar experience to the other Total War Games. Still rickety in many places and, for all its improvements, it remains a very similar experience. It's not worth getting now if you were on the fence before. It's not a radically different experience or a dramatically changed game. Like the Roman Republic itself, it's still prone to collapsing and to repeating its mistakes over and over, but that doesn't stop it from being terribly entertaining and, at times, worryingly compulsive. Total War: Rome 2 is good, quite a bit better even, but it's not the best thing since sliced bread.Pros and ConsProsHuge BattlesTurn-based and Real-time StrategyExcellent handlingGorgeous LandscapeSiege BattlesHuge Array Of LocationsNumerous options for destructive experimentationConsAIBad PrologueAI PathfindingAn EndingWhy all this violence?

												Well, this is a review from a now standpoint and nowhere near the realease which was nearly 3 years ago. Rome total war 2  today, is incredible value even at its full price for an RTS game, it's an extremely well rounded total war game and the replability I feel really blows shogun 2 out the water, sure the co-op campaign can still be a bit clunky at times, but can still go hours without crashing, and frequent saves make this a non issue. The biggest issue as usual in total war is the siege AI, it's still pretty bad at times - depending on what you are sieging - their micromanagement with some of the bigger settlements is simply terrible.

												As much as people hate Total War: Rome II, it has its fun sides! Of course I have been playing with Radius and various other mods recently...but the game can be enjoyable.Classic Rome but added and removed some features. The emperor edition is a lot more polished than the patchy start they had, which is where most reviews got their venom on...Anyhow, I love it, not as much as I loved other total war games like Rome I and Medieval, but it is what it is, revamped game play and much better graphics.Roma Invicta!

												Where do I begin with this game? After sinking over 800 hours into it, there is a lot I could say, but I will try to keep it short. Overall, the game is great, and there are many improvements from the original Rome Total War. Being able to have large 40 unit armies during the period of Ancient Rome is somwthing I have enjoyed for many many hours. The campaign map's size alone is also very impressive. However, some things bother me about this game. While there are bugs, just like every game, there are things that they left out/got rid of from other Total War games that were great features. 1. The ability to customize your army/general, like in Shogun 2. This feature was one of my favorites from the Total War series, as it made me feel like i was really in control of my army. 2. I can never understand the online multiplayer in Total War games. It should be possible to play campaigns online with way more than two people. Especially considering the size of the campaign map in Rome 2, there should be a possibilty of at least up to 8 player games. 3. PAYING FOR BETTER BLOOD AND GORE. I mean really? You have to charge for that? I paid for it, but it definitely should have been an update not paid DLC.      So, i would recommend this game, but only to those who enjoy Total War games. If you are looking for a good RTS game, you may want to look elsewhere, only because the mechanics of this game are not the greatest I've seen. If you are looking for a good Total War game to start with, I would suggest Medieval 2, or Shogun 2. This game is still too pricey for someone looking for a good game.			"

												Was a great game. I use to love it. It use to work perfectly fine, but now it freezes at the very beginning before the intro video and does nothing!!! I bought the game when it first came out AND I have bought all of the downloadable contents and this is what I get for being a, in my opinion, a GREAT customer? I have spent over $100 on this game alone and it FREEZES upon entry?! I have looked constantly online for help and I\'ve seen many people with the same story but no way to fix it, not even from the producers themselves. There is no limit anymore to my frustrations over this. I had put in over 1000 hours of gameplay and it is the single most fun and entertaining game I have ever played. I loved it. But this is ridiculous. I\'ve even tried contacting them but Steam gave me an outdated number that was no longer in use and I can\'t find it anywhere. It is a great game that I love, but not the best to dump money into until this issue is fixed.			"

												This game is fantastic except for the fact that they got rid of the family tree. not cool man. I like building a dynasty/legacy. the general mechanic sucks in that way. mods that go up to 12 turns a year make it a little better. the battles are great. AI is solid. the character models are gorgeous, which oddly enough is a problem. they are so gorgeous, but there are so many of them, and they are so unique and awesome looking that it makes it hard to pay attention to any of them at any given time so it just sort of becomes a huge overstimulating mess if you zoom in to watch any part of the battle. also, the battles are way too fast paced. even enormous battles sometimes last about 10 minutes, which again, makes it really hard to enjoy any of the visuals. also, every total war game before this one had better castle seige mechanics. the cities in this one, just seem WAY TOO BIG. the battles always happen on basically 1/10th of the entire city, and the AI annoyingly takes advatnage of this and sends units to the opposite side of the city to attack, making castle seiges just a total pain in the butt. Shogun 2 is better than this game in pretty much every aspect. however, i could not help but enjoy playing as the macedonians and re-taking over the success states. this game is fun, its just disappointing due to the fact that literally every game before it was better. if you love history and the total war franchise, shogun 2 is the best one. this one is good, but arguably not even as good as medieval 2. now they made a medieval 3 and did not make it as a big money grab and actually took their time with it and did not make 50 DLC's...then i would pay attention to this franchise again. i recommend rome 2, but shogun 2 is better. be Athens and conquer trade in the mediterranean. super fun.

												If this was the game CA released to begin with, it would've ranked up as one of the best in the series. Beautiful visuals and an enormous attention to detail, interesting and varied unit rosters for each faction, a thematic soundtrack, a yuge and engaging campaign map full of dozens of nations and tribes with legit working diplomacy (an enemy of your enemy will actively seek to trade with you or seek a military alliance for example), battle AI that managed to surprise me by using formations effectively and actually trying to outflank me and finally (in my opinion) a more visually interesting and streamlined UI.It's not perfect by a long stretch; true to the series it can be too easy (especially as Rome) and upping the difficulty doesn't make the AI smarter, it just lets them cheat with more money and better stats, 1 year per turn means your generals drop dead from old age before you've even had a chance to properly level them up, the AI will sometimes not attack you during sieges or tire its units out by running them all over the map for no reason and the performance is pretty awful for a game of its age, although I did find upgrading my Radeon drivers to Crimson 16.9.2  boosted my framerate by nearly 20fps!If you're a fan of the series but have put off buying Rome 2 because of the awful state of the game at release, you're a fan of the time period, or you just fancy building an empire - definitely pick this one up. Highly recommended.			"

AI is solid. the character models are gorgeous, which oddly enough is a problem. they are so gorgeous, but there are so many of them, and they are so unique and awesome looking that it makes it hard to pay attention to any of them at any given time so it just sort of becomes a huge overstimulating mess if you zoom in to watch any part of the battle. also, the battles are way too fast paced. even enormous battles sometimes last about 10 minutes, which again, makes it really hard to enjoy any of the visuals. also, every total war game before this one had better castle seige mechanics. the cities in this one, just seem WAY TOO BIG. the battles always happen on basically 1/10th of the entire city, and the AI annoyingly takes advatnage of this and sends units to the opposite side of the city to attack, making castle seiges just a total pain in the butt. Shogun 2 is better than this game in pretty much every aspect. however, i could not help but enjoy playing as the macedonians and re-taking over the success states. this game is fun, its just disappointing due to the fact that literally every game before it was better. if you love history and the total war franchise, shogun 2 is the best one. this one is good, but arguably not even as good as medieval 2. now they made a medieval 3 and did not make it as a big money grab and actually took their time with it and did not make 50 DLC's...then i would pay attention to this franchise again. i recommend rome 2, but shogun 2 is better. be Athens and conquer trade in the mediterranean. super fun.

												Now that it's all patched and up to standard, Rome 2 is a fun game.  Great graphics, great faction selection, the scenery looks stunning ... what else can I say?  This game, and Total War games in general, are great among strategy games for their cinematic battles, and in this department, the game delivers.  The downsides might include the fact that some of the faction rosters may be a little repetitive, and some of the names of generals are slightly historically inaccurate for their culture and the time period in which the game is set.  Overall, I'd give this game a solid 8/10.			"

												God game, amazing graphics and runs perfectly but can get repetative. I would recommend this for it's amazing battles and for Total War to count EVERY SOLDIER on the battlefeild, large campaign and the multiplayer but there are alot of issues aswell that needs to be fixed. The game is really easy even on legendary, it crashes frequently and the DLC comes to £60 ! I think that Total War just had another too many bad desisions and tried to make a money grabbing attempt at launch. The AI is terrible and the graphics aren't what are shown at the teasers. The Victory Points are a nightmare. The AI can just put all their troops there and just stay there not even attacking just waiting for the timer to tick down.Because i LOVED Empire so much, i can let this one of, FOR NOW.7/10 IGN Would be a Roman Again.

												This is yet another incredible game in the Total war franchise that dare I say, challenges its pretecesor, Rome Total war, as the best stratefy game of that time period.  From great graphics to an easy battle interface and simple troop movement, it truely is one of the best.  The only downside I can find is that there is DLC, which should come with the game in my opinion.  Also, some countries, such as Sparta, are not playable in the campaign, even with DLC.  Other than that, it is overall a fantastic game.			"

												This game has been really up and down for me, but I'll go into detail as to why. I love the TW series and have played everything from the original Rome to now. So I was obviously expecting some of the issues that arose around release involving lagging, video quality problems, crashing and AI difficulties. But those have thankfully been ironed out now, so we're left with a game that's stable, but more importantly, heavily moddable. Some of the things wrong with this game are easily fixed with some of the more popular mods available in the workshop, like the AI being completely incompetent at times, sailing their only fleet out to the middle of nowhere and leaving their capital undefended while you're camped on it with significant armies.I've found that it's very easy to get bored during some of the longer campaigns, because it's so simple to find yourself repeating strategies for different factions. You'll learn the best direction to expand in and subconscously follow it in most of your campaigns. It's a trap I fell into a few times and had to consciously avoid doing it to keep the game fresh. Try different things every game, different strategies, different directions. That's how I've gotten the most out of my time playing. The DLC's are good if you can get them on sale, I wouldn't recommend paying full price for any of them, The game in general is a lot of fun. The battles are realistic for the most part, the strategies you can employ are widespread and the unit diversity is good. The city/economy building is also a lot of fun, trying to find ways to stick a knife in someone's back while you're sharing a border and multiple allies is always an interesting struggle. There really is something for everyone in this game if you want to find it. I'll recommend it to anyone chasing a decent turn-based strategy.			"

												After 3 years, I'm still coming back and playing this for hours on end. I finally won my first campaign as Parthia, because I would always just start new campaigns. I'd say the strongest point of this game is the start of campaigns, when literally anything could happen, any AI faction could rise up and become a major player. You can play the same faction infinite times and your experience would be different each time.However, the biggest problem I have with the game, the reason why I was never finishing campaigns, is how stale the endgame is. It gets super repetitive once there are only a handful of factions left, and there's hardly any diplomacy at that point, just conquest after conquest. The politics ""mini-game"" seems tacked on, or not fleshed out to its potential. And Diplomacy can sometimes seem strange, factions refusing to trade with you even though you have tons of resources and they have none. Every once in a while a faction will declare war on you right after agreeing to a treaty.But in the end, the strengths of this game come out on top. Battles are epic, especially when they're between two powerful and advanced factions. The growth system for cities is ingeneous, and the wide variety of cultures at play insure a unique experience for each faction (outside of the Greek city-states). This went from one of the worst Total Wars at launch to one of the best. It's in my top 5, maybe arguably my top 3 with Rome and Shogun 2.9/10, would recommend.			"

												I am a HUGE FAN of the total war series and a big history nut. This game was, is, and will be the biggest disappointment i have ever had.Let me just start and say that the game can be pretty fun at times and has its pros, however they are greatly overshadowed by all of the negatives.One word: STREAMLININGThis is probably the simplest total war game yet, and it really takes away from the experience.Now this could be a positive if you are new to these games, but for hardcore fans this is a slap in the face. All of the factions are divided into 3 types (Hellenic, Barbarian and Rome rip offs) ALL OF THEM FEEL THE SAME! The Macedonians feel like the SeleucidsThe Iceni feel like the ArverniEgypt feels like Carthage.and on and on AND ONThe only difference between all of the factions is different named units with slightly different skins.Or some crazy exotic unit like fully armored war elephants that can rip army's to shreds.To add on to thatWALLET♥♥♥♥♥♥br>There is already two full dlc campaigns and a unit pack dlcall incredibly over priced and worthless. But don't worry, there are no over powered units in the dlc'swant to know why?BECAUSE ALL OF THE FACTIONS FEEL THE SAME!The dlc units are  just re-skined units with different names and a funny accent.If you enjoyed the innovative and Amazingly addictive multiplayer of shogun 2 (in my opinion it was a lot of fun, disagree if you want.) If you liked the RPG mechanics of your online general in Shogun 2If you had fun playing with clan mates in a game with full clan support in shogun 2.If you had fun Playing With your own personalized army holding the flag you designed in shogun 2.Play shogun 2The multiplayer in Rome 2?Its badIts terribleITS ABSOULUTLY TRAGIC.Bare Bones and Pointless.Doesn't even include the fun free for all battles that Rome one had.I could go on and on for a lot longer then you are probably willing to read, so i will just let you make a decision.If you are a super hard core fan, get it on a super sale for as cheap as it will getbut just be absolutely sure you want this game before you waste you money.

												The game looks pretty and runs well. Many playable factions with a wide enough unit roster. A campaign can take a pretty long time as the map is pretty large and challenges are spread out across Europe. The AI is sadly not that very challenging but it's not a pushover either. The civil war system is a bit of a disappointment and not that well thought out. All in all, if you're a fan of the previous games you will like this game as well.			"

												Very disappointing. With increased graphics and more clever mechanics on the battlefield, everything else is dumbed down to compensate. Gone are the complex research trees and individual towns. In a time when roaming bands of outlaws are literally everywhere most towns are incapable of a simple wooden wall to protect them.And there are about 3-5 different designs of town.If you liked how previous Total wars were RTS with Civ like components well then go buy the latest Civ and an RTS.Shogun 2 was a well thought out and nice update. this is a hideous clone of what was once a gold standard.

												I am a HUGE FAN of the total war series and a big history nut. This game was, is, and will be the biggest disappointment i have ever had.Let me just start and say that the game can be pretty fun at times and has its pros, however they are greatly overshadowed by all of the negatives.One word: STREAMLININGThis is probably the simplest total war game yet, and it really takes away from the experience.Now this could be a positive if you are new to these games, but for hardcore fans this is a slap in the face. All of the factions are divided into 3 types (Hellenic, Barbarian and Rome rip offs) ALL OF THEM FEEL THE SAME! The Macedonians feel like the SeleucidsThe Iceni feel like the ArverniEgypt feels like Carthage.and on and on AND ONThe only difference between all of the factions is different named units with slightly different skins.Or some crazy exotic unit like fully armored war elephants that can rip army's to shreds.To add on to thatWALLET♥♥♥♥♥♥br>There is already two full dlc campaigns and a unit pack dlcall incredibly over priced and worthless. But don't worry, there are no over powered units in the dlc'swant to know why?BECAUSE ALL OF THE FACTIONS FEEL THE SAME!The dlc units are  just re-skined units with different names and a funny accent.If you enjoyed the innovative and Amazingly addictive multiplayer of shogun 2 (in my opinion it was a lot of fun, disagree if you want.) If you liked the RPG mechanics of your online general in Shogun 2If you had fun playing with clan mates in a game with full clan support in shogun 2.If you had fun Playing With your own personalized army holding the flag you designed in shogun 2.Play shogun 2The multiplayer in Rome 2?Its badIts terribleITS ABSOULUTLY TRAGIC.Bare Bones and Pointless.Doesn't even include the fun free for all battles that Rome one had.I could go on and on for a lot longer then you are probably willing to read, so i will just let you make a decision.If you are a super hard core fan, get it on a super sale for as cheap as it will getbut just be absolutely sure you want this game before you waste you money.

												The game looks pretty and runs well. Many playable factions with a wide enough unit roster. A campaign can take a pretty long time as the map is pretty large and challenges are spread out across Europe. The AI is sadly not that very challenging but it's not a pushover either. The civil war system is a bit of a disappointment and not that well thought out. All in all, if you're a fan of the previous games you will like this game as well.			"

												No commentsEdit: After waiting almost a year the game has improved a lot but it's still mediocre. On one hand the campaign is the best part since the AI has improved a lot since older TW games. On the other hand, with a pretty decent laptop, I spend hours (in total) just waiting after  each turns. Then when I get to play, I have to keep clicking and clicking and clicking to upgrade agent skills or declining all those ♥♥♥♥ing requests for this and that.Battles, which should be entertaining and thrilling, are instead disappointing and finished all too quick. Reminds me mostly of bad sex. The enemy AI is pretty smart but every freakin' soldier apparently likes to jump head first into one big♥♥♥♥♥mushpit.Big disappointment!			"

												After almost six months game is still very bad and boring ( because of victory conditions in campaign ) . Animations in battle are on the level of Empire or Napoleon .

												I was very hopefull for this game, and have given it chance after chance to impress me. However I really feel that this is a good reprasentation of how the gamming industry has gone down in quality over the years. what I mainly mean by saying that is that companies used to make sure a game was a good complete final product before they released it. now though it seems that every game is released far to soon becuase the companies didnt budget properly for the release. meaning that we get a half♥♥♥♥♥product until they are able to fix the bugs. this means that the game has had to have like somewhere in the realm of 30 updates since its release in october. one update totally made the game completley unplayable, and SEGA was interely unhelpful in helping me getting the game running properly again. I had to have my entire computer memory wiped by geek squad (something that cost me upwards of $200) just to get the game playable again. The positives: it is a very epic and large game with many improvements from the original rome total war. the campaign map is much larger and more in depth. The battles have the ability to have blood and gore and are much more fluid than the original rome total war. Negatives: the load times on this game are a huge low point. sometimes it will take 15 min just load a saved game. also the turns sometime take 10-15min just for the other nations to do there turn, during which time you better be moving your mouse around or the game will just dump you back to the dexktop becuase it thinks ur idle if you dont move th mouse in 60 seconds now. And the constant updates are really starting to get so old that i am about to be completley over this game. the past 4 times I have come to play the game I have had to wait upwards of 30min to an hour just for some new stupid update to be downloaded. Just to play the game. this is far to much waiting and waiting and waiting just to play a game. I really hope someone from SEGA reads this and realizes that people do not appreciate being sold half completed products. oh and maybe they could make the game work properly instead of constantly focusing on putting out new DLC. just so they can make another cheap quick buck. very disapointed in a company I have supported since the mid 90's.

												Total War: ROME II is an immersive and very in depth strategy game that offers countless hours of fun. The single player campaigns are grat tests for the players ability to keep their chosen empire under control. The real fun is in multiplayer, grab a friend and start either working together for the greater good, or drive a dagger in their neck. Total War: Rome II is one of my favourite strategy games.			"

												While I'm a big fan of Creative Assembly's Total War series games, I can't speculate on Total War: Rome II because I can't even play it. This has been a huge disappointment for me. I was unable to get the game on the release date, but now thaat I have the game it still doesn't work. I had heard that there were some issues with the game, but I wouldn't have imagined that the issues would still be running this long. I'm a loyal player of the Total War series. The first Total War is still one of my favorite games to this day, but not having this game together yet is just unacceptable. Creative Assembly can do much better than this.

												Easily my favorite Total War game. Drastically improves diplomacy, as well as handling your large empire (making it easier by breaking them up into provinces). The game adds a power struggle within your empire so you can play politics by killing generals or other important members of your faction (to ensure your parties dominance). Let another faction gain too much support and a civil war can occur. The armies you control can grow in both size and strength as your faction allows you to create more armies and navies (this helps to organize your military and customize their own symbols/traditions). This game mixes strategy, diplomacy, and combat all into one.			"

												This game has deffinitely recieved its fair share of crticism, on launch the game has numerous issues and 9 patches deep it is still not complete, releasing a buggy game is not acceptable. Looking beyond that the game has some enetertainment to offer. First and foremost looking at this game you need to look past the previous titles and see this game for what it is. THe graphics are great, the strategy offered on the campaign map is different and more unique than the previous games, old fans complain understandably but to a new user or someone who has not played a total war game in a long time the strategy present will be challenging and interesting. Battles play out great, larger and bigger than ever before.The game does have a learning curve and to fully learn the game you will have to go thru the guides and get some experience to understand it all but once you get it you are looking at an awesome game with some of the best battles a total war game can offer.In its current state the game gets a solid 7/10. With some more patches and hot fixes the Ai could use some more improvements. Modding support is deffinitely another plus. Once the Ai is complete and you can find the mods you prefer the game is worth the money.			"

												First of all, this game has made alot of impact to society through its historical features. History has been one of the most challenging subject to understand because of its complex and mysterious timeline which makes alot of people really confused, making it one of the most anyoying subject known. However this game had changed people from hating humanities based to loving humanities(economics, history,etc) This real time strategy have a unique content in comparison to other games. First would be the graphics, here in ancient world of Total War astonishing graphics shown (the zooming in method) helps people to analyse the gears and the culture through the weapons and also helps people that loves technology to get a better view of what a good real time strategy game should be. Secondly is the campaigns, here the campaign are free and everything is permitted, which supports both pros and cons. The pros are it teaches people to actually control an empire focusing not only on military but also diplomats, economy, etc. This really could help people know how the actual world can be. In the other hand the cons are it is a game, therefore cheats could happen. Overall I would recommend to everytone to play this game and obtain all the advantages. Marco Lembong			"

												I have played all the TW titles and all I can say is that this game has significantly improved since it was released. Its still not perfect, but I think its as good as we can get it and expect from CA. I personally don't agree with gaming companies like CA releasing alpha or beta games, but the fact is that the meaning of ""finished game"" is a metaphore. It doesn't exist, there is no such thing as a finished game nowadays, since even if they claim that a game is finished. Updates, dlcs and what have you all contradict this notion.Furthermore I would like to point out some other things that immature people and children need to know.1) There is no such thing as a finished game. Updates nowadays along with dlc's contradict this. 'Finished game' is a metaphoric concept, it is a made up notion and no longer exists.2) CA and developers like CA are all under a certain deadline, everyone knows this. If we're to blame someone for a crapy of un-furnished game, then we should blame the ones who pressure CA and not CA itself.  3) Money makes the world go round. Hence why the concept of the dlc was created, since it is another form of making more money from games. The concept behind this is to release un-finished games, so that content which should have been included in the game are sold off separately, hence more money being made off on top of the initial sale of the game. Why release a game finished, when you can milk the many 'sheeple' who buy these games. Of course, people will continue to complain, but at the end of the day these 'sheeple' always out weigh those who do complain. The concept of the custome is always right no longer has relevance in today's world. Its an extinct notion. If you want to improve or create something more to your liking, then make it yourself. The TW modding community is a perfect example of this.4) Try the Radious Mods. If the vanilla version of the game doesn't suit your taste and makes you cry like a baby, then try this mod since I've played it and its practically fixed most of the issues RTW2 had at the very beginning. Its the best this game can go and in fact I no longer update my RTW game because of this. Those who bought CING are all fools who like wasting money. 5) We should all put ourselves in CA's shoes because till we all do this, how can we possibly complain about the lack of juice this game has when we can never comprehend the difficulties that CA faces to begin with. Running a company is very difficult, you can't have everything you want, nothing is totally perfect. Its OK for some of us to sit at our computers and complain, but to be honest. I'd rather not complain since the worse thing that could happen is that CA stops producing these games and if that were to happen, then I'd be very unhappy. Fact is, there aren't many game developers making historic strategy games right now due to the niche market its in. In fact, only two companies out there stick out as the best strategy game developers of our time; Paradox Studios and Creative Assembly. There used to be Maxis, but that's gone down hill. For me CA's TW francise is as good as it will get, till another 'CA' starts up to compete, which is highly unlikely.Take care everyone, peace out!			"

The same concept in the game applies to all other Total War games. It was to CONQUER (Grand Campaign) and breaking the enemies moral... and that was in 5 minuets when I first started Total War. This review will be only about/mostly about battles. Not the Grand Campaign.Likes-High detailed units that destroyes weak computersHigh graphicsSimple and easy to understand in 1-2 hours of playing, except for the game mechanicsDifferent factions, not like StarCraft where there are only 3 factions with less new unit to play withGame mechanics (ex. unit moral, charges can be affected by the slope of the land, forest blocks missles, etc.)Updates, updates, updates. They appear unually every month or two, changing the game in different ways. Ex. When archers were useless due to their less than 30 damage, now they are useful with over 30 damage. Also, battles last longer with more armor given to the units.Unit rosters are usually huge, not like StarCraft in multiplayerNot everything is balanced *look up*The community and friendliness in multiplayer battles with other players. After a few games and laughter with each other, there's an established community that last very shortly. Dislikes-Super elite unitsDoes not usually follow historical ways and I know why thanks to balancing *sobs* *Disappointment*Micro manage is not challenging enough, I see hammer and anvil tactics or something similar a lot. Sometimes it's just an anvil. The other time, it's just a hammer. What the game is missing is sickle. Every units in every fractions are in a boxy formation. Why can't they have loose or uneven formationBad melee combat/strange melee combat. It's like knights and samurais fighting each other. One is super defensive and the other is super offensive. Like Veteran Shield Warriors vs. Principes. I find it strange, but I don't know about you guys though.When one person lags/having internet issues, everyone suffers. Battles lag with laggers. I'd like the StarCraft system where we wait for the lagger to drop out. At the same time, having a nice/mean chat with each other.Conclusion-Overall, the game is great, but has poor micro that StarCraft surpass. "

												I was very hopefull for this game, and have given it chance after chance to impress me. However I really feel that this is a good reprasentation of how the gamming industry has gone down in quality over the years. what I mainly mean by saying that is that companies used to make sure a game was a good complete final product before they released it. now though it seems that every game is released far to soon becuase the companies didnt budget properly for the release. meaning that we get a half♥♥♥♥♥product until they are able to fix the bugs. this means that the game has had to have like somewhere in the realm of 30 updates since its release in october. one update totally made the game completley unplayable, and SEGA was interely unhelpful in helping me getting the game running properly again. I had to have my entire computer memory wiped by geek squad (something that cost me upwards of $200) just to get the game playable again. The positives: it is a very epic and large game with many improvements from the original rome total war. the campaign map is much larger and more in depth. The battles have the ability to have blood and gore and are much more fluid than the original rome total war. Negatives: the load times on this game are a huge low point. sometimes it will take 15 min just load a saved game. also the turns sometime take 10-15min just for the other nations to do there turn, during which time you better be moving your mouse around or the game will just dump you back to the dexktop becuase it thinks ur idle if you dont move th mouse in 60 seconds now. And the constant updates are really starting to get so old that i am about to be completley over this game. the past 4 times I have come to play the game I have had to wait upwards of 30min to an hour just for some new stupid update to be downloaded. Just to play the game. this is far to much waiting and waiting and waiting just to play a game. I really hope someone from SEGA reads this and realizes that people do not appreciate being sold half completed products. oh and maybe they could make the game work properly instead of constantly focusing on putting out new DLC. just so they can make another cheap quick buck. very disapointed in a company I have supported since the mid 90's.

												Total War: ROME II is an immersive and very in depth strategy game that offers countless hours of fun. The single player campaigns are grat tests for the players ability to keep their chosen empire under control. The real fun is in multiplayer, grab a friend and start either working together for the greater good, or drive a dagger in their neck. Total War: Rome II is one of my favourite strategy games.			"

												I have been playing the Total War series for a while now and Rome 2 has a fantastic campaign system. The graphics are amazing in ultra or high settings. There is a great range of factions and the province system really works well.However, the game feels under optimized and I also feel that the multiplayer system has many flaws as it is very hard to get people to join your battle. I also feel that the game is unrefined as there are still many bugs and you need a very good graphics card and processor to run this game. The benchmarking system is unrealistic as it said in high settings at an average of 15fps, but in a battle Fraps told me I had 55fps.Only buy this game when it is at a good price!			"

												If you are coming to look at Rome now the probability is 1) your not a longtime fan of the series2) You were waiting around for it to be on saleIf your of the 1st group then I would join the 2nd, the battles do look amazing but that is about it, the game is simply dull and not worth more than £10 as you will lose interest quickly. A lot of people have spent a lot of time trying to enjoy this game, (this was expensive on release) but it has remained even with dlc and mods massively empty. You will simply run out of stuff to do, ending turns until the only real challenge emerges in the form of a civil war, but these are not exactly fun, slogging back through the map to the territories you already controlled but lost to armies that appear out of nowhere. Likely you will use this feature called the political system that measures the time until a civil war begins for when its time to call it quits.If you are waiting for it go on offer just be weary that it deserves a lot of the negativity surrounding it, but if its on sale it can be forgotten about in your library.Enjoy "

												It's hard to say no to a Total War game since I've loved every single version so far, even Empire Total War. However, if I had knew about the bugs and glicthes on launch, I probably would have waited for the game to be fixed. That being said, it's been a few weeks now and the game is starting to look pretty good. Gameplay wise, the game is the same as any of the other Total War games. There a few new features added in, and most have improved the game. For example, Siege battles are a bit more challenging and now you have restrictions on how many armies/navies you can have, which is good because the AI doesn't spam like 50 small armies anymore. Speaking of the AI, it's probably the only thing I have to complain about. It still sucks, but the AI is defintely an improvement over Shogun 2. However, I still find it stupid when I see a whole unit of swords charge head first into my pike formation. The Graphics are really nice, but sadly you require a pretty good computer to run things on High/Ultra. I'm currently running on Medium with an i3. However, the graphics are still beautiful and the animations are really exciting, as the battles feel pretty real now. Overall, I recommend this game for everyone to try. However, make sure you have an i5 and a good video card to unlock all the wonderful aspects of this game.			"

												Finally a worthy successor to Rome: Total War!Though no Total War game can ever hope to match the height on which the original 2004 Rome: Total War dwells, this sequel required over a year to rise from a pricey bèta to a worthy successor.Alas, certain features such as the family tree are still absent; the political system is still a mess and the AI still occasionally behaves like a woman on her period. But who cares, Total War is about warfare and conquest. Using the acclaimed Radious Mod I find myself actually requiring careful planning rather than mindlessly march off to war. Now, one can face multiple enemies, and if that sufficiently weakens you, other nations may use that as a casus belli and attack you at your most weakest moment. And I love that! But what drives me into writing a review in the first place? Never have I cared for expressing my opinion in such a public way. Well, the situationi is that certain friends of mine have this game in their wishlist and right now, its 66% off. That, and I would like to try cooperative mode...To quote a famous sports brand: Just do it. "

												It's not bad. I feels like a step back from Rome I, though. What I really wanted was just Rome I with new graphics. Oh, well. maybe Rome III will be more my style.The two major complaints I have is 1) the general system and 2) the mission system. The number of generals determines the number of armies, and you never have enough generals. Which is odd. There are prospective generals that want you to hire them, you want to hire them, but the game says 'no, you have enough'. I don't like that. Also the guided mission thingee really jacks with my game. I don't want to play through historical events; I want to make my own. The whole thing just felt like it took every opportunity to tell me how wrongly I was playing their game.If neither of those things bug you, the game is pretty amazing. I played through several hours worth before moving on, so that speaks to how good the rest of the game is :)			"

The game stands as a testament to newer game releases, little release content with the expectation you buy DLC content. The saving grace of this game is the multiplayer campaign in which a number of DLCs are given too you in for free.The modding community some of the mods for this game make it worth it, and flesh it out to an extent that makes it wholly absorbing. (although this now means you must await mods patches and game patches) The mods are great, but this review remains for the game which is sub par. Mods I'd get to play this game are Divide et Impera, or Traits, Talents and Toadies. A friend showed them to me and literally brought me back into the game.As it stands game crashes make it impossiable to finish anything and computer desicions will leave you laughing.			"

												Not as good as Shogun 2 ,BUT after the patches it's a decent game.... However I still miss the TW feeling and the combat is stupid for example 200 soldier can't break a 3-4 men deep infantry line,they just stand behind eachother and doing nothing ,only the first line fights or so. Physics? Sega: ""Wtf is that?""Pros:-long playtime-TW-noob friendlyCons:-new battle system with those victory flags-lack of physics-sometimes the AI is dumb ,defending the flag only and lets itself butchered6/10 ,coz the fixes.... So if you are a hardcore TW fan buy it,but I suggest wait for -50-75% price drop...			"

												A fantastic strategy game with a perfect combination of exciting campaign gameplay and intense and difficult real time battles.  Real strategy is required in this game to succeed not only in battle, but also as a nation. Many options are presented to you in Rome II when it comes to your empire. Will you expand via military force and conquer all in your path? Or will you make connections, allies and trade, becoming the richest and most influential nation in the known world? The choice is yours in Rome II and it does so in great fashion. There is always room for improvment and Rome II isn't perfect. A few things could be more fleshed out, such as general(Family Tree from TW: Attila would have been great) and I've always yerned for a more personal connection to your units within an army. A simple window for stats for that unit would be nice with # of kills and battles, total losses perhaps. Overall Rome II is an amazing strategy game, easily one of the best. I recommend it to any RTS fan, and even newcomers. It may be overwhelming at first but it's easy to get into and has a boat load of content.			"

												Game overall is good, I enjoy playing it and taking part in the large battles. But there is so much more work that could've been done on it, I sincerely hope the total war team spend many more weeks working on this game and not another game. They should stop releasing DLC and should focus on making the AI a lot better. But anywho, a great game to help pass the time :-)graphics - 7/10AI - 5/10Siege - 2/10Campaign - 9/10AI- On campaign - 6/10			"

												4/5- Great fun being a roman commander, with more unit variation than Shogun 2 but lacking the polish and engaging generals/agents of Shogun 2. DLC whoring is nowhere near as bad as I thought(except greek states).TLDR:It isn’t the worst total war(Empire), but it is not on the level of Shogun 2(the best).  Overall it has that flavor that total war seeks to give you, but instead of the flavor being focused on generals, it is more focused on provinces(similar to Medieval 2).Most reviews tackle this game from patch 7 and earlier(like 6 months from release kind of times), but emperor edition was the “relaunch” of the game. I also assume that you know what this game is. If you don’t google and youtube have your answer. I played this around 10 hours at release, 50 hours at patch 4, 50 hours at patch 14, and probably 20 hours at patch 15/Emperor Edition. I plan on playing much more coop campaign. I did preorder this game and got greek states 'free'.-----Campaign: -----A good selection of nations with various cultures, with a decent building system that they pulled out of shogun. Diplomacy is pretty good, not Europa Universalis level, and not shogun 2 level, but its not a detractor like in some other total wars. I really like the building system and agent limits, although spies are still too powerful. Most fights will end up being in provinces without walls which is fine with me. The early/mid game is quite fun, with lategame being not as interesting as the realm divide but now there are big enemy nations that form, so yay.+Varied starts and nation types.+amazing game for coop campaign, no desynch issues and you can draw on the map.  +relaunch redid the building system to make interesting choices on specialties and bonuses for specific provinces.+reasonable turn timers/load timers. About 1 minute loading screens for battles, 30-40s for turn timers.+Attrition and unit replenishment has been changed to shogun level, so it will take 6 or so turns to get a good unit back to strength.+AI will actually attack you, so more stances will be used and you can actually have ambushes on them from choke points.+The happiness and food systems work much better than before, it is a mechanic you need to build around, while not being as ridiculous as it was on release with stupid food losses of -8 for a reasonable T3 temple.+I personally like the limit on armies based on how big your nation is. With the new building system you can actually have decent garrisons.-some of these nations are very similar- most of the greek states or barbarian tribes use the same general units, and because they start right next to each other it could make for a pretty boring expansionary period to fight clones of yourself.-family trees are gone, and they have been replaced with a subpar system of traits and gravitas to make your generals interesting. On the whole your generals and their armies are less engaging than shogun and medieval, with a boring upgrade tree.-Traits and upgrade trees still poorly documented and pretty boring. Might want to grab toadies Traits mod.-Autoresolve is still kind of borked. Mostly when dealing with elephants, Horse Archers, and Town Garrisons(Not sure what is wrong with these- sometimes it is correct and sometimes it is not).-Civil wars not as interesting as realm divide. A lot of the time the ""big empires"" are pretty subpar and the Civil wars are annoying as a mechanic.---Battles:--- There is a good deal of variety here between nations, pike/hoplite heavy cultures play very differently from general infantry or barbarian cultures. When you zoom in things look fine. These are some of the best battles in the total war series(tactically).**NOTE-  If you have trouble telling units apart, turn your “unit detail” setting down to low- the unit detail is actually the variation between soldiers in a unit, so I play on low and things look perfectly fine.+General unit ‘types’ such as skirmishers and heavy infantry are a necessity, so you can’t just make an army of full heavy infantry and win every game(in campaign even!). AI doesn’t build enough horses though in my experience, but it’s about the same as the other total wars, not perfect army composition.+AI is perfectly acceptable in both sieges and open battle. Only time I have seen it bug out is with 2 or less ladders and sometimes it will have 2 towers blunder into each other if it builds too many.+Very few unit abilities worth using every time now- some charges are still in the game and sadly no really interesting general abilities like in shogun 2. Generals get 2 or 3 abilities that are okay, but they won’t really change the battle by being there as they did in S2.+Battles are longer than launch(most take about 3 minutes to skirmish and 5-10m of line fighting) and tired units are much slower at killing other units, a really nice tactical addition that makes a lot of the abilities much more situational.+Things to legitimately do in battle now! With the long fights comes tactical opportunity. Flanking is very important, as is having fresh units and skirmishers.+They made the unit cards forced into a single bar! This adds at least 3 inches on your screen of viewable space, and makes a huge difference to how big the UI appears.+Amazingly…the warscape engine is working fine. They have updated it so multiple soldiers can attack the same enemy and on the whole units aren’t bugging around floating everywhere. I would not have believed it if I did not see it myself! Just go watch a video.-Some units look weird in their 2d sprite mode when you zoom out, pikemen do not show you deployed pikes and roman infantry tend to blur horribly.-Boat battles are still confusing to tell what is going on and fiddly on ramming motions. At least transports are fixed to be terrible at fighting.-sound is subpar. General speeches are back but you need to zoom in really close and they will say a few lines. There are also lines that units say when attacking other units which again you need to zoom really close, probably not happening in the middle of combat so I did not realize that they recorded like 100 different ones until I looked it up on youtube.--DLC:--This was what I thought Rome 2 was made for- when the “greek states” were day 1 DLC, I thought this was going to turn into “want to even think about playing nation X? DLC!”. And by the starting positions from the core game, this was mostly true. At launch you could play most of the nations neighboring rome, but for some reason only one nation on the Spanish peninsula(carthage, which was also in Africa). I expected much whoring on releasing dlcs, but quite frankly they have not really done this. There is a perfectly good core experience here without needing to buy DLCS(Except for that greek states one). The only other DLC I have bought is the blood pack which has added visually to the battles(it adds more animations as well as blood by the way!). All of the DLC here is either bonus nations or extra campaigns, which are perfectly valid DLC.Final tips:*Go pick up a music mod, the base music is pretty boring. Either the rome 1 music mod or the very nice Roma Sur♥♥♥♥♥♥ II music pack adds quite a bit to the experience. This is the only mod I use since the rerelease- no need for sweeping balance mods anymore.*If you have a weaker processor, the siege AI will cause lag(weird stuttering of units when they reach the walls)- best 2 ways to fix this are to turn down the unit detail setting or get less units on the board(small unit scale). With a Q6600 @ 2.4GHz this hits for me at around 3000 units in a battle (stack v. stack on large unit size). So I had to turn unit size to small and now I can take up to 1 stack vs 2 stacks without lag.*It really is amazing how far this game has come. I ran out of characters right here, go watch ""why rome 2 failed"" vid to see why it got the well deserved low ratings before.			"

Unfortunatlly it did not deliver, fights are a caotic mess  (and not in a realistic way) the AI is broken both in battle and on the campign map. 120 hours of my life I'm not getting back.If you are thinking of buying it, don't. get shugan II insted its a great game.

												No realm conquest in MP, single player game is horribly broken in both the strategic and tactical layers. Game feels completely unfinished, even compared to Empire Total War.Strategic game takes forever, you will be autocompleting battles for 90% of the time you spend on the strategic map because you know you won. Once you're bigger than 3 or 4 provinces no AI player will be able to stop you because they will all be puny. Enjoy spending another 100+ turns of next turn and becomming even more lopsided as you tech up and grow your economy. The map and world are setup for a Roman empire that will never span the Mediterranean like it did historically if the AI controls Rome.Tactical AI needs work, gets stuck in buildings, happily dies vs gate oil in every siege, took several patches to make the amphibious AI work and even then will land in the wrong place at the wrong time all the time. The clean and simple Shogun 2 units have been replaced with a bunch of reskinned slightly alterted units that require constant management for their fireoffs (faster reload for ranged, beserk). Naval battles are completely awful, even worse than Shogun 2.Do not buy on sale even, maybe at a $10/$15 price point.			"

												Its nowhere near as bad as people think it is/want it to be. It isn't a revolutionary Total War game at all,though, and in trying to push the series so many steps ahead they kind of took it a few steps back. The UI in the campaign map is awful,but I really love what they have done with the presentation. This series has ALWAYS been about two gigantic armies fighting, and this game takes that up to 11. People have a lot of rightful frustration with this Franchise for never evolving, and it is not misdirected, its true. People want this game to have the strategic,overall arching aspects of a Paradox game while still having the amazing presentation that Total War is known for, and this game does not do that. This game still has a very bare bones economic system,the diplomacy system is still almost useless and it does not compare to Rome Total War at all.But despite a number of the issues ive mentioned, after all the patches have come through, and even with some frustrating AI (they can be really good or they can be the worst youve ever fought) The game retains the heart of previous TW games. Without a doubt,the glory and spectactle of Epic Total War battles is still there. And its a good game with that.I definitely reccomend it.			"

												I will freely admit she was a disaster at launch, but after almost 500 hours I still cannot get enough of Rome II.  There is a lot of variety between the factions, and a lot of different strategy to deploy.  It can take a long time to master the ins and outs, but once you do it is a deep strategy game.  The launch issues have passed, and all the content in the emperor edition make a great package.  I cannot recomend enough.			"

												Okay, honestly, this is a good game.  The vast majority of the extremely harsh criticisms about this game are purely based on very, very high standards.  The AI is not as good as it could be, but after 7 patches the game has greatly improved.  The campaign world itself is immersive and beautiful to look at, although you should expect to have a decently powerful machine to see it in its whole glory.  Nearly every faction has a unique feel to it, although some more than others, most notably the Romans, Germanic tribes, and the far east factions.  The battles themselves are pretty graphically demanding, and most of the time way too short.  It bugs me when I command a battle involving over 3000 soldiers, yet the action is over in an extremely unrealistic 15 minutes.  But nonetheless, the battles are very enjoyable and look stunning and realistic if seen with a powerfulish machine,(especially with the Blood and Gore pack) and the Creative assembly does a very good job of building off of what they were able to accomplish in Shogun 2.  Overall the diplomacy is tolerable, and greatly better than anything before Empire: Total War.  What Rome II does very well is really give off the vibe of the ancient world; whether it be armies on the battlefield or the clash of cultures on the campaign map, it is a satisfying feeling when the factions feel alive and independent.  I have been an avid player of the Total War games since the original Rome, and its extremely refreshing to witness the ancient world in new-found light.  Bottom line:  Rome II has weak points, no doubt, but its worth playing if you have enjoyed other TW games and, when seen in its full glory, is by far the best looking TW game, especially on the battlefield.  I would recommend it. 8.5/10			"

												Buggy release, full of disappointments (especially for total war series fan which pre-order the game, like me). The combat system was very unbalanced and the AI was a disaster in September 2013 when the game was launched, on top of that, a lot of cool features were missing (seasons, family tree, politics etc.). So I understand the people that were complaining about the game. But now after 10 patches the game has improved a lot, more factions, the AI is a lot better (still sucks at sieges, but can pose quite a challenge for inexperienced players in land battles, especially in higher difficulties, due to morale buffs to his troops), seasons are now reintroduced (in latest LC), wonders are repaired and visible in battles,  the battles feel more balanced and require more tactics (especially when outnumbered), the troop variety has greatly increased (if you include the DLC's packs) and for 2.5 EUR you can have blood effects. Anyway it's starting to become a very good game, it's extremely addictive and the hours of gameplay can be from a few dozens to thousands (if you want to finish the game with every faction) + if you include the DLC CiG and HatG, + the bonus provided freely by mods, can last forever. The price demanded today of 55 EUR is worth it (it wasn't worth it when it was launched) and if you include the 2 good DLC's (CiG and HatG) 15 EUR each (Greek and Nomadic factions DLC's are 7.5 EUR each but it's better to get them at a discounted price because they don't really offer too much content, I got them for free: Greek DLC because of preorder, and Nomadic DLC because of promotion), + Beast of War pack and Blood and Gore pack 2.5 EUR each, you will reach at a price of 90 EUR, which is quite a lot for a game (Advice: Easter is coming, and there will definitely be a lot of discounts, Rome 2 was at 50% discount during Christmas, so if you want to save money, it will be better to wait) but we are talking about a game that offers hundreds/thousands of hours of gameplay, not some Call of Duty that you can finish in 6-10h max, for 50 EUR, so if you are a history fan, like me, it's definitely worth the price tag. I also would like to mention that there are still some great features missing: Family Tree, Politics, Good Siege AI etc. but hopefully CA will add them in the near future. In the end, I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, because with all the bugs at launch, with all the bugs in the present and with all the missing features, it's still the best history RTS game on the market (with no real challenger to his genre), the thrill of battles is priceless.

												The battles look epic, the campaign map is huge and to me (who probably has 1500+ hours on TW games) its the best in the series yet. Despite what I have heard about Rome 2 failing as a game and being buggy as ****, i've not seen anything to a level that makes the game any less exciting than I thought it would be. Yes, it has the occasional bug or two, but no more than any other game of this scale. For people moaning about how poor the AI is, try beating the AI on legendary difficulty then moan about how poor their tactics are.Pros;- Huge scale map- Battles look epic- Addictive as the 1st oneCons;- AI sometimes isn't as smart as a human- Loading times between turns9/10			"

												Absolutely stunning! The user interface is a little tricky to get to grips with but once you understand it it is incredibly versatile! The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. I love zooming in to see my vast armies up close just before an assault. The diplomacy screen now makes it nice and easy to work out your trade agreements and alliances e.t.c. It gives you a breakdown on what is affecting your relationship with another faction so you can adjust your actions accordingly which is a huge improvement over previous Total War titles. There are still a few bugs here and there at the time of writing this review (08/03/14) but Creative Assembly have been working as hard as possible and releasing patches every week to get the game up to standard which is great! I would recommend modding the campaign game so that each year takes 4 turns instead of 1 as your generals seem to pass away from old age rather quickly otherwise. There is plenty of support for this game and an incredible amount of mods knocking around now too! Definitely pick it up if you like historical strategy games!			"

												So i picked up this game on sale December of 2014.  I have never played the Total War series so the entire series and mechanics were new to me.  Let me start off by saying that this is one of the best games I have played hands down.  I had heard a lot of issues with it when it first came out, but in the Emperor edition I have found nothing of issue.  I am a huge history fan, with Rome being my favorite, so this game really hit all the sweet spots for me.  Historically its pretty accurate, units, buildings etc. are all excellent.Gameplay wise there is a bit of a learning curve.  Tactically its very satisfying to command an army against odds the computer says you will not win and wipe the floor with the invading force.  I particularly enjoyed taking command of artillery units and turning the tide in battle.  I still haven't quite figured out the happiness/order formula in the game, so every now and then I had a wave of slave revolts to contend with.  That always seemed to be when I was militarily reaching so perhaps its a byproduct of not tending to my conquered settlements as much as i should have.  On a side note i liked the nod that gave to HBO's Rome series in the skill cards you can assign generals (XIIIth !!!!!!!!).Overall I am really happy with the purchase I made.  This is a game I'll be spending a lot of time with I can already tell.  The DLC is fun if not game changing.  Caesar in Gaul is a fun romp through the Gallic Wars.  The only critique I can give on it is that its just a larger campaign map for the Gaul area.  The Roman Civil War is fun to play (shots out to Octavian), and overall its worth the buy when on sale.All in all I'd rate IX/XROMA INVICTA			"

												Overall; great game, personally enjoying it a lot. 9/10Pro's: -Everything is balanced well-The campaign map graphics will amaze you every time (not even on the highest graphic settings)-Huge campaign map-Plays out very differtent everytime-Never gets boring with all the factions to play-Nice diplomatic system and a map where you can see how much each faction likes eachother-Multiplayer campaignsCon's: -DLC's, DLC's aaaand.... DLC's-Very different from other total war games (might take a while to get used to)-You might get bored without mods, depends what you like personally though.-I find some units in the game kind of under/over-powered.-Did i mention DLC's?Would definitely recommend this game if you like strategy games. Oh and.. if you think you have mastered the game, play Epirus on legendary and see how that goes.			"

												I consider Rome II to be the best game in the Total War series so far. It improves many campaign map aspects of the Total War series and adds many new things to it. Sure, it had problems in the past but I have never suffered from them. The diversity of factions and units makes this game replayable and interesting.			"

												Since I've played a few more Total War titles, both new and old, I can finally decide how I feel about this game.Graphically, it is stunning. The details are amazing, the effects, divine. However in the heat of battle one cannot pay much attention to these details.The AI is... interesting, the AI strategy is to either rush the capture points (or you), or just stand there and wait. I've rarely seen flanking manouvers or kinks and vees.Compared to the other total war games, Shogun, Napoleon, Attila, it is very buggy and flawed. There is untapped potential, there are bugs and glitches, and there are useless features. On it's own, this game is very very good.Since this was my introductory game to the series, it holds a special place in my heart, buts it's brothers and sisters just put it to shame.Also: Strategery simulator 11/9 "

												One of the best game out there, so fockig addictive and my favorite TW game. Even better when playing in coop with a friend, you just cannot stop playing, it will steal your life !The game is great except for a few things, the naval battle sucks, the IA is pretty much stupid even retarde.d sometimes but what's really frustrating is the bugs.... FOCKING BUGS ! In 91 hours I've experience my first bug and this is so focking frustrating. If you ever encounter that bug good luck! The camera just stops working, you cannot move it or rotate it. You can only move around the map by double clicking on your armies or in the minimap, this is unplayable. I've played only one turn like that and i passed from focking-happy-loving-rome-masturbating-on-TWrome to focking-rage-want-to-kill-babies-smashing-their-heads in less than five minutes.			"

The battles are really fun but sometimes challenging. The graphics are good. (If your computer is good.) So, yes, overall this games is abosultley amazing!			"

												- nutshell - worse in every single way compaired to rome1 except for the graphics which look awesome when viewing the fights on the battlemap. but still recomended because it is still a good game in its own light and also really where else are you going to go for this stuff -nutshell - -strategic map   -cons                       -city building- less options and freedom when building, following the shogun2 model of 2-6 building plots to    assign  structures tovery dumbed down compaired to rome1, medieval2 method                       -3 types of agents avalible but very limited cap on each type in early game and still quite restrictive in late game, also no action videos, wtf CA seriously                       -armies are capped now not just by what you can support but by an unexplained arbitary number, so if you feel like leaving some extra men to suppliment your garrisons you had beter be prepared to sacrifice a whole stack from your total forces even if you only want to leave 2-3 units it counts as a whole stack to the total                       -deplomacy is dumbed down compaired to previous games. simple options and less freedom.    -pros                       -pretty, the graphics have, as would be expected, been updated durring the last decade                        -i find myself liking the army personalisation, each army has its own legacy and like the generals in shogun 2 they gain experiance and can choose skills/perks/new attributes from a set for their current level.this allows you to craft an army into siege experts, veteran attackers or defenders, occupation troops with a bonus to public order   ect                       -city models on the map accurately reflect the battle map, which i just think is kinda cool-Battle map    -cons                       -AI, the ai is just plain, old fashioned stupid. forget flanking, faints, tactical formations or any resemblence of inteligence. most battles just end up with the ai throwing its units at you until you break or they do.  i can count on one hand how many times i have seen a tactical manouver by the compon minor town siege battles the ai just throws its men down the shortest distance to the town center with no regard to formation or your own unit placement. and on walled towns i have only ever seen an army use 4 ladders (one choice) as the sum total of their siege equipment and they usualy end up just standing infront of your main gate throwing flamming torches at it regardless to whether their ladders reached the walls  or not.you really have to be up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek to lose these sieges, which you can be with not being able to suppliment your garision of two pleb units  with out using a valuable army slot                           -thats actually about it for cons on the battle map for me. most of my other grievances are aimed at particular units like legionarys not being able to throw pilum with out charging first ect.       -pros                            -very bloody pretty.   as a bloke that doesnt mind inviting extra carnage to his army just so he can watch it unfold i really enjoy the new level for graphic fidelity.  watching 4000 odd guys duking i out with graphics that i would expect from some 3rd or 1st person rpgs is very gratifying to watch                           -tactical map is very useful for getting an instant view of your force disposition                            -naval assaults, just so much win.  ive wanted this including since i first watched troy years ago. also allowing tactical assaults on towns and allows fleet crew to assist land armies in city assaults random grippes no sli profile - self explanitary really, this is a huge demanding game, i have two cards, i want to use both of them. CA and nvidia both claim its in the others hands to move forward with the sli compatibility so both are doing bugger all as far is ive heardpaided unit dlc packs with 5 new units in them- just wow CA really. massive kick i nthe balls from what i concidered an oldschool, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t company.expecially annoying after i played 40 quid for the preorder anyway and then want 3-5 quid a pop for stuff thats avalible free from the workshop.if you have played total war from empire onwards then would will love this thisif you are still hanging on from before that then things will annoy the crap out of you but you will still love it "

The various landscapes of the battlefields are undeniably beautiful with the greatest depth of units to any previous total war game. There is also the fact that battles are not as rectangle-like as previous games, a single unit can envelope a narrowly formed unit adding to the realism of the game.Although the game could be better, although that could be said for every game released I believe this game is brilliant.

												I was very hopefull for this game, and have given it chance after chance to impress me. However I really feel that this is a good reprasentation of how the gamming industry has gone down in quality over the years. what I mainly mean by saying that is that companies used to make sure a game was a good complete final product before they released it. now though it seems that every game is released far to soon becuase the companies didnt budget properly for the release. meaning that we get a half♥♥♥♥♥product until they are able to fix the bugs. this means that the game has had to have like somewhere in the realm of 30 updates since its release in october. one update totally made the game completley unplayable, and SEGA was interely unhelpful in helping me getting the game running properly again. I had to have my entire computer memory wiped by geek squad (something that cost me upwards of $200) just to get the game playable again. The positives: it is a very epic and large game with many improvements from the original rome total war. the campaign map is much larger and more in depth. The battles have the ability to have blood and gore and are much more fluid than the original rome total war. Negatives: the load times on this game are a huge low point. sometimes it will take 15 min just load a saved game. also the turns sometime take 10-15min just for the other nations to do there turn, during which time you better be moving your mouse around or the game will just dump you back to the dexktop becuase it thinks ur idle if you dont move th mouse in 60 seconds now. And the constant updates are really starting to get so old that i am about to be completley over this game. the past 4 times I have come to play the game I have had to wait upwards of 30min to an hour just for some new stupid update to be downloaded. Just to play the game. this is far to much waiting and waiting and waiting just to play a game. I really hope someone from SEGA reads this and realizes that people do not appreciate being sold half completed products. oh and maybe they could make the game work properly instead of constantly focusing on putting out new DLC. just so they can make another cheap quick buck. very disapointed in a company I have supported since the mid 90's.

												Total War: ROME II is an immersive and very in depth strategy game that offers countless hours of fun. The single player campaigns are grat tests for the players ability to keep their chosen empire under control. The real fun is in multiplayer, grab a friend and start either working together for the greater good, or drive a dagger in their neck. Total War: Rome II is one of my favourite strategy games.			"

												I LOVE this game. I only wish they would add more historical facts (like in some mods, wrath of sparta) but gameplay has been clean with no glitches which i was afraid of from some of the reviews. I love playing the Greek factions especially Selucia and Egypt and as soon as my new graphics card arrives i will be devoting even more time to it. Also, I hope they continue making GOOD mods. Black sea colonies was a little simple:( I do appreciate the attention to detail in a game like this especially in the cities which are beautifully done and usually pretty different from region to region. I hope to see more quality mods and WHY IS THERE ONLY A HANDFUL OF HISTORICAL BATTLES?!! Make a mod with like 100. As a fan who has been with this title since 2003 this is a worthy succesor to the franchise			"

If you like this time period, RTS's, and strategy/empire maintence games this is a great one. Now go slay some barbarians and Genocide Carthage...Happy reaving!			"

												I have to say after waiting two years and a new computer later, the Total War Rome II seems to be a far cry short of what I expected from such a top developer and the Total War series. The amount of bug issues and crashes seems to be a bit over-the-top for the established Total War designers. Although, the game itself offers the greatest replay value out on the market with the most sophisticated gameplay and realtime battle control. I'd love to say that I will continue to play and buy the line of Total War games but after this let down I'm not sure i'll care to buy another one.			"

There is probably over 50$ of DLC you need to buy to enjoy countries like.. SPARTA. Also, the in game encylopedia is broken. Sad that the series has gotten so bad....			"

												Combat in this game is not as fun as Attila; trade is not as fun as Empire. That said, it's a well-rounded Total War experience. Unless you're trying to run it on your Mac. Don't. It has nothing to do with how good your computer is and everything to do with how little Sega cares about good code. It will crash constantly on any Mac platform. Ignore the little Apple symbol on the store page. For transparency, I would recommend this game on PC as it plays fine on my Windows partition, but am giving it the thumbs down from Caesar for the unbelievably bad compatibility issues on the Mac.Pros:- Excellent graphics, truly stunning on higher settings- Many traditional TW elements, such as the context-specific generals speeches before a battle- Lots of little details, like snippets of dialog you can hear when zoomed in on a unit- Beautiful, if intermittently disorienting, world map- Characters and Agents are customizable as they advance, unlike many other iterations of the game- Famed units can be re-founded after they are destroyed and regain hard won characteristics- Expansions, expansions. Lots of different scenarios, though the mechanics of each aren't quite as creative or interesting as Medieval's expansions or Attila's Horde Mode.- Naval combat actually makes sense.- Combat itself plays very differently from other period TW games; if you try to play it like Medieval or Empire, you will lose. Much like medieval tactics likely wouldn't work in the ancient world.Cons:- Trade is not as interesting as Empire or as easy to follow as Medieval- Faction system and internal politics remain somewhat opaque; for example, I can't for the life of me fathom why I would want to assassinate my own guys, but it seems like something I'm supposed to do. Faction events are basically just luck of the draw, pick an answer and hope it's right.- Factions lack individual character in many places, perhaps partly due to the sheer quantity of them- Still suffers from performance issues on PC, even when you discount the abominable release. Often unplayable on Mac.- Sometimes becomes repetitive or bland as campaigns draw on; new enemies offer few new challenges.- Balance of settlement construction is still pretty wonky, you'll spend an awful lot of slots on public order buildings instead of exploring the tech tree. You can master Public Order, but it's like pulling teeth.			"

												I preordered Rome 2 before it came out and paid A$89.99 for it. The game was an absolute disaster. Two years on, it is now pretty fun to play although there are still many small flaws remaining - incorrect unit descriptions, incorrect piercing damage, no hoplite phalanxes, weird projectile damage,  etc etc. However, the game is a vast step forward from Rome 1 and a number of quality of life improvements are evident. Overall I enjoy the game, although now that i've played a few campaigns as various factions the game is all starting to feel very samey. Expect to lose battles to the AI now, although later in the game it becomes a big steamroll as usual.Romans have the best roster by a country mile, and by contrast some other factions can feel quite bare, especially when you get bigger. As it stands, I would give Rome 2 a 7/10 and pay up to A$30 for it, given the time you'll get out of it. The only DLC i have is Greek City States (free with pre-order). I am considering buying one or two of the campaign packs on special.  I have given the game a thumbs down because at release, it was absolutely appalling, around a 3/10.			"

The  dlcs are worth more then the game, i mean seriously i undertand the addition stories like hannibal at the game and others to be dlc, but really taking factions of like Sparta. really regret buying this and SEGA dont get mad when people pirate your game they are stealing from you like your stealing from your customers			"

												Graphics are great and battles are pretty good too. However the general gameplay is terrible. You spend ages managing public order and food levels rather than doing the fun stuff of buliding armies, moving them around the map and building your empire. Total War has lost its way. I have played every game in the franchise but I doubt I'll buy another. The last good game they made was Empire!			"

												I am trying to give a neutural view on the game. My feelings are still confused and I am not sure if I hate it or love it. It all started when the game was first released. Many bugs, huge turn change times and a bad overall expirience. All of us that grew up with Rome Total War were devastated with that turn of events (not gonna mention the wasted money) In the next months the company tried hard to fix and polish their unready game. I can now say that they finaly did it so for you that you are thinking about buying it now there is not going to be a problem at all. The community is the one thing you are going to love in this game. The modders do amazing job making historical or funny mods. The Dlcs might be your only concern. You should keep in mind that I they don't affect the game in any way. They just add more flavour and more factions. My overall opinion is to buy this game, play it and then think if you want the dlcs.			"

												I have been playing the Total War series for a while now and Rome 2 has a fantastic campaign system. The graphics are amazing in ultra or high settings. There is a great range of factions and the province system really works well.However, the game feels under optimized and I also feel that the multiplayer system has many flaws as it is very hard to get people to join your battle. I also feel that the game is unrefined as there are still many bugs and you need a very good graphics card and processor to run this game. The benchmarking system is unrealistic as it said in high settings at an average of 15fps, but in a battle Fraps told me I had 55fps.Only buy this game when it is at a good price!			"

												It's hard to say no to a Total War game since I've loved every single version so far, even Empire Total War. However, if I had knew about the bugs and glicthes on launch, I probably would have waited for the game to be fixed. That being said, it's been a few weeks now and the game is starting to look pretty good. Gameplay wise, the game is the same as any of the other Total War games. There a few new features added in, and most have improved the game. For example, Siege battles are a bit more challenging and now you have restrictions on how many armies/navies you can have, which is good because the AI doesn't spam like 50 small armies anymore. Speaking of the AI, it's probably the only thing I have to complain about. It still sucks, but the AI is defintely an improvement over Shogun 2. However, I still find it stupid when I see a whole unit of swords charge head first into my pike formation. The Graphics are really nice, but sadly you require a pretty good computer to run things on High/Ultra. I'm currently running on Medium with an i3. However, the graphics are still beautiful and the animations are really exciting, as the battles feel pretty real now. Overall, I recommend this game for everyone to try. However, make sure you have an i5 and a good video card to unlock all the wonderful aspects of this game.			"

												This game is less about the recommendation, more about the pricing strategy. I bought this pre-release for about $50-$60, and let's face it, back then the game was a shambles. After patching it to death the game is now playable and I find out it is $10......lesson learned - wait and buy the game heavily discounted later			"

												Creative Assembly gave a 30% finished game so modders have to do the rest of the work. The game is fun when modded (fixed and finished), but CA should have finished it. They did the same thing with Attila, and Wahammer (which is the only TW I didn't get or play and I won't). DLC concept is shameful. Like scammers on the street. I'm not even gonna get into that. I'm playing TW since the first Shougun came out and onwards. I like the concept very much. Sadly some other people did this game. People that were so whack that it is even a wonder that they've managed to do even this much. What I don't like about the game as well are the STUPID jokes in descriptions of various things. I think one of those two guys promoting ROME 2 was doing them. Because it kinda reminds me of those two douches. The one with that long faggy hair and that other guy from the videos. Annoying.ALso I don't like the ""more information"" option (units and buildings) when it opens a window which is slow and the WORST possible idea in all games I've played in my life.  Everyone can sail, just like that. It's stupid as well, and lots of other things. As I've said, if you get some mods then the game is fun. It's the only way I can reccomend it. ONLY! I'm real about this because TW is one of the few game series I stayed with during my gaming life and I can be totally honest. I hope CA or whoever keeps on doing these TW games never repeats this DISGUSSTING eppisode we've seen with the last 3 tittles. I hope it ends, and abruptly. You guys need to snap out of this bad trip.			"
