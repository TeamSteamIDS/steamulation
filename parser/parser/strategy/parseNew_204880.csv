												This is the best game I know.  Fantastic 4x play that kept me coming back for years, and I think it will be a future classic.  There are about a half dozen full environment mods for this game and lots more resources in general.  We need a strong, 64 bit reboot of this game that allows us to use the power of modern computers.  I know I'd buy it and every DLC they come out with.			"

												So what's good about this game? Well let Swerve tell you! This is going to be long as hell since I used to play the orginal a crap ton 3 years ago! So gather round children! Grab a seat and listen to the great story I am about to tell!Diplomacy:The game provides a pretty solid diplomacy system that fits in very well with the backstory of the game. This means that it's harder to ally with Vasari rebels when you're a Vasari loyalist, unless you already premade the teams ofc. The computer or player can give you missions, if you choose to do them will improve your relations with them. Eventually if they like you enough they ask for peace treaties, powerful pacts (These buff both of your factions), trade agreements, ect. Even though diplomacy is useful in a game, it's not the core aspect of this game, you shouldn't buy it expecting it to be a game like Anno 1404 where war is only an option.Your goal is to kill everyone, not to make peace with them.TL;DROverall it's a nice mechanic, it fits with the story, highly dynamic, and very diverse, but not the main focus of the game.Combat:Personally, I think the combat is very simple.You have your ship types: -The Frigate : Light, fast ships. Most are used for offensive means such as taking out strikecraft or bombing planets. Some are better at taking out other ships than others. I wouldn't call it rock paper siscors but it's kinda close to it.-The Cruiser : More expensive, but provide much more firepower and/or support than frigates. Enforcers/Crusaders/Kodiacs are probably going to be the front line of your fleet.-Srikecraft : I feel I had to put this in somewhere. Strikecraft can only be created by Carrier Cruisers or Capitalships/Titians. They cannot be targeted by normal ships so you either need to counter them by using more strikecraft or use specialized frigates to take them out. They do a crap ton of damage if you leave them unchecked.Strikecraft have 2 types:-Bomber (Good at taking out bigger ships)-Fighters (Good at killing bombers)-*Advent only* homing mines (They're mines)-Capital ships: These are essential for any fleet. They are very expensive *You get your first one free, so pick wisely"" and very powerful ships that provide ALOT of utility and/or damage to the fleet. They are tanky, and usually the first, or last to go down. They act like Warcraft 3 heroes where they level up if you gain enough experience from killing things. These levels unlock abilites for your capital ships that do various things. (Ex. Kol Battleship, The ability  ""Finest Hour"" gives him massive Health Regen and  lowers cooldowns on his other ablities)-Titians : These things a freaking scary. Huge warships each faction/subfaction gets a specific one. They do alot of damage, they provide HUGE utility (Ex. The TEC Loyalist Titian buffs his allys with reduced weapon cooldown and gives them all more shields). It takes 5 points of research to fully build one, and even then It costs alot of money. It's best used in late game.-Starbases : These things are broken. I've turned around entire games using these things. They do LOADS of damage. You can counter them with a ship specialized in destroying buildings, because they out range them, unless you put them in the middle of the damn phase lane! Thats right, you can place them right where you enemy will enter and they wont even get a chance to say their prayers. And if you're TEC Loyaist, you can have 2. gg-Pirates!If you ever play TEC Rebels you need buy a pirate fleet. Seriously. They have the best voice acting N/A. It's hilarious. There will be a pirate base on almost every map, you can place bounty on annother faction and they will attack the person with the most bounty. They don't have shields, they're kinda easy. Cool feature tho.Diversification:I think the ships are very well-designed. Each have their own jobs and none do the exact same job. They all look very different from one annother and are very detailed. They're voice acting is very professional. Overall they did a good job in diversification the different ships. Mechanics: The victor of a battle is mainly determined by whoever has the best ship composition and the most research. It's very rock paper siscors-esk. It's simple, you have shields, that protect the ship for so long and then breaks and then it does health damage, if it reaches zero the ship splodes.There's no complex locational damage, They all just kinda stand still and hit eachother until they die. Realistically, no captian in his right mind would just stand there and let his ship get rekt. But it's based off an old engine so I'll let it go.However! The battles are epic as hell! Pretty lasers, Strikecraft flying all over the place, Capital Ships using they're cool guns. They look very pretty, but nothing else.Economy:Economy is simple as well. The 3 resources you have is Credits, Metal, And Crystals. You can get credits from planets, which you can upgrade to house more people to tax. You can get metal/crystal from extractors that can be built on asteriods orbiting the planets. You can also research and build trade ports and oribal refineries/Matter Processers. TEC are very good at amassing credits. The Vasari are very good at getting minerals. The Advent are mixed.You also have a thing called ""The Black Market"" where you can buy and sell metal and crystals. It acts like a regular economy and if you sell too much the market crashes and it sells for literally nothing. If you buy too much the market booms and I think the price goes up by alot. Doesn't stop me from buying crystal tho, because lord knows I always need crystal. >.>Every resource is renewable. It will never run out. However the more fleet upgrades you invest in, the more it will effect your economy (7 to 80% deduction without pacts/supply reductions). It actually makes turtling viable, and I KNOW EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY LOVES PEOPLE WHO USE THE GOOD OL' TURTLE STRATEGY.Overall the economy is like every other RTS. Just without gatherers or giving a damn about exhausting resources.The Art:This game is beautiful. I love it. Every planet, ship, and building is 1080p and professionally crafted. The battles are awesome because of all the colorful lasers. Every race has different ships which look just as professional as all the others. Voice Acting:Good stuff mayne. Professional voice acting. The voices fit the theme in ships ( Ex. TEC Rebel Titian ""I put the laughter in slaughter!""). Everything just fits. P.S. Whoever voiced the pirate ships deserves a metal.Story:Even though this game has no campaign the opening cinimatic really gives you a good feel of the current state of the universe. The whole ambiance of the game gives off a desperate feel. Every race is tired of fighting, but cannot forgive eachother for the horrible atrocities that they committed against eachother (Hence the name Sins of a Solar Empire). Every side will do whatever it takes to win.If you want to buy this game for story, there really is none besides the opening, sorry, play Mass Effect or something.Conclusion:This game brings a unique twist to the 4x genre. Providing a slow pased game that keeps you interested and on your toes. It includes a large research tree, many ships to choose from, very diverse races, and very pretty art. Though kinda simple it still holds a place in my heart. This has to be one of the best 4X games I've ever played.I'd say it's worth buying.(insert X/10 joke here) "

												Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion is one of the best Strategy Games i know and maybe the best Galactic Strategy Game. Lets begin with the Gameplay. You can choose between 3 Races: TEC (Trader Emergency Coalition) they are human, The Advent was originally a desert religious cult that mastered psychic powers and The Vasari they are the only alien race in the game. A new feature: For every race (TEC,Advent,Vasari) you can choose between Loyalists and Rebels both of them have their own advantages and abilities. You have many possibilities to start a game (defensive, offensive or aggressive) but to win at the end you have to attack the other empire (other players or KI). The intelligence of the KI is pretty well and if you play on a higher difficulty like unfair its really hard to win the game especially if you play agains more than one player for example 5 or even more. (10 players max.) The graphics are really nice and the galaxy with all its stars solar systems and planets looks just awsome. Only if you zoom really close to the planets you will see that their surface is fashioned a little bit boring. But all ships, frigats, star bases and structures look nice and really realistic. One of the coolest features in this game are the Titans the biggest ships you can build. Every player can only have one Titan at the same time because theyre really strong especially as support if you attack with more capital ships and a fleet. Only a full developed star base can fight against this strong ship. You can play in small solar systems with 9 planets or you can choose the biggest map: a galaxy with five solar systems and about 150 planets. Thats really big and you will need a long time to discover the whole galaxy with all its secrets and resources. Resources a one of the most important things in the game you can earn: credits (from: taxes, war and allies) metal (mainly from extractors but also from allies and war) crystal (mainly from extractors but also from allies and war). As soon as you have enough recources, planets and a few defensive structures you can start to discover the galaxy and to build your fleet with many little ships, capital ships and you big Titan. Then you can attack other empires to get their planets because for a big empire you need much space. But maybe the will attack you before you you are ready and thats the difficulty with this game: YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! Thats what makes this game so interesting. Lets come to an end: This game is worth buying! You need to invest time but once you have understood everything the fun begins and you can start building many empires. I hope i could help you. :)			"

												This is by far my favorite strategy game.  For those of you who are new to Sins it will be a bit of a challenge figuring out how to play the game but trust me put the time in and it pays off. The difficulty of the game can be tweaked to suit anybody's needs, wether your'e looking for a quick 1 on 1 match against an easy opponent or an 8 player free for all against ruthless AI, or compete against real human beings online.  Be warned though, matches can last for hours and hours, this can be a good or bad point depending on your play style.  Visuals are great, so much satisfaction to be had in zooming all the way in on your massive fleets and watching them demolish your rivals empire in flurries of lasers, and explosions.  Long story short, if your'e into games like Total War, Glactic Civilizations, Supreme Commander then your'e definately going to want to pick this up.  40$ is a little steep though so look for it to go on sale, I was able to pick it up for 8$.

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a massive real-time strategy game developed by Ironclad Games and published by Stardock Entertainment. It is the third standalone expansion in the popular Sins of a Solar Empire line of games and stands as testament to why this genre can only work with the PC Platform. Although the game is classified as an RTS, it does feature a lot of 4X (Civilization type) elements which the developers are calling the 'RT4X' genre.PLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes control of a space faring civilization whose sole objective is to be the most dominant force in the Galaxy. Achieve this either through military force, diplomatic means or economic superiority. Lead your civilization from a small single planet colony into a vast interplanetary empire spanning multiple worlds and multiple star systems.PROS:+ Epic in scale (The player can choose to either play in one solar system only, or expand their empire to other solar systems if the map permits)+ Massive space combat and intense fleet engagements+ Beautiful Graphics and Visuals+ Good ship and space station variety+ Ship and space station customization and upgrades+ Complex and solid core gameplay+ Simple and easy to manage Empire Tech Tree+ Incorporates the features of the previous expansions without forcing you to buy them+ High replayability+ Seamless Zoom Function (Marvel at your fleet or the intense ship on ship combat)+ Playable even with some lower end computers+ Modding potential (Example: See Star Trek 3 Armada mod)CONS:- No Campaign mode and even if there was...(see below)- Story is negligible- Steep learning curve- Capital/Titan Ships and Space stations have no hardpoints (see Star Wars: Empire at War space combat)- Only three main factions to play (although there are 6 sub-factions)- Stardock Account ManagementCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME but NOT FOR EVERYONE. If you're the type of gamer who's really into real-time strategy or 4X games and have a lot of free time to burn, then this game would be great.WORTH IT?:GOOD BUY and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Space, Sci-Fi, RTS and 4X fans.FINAL NOTES:It's massive in scale with dozens of ships clashing in some of the most epic space warfare I have ever seen. Outside of combat, it has a good and complex empire management system akin to the 4X genre. The game also runs surprisingly well with the last generation computer systems since its game engine still only need the system requirements back in 2008 when it was first released.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												I must have played this game hundreds of hours, not only the steam-version but also an earlier version.What is very unique about it, is it's great epic battles. You expand your empire. You build your fleet(s). And when the decisive face-off with your opponent finally has come, ""Sins of Solar Empire: Rebellion"" gives you the most brilliant epic battles you will ever have seen in RTS.Don't be mislead by my words. There will be lots of matches, where victory or defeat is inevitable and unspectacular. You won't see much of the ""magic"" then. Of course that all depends on your game settings, strategy and the quality of your opponents. You can set the game to go faster. Then you will experience 30 minute matches in PvP or PvE, that leave little time for micromanagement and decisions. Or you can really go epic and slow, where you carefully make your choices and feel the electricity in the air ... uhm ... void I mean ... , as your fleets slowly close the distance and hell brakes loose. Then you will see how every choice you make affects the battle and finally turns the tide. Also, ""rock paper scissors"" still applies. With huge fleets and many different ship types, finding the right line-up is not trivial.You can choose from a wide variety of settings, to get the game to be more of a minimalistic skirmish or almost turn-based. I once left a slow singleplayer match for a few seconds and it turned out to take me 15 minutes. I had forgotten to pause. When I returned, my fleet had fought off some space pirates but nothing else happened. In other games I might have returned just in time to see the final building of my base collapse. Whatever floats your capital ship. If you have played the traditional SOASE, the capital ships there were really big and important for your micromanagement. But now you get the Titan, sort of a huge hero unit unique to every faction. Nothing can survive long in the presence of a Titan and as it ""learns"" it becomes a fleet in being, crushing entire enemy fleets.Establishing your empire gets a bit of the old ""Master of Orion"" feeling. You conquer planets, build up stuff on them and in the orbit.Orbit is a nice key word. The battles don't take place in space but in the orbit around contested planets. The planets are connected through space lanes. That may narrow down your options and spoil the open-world idea of an RTS game fought in space. On the other hand it creates nice tactical elements like bottle necks or flanking maneuvers.Another great aspect is diplomacy leading to alliances, which even grant advantages in combat.Unfortunately the game still has some balancing issues in PvP which is not helped by the fact, that the player community has shrunk and you will encounter lots of veteran players. You might get frustrated. But the game also has a great PvE mode and the AI is not bad at all. Sometimes the AI is rushing into a futile battle. But then again they seem to calculate their odds on-the-fly and retreat even before you know you won, only to be back before you expected them to. For SP I would recommend downloading some maps from the community, cause the PvP maps are all about balance and symmetry and PvE should be more about atmosphere and exploration. There are maps out there with huge star systems, where a game will last for days, mind this is still RTS, not ""Civilization"". With the option to get AI on your side or more on the enemy side, with - I think up to 8 - teams and difficulty settings, everyone can get a challenging yet enjoyable game experience.You will need to play hundreds of hours to get all of the tactical depth of this title and still be surprised. And if you really think you have seen it all, you can benefit from the community friendliness of SOASE. The community has been very active and there are not only lots of maps and units and ""improved balancing"" tweaks but also great mods.I cannot tell which one you will like best as that depends on your nerdiness. However there are two very impressive mods based on the universes of Star Wars and Star Trek and even a Battlestar Galactica Mod, that i have not tried yet.Other game developers make you pay for every piece of DLC, cutting off fans from implementing their own ideas. Ironclad Games and Stardock stick with another philosophy here. To try your own ideas, the game comes with two tools, a quick map designer and an editor. Thanks for that, by the way, really appreciated. Ironically that makes the game still attractive today and people are still buying it.Any negative points? Well, the game is from 2012 and graphics might not be thrilling anymore plus you will play zoomed out most of the time and not see much of it anyway. I have it run smoothly on medium settings even on my old Core2 notebook. Also, if you prefer fast paced RTS with a focus on gut feeling and micro managing small troops, then you might be more comfortable with ""Company of Heroes"" or something similar. Personally, I like both, but they are very different. I would never start a game of SOASE if i knew, I only have got an hour of time. In Singleplayer you can pause and even accelerate but it will never be a casual play.Another flaw is that units may take the initiative if not carefully set. Sometimes a ship will come back to the fight although you ordered it away and be destroyed because of some older stance. You can merge ships to different fleets or release them, but every now and then they do what they want. When you command hundreds of ships, that is not what you need. Also sometimes you will have trouble noticing a minor push or incident because the interface is not that well arranged.So all in all I would highly recommend SOASE:R to anyone looking for a unique RTS experience in a scifi world. The game, at present, is still worth its 75% discount, largely due to the open design and mods. I would not pay more, since it's an older title. If you are not sure, you can wait for a further drop or a bundle.			"

												Great Game!--------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:One of the best strategy games i have played!!!This game is a really good fuse of TBS and RTS, and has provided me with endless fun (most of which was on my old account)Also, even if you get bored (which i doubt you ever will), the mods and workshop items will keep you interested.There are no significant bugs and software malfunctions, which means that the developer has put a lot of effort into itThe soundtrack is also great.The gameplay is crafted to perfectionEndless possibilities.The game also lets you make your own maps, and the multiplayer is just amazing. The difficulty of the AI is just all right, not too easy, not too hard.I only tried a few of the tutorial missions, but they appear to be carefully made too.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons: This game does have a steep learning curve though, but after one hour (For Me At Least, w/ out tutorials) you will get the hang of it.The fighting scene for this game is not very blazing, as it is just a few ships staying there firing a few shots at each other. Not very visually pleasing.New ships will say a quote after the construction is finished. This is not an issue if you are only constructing a few flagships, but it gets irritating when you are producing 100 frigates at a time. Just a repeated ""All Coordinates accounted for"" for 100 times.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall, the developer has put a lot of effort into the game, and I dont see why it is soo unpopular.

												This game has all the set ups to be one of the BEST strategy games I have ever played. I have been a fan from 2008 of this game. All the way from first release. It has grown to be pure AWESOME when steam got it on its list!The strategic possibilitys are as endless as are your skills.-Full out assault (Recomended to beginners)-Increased fleet size and control of planets (Mid style)-Building bad♥♥♥♥♥star bases to protect your planets and building superior TITAN to increase fleets fire power while maintaining pirate missions on other players trouble and keeping trade routes safe (HARDCORE)-Only your style is the limit!The games scale is insane in good way!From strike craft size to full galazy just by rolling the mouse wheel 4 times... WOOT?? Yes, you read correctly.The best part is the total control of your full area by super easy way.Oh yes, did I mention this game is real time. So no need to wait what is gonna happen. And believe me, alot will happen!I highly recommend to buy those 2 DLC pacs (Forbidden Worlds, Stellar Phenomena) too for they increase the variety of game styles and makes your game even more different with few twist (NOT GONNA SPOIL)And community drives hard! Online is the best choise for that is where the knowledge is!Some information about the game itself:- Tutorial goes from basic to advanced- No missions to play, just full galazys to conquer- Up to 8 factions to choose from with own unique strategys to offer- Unique ship styles-Up to 2000 (!!) fleet supply and that does not inclue strike craft supply!- Up to 8 player maps- Very good selection of maps to choose from. From small map to INSANE over 100 planets and if DLCs inclue... (SPOILER!!)I let you ofcourse to make the decision but there are only two sides, Allys or rebels... No between!But to make this bowl of overflowing honey some bittersweet I must warn you:THIS GAME EATS ALOT OF RESOURCES FROM YOUR COMPUTER!!HARDCORE VETERAN			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is one of the most versatile space based RTS games produced; the vanilla game offers three distinct factions and each of those has a sub faction you can choose; loyalist or rebels, each with different tech and construction options. The research trees are fairly comprehensive and cover everything from civilian, military, diplomatic and defence branches each with 30-40 techs in each branch. Therefore there can be different strategies each playthrough to some extent. But the combat is fairly satisfying as well as visually pleasing but the real beauty of Sins is the vast repository of mods available for it on sites like ModDB - Sins of a Galactic Empire (Star Wars), Star Trek Armada 3 are probably two of the most comprehensive you could check out, but there are many more. Therefore as well as the great base game you also have access to whatever particular science fiction genre you want to simulate with the solid game engine. What I would suggest for those familiar with them are programs like large address aware; but more for the mods as opposed to the base game as they tend to crank up the population capacity of ships compared to vanilla. (Due to engine constraints it only utilises the old school 4gb of ram limitation even if you have 16gb; LAA or similar will remedy this problem and allow for late game battles on a massive scale.)

												A game from a company that told the industry, stop using stupid DRM, made tons of money to prove DRM wasn't needed, they then decide to keep updating the game!?! WTF, is this a Game Company? Why haven't they asked me to pay them more for these free updates including expanding the engine to include more RAM to help out modders? The game is great, and balances well against the 6 choices of race/rebellion and you benefit from playing to their style. Top that off with some great mods and I have never had as much fun with an RTS with friends against hordes of insane computer. I was telling ""This Will be our Greatest Hour!"" for probably about a full hour as my last battleship helped defend our frontline world long enough for us to form a counter attack.			"

												Epic space strategy at its best! Sins polished game engine allows seamless navigation from the micro managment of your individual planetary systems & military units all the way out to the full solar system view allowing large scale tactical management.At close range, all galactic elements as well as the ship & stations have very high level of graphic detail; they look fantastic! When you zoom out this detail is replaced with a clear tactical overlay making it easy to transition between tasks, all intuitively done with the mouse scroll wheel & pointer location. UI is low frills, but very functional.A.I. is also well designed, smart & strong! If you are not quick & know your strategy, at harder difficulties, they will give you a real battle for your survival! Further challenges can be found in the achievements, which challenge you to only research one tech tree or not to build a type of ship. These mix up the gameplay & I enjoyed trying to get these ones. I'm still hunting for the elusive Space Ponies! :)DLCs so far have been relatively small feature enhancements, but all worthwhile grabbing as they add a few more new things to the Sins universe. There are also some great total conversion mods (& other mods) out there to try, like one of my favs, the Star Wars total conversion mod called Sins of a Galactic Empire. Worth checking out.Sins pretty much has it all from unique alien factions, diplomacy & extensive tech trees to missions & trading. Also population, battle & resource management & massive planetary sieges involving hundreds of ships.The shear scale means games can go for days! Epic game!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Ironclad Games's first released title, and a decent RTS which I consider to be at the halfway point between traditional RTS and 4X. It might even be safe to call it a real-time 4X.As gameplay mechanics go, SOASE is sound, if a bit simplistic. Rock-paper-scissors unit relationships abound, and unit spam is unfortunately a viable strategy in some situations. Each of the three factions is specialized to excel in certain capacities, resulting in widely varying overall strategies and battle tactics. SOASE features hero units in the form of capital ships, which again specialize in certain roles and progress in a MOBA-like fashion, gaining experience through combat, leveling up, and gaining or upgrading abilities (culminating in a powerful ""ultimate"" ability at level 6). Most battles typically hinge on the survival or destruction of one's capital ships, as they become more and more important targets through leveling.Technically speaking, combat isn't the ONLY way to win a SOASE match. Like your typical 4X game (say, Civ V), victory conditions can be set which allow for several different paths to win through, for example, cultural influence or technological progress. However, again like your typical 4X game, most matches are won by pure conquest anyway. I don't think I've ever turned on those extra victory conditions since I started playing; conquest is good enough for me.The Rebellion expansion adds factions-within-factions, with each race dividing in half to offer more specialization, as well as faction-specific Titan-class supercapitals, massive investments in time and resources which serve as the nucleus of an effective late-game fleet.And that's... really about all I can say. I find it quite fun, both alone and with friends, but if I'm honest, there just isn't enough there to be worth the dollar amount Ironclad is asking for. I understand they're still a fledgling studio that needs the sales to improve and progress as developers, but frankly I believe they're only hurting their prospects by charging $40 when there isn't $40 worth of game. It is, however, a good value for $20 which is the price at which I bought it on sale, and of course any sale price lower than that is even better. The game's capacity for randomization can ensure no two matches are the same, so the replay value on Sins is quite high, but replay value based on randomization is not, in my eyes, a good enough substitute for actual content to justify a price tag approaching that of a AAA title.Final verdict: definitely worth playing, AND worth buying, if on sale. Don't pay full price for this.			"

												Excellent RTS Game, The mods for this game are also incredible like Dawn of the Reapers (Mass Effect), Sins of a Galactic Empire (Star Wars) and Sins of the Prophets (Halo). I downloaded the Halo mod before i even got the game itself, haha.			"

												A truly wonderful space based RTS. The 3 races play very differently from one another and the sub-factions are distinct enough to make you change your style depending on whether you're the Loyalists or Rebels.The game's pace can be easily adjusted in the pregame options to suit your skill and the AI does a good job of building counters to your units (e.g. you build long range, AI builds corvettes). Having said that, the AI has a greater emphasis on the Artifical as opposed to Intelligence as it essentially attempts to win through attrition.But such AI strategies are to be expected and, in my opinion, lead to some pretty epic battles. Build a starbase on a key chokepoint and station a fleet there to try and hold the line, if you're playing Hard or higher the AI will be charging your line in no time with capital ships, frigates, corvettes, cruisers and even titans.The game is also extremely moddable. If you can read this review you can mod a good portion of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. There are also tonnes of mods already created (Halo, Star Wars, Star Trek, etc.).Finally, while the game does not have a campaign I personally feel this is no loss. Honestly ask yourself, ""Would I play the campaign more than three times?"" Probably not unless there was some meaningful reward (which would be difficult to work into the game). As a result, the omission of a four to eight hour campaign is no big loss.I could go on and on but I'm worried you'll keep reading when you should just go get the game already!			"

												tl;dr: This is good game. Cheap for what you get, lots of mods. Good optimization, much pretty. Music nice, gameplay nice, must play for space RTS fans.  Sins of a Solar Empire is a space RTS with no campaign, but endless replayability. Every game, the universe that the game is played in is randomized, or selected from a premade map (which offer specific challenges to make the game more interesting). There can be many stars in one universe, and each star can have very few or very many planets, asteroids, wormholes, etc. The game offers a very nice blend of combat, research, and dimplomacy. But research really trumps everything, which leads into one of Sins' flaws... the difficulty curve. This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you are a newcomer to the RTS genre, and even if you are a veteran, you will find a good challenge. This game is not for the easily frustrated, because going against AI, or other players, can really pump up the blood pressure sometimes. The game itself runs very well for my system. I'm running it on an AMD FX 6300 Processor, NvidiaGTX 660, with 8 GB of RAM, and it runs perfectly fine. It is very well optimized and looks beautiful. The backgrounds of space look phenomenal and the ships look pretty good too. Watching the space battles can be so nice to look at that you forget to make sure they are actually doing alright. Anyway, This game is worth the $40, but I would also cash in for the DLC, because they are very good for the price. The modding potential for this game is amazing as well. If you ever get bored of the basic game, you can just browse the giant selection of quality mods on Moddb. If there is a popular movie/TV/game/book series taking place in space, there is a good possibility that there is a well made mod already created, or being crafted of it. Thanks for reading, if you got this far, and I hope this review helps, although the fact that there are already 1,000's of positive reviews made for this game should be a clear indication of the quality of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.

												First review in a while, but this game deserves it.I'll start out with the somewhat common ""my playtime is inaccurate"" speech, having played more than 200 hours of this and it's previous incarnations through Impulse.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is truly one of a kind. This version basically combines the entirety of the 2 previous titles, Trinity and regular ol' SoaSE, so Rebellion truly has it all and more.As such, this review is kind of both a Rebellion review and SoaSE in general review, because I've never reviewed the original or Trinity as there is no real story to this game, which makes it a difficult game to even explain to the masses who enjoy story driven games.I tend to play a Single Player skirmish with 2 or 3 Hard AI players, however in the past have spent a great deal of time playing lengthy LAN matches, which were loads of fun, but ultimately one of the only major flaws of SoaSE comes out through such lengthy matches, even just playing against AI.That flaw has been given a bad wrap in more recent times because of the evolution and adoption of Multi Core processor technology.Essentially this game does not utilise multicore CPU's and unfortunately there is no fix for this, even after extensive research and optimisation mod trialling. But to their credit, those mods are great for getting the game to run on lower spec systems, laptops, virtualisation/steaming etc, but no mod can add 64bit or multicore support. That's the game's engine limitation, and it's not the only one around... I'm looking at you Cities XL.It is important to note that at regular playing speed, this takes tens of hours of a single match to even be a problem, but on lower spec, lower (and older) GHz systems, this happens within about an hour give or take 30mins of regular speed play time with a couple of AI players.With all that said, one of THE greatest longevity features for me is the ability to speed up the game time by 2x, 4x and 8x increments, even in a LAN match (host must change it).Because of the vast expanses of space and [travelling] time at regular speed, this speed up feature can actually make for a much more challenging game, albeit much faster. Generally you will have to sacrifice micro management for macro at those speeds, but on large scale maps with only 2 or 3 players, with multiple star systems, the ability to speed up hyperspace travel from a distant planet to another is a HUGE time saving and action creating element and there is no penalty or lock down on the control of the game speed that you have, apart from it's 4 presets, so interchanging between them can be as fluid as zooming in or out and the speed controls can be remapped as well as basically everything else.When I first discovered this speed up feature in the original Sins, it was, at first, not something I was looking for or really cared about, largely because I was still learning the controls and the game at the time.When I was finally bored with the amount of time it took to setup, capture, defend, build and deploy, it would be too long for a single game session, and that bothered and still bothers me.Command & Conquer (up until and including 3) had the right recipe for possible lengths of a single player skirmish battle. With Sins this isn't possible at regular speed, that is if you're interested in actually establishing a large empire of any sort instead of rushing with a dozen weak ships, which gets stale fast. The camera controls in Sins are very fluid and quite unique, and once you get the hang of it, there really is nothing like it, some things are similar but the ability to orbit and zoom freely around any axis while fixed on a certain point is impressive, and the instant ability to track any of your fleet and zoom right in to the ship and it's details or zoom right out to galaxy level all in real time and fluid as your mouse can move. An RTS camera/movement system that IMO rivals that of what Blizzard, Westwood or EA have ever done is definitely worth a mention in this review.The 3 original factions, the TEC, Advent and Vasari have been Loyalist-ised and given their Rebel counterparts in this final Sins title and have created many new ways of playing the game. I found that this is by far the most balanced of the 3 in the series mainly because of the 3 extra sub-faction additions, which also open up Role-Playing type elements of having say, 3 Rebel factions vs 3 Loyalist factions in a desperate struggle to take control over a strange galaxy.The in-game Map Designer is also worth a mention, although it takes a fair bit of trial and error to get something you're happy with, and even then playing your own creations can sometimes backfire or surprise you in ways you never thought possible.The only downside is the lack of manipulation you have on Planets and Stars. The ""Map Designer"" is basically a Map Generator.If you've ever wanted to take on several hundred space pirate homeworlds in the one solar system then Sins is for you!But in all seriousness, the Map Designer does a pretty good job once you learn how it works and ways you can create interesting maps just by changing sliders and numbers.If you're really serious about designing your own Solar System or Galaxy then Ironclad have supplied everyone with their GalaxyForge editor which is used to create the many included Single and Multiplayer premade maps. My Pros & Cons shortlist;Pros:+ One of a kind space-based RTS gameplay+ Useful and informative dialogue boxes, hovering over icons has been given great attention to detail.+ Massive tech tree+ Awesome scale of real time space battles and large scale empire building.+ Fine control over placement of your buildings, or for riskier, faster matches, an ""Auto place"" feature for Buildings which is also a ++ Interesting and unique items, ships, power-ups, upgrades+ The graphics scale really well across many many different types of systems, but the close up details can be a bit disappointing even at Ultra settings.+ Inclusion of both a Map Designer & GalaxyForge editor.Cons:- Fairly steep learning curve and long match times- Units (mainly Capital Ships) of the same type have to be upgraded individually, on a small scale this is less important then on a larger one.- No minimap- Left Planet, Structure and Unit tree can't be hidden. Capturing more than 10-20 planets adds much more time navigating and cuts any efficiency of the tree at all.- Some tasks would be better left automated, such as the 2 scout ships that you start with should have their exploration ability Autocast set to on, not off. Also Metal and Crystal mines could be auto-built after you have captured a planet and have the resources to spare- At regular speed it takes far too long to reach higher tech levels in a single match- Can be boring in stages of early travel or exploration. Once you've seen the same variations of desert, ice, volcanic, terran and asteroids over and over, the excitement wears down over time (tens to hundreds of hours for me)- Not just a con of Sins, but most RTS games really need the ability to 'mute' a certain Unit or Building you are queuing up and and creating 50 or 100+ of the same Units and the game wants to announce the successful creation of every single one.Story: 4/10AI: 7/10Sound/Music: 7/10Voice: 6/10Controls: 9/10Models: 8/10Textures: 8/10Special Effects: 9/10Replayability: 7/1065/100			"

												If you've never experienced Sins of a Solar Empire before, you'll find no better entry point than Rebellion. But if Rebellion commits any sins of its own, it's in the 37$ price tag, which seems excessive for an expansion that will almost certainly strike its loyal fans as little more than a meaty content patch.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion adds some nice features to a great, proven winner of a game. Those features are nice, but as nice as they are, I couldn't really see myself running out and throwing down nearly forty bucks for this standalone expansion if I already owned the original Sins, to say nothing of its expansion packs.But on the other hand, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is an outstanding and unique real-time strategy game that offers a welcome, slower alternative to StarCraft 2's intense pacing. As a life-long fan of sci-fi space battles, I simply can't help but strongly recommend it.The important part here is that Sins of a Solar Empire still delivers a very unique kind of strategy game, and Rebellion doesn't screw with that; instead, it makes that base game substantially smoother and more interesting.

												I'm on the fence about this title. It's a very fun and enjoyable game, and for that I recommend it. HOWEVER, fans of the original SOSE should know that the publisher, StarDock, has made a complete 180 on the subject of DRM and their treatment of customers since they originally published their ""Gamer's Bill of Rights."" If you are a die-hard opponent of DRM, I can not recommend giving them your money to buy this title. They have made it a requirement now to register a Stardock account to activate the game, and you only get one activation. TL;DR: If you don't care about DRM, this is a good game if you like the genre. If you do, however, giving stardock your money now, for this, sets a bad example. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. Now that I have, though, I'm enjoying it.If you don't want to buy this because of the DRM, look into the original SOSE title, as it was published 100% DRM-free. Buy that instead, as it's really not that different from this expansion.			"

												Think Age of Empires. Then think Rome: Total War. Now throw those games into space and fast-foward a couple thousand years, and you'll get Sins of a Solar Empire. This game takes space combat where it has never gone before. The arrray of different ships is vast, the visuals stunning, and the game play rewarding. You can zoom the map all the way out to view 5 solar systems at once, or zoom all the way down to a single fighter as it zips around a mind-bogglingly large and colorful battle. My only complaint is that sometimes the game can feel too big, if you are playing on the largest map scale, and you find yourself waiting for a good 5 minutes as your fleet traverses one system to the next in search of the enemy. Build scouts!			"

												I love this game.  While there are some similarities to other 4x games, this one combines the right mix of fleet combat (w/ great graphics and sound effects) with expansion and building.  Thankfully, they did not overdo it with the planet building and trading aspects.  There is just enough to make it an integral part of the game, yet they do not weigh it down.   I've enjoyed the single player game as well as multiplayer online.  Sometimes it is difficult to find people who will play for hours online (my last game was 4 hours almost exactly).    However, if someone quits, the A.I. takes over, even if it was the initial host.  The A.I. is not the absolute greatest, but it is capable of making you work for a victory.  If you want to command a fleet or many fleets and conquer the galaxy, planet-by-planet, you will likely enjoy this game.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire represents a fun and visually spectacular 4x game. But the 4x is a bit tilted. There is diplomacy and you can win with diplomacy, there is exploration and you will need to explore and there is exploitation. But Sins of a Solar Empire at it's core is a game of extermination, combat drives the game and will dominate the majority of what you do, but that is perfectly fine considering how fun it is. This game is well supported considering it's age though optimisation in multiplayer is poor and they do not allow you to local host your games instead requiring you to connect to their servers. The attention to detail in the base game is excellent from space elevators and space traffic around your planets to having individual weapon ports on ships with their own firing arcs. It's hard to get bored of this game especially if you have friends to play with.But, when you do get bored, there are tons of ways you can spice up the game. Here is a short list of some of the very best mods for the game. You can play Star Trek Armada 3 mod and fight the Dominion War as either the Federation, Klingons, Borg, Dominion or Romulans. Many people will argue this is the best mod for Sins of a Solar Empire, an exceptional amount of love has gone into it and is by the most detailed mod.There is the Maelstrom mod, it reimagines the Sins of a Solar Empire universe with new races based on books and tv series. Maelstrom is unique as being one of the few Sins mods that are not direct clones of existing universes. It is my personal favourite for it's excellent balance and aesthetic appeal but also because it is one of the few Sins mods that let you play the original factions from the base game.You could try the Fall of Kobal, this mod takes place in the Battlestar Galactica universe letting you play as Colonials, Cylons or dissident factions of either. The biggest reason to appreciate this mod is because of how extremely small the development team is and what a fantastic result they ended up with regardless. Sins of the Prophets is like Fall of Kobal except it takes place in the Halo universe pitting the UNSC and Covenant against each other. Beware though for the mighty Flood threat is real and dangerous. Aesthetically this mod is second to none, the detail in the models and the special effects are absolutely incredible and it offers by far the most unique combat experience of any mod on this list. Thrawn's Revenge II. This is one of many good Star Wars mods for Sins, in my opinion though this one is the best. The mod lets you play as post Star Wars Episode VI factions based on the extended universe lore. This doesn't mean you can't enjoy Clone Wars era ships though and there are plenty of iconic ships from the Original Trilogy to cover all your nostalgic needs. Star Wars Interregnum recently got it's latest update making it compatible with the current patch of the game. This mod is based on the excellent 4x Enhanced mod that tries to incorporate a greater degree of exploitation and exploration including new diplomatic options, planets and stars. Star Wars Interregnum expands on this by also adding in the Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire as playable factions with amazing models and excellent balance with the existing factions.			"

												This is one of the best space stategy games of all time. If you want a game to not only be beutiful but never the same game experiance twice this is the game for you. Pros-Near Perfect Stability-Massive ship battles that will be epicly stunning!-Smart AI for your foes and 5 diffrent difficulty settings from casual to insane in the membrane. (Dificullty can also be adjusted by the complexity of the map in more ways than be mentioned here)-Low graphics requirements for such a complex game. Near Perfect optimization. -Mods! Near 20 complete overhaul mods. Star Trek, Halo, Stargate etc. -Stunning skyboxes and ship models. -More than 50 premade maps (not including DLC maps) And the ability to create custom maps both base game and through the use of Galaxy Forge. -Distict factions. 3 distict facion with unique races, ship styles, tech trees, and structures. -Easy to learn and play but diffcult to master!-Single Player or Multi Player otions both equally well implemented and neither take away from the other. -Can host server multiplayer games with mods or find other players using mods. Or without mods as well. -5 distict victory types for a bigger variety of playstyles. -Complete camera movement viem ships, objects and stations from all agles and refined distances. Cons-Mods are not plug and play. You have to use an external site and unpack the files in the proper folders as well as edit a txt. file to activate them. Besides the base game doesn't have to have mods untill your 200 hours in.Best of luck players. Sincerly, -Akeva-Banshee- The Typo King!			"

												This is a niche game. You have to love RTS titles to begin with in order to get all you can out of this game. That being said, this may be the greatest RTS game ever created. Pro:- Intricate, detailed gameplay that allows for nearly infinite strategies, compounded by six readily distinguishable classes, each with easily understood strengths and weaknesses.- Gorgeous gameplay, small battles feel like a desperate struggle, large battles feel like an epic contest of ultimate power, and all planet/star models are meticulously rendered into sprawling heaps of sublimity.- Early/Mid/Late game all allow for new strategy to be applied, letting the player modify their tactics to better meet the assuredly unexpected challenges they face.- In-Game map creator allows for pretty much any map style the player could ever want.- Solid multiplayer mode, far less lag than would be expected for a game of this sheer magnitude.- Player interface is smooth and allows at-hand modification for hotkeys, etc.- Extremely advanced AI, on harder difficulties your robot opponents will be very difficult to defeat.Con:- The learning curve is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick wall. At least two or three hours of tutorial + practice are required before you stand a chance of beating even the Easy AI.- Micromanaging is a must, although I love it, assigning keybindings for every possible ability and advancement can be tedious, and is unfortunately a must for high-end competitive play. Not much is required for basic play, but for some, dealing with planetary income/resource/optimization issues will be a chore.- This game is an enourmous time investment, I've played matches that lasted over twelve hours. The shortest match I've ever played was probably about two hours.- No campaign mode. I hate to even say it, but if this game had one, it would shine brighter than a pulsar.Essentially, if you like RTS games, strategy games in general, or mentally challenging games in more general still, you will love this. I've spent hundreds of hours (I bought and played independently before buying on steam for multiplayer reasons) and none of them I feel have been wasted.

												A nice space RTS.If you enjoyed Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity.  You will enjoy this.The graphics are decent from either zoomed out so you are looking at the planets or zoomed into the ships during battle. The Audio is decent is loud, active and lots going on. The controls are simple to handle, it's just the game to understand that's the little bit confusing. You will need to spend lots and lots of hours just to play one game.  I once played a multiplayer match with friends, that we had to save and spanned over 4 days, a total of like 18 hours for ONE match.  Luckily the game saves every few minutes and you can resume when you like too.If you never played a Sins game then you will need a little outside help I think because it is a tiny bit complicated because it has a lot going on, and a lot of things to do, but in the end it is worth it.The game worth the time? Yes The game worth the £29.99? Maybe as I am not sure how much of an RTS person you are, and I am not an RTS person much, but I enjoy this.			"

												This is the greatest 4X RTS game of all time. Combine that with one of the best modding communities out there and you have a game that allows you to control the capital ships of pretty much every major sci fi franchise. You want to have iconic battles with Star Wars ships? Go right ahead. Want to get the feel for why humanity was losing the war in space in Halo? Play as the UNSC. Ever wanted to be the Borg and assimilate all those who would dare appose you? Have fun. Or maybe some Battle Star Galatica is more in you alley? The game itself is amazing but with mods it becomes much more. Honestly I would buy this game for 100$ if the decided to price it that high.			"

												The following describes my experience every time I play this game.The first scenario.I take my sweet time, playing turtly and expanding slowly, mainly because I'm still fresh from Endless Space and rapid expansion is dangerous, in my mind. I fully upgrade every single world until I can make my empire like a house, except I paint each indavidual brick before I lay it, polish it, and make it amazing. A slow process.Then the enemy fleet arrives, bristling with LRM frigates and siege engines, capitol ships all over the damn place, shredding my meager defenses while I scramble to make some kind of response fleet. I lose in minutes when this happens. Hours of work, gone in seconds.The second scenario.I make one capitol ship right off, usually the one with colonization capability, and build a fleet to defend it before I even start growing. From there, I expand. The colonization fleet dives into the universe and takes everything not bolted down, planting my flag in every piece of dirt they can find. While this is happening, I'm researching like a madman. Everything from the civilian tree goes first, mainly mining and expansion assistance. I'm able to colonize any world by about minute fifteen, and do so with abandon.While the colonization fleet is away, I build up the battle fleet. More capitol ships, hundreds of frigates and cruisers, and a Titan being build in the corner of my home gravity well. My scouts find pirates, enemy players/AI, and all number of worlds. I take everything I can get my hands on and build up more gauss cannons than I can count. If anyone pokes around my systems, they don't leave alive.Finally, I run into worlds that I can't take with my small colonization fleet. So I pull them back. The enemy mounts an assault, thinking me weak. I let them come, break their backs on my frontier worlds, cracking their armor on my defenses.Then the battle fleet arrives.I destroy their assault force in moments, my capitol ships shredding anything in their path, Titan mysteriously AWOL, and drive them back four systems or more before they manage to scramble up a defense. When they do, my Titan and its auxilery fleet arrive...behind them. On a world where they have few defenders, she enters the fray, and ignores the first three worlds completely. Her goal is the capitol. In a desperate attempt to keep their forces strong enough to fight me, the enemy pulls everyone back to the capitol system, and mounts their last stand.I leave no survivors.This game is amazing. A little slow, as it usually takes me an hour just to get comfortable with my standing, but oh so very addicting. The above situations happen often, rather than once or twice in a while, and though it does take a long time to build up your fleet, seeing it warp in out of nowhere is a warming experience I've yet to feel elsewhere. Endless space scratched the itch to rule an empire. This scratched my itch to conquer the galaxy.I'm not one for numbers, but this one gets an 11/10. Best played with friends and open alliances, over coms where you can covertly talk to each other. The envoys let you spy on 'allies' easily, and the diplomacy is enough to play the sides until you emerge on top. I've nearly lost friends for the plays I make here, feinting aggression to one faction when really I'd had envoys with them the whole time, and that battle fleet I'd been prepping was for my early game 'ally' that was a little too demanding with my resources.Love at first conquest.

												Space Strategy enthusiasts rejoice: real-time strategy meets 4X rules in a seamlessly zoomable universe that hasn't looked or felt this polished since the original Homeworld game. Marketed as a stand-alone expansion for Sins of a Solar Empire, Rebellion basically sums up every mechanic introduced in every expansion to date - fight off pirates and opposing empires, establish trade routes, colonize or raise every planet in your solar system... and beyond. It has the same addictiveness as Civilization, in that you feel like you're playing a board game in which your faction fights to rule the universe using various tools or domination and manipulation, every match a new iteration in the array of destinies you can forge. On top of that, the space battles are impressive in both scale and effects: tons of freaking laser beams, rockets and machine gun fire keep you at the edge of your seat when a few hundred ships in your fleet meet a few hundred of your opponents' craft and clash in a display of fireworks that is so visceral and pretty it blows your brains out and leaves you slack jawed at the display of awesomeness.BUY it if you:-Enjoy RTS games and civ builders alike.-Want to engage in large-scale space battles with budget hardware (the game's zoom function works like a miracle, letting you join in on epic skirmishes or zoom out to manage your home planet in the blink of an eye).-Always wanted to recreate the Dominion assault on Deep Space Nine or some other notoriously nerdy science fiction scene you're almost embarassed you enjoy so much.DO NOT BUY it if you:-Hate the pacing of RTS games (learning hotkeys, developing effective build orders and being fast in setting your bases is essential to mastering Sins of a Solar Empire, and if you need time to think things through, you might be better off waiting for Civilization: Beyond Earth for your 4X fix).-Expect a campaign or any kind of predesigned narrative - Rebellion has none.

												First Review Ever The Great  Breath Taking  Visuals [i.imgur.com] The term from the first game ""Unrivaled Scale"", they aren't joking, I've had games against the AI with friends last as long as 12 hours. (You can save and come back later) Introduction of Subfactions to each species doubles the faction options from 3 to 6. Includes everything from previous Sins games. As a Former Halo Player, I have high extremely high standards to what a soundtrack should be like. Bought the soundtrack, best decision I've ever made  TEC Loyalists - Watching The Borders  Absolutely beautiful soundtrack. Unique to each faction, and deviations for each subfaction. Surprising amount of depth, you've got your defense to manage, your own fleet for attacking targets, resource generation to worry about, politics and diplomacy are surprisingly in depth if you do some reading about how the game works. UPGRADES FOR EVERYTHING JUST LISTED TO CONSIDER. Yes, you can upgrade your diplomacy, something our current world could bother doing. If the person hosting has the DLC for the game, everyone gets access to it. Forbidden Worlds adds new types of planets, if the host has it, you'll see these planets in game and you can get the research for them, colonize them etc. Also applies to Stellar Phenomena, if the host has it, you'll get stuff like Coronal Mass Ejections screwing with your planets, but then the'll move on else where (maybe to your enemy). Just like Random Crits in TF2: They Give and Take. ALL SHALL FEAR YOUR SUBFACTION SPECIFIC TITAN AND FACTION SUPER WEAPON AND YOUR FLEET OF MIGHTY CAPITAL SHIPS The Good  You can change victory conditions and in game speed of progression, this game takes awhile to play. Multiple types of victory conditions like ""Capital"" means you actually have an objective that isn't going to take 10 hours to complete if you don't set them, else it defaults to ""Last Man Standing"" which means you have to completely clean out your enemies. I recommend playing Capital Victory first time around. If you want to sit down and conquer a galaxy, you can, but it's gonna take awhile (~4 - 6 hours based on opponent) If you want to conquer  Multiple Galaxies  you can, but it's gonna take awhile. (8+ hours based on opponent) If you want to fight over a single star system with just a handful of planets, you can! (2 - 4 hours based on opponent) Surprisingly simple interface that noobies can use easily, and vets can master with a bit of poking around. The Bad  As said before, depending on your scenario, this game can take AWHILE to play. Depends on your view, but I've gotta throw this in The Bad section because spending half your day conquering a Galaxy is both kickass and tedious at the same time. Besides capital ships, most of the Frigates and Cruisers don't seem to have much strategy behind them except ""Build a bunch of everything"". More Experianced players will know how to use these, but it's not immediately clear to noobies the difference between each of the frigates. Cruisers doesn't have this apply as much to them, but it's still worth noting. Frustratingly slow start up to each game. You'll be scraping the bottom of the barrel for resources and unlike other games that don't allow you to manage resources, you simply get continous deposits, you'll find yourself never getting a head. Fighting online you will either run into people that don't have enough time to sit down and enjoy a game, not really the game's fault, but it's worth noting. OR they'll be so damn good you don't even stand a chance. I typically play Free For All with optional alliances, so you can build up with other factions that might be on your door step, and plot against those that'll be gunning for you. Alliances with other factions with their own alliances do not carry over to you, so you can absolutely obliterate your ally's allies. The Ugly  Very difficult for noobie players, or even people that know what their doing but haven't played in awhile, to... hate this word, MICROMANAGE  everything.   You've got so much you're going to have to put your attention on. Planetary defense is probably the biggest issue under the Micromanagement department. The Vasari have a ship that can be told to ""Autoplace"" mines. Something similar for planetary defense. I wish part of a planet's income was also stored as ""defense"" budget so you could place defenses around one planet without drawing out of your own resources. Because you're going to be scraping the bottom of the barrel just playing the game as is. Late game when you have all the money you could possibly imagine, it stops being a resource issue and becomes a management issue. Because you've gotta do it all manually. If it applied individually per planet, and each planet had it's own defense budget that built up over time, pulling out a defense would be a lot more feasible for EVERY planet in your domain. I suppose this is to make it so you don't turtle on every planet, and you need to concentrate your resources to defending the key points, like the planets you own that are next to enemy planets, or defending wormholes, the centre star, etc. It feels like you should be able to defend every planet equally simply because the options are there. But if you're fighting the AI, the AI is WAY better at Microing than any human player, and you WILL find defenses on every planet, and that's why this is so frustrating. On The Fence  You'll control the battles by specifically saying which targets to attack, and with what, when to use abilities so on. But this hinges on whether or not you have something that can counter what the enemy is throwing at you. The only solution to fighting a Titan is either a fleet of capital ships or another Titan. Throwing the lesser ships (Frigates and Cruisers) at the larger ships (Capital Ships and Titans) is basically useless. This is entirely for balance issues. If you could build a bunch of crappy frigates and beat a captial ship, there'd by no point to building capital ships. The biggest thing you'll control in a battle is when to retreat. Not bad, not good, this is stuff that's on the fence. There is depth to the battles, but once again this comes down to that word again... MICROMANAGEMENT. You can just Macro (I.E CTRL + A, and then attack) instead of Micro, but the best results come from Micro... once again, not bad, not good, this stuff is on the fence. Notes It may look like this game has a lot of ""bad"" being shipped with it. It's really because there's SO MUCH to do, there is SO MUCH DEPTH to the game that this is really the best system that could go along with it. Note that I never offered points of improvement except to defence, because there isn't much that can be done to improve the series. The series has evolved from just ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" through multiple expansions like... entrenchment, diplomacy, which has added more (and for the better) to the game. The realty is, you are one person, and you can't run an empire with just one person... and that's the biggest strength and flaw to the game. You are one person that can manage an interstellar empire, the devs have done their absolute best work to make sure you can MANAGE your empire, but there is just SO MUCH to do...And that's why I love this game. Really, you could call ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" Galactic Empire Management Simulator, one that is rather serious, but a Simulator regardless. Because you'll be managing every aspect you can imagine.""Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. Real-Time Strategy, Unrivaled Scale""			"

												This game is frequently on sale for $10.00 every few weeks.It's by far one of the most unique rts/management games I've played. I owned it on disk before I found it on Steam.The game is much more of a management based game than it is an RTS. You move around large fleets of ships from planet to planet. The game allows you to let the ships automatically battle with enemy fleets, which is a good thing because once your fleets reach a specific size you will never be able to micro manage them.From screenshots and gameplay this game looks very deep and hard, but it really isn't. It's fun once you put a little bit of time in it. It has a great single player experience where you play against the AI. There is no campaign or anything, but that doesn't take away from the single player value.Overall, a great little game. But wait for it to go on sale. There's really no reason to spend full price on this game.			"

Stopping to watch lazer beams and long range torpedoes carve the enemy up with awesome explosions, check. Ships galore to counter incoming pirates and others, check. Massive titan ships to pummel everything in sight and buff your fleet, check. Please... Sins feel free to strip mine my free time until it's 5am some more.

												O_o I don't know what day it is. I know not the year...   but if you are reading this, i advise you to stay away. It is too late for me. If you are reading this please, tell my family i've always hated them. But In the name of science stay far away. Back in the time of innocence, in the time where my mental frame was at the apex of stability and lucidity I was enticed by such a radiant bedazzlement of flickering colors and hues. Ooh look at the pretty lights. I was entranced into a euphoric stupor by such tantalizing melodies. Ahh my ears ahh. I was in a complete state of bliss. But it was a trap. It induces you into such a state only to lull you down, down, down into the spiraling abyss of addiction from whence no light will find return. You lose all sense of you, of time and urgency, and suddenly find yourself gazing upon the incomprehensible faculties of you inner functions questioning the greater scheme of our vast cosmic ocean.So, yeah the game is good. It may not have the level of depth and complexity of Civ V but it does have exciting fast paced RTS action (IN SPACE) for all you Armchair general enthusiast. Definitely the game to go to, to live out your starship armada fantasies. Not to mention the modding community is one of the best, perpetually adding life and fidelity to a 2 year+ standalone game. Star Wars, Star Trek, Babylon 5, Stargate, Halo or Mass Effect Reaper mods anyone? "

												In the grim darkness of the 41st millenium, there is only war. Mankind fights an endless - no wait sorry, that's a different game. It's not even an original video game, it was based on a tabletop game. This is a completely different game.Thousands of years in the future, the ways of war have been forgotten (oh my god, this is literally the exact opposite of 40k, how did I get those two mixed up, what'm I like?) and an era of peace and prosperity has been ushered in for mankind.Then the aliens came. Fleeing from a terror they know nothing about, they laid waste to the outer worlds and took humanity completely by surprise.Then, because when things go wrong they go really wrong, a faction of exiled psionics returned after their long exodus calling themselves the Advent, also laying waste to the outer worlds. Man, the outer worlds really suck. If I lived in space, I'd stay the hell away from outer worlds of any kind. They're always full of criminals or the first to be hit by an invasion or whatever, always live near the centre of a space empire. Remember the Star Wars prequels? Actually, don't remember the Star Wars prequels, they were awful. But the Outer Rim sucked in those too. Well everything sucked, but the Outer Rim especially.Anyway, the traders united to form the TEC, or Traders' Emergency Coalition, to fight off the other two armies and none of this is relevant at all. Seriously.Wait, let me check... Nope, definitely irrelevant. I can't find a campaign mode anywhere. Why would they do that? Who does that!? Who writes a backstory and then gives no story!?Well alright then. It's a space RTS. Instead of soldiers, you blow up spaceships. You conquer planets. You play as one of the three factions mentioned above, as either Loyalist or Rebel. In many matches, this is all to get the resources for building a really big spaceship called a Titan, and those are awesome. They've got great abilities. Vasari (aliens) Loyalists get a Titan that can eat spaceships. And Advent Rebels get a Titan that can heal itself as your other ships are blown up. The TEC just get boring grey stuff for boring grey humans.A single match can last anywhere from a few hours to a week. Actually, if it lasts for a few hours, that's because someone has ragequit.The final verdict is, it's a unique and fun RTS about blowing up spaceships, which is pretty much every sci-fi fan's dream. It's not without bugs or cheating AI, but it's definitely worth buying if you want a decent game to play with friends.			"

												Hello and welcome to SoaSE:R.We give you a starting planet and some resources and it's up to you to conquer the universe! (that is, if you wish so - you could, say.. go the diplomatic way of course, but you know what's that? BOOORING!)So, build massive fleets of ships and go obliterate the enemy! Watch hundreds of ships in direct combat destroy each other while you build.. ANOTHER giant fleet that will flank the enemy forces and make them defend on several fronts at once! Ain't that a brilliant plan? All this while you expand your planets' infrastructure to fuel the machines of war. Because what's more awesome than waging a full scale space war? (I know it's unicorns, but I haven't seen THAT mod yet!)Pros:o) Awesome RTS, especially with the mod support!o) It's great to obliterate your enemies with giant fleets of OP ships!o) IT HAS A GIANT MODDING COMMUNITY!Cons:o) Can be a bit hard for starterso) Could use more ships and stuff (but then again, you have mods)Overal:A must buy especially on sale - if you love space RTSs.Plenty of fun to be had and planets to annihilate. c:Recommended mods: STA3 (Star Trek), SOGE (Star Wars), SotF -♥♥♥♥♥(Battlestar Galactica)That said, kudos also to the modders for bringing those awesome mods to life!1) Resistance is futile.2) Rebel scum!3) Fraking toasters!Edit: For full ref: STA3= Star Trek Armada 3, SOGE= Sins of a Galactic Empire, Sotf♥♥♥♥♥ Sins of the Fallen - Fall of KobolThere is also a Stargate mod that I'm anxiously awaiting, but unfortunately it's still in Beta.TL:DRLol buy. It's a great game.			"

												I normally find RTS for 4X space games a big turn off mainly due to the genre not balancing the elements of the game well and high reliances on quick reflexes which makes it more of an arcade experience than 4X.So before providing my review, I wanted to thoroughly spend time with this game to see if it was as good as others have said. Well, lets just say I lost track of time. :)Boy do I really love this game - even over some turn based 4X games! And it's still something I enjoy coming back to!There is a lot of depth and strategy with appropriate pacing to keep the RTS component manageable for even older folk like me. As others have mentioned, even as your empire grows, you are not bogged down with managing your planets and fleets. Ironclad strikes a good balance here.And the ship combat is such a joy to watch! Watching large armadas mixed with starbases and titans going all out is an epic experience every time.If you normally prefer 4X turn based games and are looking for a RTS to try out, I highly recommend this game. It will really give you your money's worth. I recommend you start easy to get the hang of things before hitting the harder difficulties. Also, play each faction. This will help you better understand their strengths and weakness before settling on your favorite. Cheers and have fun! "

												Is there anything that needs to be said here?Well, there is.It's an epic RTS game, set in space. Runs very smooth, lots of replayability, awesome in-depth combat strategies, and awesome soundtrack to go with it. Did I mention that the DLCs add some really cool new features? Best part is that it's easy to login and play against other gamers online, and it's addictive.You can't go wrong with Stardock Entertainment games.			"

												To start im gonig to have to lay in this disclaimer, I easily have over 2000 hours in this game so you cant go by the 120 hours steam thinks I've played. So when I saw that this was on sale this weekend being an old player since the original game I just had to leave my opinions. Which arent relevant because this is simply just the best and most amazing space RTS that has since been released since sliced bread. If your going to get this game and play dont sell yourself short, just get the whole DLC package with it. It is easily worth every penny even if you have to sell your children to afford it. I'm not even going to get into the uh-MAZING  StarWars:Interregnum or StarTrek: Armada 3 mods there are. Well maybe a little. StarWars: Interegnum adds the Rebels and the Empire into the game along side the original 3 factions with INCREDIBLE balance while ST:A3 is a total conversion... (you guessed it) startrek mod. Interegnum easily takes the cake being the best mod available since it supplements the vanilla in ways I've never seen mods for other games ever do, plus there are about a dozen great minimods for it.

												This is how all space strategy games should be. I haven't even tried playing anything beyond skirmishes yet; it's like a wonderful sandbox version of Homeworld, but with bigger fleets and varied enemy factions.Rebellion is everything Trinity has, but with a few (good) extra features, and of course MASSIVE TITANS. Yes it can feel like a ""race to titan"" sometimes, but on huge maps and against decent AI players you need to be hacking away at enemy empires in more than one place, and the titan (with enough levels) enables you to free up more of your fleet for offensive and defensive actions.Pro's: It's a stupidly varied and replayable game that will take many, many hours of your life.Con's: It's a stupidly varied and replayable game that will take many, many hours of your life.

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a 4X real-time strategy from Stardock Entertainment, the few of its kind. This game is a standalone expansion of the previous game Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion gameplay is exactly the same as the previous game but expanded in some ways. Each faction in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion has been splitted into two, a loyalist faction and a rebel faction, each with their own unique background story and traits. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion also introduce new mighty unit called Titan. Titan is unique with each faction. There is also smaller new ship, the corvette unit which is also unique with each faction. This add new elements of strategy and gameplay to the game. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion also offer two new DLC, one of them contains new feature, the random events, which will affect your gameplay much.Graphics of Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion has also been improved. Weapons effect, ships boosters and many other space environment graphics are all enhanced, making the big space battles even more epic than ever. Ships and planets also have better texture now. The game still runs optimized despite all enhanced graphics but still unable to utilize more than 2GB of RAM. When the game run out of memory, most of the time it will crash, but it rarely happen unless you're using 3rd party modification.There are some mods that making Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion even more fun and interesting, like the Star Trek Armada, changing the whole game universe into Star Trek Universe, Federations, Klingons and all.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is great standalone expansion pack. Great addition to Sins of a Solar Empire fans. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												This is one of my favorite games. It keeps the micro management from becoming overwhelming no matter how many worlds you have. Combat:Fleet composition can radically alter engagments. Capital ships are key, it feels like the death or escape of an enemy (or your) captial ship can at times be major turning points. Every ship has value, even the first ship you start with can be useful late gam when used correctly. Each world can be a campaign itself with proacted sieges or lightning strikes that bypass enemy fleets and defenses. Capital ships and titans level up through combat to increase their stats and unlock or upgrade powerful abilities. a handful of fully leveled captial ships can be increadibly powerful, they also are an irreplaceable loss if you are not careful. the control within combat is relateivly straight forward but be warrned in larger engagments ships may be unable to act in timely manners. If you tell a damaged ship to retreat it may have to push other ships out of the way, slowing it down. there are other small things like focusing fire to take on enemy captial ships but nothing unsual or complex.research:four trees that require you to expand to fully move down (each level requires another research station which take critial slots on your worlds) that each move  seperately. It is somewhat boring but there are later powerful and unqiue technologies that can radically alter a game. it is well laid out and easy to understand in a single play through. Diplomacy:This is both simplier and a little more involced than most games of this type I have played when dealing with both AI and human players. The reason being that you cannot overrule the will of your empire. Actions on both sides as well as racial relations can effect how different empires feel about each other. Completeting (and assigning) missions can help but failing missions can have severe concequences. Bribing races with resources can also be used but is limited by the other factors and can serve to push relationships over the edge but will rarely turn foe to friend.Races:Each race has roughly anologous ship types and some of the most basic research is the same but by the mid game the differences become abundently clear. The TEC, Advent, and Vasari have different strengths and weaknesses that are reflected in their ship specializations, unique abilities and most promanietly on the nature of their captials ships and titans. The Rebellion speciifc split of each faction results in truely have six interconnected races and their natures even effect attempts at diplomacy. The Rebal TEC can align with Pirates and Militas but its hard to gain the trust of other factions and also hard to get your people to accept them in turn.Culture:Culture is a mostly passive system that your choices affects. Both race and research as well as building affect when and how it spreads. Culture allows you to get more resources from remote colonies, it can give you abilities such as visiabiliy of enemy worlds, and it can take planets away or keep them safe. A world overwhelmed with hostile culture will rebel and abandon your empire, conversely an abandoned world covered with your culture will not be colonizable by hostile empires even without your control. its another layer that can drastically change the tide or be nothing  depending on how each party uses it.Colonizing:Hard but streamlined. if you can clear it you can take it and there are only a handful of upgrades each world needs with the option of a few specializations. additionally you can explore to find benefits, powerful artifacts, or debuffs for your worlds. The most important part is always space, what with you use the tactical and logistical slots on each world for can determine if you are rich, smart, capable of producing a fleet in minutes, or culturally dominate. Overall its one the best games I have ever played. It has been described as 4X lite and I think its somewhat accurate but not a negative at all. Its a streamlined 4X that tries to keep you from being bogged down with minuta while still having a slower more deliberate pace.  "

												After yesterday’s patch, I just had to write a review. First and foremost, it's an RTS at heart, adding a goodly amount of 4x strategy to the mix. As far as I know, the star system generator can go up to 251 planets, however it can maybe go higher. You begin the game on your home world and you're able to select the planets main focus which is either social (culture) or economical (trade, smuggling). You require culture to keep the planets allegiance towards your empire. Should the allegiance fall to 0%, you will lose the planet and have to deal with an uprising. The tech tree has two pathways to research, ""military/defence"" and ""civilian/diplomacy"". The military pathway includes, new ships, weapons, shields and defensive systems. The civilian pathway includes better trade, diplomacy (sending an envoy) and technology to colonise various types of planets. Each planet/asteroid has a particular amount of tactical and logistic points available. To unlock a particular path within the tech tree, one must build a military or civic research centre. Logistic points, limit your total amount of buildable research centres per planet/asteroid. In total, you can build up to eight structures of each research facility throughout your entire empire. You also require logistic points to build shipyards and other structures as well. Tactical points are used for defensive structures such as fighter hangars, minefields, gun and torpedo batteries etc. Sins of the Solar Empire has a combat mechanic similar to Homeworld. Your arsenal includes a large variety of combat and support vessels, starting from frigates to dreadnoughts (and starbases). The movement and attacks are identical, yet it is not as sophisticated as Homeworld. Your ships can only attack or hold position and they don’t have any aggressive, passive stances etc. Formations are non-existent, they just fly in one default formation and it doesn’t have any effect on combat. Only capital ships can gain experience, the low tier ships (including cruisers) cannot gain experience. I think it’s sad, as I thoroughly enjoy veterancy systems in each game I play. However, experienced capital ships can gain new abilties such as shield restoration or expanding the fighter hangar etc. Since release, the game could only run on maximum 2GB ram and caused severe lagging during later stages of the game. Yesterday’s patch enabled the utilization of 4GB of ram instead of 2. This is great news for everyone, especially modders. The game has a great modding community and there is a plethora of high quality mods out there. From Warhammer to Star Wars and Star Trek, there is also a high-quality Halo mod as well. I’m currently playing Star Trek Armada III and it’s glorious, I honestly prefer it more than the base game. All in all, this a very well designed game and you should give it a try, especially for people that are trying to fill the Homeworld void.Edit: Spelling.			"

												English version:One of the best game I have ever played, I would recommend strongly to buy it!!. It's worth even at full price and I would support again and again this company. They are different from the general ***** of actual games houses, because they made a game for gamers to enjoy both in single and multiplayer without the aim of grabbing money as much as they can like most game companies do.  The 3 dlcs are worth for their costs related their contents. The most important point is they still care about this game, even if it's old, they are keeping it updated and still fixing some bugs-problems in terms of memory use. Check the last update incoming.Sorry if my english is not perfect, I tried my best.Italian version:Consiglio a chi ama questo genere di giochi di comprarlo ad occhi chiusi. Il prezzo è onesto rispetto ai suoi contenuti, anche comprandolo senza sconti. Il gioco offre molte ore di divertimento, sia in singleplayer sia in multiplayer. Questa compagnia è una delle poche rimaste che focalizza le sue politiche sul rendere ottimi i contenuti rispetto a fare più soldi possibili a differenza delle attuali, che rilasciano giochi scadenti in contenuti e solamente pompati in grafica a scopo di realizzare più guadagni possibili. I dlc sono a prezzo onesto, 5 euro ma che aggiungono molti contenuti al gioco (rispetto ai soliti con cui si rilasciano skin o minchiate varie).Cosa molto importante, seppur di vecchia data, il gioco è in continuo aggiornamento, specialmente gli ultimi in cui stanno cercando di risolvere un problema di prestazioni che calano nel late game, a causa che questo gioco fu programmato per sistemi 32 bit.

												The AI of this game has only two difficulties: braindead or impossibly hard.On braindead difficulty they always have incredible amounts of units but rarely make an effort to attack you, it's like playing with an AFK player that hoards fleets and keeps them stationary in defense.On impossibly hard difficulty they hoard just as many units, but they also keep spamming you to a point where you quite literally can't keep up because contrary to the (cheating) AI you're bound to the game rules and economy and there's just so much you can do.Also if you play with AI allies you can be sure as hell they're going to be extremely incompetent and even at their highest settings their units will get rekt every single time.I understand AI has to cheat some way, but this is really not fun.It's either boring and repetitive, or frustratingly hard.

												My hours do not do my playtime of this game justice, I have over 300+ hours on stardocks launcher before the steam release.This game is the BEST space strategy game ever released. Perfect mix of RTS, 4X, and even some RPG elements. Every map isnt just a game, its a story of your empire and how you choose to build it. Some matches will be a fast blitzkreig of domination, others will be a drawn out war filled with diplomacy and betrayal. Some matches i emerge victorious and the sole empire, but most I will have been destroyed and defeated by my enemies, watching my planets and fleets fall to the overwhelming enemy. I cant write a review of this game without gushing its every praise, so this is a love poem to Sins and Stardock. Thank you for making this game.Only 2 negatives in the endless streams of positives-End game slowdown with large fleets is inevitable, I have a GTX 970NVIDIA and I still get slowdown-No definitive campaign or storymode.GET THIS GAME NOW, on sale or fullprice its worth it dont worry.

I'm happy for folks to buy me games and I'll compare and contrast, though ;) ).There's a bit of learning, and I'm not finished there yet, but I do feel I have options in what playstyle I follow. I have played mostly with some friends, and we've tried both vs and co-op (plus, recently a mix). Human oposition is better, of course, but my only real with is I could design some maps with a bit more detail - there's three of us at times, and I'd love to create a 2 vs 1 game (with resources to suit) rather than have a tenative 1 vs 1 vs 1 game, whcih is that we tend to fall back to.But we're all enjoying learning the game and playing it, and look foward to our next games night.

I personally play Sins with a total conversion mod called Star Trek: Armada 3. Anyone who is a Trek fan, I highly recommend that you give it a try.

												One of the best sims/RTS's of all time up there with master of orion 2. Rarely any bugs (for me at least). One problem is the lack of online activity although I do play LAN and single player most of the time. Graphics are medicore although they have to be with some of the larger maps/battles (It starts getting crazy huge). Warning this game has a large learning curve when you start, best to play some offline single player matches on small maps then work your way up (disable pirates too). Titans make gameplay interesting. Although if you allready own Sins Trinity i would hold off untill there is a sale because you do not get that much more, if you never owned sins then go for it :P.

												Too ruggedly professional to die, 2008 sleeper hit Sins of a Solar Empire has returned. Titled Rebellion, this third expansion comes in a new, expandalone format, and adds just about everything except actual rebellion. Silly developers!Sins has aged well, partly because its only competitor, Sword of the Stars II, flopped harder than a snake slipping off a diving board, but also because its appeal is still intact. As you develop your empire, swinging from planet to planet, tumbling down the tech tree, stringing together fleets and levelling up your capital ships, the game simply gives you a bit too much to think about.It’s uncanny. As a beginner, you’ll have your hands (and head) full developing trade routes and continuing the electric push of your culture across the solar system, perhaps with one eye on your prize fleet, making sure it’s still winning some 20-minute pitched battle. But experts will be kept just as busy micromanaging the powers on individual ships, perhaps leaping home to oversee the construction of a Maginot Line-like array of turrets, before snapping up the diplomacy menu to offer a job, a ceasefire, a demand, then back to the fight. Sins’ sweet spot is that it always threatens to overwhelm, but rarely does. This isn’t the riptide real-time strategy of StarCraft II. It’s more sedate than that. But the game simply has so much going on, its every element rewarding not just attention but obsession, that you’re able to sink into it like a hot bath. Want to fling armadas around as if they were plastic toys? You’ll have a great time. Want to orchestrate your fleets like an interplanetary Rommel? You’ll see the rewards instantly.Which brings us to what Rebellion adds. Perhaps most notably, it still doesn’t add a singleplayer campaign, leaving you to fool around either online or in the excellently robust skirmish mode. Which is fine. There’s also a whole new suite of tutorials, which prepare you for everything – except how to deal with this much content.Sins’ three relatively asymmetrical races have been further rent into Rebel and Loyalist variants, each of which holds a new teasing selection of powerful abilities and a unique Titan. We’ll get to those. Loyalist TEC, for example, are a turtle’s dream, with one tech that increases experience gained fighting in their own space and another that lowers the cost of the horrible Novalith Cannon (which lets them slam-dunk nukes into distant gravity wells). Meanwhile, the nomadic Vasari Loyalists gain the power to summon NPC vagabonds and devour planets like so many Mars Bars.There are new corvettes and capital ships for each faction, too, but the Titans are the stars of the show. Monstrously expensive and perfectly suited to a long-form game like Sins, it’s likely the fiercest fighting these behemoths will see will be attacks by wary players on their sprawling dockyard before they’re completed.As with everything else in the game, however, they strike a thoughtful balance. Completing a Titan is by no means a ‘win’ button, but the automated report that another player has finished one still instils a gentle dread.Outside of the lack of a singleplayer campaign, about the only criticism that could be levelled at Rebellion is that it’s not much of a looker anymore. But you know what? When you jump some 50 ships on top of an enemy fleet, announcing your presence in a flutter of missiles and hot burps of laser fire, you just can’t tear your eyes away.			"

												I still consider this game from Stardock to be one of, if not the best of the 4X space genre! I started with the original game and have purchased each of it's successors and, or DLC's. I have never felt let down in any game from this gaming series. I've always enjoyed playing each and everyone of the releases. Many, many games have brought themselves into this 4X space genre and I've tried out many demos from the competition. I've also purchased many other games in this genre, yet to date none have compared to Sins of a Solar Empire, in my humble opinion. The gameplay is smooth and extremely beautiful, even when you zoom in as close as you can. And have literally hundreds to thousands of ships in the grips of warfare (including the AI or enemy player's ships). I highly recommend that you purchase the DLC, especially for this release. Because it brings a lot more options and most importantly; Tons mo' fun to the table.There's also a lot of depth in this game, if you so choose to dig deeper. From planetary upgrades, fleet upgrades, starbases and the awe inspiring Titan Class. There's always something to do and MM is easily tamed if that's your play style, and the game moves fast or slow. You decide -- there are so many options before dropping into battle as to what could possibly happen. Don't like pirates? Fine, simply disable them or better yet choose a faction that harnesses the pirates to do your bidding. Don't like playing with diplomatic measures influencing the game? You can disable or bend these options to your will as well. Truly, the options are endless. This game gives you so much control, whether it be through the options menu and, or the faction you choose to play as. I could go on, but I think you have a firm grip on the gist of what I'm spraying. Not to mention the fact I've babbled on and this review is long enough as is.			"

												So, before getting into this review I have to say I am a big space and empire building nerd, so when those two are put together I'm already partial to it, so fair warning.General Info:-Sins is a space building empire where you pick one of three factions (with two subfactions each) and conquer the galaxy. Each of the six subclasses feels unique, with gimics from turtling and economy to psionic warfare.  Maps can range from single star systems or maps with up to 3 star systems (could be more, I mostly play on the 3 star systems, apologies if i'm incorrect on this one). You can play diplomatically or militarilly, although really you'll almost find yourself exclusively military, as it's nigh impossible to get everyone alligned together, although it's not hard to get one or two AI allies to join you for tagteaming. -Gameplay is real time, not turn based. This adds a unique element to the late game, when most factions have hundreds of ships moving in different parts of the galaxy. This can keep you on your toes, constantly watching everywhere for what the others are doing.-Game is entirely based in space, no land combat (only thing you do on land is upgrade the planet's overall population and other things like bomb shelters for defense).Pros:-Fleet combat: Real time combat with hundreds or even thousands of ships duking it out in real time is amazing, and the graphics and spectacle is amazing (especially considering the game's small download size).-Extensive tech tree and decent pool of ship classes to give you enough to play with different fleet builds.-Capital Ships and Titans are essentially heroes that level as they are in combat. Every class is unique, and each faction has 6 capital ships, and each subfaction has a unique titan that fits their play style.-Amazing Mod Support: ModDB has some pretty amazing conversion mods for this game. I've personally tried Halo, Star Wars, Star Trek, and one of the older Mass Effect conersion mods and they are amazing, especially if you find yourself tiring of the base factions.-Multiplayer support still works at the time of this review (even for most of those mods I just listed).Cons:-Extreme learning curve, even if you are used to these kinds of games you'll find yourself feeling slightly overwhelmed or really overwhelmed depending on experience with these types of games. (Pirates are the main issue, as if you very inexperienced and not paying attention to the pirate bribery meter, you might find yourself losing a planet early on to a large pirate fleet, although you can use the pirates to your advantage as well if you have the money for it).-AI Isnt that bright, and generally doesn't start amassing large fleets until late game, if at all depending on ai difficulty. Mostly the AI like to spam superweapons and harass your planets.Overall I give this game a 8.75/10. If you like space combat or empire building this game is definitely worth checking out, although the standard price is very steep, I definitely recommend waiting for a sale, as 50% and 75% sales happen fairly regularly.

												Sins of a Solar Empire. A relatively obscure 4X game that my brother showed me nearly 8 years ago... evidently, this was for the best as it opened my eyes to the medium of gaming and I would not be myself without it and for that, I owe it everything and have spent probably around 3,000 hours across all versions of the game, on and off steam. At heart, it's pretty simple for a 4X game, much more focused on combat and not empire building compared to others such as Endless Space and Masters of Orion although this is not a bad thing. My personal favorite part of SoaSE:R is the mod scene, it's an amazing game and is well worth the full price umodded, but it truly shines when modded, everything from slight changes to entire overhauls consisting of just about every popular Sci-Fi universe including Halo, Star Wars, Star Trek, Eve, Stargate, even Battlestar Galactica (Sadly, no Warhammer 40,000). This fact, along with the infinite replayability will keep me playing Sins of a Solar Empire for many years to come. (Until the release of Sins 2? Please...)			"

												This is the PC game that forced me to go out into the world and purchase my own PC. Before Sins of a Solar Empire, the only games I played on the computer were over at a friends house, but after week long (game time) sessions of play in a SINGLE match of Sins, I was hooked. This game has the depth and micro-managing features I crave, with a sleek enough system of menus that, after a small learning curve, never slows the pace of battle/building/expanding my space empires. The only thing I'm ever left craving from Sins of a Solar Empire is MORE Sins of a Solar Empire.			"

												An amazing game, but unfortunatley the engine is terrible. The game client is compiled for 32 bit systems (which means it can only utilize 4GB of ram) and runs under a single thread. Even the best of computers will start lagging towards mid game until things become unplayable late game. The game is absolutley not playable on multiplayer either. A single AI enemy is enough to make any multiplayer session turn into a powerpoint presentation. The community has even offered to crowd fund the capital for an updated client a few years ago.			"

												I, personally, enjoy this game, and if you are into space combat games at all, you will enjoy Sins of a Solar Empire. The original game was fantastic, and with Rebellion, comes even more fun! Take command of one of three factions, and choose whether you are a Loyalist or a Rebel. Each faction has their own backstory and reasons for why they are fighting, and the sins they are paying for.The technology trees have been expanded ever so slightly, and the tech from before has been reworked. Perhaps you want to upgrade how effecient your mining is or maybe you want to start broadcasting how amazing your civilization is across space. Choose whether you want to upgrade your ships' weaponry or armor, to field more variations or ships, or build your defenses.Speaking of ships, they have added in two new classifications: the Corvette and the Titan. The Corvette is a fast little attack ship, sporting a few weapons, and a debilitating effect. They take only a research upgrade to start producing. And then comes the Titan. These behemoths take several research upgrades, not-to-mention an arm and a leg worth of resources to start producing. You can only field one at a time, but these monsters are devastating.Each faction has one new capital ship as well, which can be of varying use in certain aspects of the game. The original five capital ships have been revamped, with their abilities being reworked and revamped. Not everything has been changed, but a few tweaks have been made, to make sure they are still viable and fun to use.This is the only part that I still have a problem with: the planetary upgrades. Planets can be upgraded in a handful of different areas, and different types of planets can receive a different number of upgrades, up to a maximum of four. These upgrades can allow a larger planetary population or increasing the number of tactical (defensive structures and the like) or logistical (research platforms, broadcasting stations, shipyards). It could increase the health of the planet (and thus how much damage it can take from enemy bombardment), or explore the planet. This could lead to planetary anomalies that could be beneficial or penalize the planet, or even discover a long-lost artifact, which would have beneficial affects for your empire as a whole. The reason I have a problem with this is because it is too streamlined. Once a planet is upgraded, there is no reason to keep coming back to it, unless it is being attack.That being said, do I recommend the game? Yes. Absolutely. Gameplay is almost never stale, as the game changes every time you start it again. Anyone that enjoys the aspect of large naval space engagements would positively love Sins of a Solar Empire. And with this 75% off deal going on for this weekend, I would jump at the opportunity.			"

												Fantastic series of games - the whole Sins of a Solar Empire series, I mean. Great scale and a very casual pace, that allows you to weigh your options and think through the game. There is a rich and challenging technology tree, and there's variety in the gameplay and situations. Perhaps one fault is the lack of a good single player campaign or story of some kind. The game mechanics could also have taken into consideration things like orbits for planets, to make it a bit nicer. Overall, fresh even after 8+ years, and very fun.			"

First time I got it was DRM free playing local multiplayer with 4 friends in my college dorm. My favorite memory was teaming up with 2 of them on our first very hard lard random map. I quietly built up my culture as Advent reminding tham that they do in fact recieve the culture bonuses from an ally. The last AI was about to die, friends' fleets are dwindled and and their economy in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from fleet upkeep. Tell team that it is time to start the pvp and end the ceasefire. Proceed to max out all my starbases in asteroid belts for max culture. Friends start fighting eachother because I was objectively ""weaker."" I wasnt until they lost most of thier planets from the sheer force of the Advent cultre machine. They grouped up against me but failed to hold even planet even with maxed culture buildings on their homeworlds and domination victory was achieved. 8 hours of long con never felt so good.5/7 would purchase again.

												First of all, what a brilliant game. This is by far the best 4X Space RTS game on the market. Nothing does massive space battles better then this game. Theres nothing better then building a massive fleet and laying waste to your enemies.For first-timers the learning curve is like a mountain but after an hour or two you'll climb that leg cramping, AI dominating mountain and begin kicking some AI butt, strategies will become more apparent and the game becomes so much greater.Only downside occasionally, very occasionally will a ship try to fly between gravity wells without slipspacing, its not going to get there but its going to give it a try. The modding for this game is fantastic, easy to install (check those checksums) and adds hours upon hours of fun to this stellar game. Want to play as the UNSC, theres a mod. Want to play as the Federation, theres a mod. Want to play as the Tau'ri, theres a mod. Want to play as the Empire, there's not just a mod there's a handful of mods. "

												This game is an interesting blend of 4X and RTS, on one hand you have to capture chokepoint planets and deny resources to your opponent all the while making careful decisions about which research to go into next, on the other hand you have to micromanage unit abilities in order to win any sort of competitive combat. The learning curve for this game is indeed high if only because which race variant you play impacts the strategies you can effectively use. Thankfully there are many good articles online to help you understand the concepts and advanced strategies possible in this game.For lovers of RTS, this game is a must. The graphics are beautiful, the AI punishing, and the multiplayer grueling.                                                        Expect competition.

Colonize and destory which is still cool as the weapon effects are excellent and the graphic are great too.Only major disapointment was the bloody voice overs... ""die die"" etc from screachy women who had drunk to much coffee before being asked to speak in the microphone whilst recording for the game. Seriously this is soo annoying in game. Made the game feel very childish at times. Infact she was not alone many voiceovers where extremely over acted. Game would get a 9/10 but because of having to turn down voice over slider which made me miss important events from good voiceovers i rate the game a 6/10			"

												For a space RTS game, this is definitely where it's at. Although it doesn't hone the capabilities of taking control of a single ship, it does give a good space fun their fill of fun. Be careful as you can get caught and quickly start pouring hours into single player missions or playing against your friends online! If you are looking for me to expand on the personal story of Sins of a Solar Empire I cannot do it. Why? I don't have enough background information to tell you exactly what the story is but I can tell you how the game holds up! Even if you're not a hardcore space fan, you could most likely easily put 10 hours into the game. This may be in part in how the game develops to play style.Sins of a Solar Empire is described as an 4X type of game (explore, expand, exploit and exterminate). There is quite a bit to do and manage. To begin, there are three races that the player is able to choose from : the (industrial) TEC, the (psychics) Advent and the (alien zergish looking) Vasari. Each race has it's own unique distinctions and units but all sort of share the same build options regarding ships and buildings alike. The TEC (human race) is not as good technologically as the other races but is good at poking away at opponents slowly (attrition warfare). The Advent race has great energy weapons but lack armor and prefer shields. They also can use their cultural influence on other planets in an attempt to shift opinion. The Vasari beat both the humans and the Advent regarding their technological and ship abilities. However, these high quality ships come at a steep price!The game play itself is actually pretty good. It's easy to keep track of what's going on from planet to planet and they made it extremely easy to upgrade/build. If you are wanting to upgrade an aspect of a planet (say civilian infrastructure, emergency shelters, exploring more of the planet and (not limited to) industry or social focus), it can be done easily. Managing planets was made with ease while managing fleets takes a bit of work. There are lot of commands in games that the keyboard can take care of. It will take a while to figure out what is what but as long as you know what the icons mean, you're gold. Research and diplomacy can be taken care of by clicking the tabs up top. Research is broken into a few categories in which focuses on either military, defense, diplomatic, civilian infrastructure and fleet upgrades. New units, abilities or even additional damage can added to your arsenal. Be wary though! To create capitol ships or titan units (mega ships), you will need ""command"" staff and will have to upgrade not a unit amount, but the command slot amount.I'm a bit confused regarding single player as there doesn't seem to be a campaign mode. Rather, it seems they took the approach of single individual missions against the AI. This might irritate a lot of players but may also entice a lot of players into playing single missions. Multiplayer saved games are a bit tricky (see : link discussion). All players must have their own save file but the save file cannot be sent player to player (as one player may be using your race/units). The diplomacy portion of the game is a little weary as well. It's good but nothing too outstanding. Missions can be given to factions and vice versa (as well as trade options and the sort). Completing these missions reflects on your relations with factions. Pirates can also be hired within the game in case you don't want to attack your opponent directly. It can cost you a pretty penny though!There are a few things you can tweak in-game considering winning conditions. Default mission settings uses domination, which means that you basically have to take over the map. There is a diplomatic victory in which you need to acquire the most diplomatic points to win. Research victory where (obviously) you need to complete the most research or reach a specific tier. There is an occupation victory in which special militia will keep spawning at a certain planet and players must control (occupy) this planet for a certain amount of time. Reaching this time means victory. There are other winning conditions such as capitol planet and capitol ship in which both (or one - your choice) have to stay alive. If your capitol planet becomes occupied, you lose. If your capitol ship gets destroyed, you lose. Within this menu you can also change how many planets are within the map and starting conditions. They give you a decent amount of options to customize your game so you can enjoy how you wish.The game's currency system is quite simple and has some nice additions. Coins are your basic income and will need it to buy majority of things. (NOTICE : if you are losing coins and do not know why, you do not have enough civilian infrastructure on your planets)! Crystals are the next and finally metal. Metal and crystal are harvested from asteroids and can be traded if you build a trade system (increasing your economy). Metal and crystal can be sold or bought. They attempted an interactive market where the prices will drop and rise. The game will give you a small heads-up but it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the prices.The visuals themselves are actually decently good. They is a lot of attention to detail and most phaser/ion cannon shots are noticeable. Ships taking damage is also apparent as well as when ships attack planets (you can see mini explosions on the surface)! In addition, you can see traffic moving about the planet and cities. Sounds are pretty good (explosion sounds could vary a bit) and you can hear ships jump from planet to planet. The dialogue in game is good but as most RTS games, you'll start hearing the same voices in your head.Overall, a pretty good space RTS game. I would recommend it for die-hard space fans and would recommend the casual gamer to buy on sale so there is no love lost. After playing for 10+ hours and playing different game modes (victory conditions), it is beginning to be redundant. Like I said, I can see a lot of gamers immersing themselves into this game. I would love to see some individual control given to the player as well as maybe adding a campaign? All the space RTS stuff is right, maybe it's now time to take it an extra step?RATING : 7.5/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : (to come) What one Titan looks like What another Titan looks like Some levels have a distinct color that'll hit your eyes consistently There is a magic button you should be aware of "

												Ok so lets start.  First off, the time listed played, is one match + the tutorial.  I played only one single player map.  The smallest one.  The time it took me to finish it was over 8 hours.  Again this was the first single player map and listed as tiny.  Now I will admit.  Part of that was cause I was still getting use to the game.  I also kinda limited my self to only upgrading war and defensive upgrades.  Leaving out anything that was trade or peace related.  This makes it hard cause those upgrades I did not use would help capture some planet types, give better material gathering, give more money, and allow peaceful relations with others in the system so that they did not attack you or even might help ya.So ya, 8 hours for one tiny map.  This game is fun for anyone who like strategy and long game play.  Do not get this game thinking it will be a quick run.  There are ways to change the victory setting and not sure how the competitive play fairs.  I would imagine there might be some ways to make it go faster.Also, as far as I can see.  There is no storyline or quest line.  This is not like Starcraft.  You are not doing RTS with a rich story about 3 different races.  Your basically playing a glorified chess game.  A MASSIVE, BEAUTIFUL, not really that close to chess, chess game.  I was listening to a coworker talk about it and the vids I saw made it look good enough to try.  It is, but it is really only good for eating up your time.  Need something to just throw countless hours at were there is no story and just plotting and building your forces in hopes you can take out your enemies.  Then go for it.  Though if you are not absolutely sure then do what I did and get it at 75% or more off.			"

												The best space RTS out there in my opinion. Massive space battles and galaxies allow for long and intense campaigns. Although it is considered a 4x, (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate), you will mostly be doing expanding and exterminating. If your a strategy game or sci-fi nerd, pick this up!			"

												It kind of reminds me of Star Wars: Empire at War, except no ground battles and everything happens in real time. There isn't much of a story to it except what's told in the intro video. So, there's no story mode, it's just like a skirmish mode, choose a map and go. That kind of sucks but the gameplay makes up for it, there's a lot you can do once you start a game. The game tries to make diplomacy a big concept but fails because diplomacy can largely be ignored. At least for me, diplomacy could have been done better.It comes with a ""map editor."" I use quotes because it's not really a map editor. It gives you a screen with various settings that you can modify and it auto-creates a map based on those settings. It's essentially just a fancy random map mode.Not really much else to say... If you want a detailed story mode then this isn't going to be very fun for you. But if you like galactic RTS games then this works great.			"

												Probably my current favorite game of all time, alongside empire at war. Absolutely gorgeous graphics, gameplay is perfect for new video gamers, as well as long time gamers. It has minimalistic control, so you dont need to micro everyone and everything. However, if you so desire, this is an option, and will greatly improve results from battles. All factions are pretty much balanced, however they do depend on your playstyle. All races have a few OP researches they can do at the end. Last but not least, the modding community. It's absolutely stunning. There are mods for almost everything for this game, and more are on the way. Only downside I see is possibly price, however that does not factor into the actual gameplay. I give this a 10/10. Best game ever.			"

												If you noticed the game on a sale and you are either struggling to pay the required amount of money or just looking down the comment section to see if it's worth it... BUY IT. Like a great person and an ultimate memelord once said: ""JUST DO IT!"". This is an RTS video game which main goal is to rule a growing space empire. The game is filled with content, it features real time combat (the unit limit is seriously high, so the battles are not only challenging and exciting but also huge and spectacular) which requires input from the player since you can manage every single ship on the battlefield separately, especially capital ships that will level up after gaining enough XP points and require the player to put some input in the direction of where the upgrade points go. However the game is not only focused on combat unlike the majority of other RTS games with such massive battles. While the battle is going on you can just zoom out and control your empire, send reinforcements or either start an another battle in a different spot. As I mentioned before, not only you have to fight and conquer, but also do research, gather resources, manage the planetary and orbital infrastructure of each planet you own, run a diplomacy between you and other players, give missions to factions or pirates, bribe pirates to strike empires other than yours and do other stuff that a space emperor would do. The point is, there is so much content, such a huge game world (if you feel like a single solar system of 30+ planets isn't enough for you, there is an option to play on a map based on several solar system each one with tens of planets ) with so many planets/sectors to rule and various ways of victory (diplomatic,total annihilation etc.) that it's hard to put everything into a smal steam review. Even though it is an RTS game, the matches can stay up to several hours or days as it is in Civilization V. It makes the game a fun multiplayer production with an option to host a multiplayer lobby and save the game progress so it can get loaded next time you want to play, that's why the game plays the best if you have friends who are willing to play it with you.In a nutshell - it is a fun RTS game with many gameplay possibilities and a great multiplayer module. If you are a fan of RTS games you should definitely get it !			"

												This game offers a lot more tactical depth then what you'd expect from from a real-time version of popular turn-based 4X games. With an enormous tech tree, a flexible - well designed diplomatic system and 6 factions (3x2) that play very differently this game offers more than enough content to keep you occupied for months (given the sky-high replay value and dozen hour-long matches)While reading the negative reviews i came to realize that they mostly cover the following:-the ""expansion"" hasn't got enough new content (with which I highly disagree, besides, it's a standalone title)-Master of orion and Gal Civ are better (to people who say this: real-time strategies are obviously not your thing, no matter how much content they pack)The game is as good as flawless when you look at it at a standalone viewpoint.

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a sequel of sorts for Sins of a Solar Empire. Rebellion adds many things to the game, but its primary additions are the Titans, which are massive Mothershipesque monstrosities which dwarf the capital ships.There are still the three primary factions: Vasari, TEC, Advent. This game, however, splits those factions into Loyalist and Rebel factions that the player can choose. These factions diversify the choices and play styles of the factions. The Vasari are still, in general, very war and destruction focused (you get cool gravely voices and get to strip planets). The TEC are still pretty trade and defense focused. The Advent are still rather culture focused. The factions do add a little difference to the play style. The primary reason to play this game is the feeling of power as you conquer planets and then galaxies. The game is very long with even a one galaxy game taking hours. It is loads of fun in multiplayer, but you might find that you have to dedicate an entire weekend to a good multi-galaxy 3-5 player game. My and my buds in college did this more often than we probably should have! The story for this game is essentially the context of the races. Make up your own story! Are you the TEC turned aggressive? Do you want to be constantly quoting ""Join the Unity"" or ""I am the Unity's Servant"" with your friends? Play the Advent and be annoying! Are you the Vasari who have decided to like trade and culture (if so, you're playing them wrong. Play the advent). DO YOU WANT TO CONSUME ALL THE PLANETS? PLAY VASARI. For example: 


The fully consumed Galaxy. What Galaxy will the Vasari devour next?

												Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion incorporates all the outstanding aspects of the previous games in the series and abolishes most of its past flaws. Although $40 is a steep price, the game is worth its weight in gold if you enjoy 4X and grand strategy games that are dynamic and offer endless hours of entertainment. The DLC adds some flare and more strategic options to the mix. I have played every Sins of a Solar Empire since the first one was released back in 2008 and I assure you this is by far the best installment in the series.  Pros: Enormous space battles – Upwards of 3000+ ships within one gravity well can be quite the site to behold, especially in cinematic modeOnline multiplayer – You must make an account, which doesn't take long and then you can play with your friends vs. AI or against other playersCustom map designer – Allows you to make absolutely massive maps, even to the scale of an entire galaxy and it is an essential tool to help you acquire achievements Grand strategy - Diplomacy, Trade, Pirates, Fleets, Research and much moreMultiple races each with their own unique tech trees, specialties and titansMod friendly – There are mods that allow you completely overhaul the game, such as Star Wars, Star Trek and Mass Effect themed mods and smaller more particular mods that allow you to change a tech tree or add a wider variety of planets + I recommend using Mod DBGame speed management in single-player, which gives you the freedom to play at your desired paceCinematic button to help you sit back and enjoy grand battles Cons: Multiplayer games can be quite sluggish and take very long periods of time to finish so be sure to save between play sessions Limitations of the engine and poor connections from time-to-time can sometimes make it difficult to enjoy online gameplay No campaign or rich backstory - The lore is quite interesting, but they never expanded upon it, which could have made the game ever betterDated graphics – I imagine there is a mod to fix this issue if you don't enjoy the current graphical qualityNot a large player base for online multiplayer so I highly recommend playing with a friend Note: Give this game a solid chance, even if it seems overwhelming at first.

												Sins of a Solar Empire has to be one of the most diversified Real Time Strategy Games that I have played within the last Decade of my Life. I have yet to complete very much research into the back story, and lore of each faction, but there is not much of a campaign to speak of either with the Game, so it's up to you to explore which faction you most identify with. There are Three primary Factions which are playable, while each Faction is divided into the primary Faction, and the Extremist Factions each providing their own unique bonuses and strategies. Did I mention there were Pirates in the game, and  they love to collect Bounty. You will have Tons of opportunities to explore the Game during Solo Play with a couple AI Enemies, I would highly encourage this to learn the Ropes of the Game before full immersion into a Multilayer Game. Have you ever felt like creating your own Galaxy, and then try to Conquer it in its entirety? You can do that with a decent Computer and Sins of a Solar Empire. Did I mention how great all the DLC Expansions compliment the Game, and allow for a much more diversified and unique Galaxy each time you begin a new Game? One time I thought it would be Awesome if I could Control an entire Fleet during a space battle after watching Star Wars for the first time in my life, after purchasing Sins of a Solar Empire, my Dreams became a Reality. Would you like your fellow Clan or Guild Members to hail you as the Galactic Emperor? This could be a Reality for you too with this Game, a little practice, and possibly a couple personal pointers from yours truly.. One aspect that I felt was missing from the Game was the ability to Control each Ship yourself, which I think would be fricken Awesome. Ultimately the Game will be as vast as your Imagination, and Free Time will allow; Many games can be finished within Two to Three hours, I also have some on-going Games which might never end. If I were to describe the Game to you from here on through the rest of this Review, I would make sure to include the Fact that you start out with a Home Planet, and through Military Skill, Intelligent Research, swift Expansion to surrounding Planets, dominating your Local Star, Cultural Assimilation, Diplomatic Relations, and Teamwork, you gradually Conquer the Solar System, Planet by Planet. You will eradicate all Competition, punishing Pirates, or placing Bounty on other Players, hiring said Pirates to do your Dirty Work. Did I mention that you can develop each Planet, and harvest the necessary Resources to Build up and Expand your Armada, and Empire? I heard that the Black Market can always provide a quick Economic Stimulus when you're in a Financial Bind, I've never uttered a more true to Life Statement. Don't forget to do your Research, because there are Multiple Tech Trees to Explore and unlock, which provide great Offensive, or Defensive Bonuses, as well as♥♥♥♥♥♥that helps your Empire expand. Your Fleet may consist of a vast array of unique Ships, each with their own Strengths, depending on your Research Levels, you can quickly Constrict your Opponents to close Proximity Conflicts. One other thing I thought to mention would be the great Modding Community, remember when I was so into Star Wars earlier? There's a Mod for that... Yea when I think of the ultimate Futuristic Space Real Time Strategy Game, Sins of A Solar Empire has become my number One, so go ahead and purchase this game next time you see it on sale, because it is a Great Game, which I feel I have gotten the value of what I had paid for it initially, Ten Fold after my First successful Galactic Conquest. Remember Space is Mankind's final Frontier; Look to the Stars for they are the Future.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire Rebelilion is a fantastic real time 4x strategy game with varied races and varied ships that during combat you can see them rail your opponets fleet with devastating attacks. One of the things I've been most impressed with in this game is it's modding capabilities. With these there are overhaul mods for nearly all great sci/fi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars. These mods even have multiplayer capabilities so you can create scenarios fitting to the universes. All in all I believe even without mods this game is an amazing experience which few games offer and would highly recomend it to anyone with an interest in sci/fi games and in strategy games in general.

												The first time I saw this game, I thought it was some meh-tier spehs RTS. Then I played a little bit (read: 18 hours) and I was hooked. Vanilla is great, and there's a lot of diversity between the 3 factions and their sub-factions. Then you search up mods, and suddenly you're playing the Galactic Empire against the Trader Emergency Coalition.10/10, would fight a Super Star Destroyer with a vaguely-angelic looking spaceship that just can't die.

												Fantastic RTS game. The only flaw is that the factions could have a bit more diversity. While the added dimension of rebel factions is a nice addition over the previous Sins games, a fourth faction is what is needed to make this a classic.Personally, I feel the experimental weapons are overpowered.I hope there is a Rebellion 2 in the making.

												First off, Sins is probably the best game of its kind i have come across, its pretty, deep, challenging and fair. However here is something important, if you are new to the series buy rebellion, not trinity as they are the same game only rebellion has more stuff, if you have trinity, rebellion just adds some ships, techs, factions and starbases and unless you REALLY enjoy the game its not worth the tag for the upgrade. also, on large maps starting off is often boring and samey and the endgame gets tedious if you drastically overpower the enemy, becoming a simple invade, colonize, rinse, repeat. If you like the genre and dont own trinity i definately recommend it. I have wayyy more hours on this on another account and love it. btw ships billow out smoke and fire when damaged (no visible damage tho) and when they explode they leave debris permanantly (which is cool) also capital ships do a whole slow crash and booom when killed which looks amazing in cinimatic mode.

												This is one of the best games of the sapce RTS genre.3 races are available humans in the form of the TEC, upgraded humans called the advent and the alien race known as the vasari, each race is divided between loyalist and rebel faction, so a total of 6 factions are available each factions has its own specific cons and pros.The game is just beautiful, you can see wonderfull planets, asteroids and stars, zoom in/out from seeing just stars to a single fighter flying around, watch how your planets come to life whith ships flying around trading and all, its just amazing.The game functions as many RTS with resource gathering, create buildings, research tech and build units, there is a black market where you can buy/sell extra metal or crystal, there are pirates that attack players who have a bounty on there empire and make a random attack on their space holdings.You get general control of the planets and of its civilian aspect and a much finer control over military aspects. asteroids  and planets colonized have a limited number of upgrade points and building slots all dependent on the type of world it is, this allows you to gear some worlds as defense points, fleet builders or resource gathering depending on their base capacity.your fleet is made of a mixture of capital ships, frigates, cruisers, fighters and one titan (if you can get it on space). Capital ships and the titan have a certain rpg element, they get experience and can unlock powers that can then be leveled up as they destroy stuff or if they are present at the destruction of an enemy. The rest of the ships are just cannon fodder or muscle to augment your big ships power. there is a fleet cap, but you can upgrade the cap so you can field more ships, the con of having bigger fleets is the upkeep cost, which becomes a more severe penalty as you get bigger fleets.There is something that has to be said about gameplay and that is this games is only a skirmish and multiplayer game, there is no storyline campaing, i have not found this to make this game any less enjoyable but if you are into just the lore of things then it is a factor to consider.

												This game is kind of a tough call. While I do really like it, I also started getting annoyed by it very suddenly. If you play against AI, and have multiple AI, they end up ganging up on you, and not fighting eachother. Which may not be a big problem at fist glance, but then the real problem occurs. Super weapons. The AI spams them to no end. And it's incredibly frustrating after a short time. Once the game goes on for a while, you end up bogged down in a boring defend against wave after wave of enemies while rebuilding your rear planets over and over due to super weapon attacks war of attrition. And not one of material/money, but of patience.I'd love to recomend the game because it is fun, but this fatal flaw for anyone who doesn't want to just rush every single game, leads me little choice but to vote no. Had I known of this issue before I bought the game, I wouldn't have bought it at all.The AI issue you can fix somewhat, by locking the teams. But the super weapon issue, there is no fix for, as the mods I've found that allow them to be disabled either don't work at all, or cause the game to crash every 10 minutes or so.If all you want to do is rush constantly, every single game, then by all means get the game. But if you prefer longer, but still winable games against 5+ AI, play something else.			"

Truely and epic game. ALSO, there are excellent Star Wars and Star Trek mods, such as Sins of a Galactic Empire (Star Wars) that have 6-8 different groups to play such as the republic, empire, yuuzon voth, CIS, etc... Anyway, I would highly recommend this game!			"

												It's certainly become one of the most enjoyable Space RTS games out there, and serves as a solid RTS in general. Do be warned that the pacing is quite slow (though there are plenty of options, both during the game and in the set-up, to circumvent that) and multiplayer isn't exactly a crowning feature. The touted 4X elements are certainly more present here than they were in the vanilla game, but you'll need the moderately priced DLC to really achieve the advertised combination. Alternatively, you can use mods, which are fairly easy to install.Also, there is no campaign, and there likely won't be one. The backstory, while interesting, is all you get. So, you'd better enjoy skirmish mode.For those of you who owned the vanilla game (and only vanilla) this is a significant improvement, as it comes bundled with the two other expansions, Entrenchment and Diplomacy. If you owned the Trilogy edition...not so much. The core Rebellion content mainly focuses on faction diversification. There are now six total factions, consisting of two sects of each of the three vanilla factions. They play very differently, especially in the late game when their tech trees begin to diverge. The TEC Loyalists, for example, are centered around an impenetrable defense and long-range bombardment, whereas the Vasari Loyalists become extremely devoted to mobility and attritive tactics (as in, they operate without terrestrial holdings and can cannibalize conquered worlds). New means of attaining victory have been added, from Diplomatic to KotH and more. The graphics are enhanced, and two new ship classes (super-massive, incredibly powerful Titans and ""just-barely-larger-than-a-squadron-unit, Titan-slaying Corvettes) are included as well.But, I'm really starting to ramble and repeat the description, so, yeah, consider purchasing this game if you're a fan of the 4X genre. The scale is literally massive (hundreds of planets, several star systems) and the lasers are pretty.			"

												This game is almost good, but there are a few unpolished aspects of it that make the experience less enjoyable. Mostly just minor shortcomings in rules and coherence, but also some major aspects of gameplay. Some examples:-You cant view maps before playing them in singleplayer-Your own ships wander stupidly into minefields even when you tell them to hold position-There is only skirmish mode in singleplayer, despite the misleading cinematic trailer-Pirates continue to launch raids after youve decimated their entire base-Build times are painfully slow for everything, and there are constant deadlocks where your only option is just to wait and watch your resources tick upwards at an agonizing rate (this can probably be resolved on larger maps with more planets)-Along a similar vein, upgrades are weak (5-10% bonuses, maybe 25% when maxed out) which is fine if you like the RPG style gameplay, but if you like shorter matches (smaller maps), you can only get fractional increases in power before you are at the endgame.-Upgrades have very minor visual effects (if any) and battle amount to just watching ships stand in place repeatedly firing little uneventful beams at each other for minutes on endetc..I would hold off on this one unless you get it in a sale.

												This game kicks♥♥♥♥♥ It's pretty much a combination of Homeworld 2 and any regular 4X space empire game. You could also see it as a space version of Supreme Commander, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ epic. Like, battles with fleets of over 200 ships.While I describe it as Supreme Commander in Space, Sins has a much better UI. Supreme Commander wasn't all that great IMO because the pacing was slow as hell and you had to individually upgrade all the tiny little resource poiints which really got annoying. You also do a lot of teching in Sins but it's all very easy and intuitive, without feeling like a chore.The only thing this game lacks is a singleplayer campaign with a storyline, but the open sandbox levels do an adequate job.

Had no issue until a Launcher for the devolper's games was implimented.This game I've had no problem playing in the past and enjoyed in the past can't even be launched anymore. My computer has been upgraded not downgraded since I last seccessully launched it.Discussions tell me to edit the code and this and that. Tried all of that. Still doesn't work.This is a negative review not on the game itself being bad or anything like that. But the simple fact it can't be launched anymore. And others are experiencing the same issues.If and when the problems with the Launcher are actually corected by the devolpers instead of other customers finding work arounds then I'll change the nature of this review. But as of this time I can't get the game to run. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work in my case and none of the work arounds have worked for me.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is an incredibly in-depth flower shop simulator. The many different flower types and themes will keep you coming back for more and the fact that competing flower shops will send their flowers at you to destroy your flowers makes the game a fast-paced flower shop simulator - something all other simulators to this day have thoroughly failed at accomplishing. If I had to say one thing that was bad about this, it would be the flower production. I liked how the space theme fits very well in this game - you send flowers to others in space and they send some back to you but I find it hard to believe that you'd need so much resourses to make flowers. However, that must have been a design choice that I just don't understand yet.I give this game 2 fertilizers out of 1 sprout.			"

												So the game was on sale, it was set in space, and was listed as a Multiplayer, stratagy game.. 'Worth a look' I thought. I watched the trailer, and was bored half way through.. But, it does boast some impressive stuff sooo 'Lets watch some in-game vids on youtube' I thought to myself. 2 mins in, I had purchased a 4 pack for me and some buddies. I was actually sat on the edge of my sofa waiting for the game to install.. It looked complex from what I could see.. but hey, that makes the game better!Now as much as I want to recommend the tutorials..  it did take me 3 hours to run through all the tutorials, just because they're are as boring as hell to do. They did however prepare me for some basic gameplay so in I jumped ready for some action! Now skipping past my first few games, or the learning phase, as I call it. I put myself against 3 Ai and no word of a lie, it lasted over 9 hours. The game took so many turns it was untrue.. one moment I was winning hands down, then it all collapsed around me as my culture was taken over! I then brought it back again only to have the Ai turn things around again.. It all sounds horrible but infact it was incredible fun! For a game to be so well built that you can turn your hand to something different to bring it all back again is great. Multiplayer is also great fun.. you can team up or go FFA.. Even during FFA you can raise your diplomacy with your friends, and/or your enemies. While your friend and you are teaming together to bring an enemy faction down, you can be employing other races to form against your friend, leaving them defenceless for when you decide to declare war again ;)For fans of older games like 'Birth of the Federation' 'Star wars Supremacy' 'Homeworld' or Civilisation, then be prepared to lose yourself inan absolutely incredible stratagy game! I was only made aware of this game due to a steam sale, but it is well worth the £29.99 price tag.			"

												This is by far one of the best games I have ever played.  In short it's like Age of Empires 2 in space with how fun it is to play this.  The mods for this game are amazing.  So far I have personally played around with Star Trek Armada 3 and Fall of Kobal Battlestar Galaltica mods.  The Battlestar one is way more fun to play with then it has any right to be on the mechanics of how this game runs.  Though I am dissapointed there isn't a proper Freespace mod out there, as this game is the perfect bed for it.  I bought this when it was NOT on sale aling with the 2 DLCs, I do not regret it.			"

												The only issue I have with this game is that if you play the same faction that your build order will almost always be the same.  So, the start of the game tends to be a little tedious.  To get around that though, just play different factions.  Otherwise, I love ramping up the difficulty of the game to make it a nearly impossilbe challenge to win.  I play this game all of the time and I have yet to tire of it.			"

												An unprecedentedly complex strategy game that has sucked an impressive amount of my time into its machinations.As a fervent player of strategy games, I know more than most about the quality and standard of modern strategy games. Thus, it was to my pleasure to find that the gameplay of this game took me completely by surprise. When I purchased this game (due to a passing recommendation by a friend) I was expecting a mediocre 'annihilate-and-win' type of strategy game. What I found instead was a game that truly catered for just about any type of strategy player. One can win via a multiple of ways spanning from cultural domination to research to the common exterminate victory to name just a few. The cultural element of the game was a particularly impressive feature. As a strategist who prefers to punch my enemies into submission, I realized that the threat posed by a culturally superior race only too late in my first few games, where I believed I was winning the game through annihilation. Hence, unlike most strategy games, those who prefer to fortify and dig into their defences can technically still win the game without firing a single shot into the enemy ranks.The resource accumilation and the ship upkeep features tends to keep most players in check, ensuring that no particular player can expand so quickly that he should overwhelm a coalition of players teaming up against him. This is a neat feature, as it forces players to think cunningly, lest too many of his enemies turn against him united in hate or paranoia.Amongst other notable features, I also found the time taken to travel between planets to be a key feature of this game. I had not originally known that travelling between say... 4 planets would take a decent amount of time. This means by the time my main fleet arrives to defend a planet under siege, it has probably already been raised to the ground. Hence, players are forced to pre-empt incoming attacks or opt to divide and conquer.The multiplayer experience is quite enjoyable as this game seems to have a relatively small but extremely friendly following. I was pleasantly surprised to find there are plenty of new players to the multiplayer experience as well as veterans who can teach a newcomer a thing or two.Overall, Sins of a Solar Empire ranks very, very highly amongst my favourite strategy games. While the visuals of the game is not entirely awe-inspiring, it is very obvious the developers paid a significant portion of their time working on the mechanics of the game. I am happy to say that personally for me, their hard work has paid off and left a very satisfied player in their wake.Overall Score: 9/10 - Extremely satisfying to play, would highly recommend.			"

												First of all this is the first RTS game that I have ever played so I had no idea what I was getting into. I saw the trailer and thought, ""Wow this is pretty cool looking I think I'll get it."" What it turned out to be was the best descision of my gaming life. I started up the game and playedthe tutorials to get used to the gameplay. The tutorials were very user friendly in my opinion and the game have easy to grasp concepts while always having something new for me to find about the gameplay. I started a game on a tiny map and played until I won. Only then did I realize that I just played for 4 hours straight. The game really grasps your imaginiation and does not limit what you can do in the game. If you want to go on the offensive go for it, The defensive? Do that also! But your not only limited to this you are able to do diplomatic solutions and trade during the game with other players. Not only all of this but this game has one the best modding communities I have ever seen. There are so many great mods out there for this game that are constantly being made and updated. A few of my favorites are Star Trek Armada 3, Sins of the Prophets, and Sins of a Galactic Empire. All of these great mods have dedicated modders that are able to answer your questions at any point and this game has a loyal fan base. After all of my playing, winning, and losing only then did I realize I did not know anything about the storyline. When I read the wiki on it I was amazed and the amount of lore this game has accumalated over the different games and after reading it I see the game in whole new light. I have about 200 hours logged and I am planning to log another 200.			"

												A great choice for people who are into real-time strategy but want more depth than the usual RTS games. This game combines 4X elements with the RTS genre very fluently and it makes for a great game. There are a lot of mods for it too, which help expand the game even further.That said, don't expect the game to be a real 4X game, but fusing that and RTS together made a very interesting and fun mix which helped it become one of my all-time favourite RTS games.

												Absolutely love this game! It orriginally when I saw Gul Dukat (STA3 Dev) debuting the newest editions to the mod Star Trek Armada 3 and I got this game solely for this reason. That being said the base game is far from meh, infact in it's own right it's great! But I've spent far more time in the mods, in particular the Sins of the Prophets mod and the STA3 mod, along with the Star Wars Assendancy mod. Couldn't find a single particle in my body to give this anything but a glowing review! My only gripe is the small UI but it's still readable with getting a little close to my monitor.Cheers and happy gaming!			"

												If you love strategy, compiling of unique races and factions, and wide variety of territory to conquer, this is the Game for you. You even control the rate at which things get built, resources earned, how fast ships travel, and speed of many other attributes to the game, using settings, if you choose. If you love random replayability where one game you can win, but the next with all the same settings, but game developed differently from beginning, becomes a little more difficult and you lose; this game is for you!If you enjoy production genre of space shows, like; Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica, and other scifi shows/movies about Galactic control, this game is for you. Everything I mentioned, I enjoy! I also enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization Series, Empire Earth, Command and Conquer, Galactic Civilization II, Age of Empires series, Master of Orion series, Star Craft the original, and many more. To give you an idea of this game compared to some of my favorites I listed... SoaSE:R (or SINS for short), has kind of a Star Craft three different races feel, mixed with the massive galactic control and Diplomacy of Master of Orion, and a fast pace strategy set of Empire Earth and Age of Empires, however to experience the unique faction diversity set between each of the three main Races, their is no real comparison... you just have to Experience Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion for your self.I personally love the Vasari Loyalist; Their unique ability to create their own phase lanes and travel between stars as they see fit, with their Kostura Cannon attack of defenses on a target leaving its own Phase Node behind, matched with the Titan's powerful warship and ability to terrorize enemy forces jumping around inside planet's Gravity Wells, as well as around the different planets, are some reasons why I enjoy the Vasari Loyalist! However, nothing can match the Cultural power of the Advent, and their ability to manipulate the culture across the Galaxy with their super weapon Deliverance engine casting a massive culture bomb behind enemy lines. If timed right, having a powerful armada close to a target for culture bomb, and the right research, Advent forces can get a huge combat bonus within your own culture, in side the enemy bases if fighting within the culture bomb influence. They also have many power mind control abilities to take away many ships! Nothing compares to the Massive economic power of the TEC (Trader Emergency Coalition), and their ability to expand fast and cover the cost, and earn much more power through commerce compared to the other two. TEC also can coerce the Pirates factions, and all natives across the Galaxy to side with them, creating an unwavering force of friendly support  across the map, and cause relentless waves of mild assaults by unforeseen pirate raids among different Enemy bases! If played right, any of the three races, and the split factions within, can become a powerful force to be reconned with! Can YOU build an Empire, to Stand the Test of SPACE and TIME?If still interested, feel free to check my steam profile... I have many screenshots, already posted... and more going up all the time!

												I had heard of Sins of a Solar Empire several years ago through a few mod creators I knew, and I finally decided I needed to buy it about a couple months ago. Needless to say based on my play time alone it has quickly rose the ranks of some of my favorite RTS games, and has even eclipsed some in replay value. The competetive play, and straightforward gameplay make this game an absolute must buy.My thoughts on the game are mostly positive, but like all games there's a few downfalls... The largest of which would have to be the fact that it's not compatible with hyper-threading, and even refuses to use more than a couple of gigs of RAM which makes it minidump quite often. There's several fixes to this, and I personally have not experienced a crash on this game for a month after using certain software that most mod makers use for this game to make thier mods less susceptible to crashing.Once again, I HIGHLY recommend this game, and even further recommend playing it with mods due to how much support there is in its community to make them.

												This game came out in 2012 and it's still patched and supported. I bought it because it looked like a great sci-fi type space battle game, but truth be told, I've only played the vanillia version a few times.That's because after almost my first game, I thought ""You know what? It'd be great if they made a Star Wars game like this!"" While they don't, they do make rather a few Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and other assorted space sci-fi fandom mods for it. So basically I played about two games as it was designed and thereafter all my time has been spent fighting the Rebel scum or holding the thin line against the Borg.It's a great game, even if it is a bit expensive. I did get it on sale, which I would reccommend if you can manage, but truth be told I would have happily paid full price for such a great game.			"

												Good game made by a company that is still patching it, even after 5 years!The game lacks a normal campaign and story, but it has great replayable game play, plus some really amazing mods which I highly recommend you check out.Apart from the lack of a single-player/coop campaign, there isnt really much to dislike. Graphics are reasonable, game play can be addictive, music and sound effects are reasonable.It is an old game though so I'd recommend that you get it on sale or if you're a die hard fan of the genre!

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion includes all the previous expansions and the core game, whisked and combined into a standalone which is astounding value for money.RTS4X stands for ""Real Time Strategy; eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate"", simply put: It is a strategy game that has a huge overlay of space-empire micromanagement and birds-eye-view strategy, whilst keeping the real time battles simultaneously active.This game truly is a space opera, as huge battles take place whilst perhaps your strike-fleet is sneaking around the back to hit the enemy where they least expect it. Maybe you are sending your spaceships to different solar-systems or plunging into the depths of a worm-hole, to seek the treasures (or dangers) on the recieving end.The game has similar aspects of the game Galactic Civilisations and Star Trek Armada, mixed and refined into a stunning, heart-pounding, yet relaxing game.If you love space games, empire games and RTS games, this is going to tickle you.

												This is a 4x game. There are 3 races and with the DLC 1 new faction for each race is added, bringing the total 'races' you can play up to 6. For a single player game it takes me around 3.5 hours, and thats with 2 hard bots one easy bot and me. Multiplayer is even more fun, since u can colab and even help move each other around (the vasari rebels share their phase tech). I dont think ive ever uninstalled this game. This is my default time sink game, and its fun every time. If you like Sword of the Stars, you will like this, only difference is the smaller tech pool and you cant modify your ships hardpoints. I just wish that the publisher would release more dlc (like this is a really bad complaint). If you like 4x, the idea of having ships so big that they are the size of planets, and commanding multiple fleets in realtime to own the galaxy, then this is a game for YOU! ^_^eXplore: planets for artifacts, the galaxy for planets and your enemyeXperiment: research your titan your factions ultra-flagship, can macross missles with lasers!eXpand: that oceanic world would be perfect to house the seat of your propganda machine!eXtermanate: TITANS dont change the flow of the battle, titans are a wave that assure victory.tl;dr compare other 4X to this.

												So the game was on sale, it was set in space, and was listed as a Multiplayer, stratagy game.. 'Worth a look' I thought. I watched the trailer, and was bored half way through.. But, it does boast some impressive stuff sooo 'Lets watch some in-game vids on youtube' I thought to myself. 2 mins in, I had purchased a 4 pack for me and some buddies. I was actually sat on the edge of my sofa waiting for the game to install.. It looked complex from what I could see.. but hey, that makes the game better!Now as much as I want to recommend the tutorials..  it did take me 3 hours to run through all the tutorials, just because they're are as boring as hell to do. They did however prepare me for some basic gameplay so in I jumped ready for some action! Now skipping past my first few games, or the learning phase, as I call it. I put myself against 3 Ai and no word of a lie, it lasted over 9 hours. The game took so many turns it was untrue.. one moment I was winning hands down, then it all collapsed around me as my culture was taken over! I then brought it back again only to have the Ai turn things around again.. It all sounds horrible but infact it was incredible fun! For a game to be so well built that you can turn your hand to something different to bring it all back again is great. Multiplayer is also great fun.. you can team up or go FFA.. Even during FFA you can raise your diplomacy with your friends, and/or your enemies. While your friend and you are teaming together to bring an enemy faction down, you can be employing other races to form against your friend, leaving them defenceless for when you decide to declare war again ;)For fans of older games like 'Birth of the Federation' 'Star wars Supremacy' 'Homeworld' or Civilisation, then be prepared to lose yourself inan absolutely incredible stratagy game! I was only made aware of this game due to a steam sale, but it is well worth the £29.99 price tag.			"

												An unprecedentedly complex strategy game that has sucked an impressive amount of my time into its machinations.As a fervent player of strategy games, I know more than most about the quality and standard of modern strategy games. Thus, it was to my pleasure to find that the gameplay of this game took me completely by surprise. When I purchased this game (due to a passing recommendation by a friend) I was expecting a mediocre 'annihilate-and-win' type of strategy game. What I found instead was a game that truly catered for just about any type of strategy player. One can win via a multiple of ways spanning from cultural domination to research to the common exterminate victory to name just a few. The cultural element of the game was a particularly impressive feature. As a strategist who prefers to punch my enemies into submission, I realized that the threat posed by a culturally superior race only too late in my first few games, where I believed I was winning the game through annihilation. Hence, unlike most strategy games, those who prefer to fortify and dig into their defences can technically still win the game without firing a single shot into the enemy ranks.The resource accumilation and the ship upkeep features tends to keep most players in check, ensuring that no particular player can expand so quickly that he should overwhelm a coalition of players teaming up against him. This is a neat feature, as it forces players to think cunningly, lest too many of his enemies turn against him united in hate or paranoia.Amongst other notable features, I also found the time taken to travel between planets to be a key feature of this game. I had not originally known that travelling between say... 4 planets would take a decent amount of time. This means by the time my main fleet arrives to defend a planet under siege, it has probably already been raised to the ground. Hence, players are forced to pre-empt incoming attacks or opt to divide and conquer.The multiplayer experience is quite enjoyable as this game seems to have a relatively small but extremely friendly following. I was pleasantly surprised to find there are plenty of new players to the multiplayer experience as well as veterans who can teach a newcomer a thing or two.Overall, Sins of a Solar Empire ranks very, very highly amongst my favourite strategy games. While the visuals of the game is not entirely awe-inspiring, it is very obvious the developers paid a significant portion of their time working on the mechanics of the game. I am happy to say that personally for me, their hard work has paid off and left a very satisfied player in their wake.Overall Score: 9/10 - Extremely satisfying to play, would highly recommend.			"

												The only issue I have with this game is that if you play the same faction that your build order will almost always be the same.  So, the start of the game tends to be a little tedious.  To get around that though, just play different factions.  Otherwise, I love ramping up the difficulty of the game to make it a nearly impossilbe challenge to win.  I play this game all of the time and I have yet to tire of it.			"

												This has been one of my top RTS games for a long time.  I've been playing since initial release, and each expansion adds something fun and worthwhile.  It's a little slow as an rts game, which is totally ok since there is a lot to do (some people call it 4x as well).  For me this is topped only by Star Ruler 1 and Empire Earth AOC in the strategy genre.I will say that the game is growing old and has a dying player base, but there is still a plethora of fantastic mods that are still being maintained.  Grab a friend or two, or even just fight the AI- it's a great game.			"

												I had prepped the largest fleet in the system for an invasion of the final enemy's homeworld. Including ships that could take on full fleets by themselves. And sent them to the planet. When they arrived, a giant ♥♥♥♥off space station, armed to the bloody teeth, began slaughtering my fleet from the bottom up, first the corvettes, then the frigates, then the cruisers, etc. Then their titan warped in to engage my own, and with that, I had to order my last few ships into retreat. Only my titan managed to, on about 1% hp, limp back to my forward base, the enemy fleet right behind it.Then I got mad and fired my two planet-destroyer nuclear cannons hidden on the other side of the star system as a backup plan, in case the glorious frontal assault didn't work, and genocided the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them, destroying an entire culture in just 2 shots. 8/10 would space againActual review: Large scale, slooooow paced RTS with some nice space battles, easy to use interface (one you learn where everything is), some nice variety in the factions, and an interesting dynamic with the neutral fleets of militia and pirates that will launch their own periodic assaults on your worlds and trade routes. Graphics understandably look a little rough up close, and it requires a significant time investment per game, and the ability to form fleet formations would be nice, but overall, a damn solid space RTS.Think of a mix between Civ/similar and Supreme Commander/similar. That's about what you get here. Well worth picking up the next time you see it on sale.			"

												PEWPEWPEWSpace-based-RTS. you build up your planets, you build up your fleet, and then there are a few big engagements and then you win. There are enough different methods you can use to get there, earlygame strats mostly revolve around either getting a fast fleet out to harass enemies or expanding as fast as possible to secore more income. Midgame is where all the big fleet engagements start, with fleets of around 30 ships on each side. balancing production with research and your spead of culture is  difficult, as lagging behind in any one of these will make the lategame painful. Finally, you have the massive engagements. a few hundred ships, 3 or 4 will die in the initial volleys. you can't lose a fight or else all your planets will be bombarded and you will die.I like this game.

												Well, what can I say? Sins of a Solar Empire is brilliant. 9/10The gameplay mechanics do take experience to master, but that's all part of what makes the game so wonderful; there are so many aspects of gameplay to take into consideration when you are in a match, such as culture, research topics, and etcetera. If you think that all you have to do to prevail in a match of Sins is to build a thousand ships and spam orbital cannons, you are sorely mistaken.One thing that appeals to me personally about Sins is the fact that, right from the beginning, you have to meticulously plan out each detail of your empire's expansion, taking into consideration events that could potentially happen hours later.That planet with only one phase lane leading into enemy territory? Chances are your enemy will eventually try to punch through. You'll need to plan for that. The world on the other side of the map that's just starting to produce culture? It will spread to your planets quickly. You'll need to plan for that.That TEC Loyalist player on the other side of the map whose planet pings up for a second with a superweapon alert? You'll especially need to plan for that.The one and only downside for me about Sins is, and I'm sure this is a common one, there's no campaign! The franchise has gone into a good deal of detail creating a backstory, seriously, there's a whole bunch of story content out there. What I would really like to see is an actual in-game campaign in which you can follow one of the three main empires on their quests within this storyline. Another little want of mine is to have a campaign constructor. That would be amazing. If these things were there, a 10/10 game.It's pretty much impossible to get bored of Sins, each game turns out differently from the last. But if, however, you somehow manage to get bored, there's but one thing for that: mods. This game has a Star Trek mod, and subsequently has my seal of approval.This game is amazing. I myself have had endless hours of fun with Sins, and reccommend this entirely to everybody. Get this game right now.			"

I have never been a fan of RTS.  I prefer turn-based games because I normally hate having to watch everything at once.  Sins of a Solar Empire may be changing my mind.  I haven't had this positive of an experience with an RTS game since Warcraft III.  I highly recomend this game without reservation.Peace,-Troy			"

												This game came out in 2012 and it's still patched and supported. I bought it because it looked like a great sci-fi type space battle game, but truth be told, I've only played the vanillia version a few times.That's because after almost my first game, I thought ""You know what? It'd be great if they made a Star Wars game like this!"" While they don't, they do make rather a few Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate and other assorted space sci-fi fandom mods for it. So basically I played about two games as it was designed and thereafter all my time has been spent fighting the Rebel scum or holding the thin line against the Borg.It's a great game, even if it is a bit expensive. I did get it on sale, which I would reccommend if you can manage, but truth be told I would have happily paid full price for such a great game.			"

Graphics are reasonable, game play can be addictive, music and sound effects are reasonable.It is an old game though so I'd recommend that you get it on sale or if you're a die hard fan of the genre!

												Before I say anything, I want you people to know that the supposed 2 hours I have in this game are on ONLINE mode. I use mods and play offline a lot, so there should be like 324 hours logged up, but steam doesn't log offline gameplay. Anyway, let me get on with it.This game is absolutely stunning. The graphics are amazing, the AI is very well balanced and smart, and the overall gameplay is absolutely mindblowing. There are hundreds and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay sitting right there waiting for you to buy it. At first, you start off at one planet, your capital planet, and you working on your economy and researching as much as you can. You send off small fleets to neighboring planets to gain control of them and wipe out the garrisons. This cycle continues for around 20 minutes, where you slowly expand your control and research tons of new ships and technology. Eventually, you are able to amass HUGE fleets and hunt down the hostile faction. This is just a small example of how incredibly fun the gameplay is. I have NEVER gotten bored.So what're you waiting for? Buy it.20/10			"

												A bit of a mix between a 4X and an RTS game. You can even speed it up.Basically you're going to colonize new planets, research new ships, weapons, policies, bonuses, whatever. Just like you would in Endless Space for example. But everything is in real time and combat is more interesting, like in Homeworld.Unlike in Homeworld though, there is far less micro management of your fleets. There are not fighter and bomber squads to worry about, only different sizes of capital ships, the smalles being frigates and cruisers I think, up to the very deadly Titan class warship, of wich you can only have 1.SoaSE has 3 races (with 3 rebel factions each). Each has different ships, policies and research trees. The DLC is ok, but only on discount.There's also pirates, bounty hunters and other shenanigans. In my first game I was destroyed slowly but surely by my enemy's ""anti planet"" weapons, which could basically shoot across the whole system.It's a fun game and has great mod support, while not looking or running terribly, but the lack of a dedicated campaign mode makes it a bit dull in my opinion. If you like Multiplayer or Skirmish modes, however, and you love Space RTS games with DEEP mechanics, this might just be for you.			"

												If you've played Trinity, Rebellion is not too much different than Diplomacy, but the extras are more than enough reason for a seasoned Sins player to pick this game up when it goes on sale.If you haven't played Sins before, you're missing out on one of the most engrossing, complex RTS games out there. Word of warning, if you want to finish an entire game in one sitting, be prepared for several hours, and the learning curve for multiplayer is steep, but if you put in a few hours to really learn the game, you'll love it as much as I do. For a casual player, you can play smaller games and save your progress and pick up a half-finished game whenever you please.			"

												This game... Oh, this game. Where to start?I will start with this:If you like RTS games, then this is the one for you. I have had this game, and the prior one, for years as I had purchased them from Stardock. It is a futuristic, space themed strategy game that expands many solar systems and you can colonise everythings, except for the stars, as long as you have the proper research.The longer you play, the easier it gets, but at the same time, it also gets harder and the dificulty setting increases (as usual). But the jump in dificulty is amazing as you try to play on the highest setting.There are people online that will ever tear you up at every chance the get, so get your economy going and making your fleet of ships something to be feared.

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a fantastic example of what can be done with a 4X RTS. It excels in so many ways it’s difficult to narrow them all down, but in short, its main pull is that it provides the depth and time not seen in many of the other RTS games out there. That being said, the games in Sins tend to take anywhere from 40 minutes, to 4 hours, so anyone who wants a shorter, more fast paced experience should look elsewhere. On a very important side note, the multitude of mods out there can REALLY improve the experience. Three I'd personally recommend are: Sins of a Galactic Empire (A Star Wars based mod), Enhanced 4X, and Sins of the Prophets (Halo based). "

												I dabbled a little in the game and all of it against tougher ai opponents, while most of it is a really great game, one or two little things kind of ruins the mood of what i am doing. for example i like to prolong the fighting over a long duration and make the ai come to me while i grind their forces down to the point i can launch attacks on their systems when the chance presents itself. i never leave myself exposed to an attack.when i finally whittle out a colony belonging to one of the ai enemies and take it over, suddenly every superweapon from every other ai targets that new acquisition and rends it uninhabitable, it not only slows down progress to a crawl, but how can ai's from all the way across the galaxy that has no beef with me or even knows i setup a colony there suddenly have this idea to launch their super weapons at it? i mean all of them?so while there are some questionable AI actions that ruins the mood a bit, there are also the super weapons themselves;The novalith warhead attacks a single target causing minimal disruption, now a colony with a planetary shield can take a few novalith hits, which severely limits it's ability to be a superweapon. frankly it's underpowered and absurdly so.the deliverance signal on the other end is significantly overpowered in comparison and it does far more damage to several colonies with it's overwhelming signal strength and duration. now unless you got a cultural rate over something like 200 over these multiple planets to make it very difficult for the signal to persist for long, otherwise repeated hits is far more devastating than a fleet of ships could evr provide, not only that, but if you kept launching signals against their former worlds after them losing control and you kill off their colonizer ships and colonizer cap ships as well. you won't even need to face the rest of their forces. it should get a bit of a nerf to it.the last one of the list is a warhead that explodes at a planet, causing all projects to be suspended in planetary orbit until it wears off. if the colony is not under any threat at all, it makes this weapon useless to have and not only that but it don't effect starbases. it's only use is in advance of your main attack force but still is just as uneffective as the novalith.as it is, there needs to be a balance check there. anyway, these are the one or two little problems i have with the game, the rest of it is very enjoyable to get into and play.

												I'll admit, I was one of those people who played the original for about 30 minutes and became confused at how technical and fiddly it all seemed, so gave up. However when SoaSE : R was put on a hefty sale, I decided to do some research and after watching some YT videos of mods and other awesome moments, and with copious positive reviews both on and offline, I decided to pick it up. I'll say right now, that it's still a very fiddly game, but I've sunk about 2 evenings worth of time playing it and even more time thinking about it. It's easily one of the most proficient games when it comes to Fleet management and empire building in a Sci-Fi genre. Solid mechanics, excellent economy system and fantastic battle simulations (could still be better with more animated battles, but the particle effects and light shows are still great to watch). If you need a good comparison of a game, think Supreme Commander fused with Civilization. Definitely worth a buy. =D			"

												This is a very fun game. I can't believe I didn't recommend it sooner. The replayability of this game is superior to virtually all space-based rts games. There's no real campaign to speak of, but the beauty lies in the co-op and versus maps which you can generate according to your own preferences. I prefer large universes that takes days to dominate, while others prefer universes you can conquer in an hour. The graphis are superb and and the balance is expertly done. I highly recommend this game to any fan of space-based real time strategy games. If you get it, give me a shout so we can play! I'd give it an 8 out of 10 (-2 points for the lack of a single player campaign).			"

												The game itself is fantastic. I run it at the highest graphics settings because I can, so maybe I'm jaded in that respect. However, upon entering the game, I was asked to make a stardock account. Im not a fan of games that dont directly link to my steam account, but this one seemed (and is) worth it. I did the tutorials, which I see no problem with. As with any in-depth strategy game, the tutorials are only there so you aren't saying ""what does this button do?"" later. Once youre done with those, do yourself a favor and set up a small map with an easy AI. Thats the real tutorial. I have played Civ 5 almost religously (I bring it up because it seems to be the most common comparison) and yes, its tutorial teaches you more in a shorter time frame. HOWEVER Civ 5 was also dumbed down quite a bit from its predecessor, if you know your civ. While I admit to not having played enough to get a feel for the power balance among the 6 different factions you can play as, they seem to creatively offer different playstyles, most related to war. An in-game simplistic map creator and adjustable settings of almost anything in the game (victory speeds, quick starts, team locks, ect.) score big points. Mods are endless, Star Wars comes to mind almost immediately. The ONLY MAJOR CON I HAVE ENCOUNTERED is the multiplayer system. Accross PC and console gaming I have never seen a lobby/host/chat system as confusing as SINS. There is a seperate tab for a hosting test, which has a single check box for alloy. I have no idea what alloy is, and still dont after reading multiple stardock FAQs. It says it is used to identify the IP address of your computer to allow hosting. I honestly have no idea what that means, and I personally feel as though it scares away players with little to no knowledge in that area. If it doesnt, the technical guides will. I tried reading the help sections, and posted were comments rich in IT language and computer terms I wasn't familiar with, and most certainly wasn't comfortable with changing on my computer, especially when one of the few words I understand in those comments is ""firewall"". From the number of commenters and views, a great many other people are having the same problems. I would like to be able to host a multiplayer game, just as easily as I can in any other game, such as Civ 5. I do NOT want to have to become an IT guy to play a 1v1 with a friend. I reccomend the game, and should multiplayer become clearer to me I will edit or respond to this review. However, potential buyers YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Multiplayer is confusing and complicated and appears to me as though it cannot do what other games can. I would like to see improvements from the DEV team in the future, if only in its coherency. Love the look. But when setting up a game with other people is harder than learning a real-time, in-depth stategy game, it kills most of the fun. 7/10 from me. For now			"

												Improvement over the last installment. But besides the addition of some new units and planets, not really any significant change. The Titans are pretty strong, and they don't lose experiance if destroyed; which is a relief. Much more fun in multiplayer though, as it is ard for the AI to surprise you.

												It's...an expansion for Sins. Core gameplay is the same, changes include corvettes, which are smaller than frigates but just as fast (and just as ♥♥♥♥ING annoying) as strike craft), and titans, which are apparently ♥♥♥♥huge ships but in all honesty I haven't built one personally yet because they are really really expensive. The 3 races from the original Sins have been ""split"" into 6, I say ""split"" because between the loyalist and rebel factions of each of the original races share much of the same units and research upgrades, however there are some small differences. Speaking of research upgrades, the trees got cleaned up a bit too. All in all, if you like Sins pick up Rebellion, it's the same but with more.			"

												A complex game of resource management, strategy, and out-thinking your opponent. Although I have little multiplayer experience, I've experienced enough to realize it's extremely competitive, with a small but dedicated playerbase.  The vast majority of this game's players seem to play skirmish battles alone or with a few friends.The game has extreme longevity/replayability due to it's highly moddable nature. I know of at least 3 star wars mods, a halo mod, a mass effect mod, 2 star trek mods, and a host of others that make less drastic changes. The AI is a decently challenging opponent, although it has it's weaknesses as all AI does. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is fairly well optimized, with some slowdown late-game due to it's 32-bit nature.Overall I'd highly recommend, as this is both a fine game for competitive multiplayer, or more casual games played against the AI.

Posted: June 20, 2014
												I whole heartedly recommend this and am slightly ashamed I haven't gotten around to reviewing it yet. This was one of the earliest games I played (probably second actually) and I had the game of the year edition on disk (so don't let the time counter fool you, I've actually spent a lot more time on sins outside of steam). Honestly from a space RTS I really couldn't ask for much more. It's a slightly old game so the graphics aren't ""next gen"" however the interface is very convenient and allows for quick switching between zoomed out tactical views to help manage your fleet battles, and a more up close cinematic view to really engage the player into what's going on. The civilization management aspect is also very indepth and has many different factors which need to be accounted for when making certain decisions. Coupling that with a very indepth research tree (many aspects of which are race specific) and the other deep differences in the entire play style of the three races, there's a lot of varience for enjoyable replayability.Honestly thought... I'd say the best part is just the scale the battles can get too, and mine haven't even been that grand compared to other's I've seen. It's quite enjoyable to watch a fleet of 100 frigates, and 50 or so cruisers charge into a pirate base, only for their pirate adversaries to just be engulphed and devoured in your swarms of hundreds of fighters and bombers at the ready. Also... the main difference the rebellion version has over the rest is that it adds two subfactions to eatch race, loyalists and rebels, and each of these subfactions has their own individual titan, which is just awesome. The titans add a new aspect to the combat as they can be the definite deciding factor in many of your future battles, and when you watch one plow through the enemy frigates like a steam roller... well let's just say it's satisfying.So honestly all in all I think it's worth it and you can get a lot of hours out of it. Of course it's still smart to wait for sales, so if it's on sale for cheap I'd say snatch it up. However that's just me and my experiences, I hope this helped, bye!			"

												Surprisingly easy to pick up and fun to play, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is addicting and cool. Constructing an army is greatly satisfying and the space-combat is amazing to watch. However, difficulty spikes quite often and the first few times I tried playing the game solo, I felt cheated as hordes of pirates and multiple armies swarmed over my capital planet. Definitely brush up on your knowledge and look up online tutorials before you try this on your own. But the multiplayer, especially when playing with friends, makes things easier, more fun, and it honestly is what sold me on this game.I highly recommend it if you are or even if you're not a fan of the RTS genre. I actually hated RTS before my friend convinced me to play this.			"

It's not turn based, but 'real time'.  I recomend this to anyone who enjoys plotting out star system conquest.			"

												This game is great, the pure scale of some of the mpas is amazing and the fact that you can have units anywhere at anytime is mind boggling even for now. 10/10. The tactics for each shp changes depending on the supporting fleet, its just as good as supreme cmmander except the scale has been blown up with a nuke.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, what can I say about this game that probably hasn't already been said by others? This game is absolutly amazing. From it's smooth transition into games to its multiple races, each as unique and interesting as they are from one another. The modding community has crafted multiple mods for it, each allowing for additional hours of gameplay and fun with friends should you know others who enjoy this game as well. The only downside is the lack of a proper campaign but that seems to be the case now adays with most games sadly but that can be overlooked with the right friends playing with you. I would give this game a pickup if you'd like a long term Empire builder with exiting space combat.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, is possibly one of the best ""expansions"" to a game I have ever played. Why do I say ""expansion"" you might ask, well, the basic point is, SOASE:Rebellion is a full game ""expansion"". Not an add on pack, you don't need to own the original game, you just need to put $15 on the table and pick up a wonderfully crafted, beautifully balanced product.The basic premise of SOASE is to build a giant army of death bringing spaceships, and ram them as close as you can to other giant armies of death. Repeat steps 1-2 four hundred times and eventually you might get somewhere.PRO TIP: Have a bigger, more expensive, giant death army than the other players. More likely to win that way.It may sound repetitive, and it is, but you won't notice as giant lazer beams of death come out of your giant space ship and kills 4 spaceships at once. This game is brilliant on high powered PC's and even runs on Mac (PC is reccomended though because it looks great at 1080p on ultra)This game is a definite buy for you, and all of your friends. "

												A complex game of resource management, strategy, and out-thinking your opponent. Although I have little multiplayer experience, I've experienced enough to realize it's extremely competitive, with a small but dedicated playerbase.  The vast majority of this game's players seem to play skirmish battles alone or with a few friends.The game has extreme longevity/replayability due to it's highly moddable nature. I know of at least 3 star wars mods, a halo mod, a mass effect mod, 2 star trek mods, and a host of others that make less drastic changes. The AI is a decently challenging opponent, although it has it's weaknesses as all AI does. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is fairly well optimized, with some slowdown late-game due to it's 32-bit nature.Overall I'd highly recommend, as this is both a fine game for competitive multiplayer, or more casual games played against the AI.

												An ambitious RTS that tried to do a lot of things and actually pulled it off rather well.  Essentially it takes some 4X game elements, simplifies them a bit, and puts them into a sci-fi RTS environment.+Lots of exploration, technologies to research, and planets to be built up while you amass a fleet and defences+AI puts up a decent fight on hardest non-cheating setting+Decent variety of units and defences to keep games interesting, with each race broken into 2 sub-factions for more variety+Starbases and titans are really neat+Save function in multiplayer so you and a friend(s) can takes as long as you like to finish a large map.+Smaller maps for those who want a quicker, more aggressive game+TCP/IP and LAN multiplayer options; possibly one of the last games to have such options.-Competitive multiplayer, which was never really alive even at the game's peak, is dead at this point-Even with saves, not really an RTS that's suitable for short sessions beyond small 1v1 matches.-Pretty barebones diplomacy system-Pirates were a cool idea, but the 'ebay bidding system' for them is horribly done and you'll probably end up turning them off.-There is no campaign or story mode whatsoever.  Who are the Visari, who are they running from, and why do Advent hate the TEC?  Damned if anyone knows.Overall, if you want a good single player FFA or co-op vs AI multiplayer RTS with a bit more depth to it than your usual RTS fare this is a great game.  The lack of story for what seems to be an interesting sci-fi setting is sorely lacking for a game like this though.			"

												A very cool, complex, challenging RTS game that takes place in space...the final frontier.  There are three factions to choose from: Vasari, TEC, Advent.  And each has two sides, rebels and loyalists.  Take over and colonize planets, upgrade your planets, your fleets, and many other things with research.  Manipulate the black market and the pirate faction, make or break alliances, Conquer the solar system!  You can go the traditional route and just win by wiping your enemies off the map with a massive fleet, or take other approaches as well.  Playing with a group of friends against AI is quite fun as well.			"

												Absolutely love this game. Played a lot of RTS and TBS games recently and this is my favourite. I particularly love the large battles and the ability to zoom right in on any ship and watch the battle unfold. There is an extensive research tree and levelling up for capital ships. The economy is very simplistic and perhaps my only gripe, only 2 resources, metal and crystal. However it does have a pretty good black market you can exploit.			"

The 3 races from the original Sins have been ""split"" into 6, I say ""split"" because between the loyalist and rebel factions of each of the original races share much of the same units and research upgrades, however there are some small differences. Speaking of research upgrades, the trees got cleaned up a bit too. All in all, if you like Sins pick up Rebellion, it's the same but with more.			"

												Serious Review time? Ok FineSins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a unique space RTS games that centers around moving from planet to planet conquering and establishing your empire. The closest thing you can compare this game to is like playing CiV 5 in space, but its in real time.Other than the homeworld franchise and a little nastalgic empire at war, this is one of the only space RTS games in existence that not only does not suck more than a tai hooker, but it actually pretty well done. Featuring massive and i mean massive battles between fleets of ships by the end game your ships will probably ram into eachother from a siezure because of all the laser beams flying everywhere.As previously stated you start on 1 planet that revolves around 1 star, you then migrate to neighboring planets exterminating anything you come across around the planet, then you invade and conquer the ♥♥♥♥ out of it like a space age christopher columbus. Maps however can be extremely large, featuring multiple stars, each with their own set of planets revolving around them to conquer and add to the might of your empire.Oh did i mention when you attack a planet already controlled by another main faction of the game you literally nuke it from orbit (because its the only way to be sure) until everyone dies and you can recolonize it, if that isnt enough for you then i dont know what is.The reason i also say this game is a real time space version of civ 5 is because the game moves at a slow enough pace that you are playing an RTS, but at the same time you can manage your empire and economy etc with ease. The game also has one of the most well done camera systems ive seen in an RTS game, allowing you can look and go anywhere despite the map being gigantic, all with the simplicity of a scroll wheel.But seriously, one of the best space rts games in existence, So if you are into either i would absolutely recommend buying it. Ever since i bought the original game its given me YEARS of entertainment.			"

												One of the best RTS 4X strategy games out there.This game is about pure survival, you will try to use whatever tool necessary to make sure your empire sees another day.It offers the four mighty Xs, Exploring the darkest corners of the solar systems or entire sectors. Expanding your empire by colonizing all kinds of different planets, asteroids and stations. Gathering basic resources which you need for your empire's growth and most importantly eliminating rival opponents in both single or multiplayer matches.One of the greatest features of this game is actually the option to zoom in onto even the smallest objects in the space. Therefore you can enjoy some really beautiful sights of awesome ship and building models and space battles.You can take control over large amount of ships which you can even asign into custom fleets to ease issuing commands.The game's soundtracks are one of the best I've listened to while playing any kind of strategy games, simply marvelous.Both single player and multiplayer gameplay is really smooth and solid. All the base game races are surprisingly well balanced. Every race has its pros and cons, but they share a kind of a basic setup from where the different specializations start off. What really surprised me about this game is that you can actually host a multiplayer match on a public IP with an access to your router's port-forwarding rather than crating LAN or Official lobbies.There are few things that actually dissapoint me about this game.One of them is the lack of any sort of story based missions or a campaign, which is really a shame, because the littly backstory of this game is really interesting and is surely worth pointing out.The other, but not the last thing is about the not very efficient AI difficulty levels.Using increased income bonuses and faster research as a buff for higher difficulty AI is in my opinion wrong move and it is nearly impossible to defeat highest difficulty AI in a regular match just on your own, without anyone else to balance the enormous pressure on, because the enemy's economy overcomes you in just few minutes into the game.Other great thing worth pointing out is the support for mods. There are plenty of awesome mods out there, which can really spice up the gameplay of the base game or add an entire new experience with something new, using conversions.As of the DLCs, If you find yourself enjoying this game at first, and you kinda get into it I certainly recommend adding both of them into your game as each of them adds some minor things and tweaks that can really improve the overall gameplay experience of every match you play.I've played this game for more than a thousand hours in total off-steam and I enjoy every battle I manage to win or lose decisively or just by a pure luck. SoaSER is love, SoaSER is life.Without anything more to say, I would rate this game by 9/10 for how awesome it is.			"

												The game itself is fantastic. I run it at the highest graphics settings because I can, so maybe I'm jaded in that respect. However, upon entering the game, I was asked to make a stardock account. Im not a fan of games that dont directly link to my steam account, but this one seemed (and is) worth it. I did the tutorials, which I see no problem with. As with any in-depth strategy game, the tutorials are only there so you aren't saying ""what does this button do?"" later. Once youre done with those, do yourself a favor and set up a small map with an easy AI. Thats the real tutorial. I have played Civ 5 almost religously (I bring it up because it seems to be the most common comparison) and yes, its tutorial teaches you more in a shorter time frame. HOWEVER Civ 5 was also dumbed down quite a bit from its predecessor, if you know your civ. While I admit to not having played enough to get a feel for the power balance among the 6 different factions you can play as, they seem to creatively offer different playstyles, most related to war. An in-game simplistic map creator and adjustable settings of almost anything in the game (victory speeds, quick starts, team locks, ect.) score big points. Mods are endless, Star Wars comes to mind almost immediately. The ONLY MAJOR CON I HAVE ENCOUNTERED is the multiplayer system. Accross PC and console gaming I have never seen a lobby/host/chat system as confusing as SINS. There is a seperate tab for a hosting test, which has a single check box for alloy. I have no idea what alloy is, and still dont after reading multiple stardock FAQs. It says it is used to identify the IP address of your computer to allow hosting. I honestly have no idea what that means, and I personally feel as though it scares away players with little to no knowledge in that area. If it doesnt, the technical guides will. I tried reading the help sections, and posted were comments rich in IT language and computer terms I wasn't familiar with, and most certainly wasn't comfortable with changing on my computer, especially when one of the few words I understand in those comments is ""firewall"". From the number of commenters and views, a great many other people are having the same problems. I would like to be able to host a multiplayer game, just as easily as I can in any other game, such as Civ 5. I do NOT want to have to become an IT guy to play a 1v1 with a friend. I reccomend the game, and should multiplayer become clearer to me I will edit or respond to this review. However, potential buyers YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Multiplayer is confusing and complicated and appears to me as though it cannot do what other games can. I would like to see improvements from the DEV team in the future, if only in its coherency. Love the look. But when setting up a game with other people is harder than learning a real-time, in-depth stategy game, it kills most of the fun. 7/10 from me. For now			"

												THIS GAME IS OFTEN PLAYED AT VILLAGE GEEK LAN PARTIES. A crunchy RTS space-sim, there is a lot more about this game then first meets the eye. Much like other RTS (like Starcraft or Age of Empires), it doesn't take long to learn how to play, but if takes considerable practice to really master the necessary pacing to go toe-to-toe against the veterans of this game. The graphics and sound are beautiful, as you would expect from a game like this. If you're a fan of RTS, and enjoy commanding fleets of starships, this one's for you.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire®: Rebellion is one of my favourite RTS games of all time, most matches can last hours upon hours on end which allows you to run your forge your empire exactly how you want it with every decision made by you! The mods available for this game are amazing and work perfectly alongside the game. 10/10			"

												Builds on the great game that was SoaSE, adding new features and planet types. I'll admit it's slightly overwhelming and faster paced compared to the first game, but if you played the first one you'll get the hang of this one. Be sure to check out some of the community guides on this game if you're feeling confused or overwhelmed by what to do. Fantastic RTS game you can sink hours into (a lot of my time isn't tracking for some unknown reason, but at the time of this review I'd guess I have about 100 hours on Rebellion, not to mention probably 250 hours on the original game I have a disk/non-steam copy of).

												Small to medium sized games can easily take over 5 hours. But at no point do you feel bored. Indepth space combat where good positioning can mean all the difference. Economy system isn't too hard to understand yet when handled properly can make you feel like even if you were to lose your entire fleet 3 times, over you would still be fine. Cultural system in place meaning you can't just send a fleet to a place bomb it out of existance and take it over, you have to convince the existing population that you can colonise the planet. And lastly a diplomacy system that means you have to work to become another empires ally. You can't just agree with a 2nd guy to bash on the third.All and all. Amazing strategy game that I would reccomend to anyone willing to spend quite a bit of time on one game.			"

And then you can force your friends to buy the game and get the mod you have and play with them.

												An ambitious RTS that tried to do a lot of things and actually pulled it off rather well.  Essentially it takes some 4X game elements, simplifies them a bit, and puts them into a sci-fi RTS environment.+Lots of exploration, technologies to research, and planets to be built up while you amass a fleet and defences+AI puts up a decent fight on hardest non-cheating setting+Decent variety of units and defences to keep games interesting, with each race broken into 2 sub-factions for more variety+Starbases and titans are really neat+Save function in multiplayer so you and a friend(s) can takes as long as you like to finish a large map.+Smaller maps for those who want a quicker, more aggressive game+TCP/IP and LAN multiplayer options; possibly one of the last games to have such options.-Competitive multiplayer, which was never really alive even at the game's peak, is dead at this point-Even with saves, not really an RTS that's suitable for short sessions beyond small 1v1 matches.-Pretty barebones diplomacy system-Pirates were a cool idea, but the 'ebay bidding system' for them is horribly done and you'll probably end up turning them off.-There is no campaign or story mode whatsoever.  Who are the Visari, who are they running from, and why do Advent hate the TEC?  Damned if anyone knows.Overall, if you want a good single player FFA or co-op vs AI multiplayer RTS with a bit more depth to it than your usual RTS fare this is a great game.  The lack of story for what seems to be an interesting sci-fi setting is sorely lacking for a game like this though.			"

												As a fan of the Sci-Fi genre I love everything that involves massive starship battles, and Sins of a Solar Empire have always delivered on that front, Rebellion brings diffrant factions to the table, it splits the three main factions into six factions, one loyal and one radical faction. The gameplay is much like in the old games, a real time strategy where the goal is to fight it out among the diffrant maps and planets. the maps are usally split up into a number of solar systems, on some maps they are connected by wormholes or you can reach each of the solar systems by traveling by your local Star. each solar system consist of a number off planets that you can colonise, some reqiure a bit of research to anable them to be colonised, while astroid belts can't be colonised at all. Each planet ( depending on the kind of planet, and the ammount of research made) will allow you to produce a number of buildings, such as two kinds of tech labs, one to research defensive and offensive tech for your empire, while the other lab focuses on the economic and diplomatic side of your empire, this will allow for diffrant strategies and a bit on empire planning. then you have the standard Ship factories, one will produce small to medium ships while the other one will construct your capital ships, the core of any armada. These Ships will need research to unlock while the capital ships will require you to research fleet logistics, a sort of supply system were every level of research will unlock more ship supplies and more captains for your capital ships. After these two we have the largest ship your faction can construct, these are faction and race specified, meaning that every faction have their own ""Titan"" as they are called, while the capitalships and lesser ships are race based. These titans require lots of research and will take quite some time to construct, that said, these ships will more then often decide the outcome of any battle. There is also the possiblity to construct ""Trade ports"", ""media huts"" and ""refineries"" to generate credits or influense the planets around your solar system and generate extra amounts of crystal and metal. Of course the game also allow you to bunker up your planets with large amounts of diffrant defences, all from large Starports, Mines, turrets, Warp disrupters and a special race super weapon.Now moving on to resurses, there are three resurses that are used in the game, Credits that are generated from your planets and ammount of people you have living on the actuall planets, then you have crystals and metal, these two will require you to construct asteroid mines where ever you might find them, some planets might only contain crystal while others only contain Metal so deciding what planet to colonise is again quite important. The game also futures a bit of rouge covert bits, were you can send pirates ( that said, this is a game optiuon that can be turned off before the start of the game) to harrass the planets of your enemy, these will grow in strenght over time and can be quite hard to take out early in the game because of the ammount of defences around their base. There is also a black market where you can trade crystal and metal for credits and vice verse, this works with supply and demand and some times the market for metal can crash because of the ammount of people trying to sell their large amount of metal for a bit of credits. The factions in the game are just as in the old games TEC, Advent and the Vasari Empire. These are then spilt up into two diffrant factions within the Race, each of them have their special Titan and each also have special powers that the other faction and race can't research. For example the Vasari loyalists can research a special upgrade so that their warp gates ( that allow them to move around to other warp gates constructed around the solar system) can summon the Vasari dark fleet that will assist the defence of their planet. The game is to me a balanced strategy game that in my opinion futures a large amount of content, that said, this game is made for multiplayer as the campaign is non existing. That said this game is at its best when you can gather a group of friends and just battle it out across a large space battlefield. I give it a 10/10 for a very polished and fun strategy game and one of the best space real time strategy games on the market.			"

												You can't ask for much more in a space based RTS. The races feel disticntly different, the less common roads to victory are that much more rewarding. It is a sandbox in which you can send your fleets forward to conquer the far reaches of known space, or establish an economy that spans the stars. While this series could benefit from a combt model less about throwing blobs of ships at your enemies and more about tactical precision, there is still lots of fun to be had. I'd recommend this to any fan of RTS or space games. Easily one of my all time best.			"

												i sat down to play, when i looked up 7 hours had passed. im not even joking. everything around me stopped, nothing mattered except the planet i wanted to conquer next. this game is a drug, nothing will ever compare to your first match. the feeling of utter confusion as you just barely manage to defend yourself against the onslaught of enemy ships, and the feeling of sweet victory when you crush your foes last planet and claim victory. all this may sound overly dramatic, but its the truth. if you love Real Time Strategy, and 4X games. this is for you.in conclusion WTF ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! BUY IT!			"

												Can't believe I never wrote a review for this till now. Split into played original/new sections.If you played the original Sins of a Solar Empire, this feels like another addon. Buffed graphics, addition of Corvettes (rapid raiders who will tear up frigates and long range frigates) and Titans (yes, basically what that suggests - will take on several capital ships no problem). Couple of new techs based off your Loyal/Rebel alignment, making for somewhat different play styles, especially involving diplomacy. Ever wanted 2 TEC starbases in the same gravity well without mods? Play TEC Loyalists. Wanna stripmine planets into dead asteroids like a proper Vasari? Loyalists. Care to set fire to entire worlds with righteous Advent hate? Loyalists again. Good for immersion. Would not recommend DLCs unless you're feeling rich. 5 bucks is a bit much to pay for a couple of new planet types and the ability to specialize a planet in commerce or industry. Same applies to the Stellar Phenomena DLC. It adds to the immersion and would recommend if they were like $1 each, but 5's a bit much for so little content. Definetly not on the scale of Entrechment/Diplomacy.New to the series? It's a RTS. Not a micro management game though, in fact the game promotes macro managing - the lower the shields on a ship, the higher the damage mitigation. No mass firepower orders here! Well, capital ships excepted, I prefer to blow those up before letting the AI handle the rest. Typical 4x Space RTS - start with a homeworld, colonize more, build ships, blow up enemies, make friends - and backstab them if you feel like it. Each side is balanced properly with no glaring advantage beyond numbers. That's not to say you can just spam nothing but heavy cruisers; proper fleet composition is key in this game series. Planetary infrastructure is basically just upgrading its capabilities - no GalCiv construction here.Would I recommend it? Sure, it was a good waste of just under 100 hours while I grabbed all the achivements. Be warned that it's basically nothing but skirmish gameplay - no campaign.			"

												It's...an expansion for Sins. Core gameplay is the same, changes include corvettes, which are smaller than frigates but just as fast (and just as ♥♥♥♥ING annoying) as strike craft), and titans, which are apparently ♥♥♥♥huge ships but in all honesty I haven't built one personally yet because they are really really expensive. The 3 races from the original Sins have been ""split"" into 6, I say ""split"" because between the loyalist and rebel factions of each of the original races share much of the same units and research upgrades, however there are some small differences. Speaking of research upgrades, the trees got cleaned up a bit too. All in all, if you like Sins pick up Rebellion, it's the same but with more.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion, is possibly one of the best ""expansions"" to a game I have ever played. Why do I say ""expansion"" you might ask, well, the basic point is, SOASE:Rebellion is a full game ""expansion"". Not an add on pack, you don't need to own the original game, you just need to put $15 on the table and pick up a wonderfully crafted, beautifully balanced product.The basic premise of SOASE is to build a giant army of death bringing spaceships, and ram them as close as you can to other giant armies of death. Repeat steps 1-2 four hundred times and eventually you might get somewhere.PRO TIP: Have a bigger, more expensive, giant death army than the other players. More likely to win that way.It may sound repetitive, and it is, but you won't notice as giant lazer beams of death come out of your giant space ship and kills 4 spaceships at once. This game is brilliant on high powered PC's and even runs on Mac (PC is reccomended though because it looks great at 1080p on ultra)This game is a definite buy for you, and all of your friends. "

												If there was an RTS worth buying in all the world, you are looking at it. You want balance? You've got it. You want a dozen buddies to play with? You got it. Wanna betray your friends? Do it and watch them go nuts. The game has many options for fast and slow players. There are also different gamemodes and ways to win. Graphics are great too.Now that's part 1. You want more? Mod. The. Game. Moddb has it all from Star Wars to Halo. Full conversions, adding additional playable factions, heck mod it yourself. You'll thank me.Or don't mod it. Vanilla is just as fun. The factions are balanced and diverse. But if you do mod it, I personally reccomend Sins of a Galactic Empire mod (Star Wars). I don't want to spoil it for you, so go watch some trailers and read more reviews. Heck go watch some gameplay videos.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a fantastic game. One, it's a space game, which earns it several points before even considering other features. Unlike many other games, however, Sins allows you to win in several different ways. You could go with the simple path of exterminating your enemy (Hey, I don't judge), you could sweep them from the star with culture, set the pirates on them, or even become their friend (And maybe, depending on how horrible of a person you are, back stab them-again, I don't judge). Games can last anywhere from half an hour to around ten hours depending on the skill level of the payers and map size of the game. If you don't like a victory option on you can always eliminate it somehow--by locking the teams, turning pirates off, for example.A word of warning, however, I strongly recommend that new players start with TEC. While they don't have any particular advantage over the other species, their ships are most intuitively named. The flak frigate, for example is for eliminating fighters. The Sentinel, however, doesn't give its purpose in the name, making it more difficult for new players to find out what they're doing. On top of that, with advent you have to focus too much on more complex (Not much so, but noticeably) things such as culture. Vasari, in my own opinion, are the hardest to play because they require more tactics. Their fleets tend to be smaller, even if their reaction time with phase stabilizers is increased.Once you play a few games, don't hesitate to play as the other races. They're all fun in their own way.			"

												One of the best RTS 4X strategy games out there.This game is about pure survival, you will try to use whatever tool necessary to make sure your empire sees another day.It offers the four mighty Xs, Exploring the darkest corners of the solar systems or entire sectors. Expanding your empire by colonizing all kinds of different planets, asteroids and stations. Gathering basic resources which you need for your empire's growth and most importantly eliminating rival opponents in both single or multiplayer matches.One of the greatest features of this game is actually the option to zoom in onto even the smallest objects in the space. Therefore you can enjoy some really beautiful sights of awesome ship and building models and space battles.You can take control over large amount of ships which you can even asign into custom fleets to ease issuing commands.The game's soundtracks are one of the best I've listened to while playing any kind of strategy games, simply marvelous.Both single player and multiplayer gameplay is really smooth and solid. All the base game races are surprisingly well balanced. Every race has its pros and cons, but they share a kind of a basic setup from where the different specializations start off. What really surprised me about this game is that you can actually host a multiplayer match on a public IP with an access to your router's port-forwarding rather than crating LAN or Official lobbies.There are few things that actually dissapoint me about this game.One of them is the lack of any sort of story based missions or a campaign, which is really a shame, because the littly backstory of this game is really interesting and is surely worth pointing out.The other, but not the last thing is about the not very efficient AI difficulty levels.Using increased income bonuses and faster research as a buff for higher difficulty AI is in my opinion wrong move and it is nearly impossible to defeat highest difficulty AI in a regular match just on your own, without anyone else to balance the enormous pressure on, because the enemy's economy overcomes you in just few minutes into the game.Other great thing worth pointing out is the support for mods. There are plenty of awesome mods out there, which can really spice up the gameplay of the base game or add an entire new experience with something new, using conversions.As of the DLCs, If you find yourself enjoying this game at first, and you kinda get into it I certainly recommend adding both of them into your game as each of them adds some minor things and tweaks that can really improve the overall gameplay experience of every match you play.I've played this game for more than a thousand hours in total off-steam and I enjoy every battle I manage to win or lose decisively or just by a pure luck. SoaSER is love, SoaSER is life.Without anything more to say, I would rate this game by 9/10 for how awesome it is.			"

												Surprisingly easy to pick up and fun to play, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is addicting and cool. Constructing an army is greatly satisfying and the space-combat is amazing to watch. However, difficulty spikes quite often and the first few times I tried playing the game solo, I felt cheated as hordes of pirates and multiple armies swarmed over my capital planet. Definitely brush up on your knowledge and look up online tutorials before you try this on your own. But the multiplayer, especially when playing with friends, makes things easier, more fun, and it honestly is what sold me on this game.I highly recommend it if you are or even if you're not a fan of the RTS genre. I actually hated RTS before my friend convinced me to play this.			"

												This game is great.Especially When Modded.Allow me to tel the tale of the velorum fleet of the galactic republic. (sins of a galactic empire mod :D deffinetley try it)About 15 venator class capital ships and a few Procutar Class battleships were on there way to a known CIS system. Opon Arrival they were greeted by single ship, though, this was no ordinary ship. Scans were completed and they came up with the name inscribed on the side of the ship, Malevolence. When the shp started to turn onto its broadside the crews of the velorum fleet knew it was going to be an easy fight, Until they saw a massive ring on the side of the ship, it was an ion cannon. The cannon fired and the whole fleet were sitting ducks, the ring of energy had disabled there shields and weapons. The malavolence fired opon the fleet with success. No-one ever heard back from the fleet again.			"

												One of most fun, well-balanced and gorgeous looking space strategy games out there. You have absolute control over your empire and your fleet. You can zoom out to view an overlay of the entire solar system, focus on a particular planet or zone, or just zoom right in and watch the epic battles unfold before your eyes. The vast distances between some of your strategic points can really stretch your fleets thin. You need have a keen eye for strategy to win against tougher opponents. The expansions to the game build on the story, battles, diplomacy and strategy even more. I can't recommend it enough for people who love strategy games, space games or just really beautiful games overall.			"

												Great RTS space game! Variety is better than I expected as each race plays very differently from the others. My favorite thing about this game is the fact that it takes longer than other RTS's to win. Games can take 2-8 hours depending on settings. If you are on a very big map with multiple players or AI then games can even take 20+ hours to finish. PvP multiplayer games however can be as short as 20 minutes or as long as 6 hours. AI games typically take longer to complete depending on your play styleThe AI comes in several difficulties. The higher difficulties give a great challenge that no other RTS AI I have played can match.The game comes with a map builder so you can make any type and size map that you want to suit your needs8/10 Highly recommend! Great AI, great gameplay, great balance, amazing graphics, and challenging multiplayer. For new players It may take a while to learn the controls and what everything does; the tutorials aren't as detailed as they could be so this knocks my score down a notch			"

												Great mix of 4x and RTS. Really love the super smooth zoom in/out function. Large battles feel epic. Good portion of economy gameplay. I mostly play with AI and a friend. AI is good and quite cooperative. You can ask them to attack or defend a planet.There are 3 faction with 2 sub faction inside them, loyalist and rebel. They each play differently, have unique research tree, and ohh I wish there were more factions! Playing this game is really an eye opener for me. Culture system, Pirate, Diplomacy, Jump/Warp Technology, Trade Routes, Capital Ship and Titan that levels up and have QWER skills like MOBA, oh not forgetting Superweapon too!Sad thing is, no matter how good your machine is, game is going to lag eventually when things get crowded. Some says it's due to 32 bit architecture, etc. I'm so looking to play the sequel(I hope they won't make me wait too long)One match with 4-6 players can last 6 hours or more. Thing is, I usually spent those hours with excitement and intensity. Always have something to do, check, optimize, micro, rarely dull moment.Audio:3/5 Some clipping, some low quality sounds, unique but mediocre music.Gameplay:4/5Overwhelming at first, due to depth. No LAN, high latency online match.Graphic:4/5Cool ships, planets, weapon particles.GUI:3/5Not so artistic, but very effective and intuitive.			"

Now this game is not too difficult to get into and with a simple guide getting to know the races, buildings, and ships won't take too long.  Where this game really shines though is how experienced you can get at managing your fleet, attacking other players, and if you want to know how in depth this game is look up the damage tables for all the ships.  While this game came out in 2012 it still is a great space RTS in a current game market that doesn't release many RTS games anymore, so if you like a simple but very detailed space RTS this is a great choice.

												This is the best 4X space game. Can play a ton of games, solo or multiplayer, even without a campaign and it will be different and enjoyable every time. (my hours don't reflect a fraction of the time played I had box of original shipped no DRM and playing on digital copy on release of original Sins probably 300+hrs easy not counting mods) The graphics are really good for a game with this scale I did not expect this level. But if your rig can handle it it looks good even with a massive map and ships everywhere.  But also huge modding community that is amazing. Once you get tired of it make it Star Trek, Star Wars or Battlestar and enjoy or lose all those hundreds of hours again.  Cannot believe they let this title sit idle for so long.  Glad they are releasing new content now and haven't forgotten about the game. Trying to boost publicity possibly? Brings hope for new big expansion or new game!

It looked like the game had a story to tell, but it never tells it. So you're stuck playing skirmishes against the AI or playing skirmishes against real people. So it gets repetitive after a while, but the idea of getting out there and exploring a new galaxy brings you back after a break. I really wish Stardock had taken the time to make a single-player campaign. They did it for GalCiv, why not for this?Pros:- The creation of the Mega Cruisers is nice- The factions create more Mega CruisersCons:- Still no campaign- The factions really do nothing besides create more Mega Cruisers			"

												This is hands down my favorite RTS.  It features beautiful space battles, excellent music, and scant but intriguing lore.Play as the mighty but desperate Vasari, the vengeance-obsessed Advent, or the commercial and industrial powerhouse of the TEC.  Each faction has distinct strengths and weaknesses.Much of the appeal of the game lies in its emphasis of macromanagement (research choice and fleet deployments) over micromanagements (managing individual units).  Instead of babysitting worker units, your attention is focused on hunting down enemy fleets, capturing new territory, or destroying the recently-constructed enemy superweapon before it rains doom on your planets.This game also has an excellent modding community with many great mods that add tons of new content and keep you busy.The game's main weakness is its utter lack of any sort of campaign; you can only play skirmish mode.  Fortunately, every match feels different because of the varied maps, random events, and differing outcomes.  Also, the enemy AI has an annoying tendency to sometimes give up when defeat is assured, bowing out of the game early instead of putting up a valiant last stand, which can make for an unsatisfying conclusion to hours of conflict.All in all, this is an excellent space RTS well worth its asking price.

												Well I come for the review badge, but truth is that this game is indeed a masterpiece. This game is marvelous! It has accomplished a whole 3-D play mode at such a early period (2008) which allows you to smoothly focus in and out without any loading screen. Moreover, its game concepts are also outstanding and integrated, like the culture/revolution, alliance/diplomatic concepts as well as dominance. Also, its add-in unit, the titans, also differs from its original designs, which makes the game more unpredictable.			"

												Honestly, one of the better 4x strategy games I've played in years. I've been a fan of this game from the very beginning, bought trinity, and then the newest version when it was released on steam. Each of the 3 factions, now technically 6 with the loyalist and rebel variant of each, play very differently from each other. Luckily, while they're each so unique, the game is still balanced about as well as it could be while pushing players to consider different strategies and playstyles for each faction/map and how to best counter your opponents strengths. Graphics are reasonably good, and the interface is very intuiative when being able to easily zoom out and move in to different gravity wells on the fly. It may be silly, but I love how after a large battle you'll see a ton of debris just littered and floating in space. Commanding and controlling units is pretty simplistic, and much of the micromanaging in activating unit abilities can be automated if you like. Compared to stellaris, another space 4x game, the combat is significantly more interactive. You can combine units into fleets, select targets for individual units, tell units to engage if enemies get within a certain distance or are present in a gravity well (can be useful if you want to keep your fleets behind defensive minefields and turrets), and activate abilities as needed.  With the addition of starbases, and titans (Massive ships that can decimate enemy fleets, sometimes solo when you're leveled up), there are plenty of reasons to take on the challenge that SoaSE presents. I would highly recommend this game, even at full price. New players, start with the TEC. They tend to have the best early game perks, cheaper ships, and the best perks for boosting your economy and income. Try and advent and vasari afterwards. Also, note that in this game, the decision to expand your fleet capacity is IRREVERSIBLE in each game. This adds to the total number of ships you can employ, but permenantly increases your upkeep costs (even if you have zero ships deployed, the % taken off your income still persists). So early on, put off expanding your capacity UNLESS you're playing in a very small map where you're immediately encountering other hostile players.			"

												This game is just madness.If you are looking for a space-strategie game then you've just found it.Even after years I come back to play this game with or against my friends.It's not your ""Load in and finish in 20 minute-RTS"", it's an epic battle that usually lasts a few hours (depending on mapsize and AI-level when you play against AI).The AI is pretty insane if you want her to.The graphics may be a bit outdated in contrast to current games, but thats okay. The game has so many options on how to play your very own game, three diffrent races with two slightly diffring playmethods (rebel and loyalist) give even more options.DLCs are not necessary but give some variety.If you think about buying it - do it!

												Sins has been my first look into a 4X game, it's definitely not going to be my last.The game is a standalone expansion to the original ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" which previous to Rebellion came in a Trinity pack. The game is highly addictive and takes a lot of time to get into the swing of things but you won't notice, you will be too busy exploring Feros, while defending Gateway and sending an envoy to Lexmada at the same time! The game plays much like a space orientated RTS with a top-down camera as default, you can change the visuals in a fullly flexible camera and the zoom can be looking at a shole solar system or a single planet.The game itself features 3x factions, split into 2x subfactions each. There are a variety of ships & buildings available, several research trees per faction and hours of gameplay just there alone. You can chose to conquer your system with diplomacy as you explore and develop your planets or simply wage war on everyone, choice is yours. The gameplay is quite slow but can be adjusted in realtime.Some of the achievements are time consuming but keep some replayability in the game, the online multiplayer requires an Ironclad Online account but you can organsie a match in the chat room and the players there will usually stick throughout the whole session. There are ~400 active players at any given time.Some drawbacks are the games engine, it isn't optimised well for modern hardware so no matter what you're playing on, if you're waging war in a system with 100+ planets, after some time the game will beging to stutter - if you have low / modest hardware you will see this much sooner. It doesn't have an overall negative impact on the game but should be taken into account. Personally, I wouldn't let it spoil the overall experience that is Sins, this is a game that holds hours of play and while it looks very complicated the tutorials will hold your hand through the basics and from there the game takes no time to get involved with.A secondary gripe is the lack of a single player story, the intro video looks like it is geared for one but it is not present in this game. I'd still recommend it any day.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is essentially Jesus in RTS game form.You get to choose from six factions, all with differing research trees and a wide variety of ships and a different titan for each.It utilizes a grand scale real time system, you can make huge A$$ fleets and do whatever you want, split them up and send them to different areas, move as a giant mass, go crazy, it allows for a lot of strategic, tactical flexibility.The map system is also pretty incredible, multiple planets and locations of interest all around a sun which can differ each time, and not only that but you can make the map just as huge as well, more than one solar system.It's fun with friends, fun alone, and fun in multiplayer, I'm being serious when I say I can't find any downsides to this game.

Instead of babysitting worker units, your attention is focused on hunting down enemy fleets, capturing new territory, or destroying the recently-constructed enemy superweapon before it rains doom on your planets.This game also has an excellent modding community with many great mods that add tons of new content and keep you busy.The game's main weakness is its utter lack of any sort of campaign; you can only play skirmish mode.  Fortunately, every match feels different because of the varied maps, random events, and differing outcomes.  Also, the enemy AI has an annoying tendency to sometimes give up when defeat is assured, bowing out of the game early instead of putting up a valiant last stand, which can make for an unsatisfying conclusion to hours of conflict.All in all, this is an excellent space RTS well worth its asking price.

												Background: Played the original Sins and all the Expansions, back before it was on Steam, Direct from Ironclad Website.Combat Mechanics: 4x Spacesim Lite. Active Time Battle, Fleet Building, Starline locked Galaxy Domination Simulator.  SINS has had a number of improvements and Xpacs added to it over the last 8 years. 6 Major factions now exist.  The TEC are Armor Focused. The Advent are Shield Focused. And the Vasari are middle of the road awkward. Combat takes place in real time using the entire galaxy as the battle field. Ships have roles that they fulfill and Capital ships are customizable.  The Game progresses as Technology is researched. Combat can be very slow and laborious at times when fleet sizes get huge, but often the right counter can end even massive battles quickly.  Socially after all this time: The community is small but we're still alive people.Final thoughts: ""We'll make them Understand."" - Advent. I've been told by my Advent Brethren that you must buy this game.			"

												What do ya know, another pay to use expansion... The series is good, just not really that good to have to keep paying for what basically amounts to being a patch. Nothing too earth-shattering this version, still a good game, but appears to have reached the end of the road. This version is just more of the same thing crammed into the trunk of the same old car you have already been using, but now you have some shiny spinners instead of reflective hub caps that Trinity gave you.

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is perhaps my favourite game out of those that I currently own, there are just so many features  and games will last you several hours. Few games have such a high level of replayability and sheer fun factor but Sins manages it with ease. Each faction is well balanced and unique, the split between Loyalists and Rebels is a nice touch, perhaps there could have been slightly more to seperate the two but it's not a pressing issue and they are unique enough.graphically the game looks impressive, models and textures are of high quality so people who enjoy their shiny games won't be dissapointed. The only particular issue with the game is the engine Ironclad used, it's very old and only uses a single core. Sadly this means no matter how beastly your rig is, during large battles with big fleets the game WILL stutter.If that doesn't put you off then Sins is well worth a buy, plus the game has modding support with a very active modding community that have made some fantastic mods. While you may not personally wants Sins itself (but it is good so do try it out) there are well developed mods including Halo, Mass Effect and Stargate and a Homeworld mod.Just for refference I have an i7-3930k clocked at 3.8ghz and the game still loses massive frames and stutters duing big battles. So do keep in mind the engine limitations...I wouldn't mind a Rebellion Remastered on a better engine Ironclad. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.			"

												This game is too good to pass up while it's on sale.I'm going to start with Pros and Cons first:+ The game itself is beautiful. The pictures above show what actual gameplay looks like for the most part, and I found myself ooing and ahhing quite often.+ 3 entire races to choose from, each fundamentally different. Each empire is easy to pick up once you get the hang of the game, but you'll find you prefer one race over the others, depending on your playstyle. In addition, you can pick between ""Rebel"" and ""Loyalist"" classes in each race, which have their own perks as well!+ There are many ways to win the game. Choose to conquer your enemies by destroying and taking over their planets, research technology, form peace treaties, etc... + Diplomacy is a fun aspect of the game, and can be quite challenging to manage at times.+ Once you get the hang of the game, it's very fun and engaging.+ You get to build MASSIVE fleets and manage planets at a universal level. It's freakin' awesome.+ You can create and customize your own universe to play on! It's a lot of fun to make your own maps and see how well you do on them. Most of the time you'll play on fair, randomized maps.+ The game has a speed-up function for offline play (up to 8x speed) so you can shorten a 20 hour experience vs 8 tough AI to maybe 5 (just an example).- If you don't have a powerful computer, you may not be able to experience the game to its fullest when manning a massive fleet.- Pretty steep learning curve; you really want to play the tutorials so you have a remote clue as to what to do.- All undiscovered planets have neutral units that try to kill you so it's tough to colonize. You get used to it.- Matches can be really, really long. Also, units take a long time to travel. It's as ""realistic"" as space games can get, however.The ""Gray Area"":This may be different preference for some people, but some matches can potentially last for hours on end. Computer matches can be paused and saved, but human vs. human really can't be. Playing vs AI is still very engaging, and with the many levels of difficulty, you won't be missing out much if you choose not to play vs human players. Either way, it's a satisfying game for the casual weekend gamer all the way to the basement dweller.Also, pirates. Pirates can be a b*tch. You can pay them to attack other empires, but you are also at risk of being out-bidden and being attacked as well. They add a really cool element to the game, and you have the option to turn them off. I personally turned them off until I learned the game well, then turned them back on for the fun of it.Final Thoughts/Review:When I first bought the game, I really wasn't sure what I was getting myself into; the pictures on the store page are a very simplified and zoomed in view of the game. In actuality, you are looking at a planet-by-planet point of view 90% of the time. The user interface isn't shown in the pictures, and when the game first starts, you are pretty much thrown into the game without much mercy. Once you play through all the tutorials and get beaten around by an easy AI the first time, you start to pick up the tricks of the game. Then you develop strategies. Then you start winning. Then it gets really fun. Then you starting adding more players. Then you increase the difficulty. Then you do it again.With randomized universes, huge options between each type of empire/victory method, scope of the game, level of challenge, I can't say bad things about this game. Once you invest a bit of time, Sins of a Solar Empire is worth every penny you spend on it.9.5/10. The only reason I don't rate higher is because I don't have time to play it all the time.*re-rated higher after some consideration.			"

												i have over 1.5k hours on this game, Stardock made me buy this game (and its expansions) again after their store went down a few years back. so, the fact im not salty about it should speak volumes.the last patch added some cool features but broke windowed for me (cant rezise the screen) still, its a superb game with a great modding scene and a clear game structure, so you can mod the game yourself, or tweak mods you DL in case you want to change the experience to your liking and all you need is the windows notepad.what makes this game absorbing is the swift way you can swich from Macro to micro, and that if you excel at one you can forget the other when skirmishing.the game also has an active online scene but the gameplay is a bit too micro for my liking.

												This is a game of patience, but oh man, will your patience be rewarded. Matches can concievably be played over the course of a few days, with fleets of apocalyptic proportions being the end result, blasting eachother into oblivion. Battles start small and get very, very big in scale as they go on, and the game even has a sweet cinemetic option that makes it easier to watch the space combat. Just don't do that in a serious fight or you'll find your ships exploding without you around to control them.The factions are slightly reminiscant of Starcraft's, with the defensive humans, offensive genetics-minded evil aliens and fanatical religious psychics. Space battles are fun but the game truly becomes great when you get diplomacy involved and start paying serious attention to economics, the game gives you alot of time to think and it's at it's most fun when that time is spent controlling as many of the intricate pieces in the game as possible. Definitely worth everything, highly reccomended to anyone who likes to take things slow and play mastermind.			"

												This is the best 4X space game. Can play a ton of games, solo or multiplayer, even without a campaign and it will be different and enjoyable every time. (my hours don't reflect a fraction of the time played I had box of original shipped no DRM and playing on digital copy on release of original Sins probably 300+hrs easy not counting mods) The graphics are really good for a game with this scale I did not expect this level. But if your rig can handle it it looks good even with a massive map and ships everywhere.  But also huge modding community that is amazing. Once you get tired of it make it Star Trek, Star Wars or Battlestar and enjoy or lose all those hundreds of hours again.  Cannot believe they let this title sit idle for so long.  Glad they are releasing new content now and haven't forgotten about the game. Trying to boost publicity possibly? Brings hope for new big expansion or new game!  Maybe this time we will get a campaign and finally see who or what the heck that warning was all about!			"

Ive spent hours playing this game trying out differnt strats and seeing what can quicly finish the game and what draws it out. The overal perk tree is amazing and if you are not carful you will find yourself losing the war very easily. All it takes is one simple wrong decision and you are on the defensive for hours. If you want a true challenge turn up the difficulty for the AI and unless you have played the game awhile I would not go past Hard. For a space RTS this one out of them all is my favorite well worth the money.			"

												My first space-based strategy game. Stardock creates quality games, and SOASE is no exception. I'll admit that this game isn't at the complexity of more recent space civs (like Stellaris, which I reviewd only a few minutes ago, or Galactic Civilizations 3 which is also by Stardock but is a 4k turn-based strategy game,) this game is still thouroughly entertaining, keeping a special place on my computer if not on my mind.Gameplay is streamlined but simple, and definitely can become repetative even when playing nothing but randomized maps. Diplomacy can be a pain and isn't usually worth the bother, and the economy is somewhat difficult to control (you really have no direct controls except those found in the black market.) Combat is quick but exeptionally thrilling, as ship movements are completely under your control throughout a battle and usually requires some level of strategy beyond just ""have more ships"". The three factions are all uniquely balanced and interesting to play as; personally I focus on the TEC but the Vasari are also a fun faction to play as (admittedly the Advent are somewhat boring.) *Please note that I only possess the New Worlds DLC, so I cannot be certain if the newest ""Sectors"" dlc changes gameplay in any dramatic way.This editionof the game (specifically Rebellion) is easily the greatest of the SOASE collection, possessing all the qualities and updates of the previous editions with the added bonus of the Titan ship class (my favorite being the TEC Ragnarov, Sniper shot beats EVERYTHING at higher levels.) I have to admit, this game gets me somewhat nostalgic due to my extended experience with it, but I don't believe it clouds my judgement too much. 8/10.			"

												This 4X Strategy game is an amazing game to play. The vanilla version offers countless hours of gameplay due to the sizes of the maps which can range from small to large. The mods that are avaliable for this game makes it last that much longer because of the content that the mods can bring. Some of mods such as Sins of the Prophets and Star Wars: Interregnum are in Alpha stage, but the content it brings so far looks extremely promising. Some of the full released mods for Sins are Sins of a Galactic Empire, Star Trek Armada, and Sacrifice of the Angels are just some of the mods that are avaliable to enhance the vanilla version of this game.

												One of the most epic, large-scale, intense, strategic, balanced RTS games I know of.   You have three factions to choose from, each with two sub-factions a piece.  You have a wide variety of ships to build your fleets from, you have many planets connected by tenuous hyperspace lanes.   You have war.  Lots of it.Diplomacy is a viable option in this RTS, unlike many.  One can win the entire game by turtling and sending out envoys to convert people to their way of thinking, meanwhile opening up extremely valuable technologies that can only be applied to staunch allies.One can also win by culture.  Literally propagandizing the entire galaxy into submission.This game is golden.  My favorite RTS of all-time.  It has flaws, but they're easily overcome by it's great strengths.10/10 Buy this.			"

												Beautiful graphics, efficient UI, and great controls make this RT4X game a lot of fun.  6 different races (i guess it's closer to 3 races with each race having 2 versions), 5 tech trees, dozens of unique ships ranging in size  from corvettes to frigates to capital to super capital, and starbases too!  And also, all the DLC is very cheap and adds a lot to the game.  Great map editor as well.  Oh, and the devs are very good about listening to the fans - something that seems hard to find nowadays - especially with a major release such as this.Really can't recommend this one more - if you liked games such as Homeworld, you need to check it out.  There's a demo too - so NO EXCUSES!  :D			"

												Pure awesomeness, got hooked on the 4x genre by Star Wars: Empires at war battles and after 100 hours in sins I keep finding ways to beat my opponents and to explore new planets. The PVP is a whole new universe to explore with so much tactical and strategical openings who could influence the course of an entire 4+ hours game. The only downside for me was the lack of single-player campaign, because the Sins Lore seems pretty interesting, and I would love to dig into it			"

												Effectively the only true real-time strategy. No turns, no ""planning"" period like you have in Rome between battles. Everything happens at th same time, and it could be slightly overwhelming. There is a considerable amount of micromanagement, and it only scales up once you get into maps that consist of over 100 different planets. My favorite strategy game of all time.			"

												My brother bought this as a gift for me and a group of friends. i find the multi-tiered strategy excellent and the replayability high as well. 2 different factions of each race let you play the same race with a totally different experience. good single player pve, good multiplayer team pve, have not tried all player pvp yet. keeping track of the large maps can be difficult at time [especially when there are 3 different solar systems and 96 planets!] but finding map sizes you like is easy and there are a TON to choose from.i also really like how each type of ship [different skins for each race mind you] is in the same place...colonizing cap ship is ALWAYS the 3rd one...makes it easy to find and build the ships you want. you can go tech, military, diplomacy, or any combo...LOVE IT!...i'm buying xpacs for all my friends to return the favor!for someone that wants REAL minutiae and micromanaging this might not be QUITE detailed enough for you...but it gets close. for those who want 'fire and forget' it supports that too. VERY versatile game.			"

												This game is an RTS - 4X hybrid (which focuses a lot more onthe RTS aspect), featuring three different races with two factions each (Rebels and Loyalists). Each faction is a bit different from the other, while they share base similarities. This last expansion, which is now also standalone, has all the features (and more) than the previous ones had: Diplomacy and Entrenchment. I do quite like it, I've spent many hours on it and I do suggest you buy it if you like RTS games that are set in space. It's pretty unique on itself because of the rather uncommon lore the game has; there's no story nor any form of campaign, you are given the races and a bunch of maps (quite big bunch in fact) and you just play. I hope that the backstories of each race are expanded upon with any further release/DLC and I hope that some day we see official campaigns, meanwhile we still have the map creator tools.It also is mod compatible, even online. Has pretty grafix and doesn't play too bad, although the framerate will progressively decrease on big maps with lots of AI players and units (sometimes to the point of having a 20fps slideshow, but the slideshow is still pretty!)New units and all that yadda.Overall 8.7/10 Would recommend again.

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is essentially Jesus in RTS game form.You get to choose from six factions, all with differing research trees and a wide variety of ships and a different titan for each.It utilizes a grand scale real time system, you can make huge A$$ fleets and do whatever you want, split them up and send them to different areas, move as a giant mass, go crazy, it allows for a lot of strategic, tactical flexibility.The map system is also pretty incredible, multiple planets and locations of interest all around a sun which can differ each time, and not only that but you can make the map just as huge as well, more than one solar system.It's fun with friends, fun alone, and fun in multiplayer, I'm being serious when I say I can't find any downsides to this game.

												One the best sci-fi RTS games ever made really. This is an unsung classic of the genre IMO. The closest way to describe this is that its Rise of Nations in space. You have a civilization management side to the game via customizable planets and using starbases to shape the political and economic terrain. You also have crazy awesome massive fleets battling it out against each other and against epic planetary defenses.The tactical combat rewards a certain amount of micro-management via the special powers provided by capital ships. The automation and fleet logistics are good enough to where you don't have to be a twitch-master to be effective though. Few games get this balance right.The original SINS game was not the best, I'll be straight. The complete Rebellion pack with all the expansions and DLC is however a very good and fairly different game. So if core SINS has a bad rap, you need to really look at the total package not just vanilla.			"

												Absolutely love this game! The graphics excellent, the AI can be very tough to fight on Hard difficulty alone (let alone the ""Very hard"" and ""Unfair"" diffulties!) and the variety in ships between the factions and their research and powers provides a continuous feel.My main positive with this game though, is how mod-able it is! ""Sins of a galactic Empire"" (Star Wars full conversion), ""Sins of the Prophets"" (Halo full conversion), ""Star Trek Armada"" (Star Trek full conversion), ""Dawn of the Reapers"" (Mass Effect full conversion), are just a few of the mods you can find that are just mind blowing and yet keep the same Sins feel to them!PROS:+ Excellent gameplay+ Excellent scenery + Great effects during conflicts+ Huge numbers of ships can be recruited, giving potential to massive conflicts at a time+ Love the music and sounds+ Very mod-able, opening up a variety of other gameplays+ Multiplayer+ Large numbers of maps available to play with various sizes and star systemsCONS:- Can be difficult to get used to some of the features and the pace of the game if your new to it. Give it some time and perhaps start on a small map to work out the controls and your style of play before taking on the larger maps and harder AI's (trust me, you'll get obliterated otherwise haha)- [This is more of a personal con] - Wish there could be a bit more detail in wreckage. One thing I seem to keep missing when playing sci-fi RTS games like this is that when a ship is destroyed it explodes and then nothing is left behind. In this game there is only a small amount of wreckage left. If you have a big enough battle it's not such an issue, but more wreckage would add another level of greatness to conflict. However there are some mods and full conversions (such as Star Trek Armada) that address this.OVERALL: Fantastic game that is a perfect addition to the RTS genre. If you're looking to expand your RTS collection or just add more games to your library list, this game is certainly worth the buy!			"

												So first and foremost, I love this game, i've enjoyed it alone and even more so with friends. For those who can't be bothered reading anything lengthy, if you are looking for a fast paced strategy game you're very much in the wrong place, go play starcraft, or, well I guess thats it (Dear god we need better RTS titles)  Rebellion takes the slow, methodical strategy of its predecessor and adds on largely to the end game but there are some new toys almost every aspect of the game. If you liked sins of a solar empire I cannot fathom any reason you wouldn't like rebellion. Havnt played either? Sins is a space based 4x Real Time Strategy game focusing quite largely on fleet composition and production with empire management taking a bit of a back seat. Don't expect civilisation depth but thats not to say its a simple game. Rebellion in my opinion is a good game to go for as a first step into the sins series or for experienced players. The scale of the combat alone can be awesome in the literal sense of the word and the new titan class ships can make for some very interesting boss battle style engagements. The new factions (well, old factions split in to two groups) can really give players a good sense of direction and palystyle which really does run on to the rediculous once you hit the end game research.   The corvettes while were a nice addition are not overly game changing like much of the other additions much to my own dissapointment and this version still suffers from one drawback it shares with the original trilogy. The combat can look a little stupid at times. While its really cool to see the larger ships turn to fire broadsides at eachother, the smaller ships tend to just sit there like stationary platforms. The smallest ships are a little silly looking as they have a tendancy to literaly fly into their target and fire in a random direction, poorly representing any sense of speed and manuverability or even looking remotely sensible.

												This game.... This game is probably the best Space based game I've ever played. Sin's of a Solar Empire started off as a revolutionary Space combat system, with hundreds of planets, dozens of ships and unlimited possibilities. Rebellion is the next step, and Stardock did not dissapoint me at all. This game is as close to perfection as you can get. Amazing graphics, gripping storyline, and explosive combat. In this game, you take command of one of six Factions, and command an entire empire throughout war and peace. You can choose from one of six factions, of three Races.The Trader Emergency Coalition is the human empire. They were formed after an alien assault, and have been fighting a losing battle ever since. The Loyalists want to find a diplomatic way to end the war, preferably saving as many lives as possible along the way. The Rebels on the other hand, are only interested in Human domination, and will do anything to destroy the enemies of humanity. The Advent are a long lost sect of Humanity. They strive to seek peace and enlightenment, and the only way they see they can succeed is by either indoctrinating everyone else, or destroying those who appose the Unity. The loyalists are trying to remain peacefull, spreading their religion as far as they can, taking over worlds through persuasion, and not violence. The Rebels are violently assaulting other worlds, using massive weapons of mass destruction and mind control to overthrow planetary governments. The Vasari are an ancient race, born in the beginnings of the galaxy. They are all that remain of a galaxy spanning empire, and are fleeing from a dangerous species, known only as the unknown. They are incredibly powerful, and will do anything they can to keep their species alive, through intimidation, or slavery. Loyalists of the Vasari commune want to enslave or destroy the other races they have encountered, while the Rebels want to work together to survive, and the gods know that to survive something that can destroy an entire empire, who knows what will have to be done.....20/20 Score10/10 for Graphics and Visuals10/10 for Storyline and Gameplay "

												Although Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion lacks a campaign that so many gamers love and look for, it more than makes up for this by atmosphere, scale, and depth. Sins of a Solar Empire is one of those games balanced in such a way that there's no clear balance. That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means that each race (the Vasari, the TEC, and the Advent) have different playing styles. In contrast to games such as StarCraft, where everone knows the three races have their own triangle of defeat (Zerg beats Protoss, Protoss beats Terran, and Terran beats Zerg), Sins of a Solar Empire is all about your strategy. Will you expand your space outwards, take planets and conquer the enemy, or will you lie in wait until the time is right? The scale of the game is truely marvelous, but often goes overlooked. The zoom function is really helpful, as it shows that even the tiniest of battles are absurdly dramatic: If you're zoomed out enough, you see two little ship icons, and perhaps some fire in between them, Zoom in more and you see stunning 3D models, complete with thrusters, blinking lights, etc, and you can see exactly what they're firing. Zoom in until one fills your screen and suddenly you notice that it's on fire, sparks are flying, and the enemy's fire is devastating the hull with massive explosions.If you love strategy games, space games, or just want to watch ships burn, you'll probably like this game.

												THE best 4XRTS game I have ever owned. It does take some getting used to at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes very addicting.                 Graphics and gameplay greatly balanced. No extra effects that do not add to the gameplay. If you have a beefy rig, or a standard laptop, the settings are highly configurable to suite your needs. You can zoom right in and see your ships shoot lasers and rockets at the enemy, watch your fleet jump into an intense 3D fire-fight, and zoom in on a building that you just destroyed to watch it explode.                You will always be researching armor, weapon, mining, colonization, and diplomatic sciences to improve your empire. Build a variety of ships, defensive structures, and planetary upgrades to improve you empire's spread rate and combat effectiveness.                Overall I would rate this game 9/10. Love the game, but matches can take hours, and not everyone has that time. But what do you expect? It's a strategy game, they all take a long time.			"

												This game is one of the best by far RTS Space-Set games, The fact that it is pure RTS is wonderful, The combat system is iffy and could look more space-battle like instead of two ships looking at each other but that is pretty much the only flaw, the research shows you ahead of time what you can get and explains the advantages of getting that upgrade, the game itself was confusing at first for me but i literially played the very first version where you got ships, a planet, and that was it, no mines, no space stations, no titans, no corvettes etc. etc. This game does feature tutorials so do not be down, and a tip: The very first game you play on here should not be a multiplayer game! There are literal people who this game is their bread and butter for favorite games and are skilled at it and can bulldoze you and your fleet like a literal bulldozer going over a stick, try AI easy at first then work your way up to about hard then try multiplayer.

												Although Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion lacks a campaign that so many gamers love and look for, it more than makes up for this by atmosphere, scale, and depth. Sins of a Solar Empire is one of those games balanced in such a way that there's no clear balance. That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means that each race (the Vasari, the TEC, and the Advent) have different playing styles. In contrast to games such as StarCraft, where everone knows the three races have their own triangle of defeat (Zerg beats Protoss, Protoss beats Terran, and Terran beats Zerg), Sins of a Solar Empire is all about your strategy. Will you expand your space outwards, take planets and conquer the enemy, or will you lie in wait until the time is right? The scale of the game is truely marvelous, but often goes overlooked.

												Sins of a Solar Empire is a solid RTS all round. The only gripe I have with it is that there is really only one way to actually play the game. Sure you can win via other ways technically, there is only one effective way to win.It's a good play if you're into space RTS, but if you're looking for replayability, perhaps you could give this a miss.7/10			"

												Hey all, Deadpool here with a review. Now that the obvious is out of the way, let's get to it shall we? Here be the review for Sins of a Solar Empire; Rebellion, a 4X RTS game set in space. Oooooooooo.PlotThere isn't one. At least not that I can infer. I think. Let me start from the beginning. Rebellion is the first Sins game I have played. As with sequels, you'd usually get a recap, yes? Crysis 3 has a rather long one, the Assassin's Creed games(save for the first) have recaps, and the list goes on. Sins of a Solar Empire; Rebellion does not have one. So me being new to the series, I have absolutely no clue what is going on. The intro video, while stunning and well done, offered little to no info. All I know(and still know because I am too lazy to Google) is that there are humans, some very spiritual alien peeps, and some nano-tech alien things that are running from something. Each race has been split into Loyalists and Rebels. So you have, vaguely, six to choose from.The Good StuffThe game is pretty well balanced. The developers seem to have a keen eye for balance between the various ship classes and races that produce the ships. I tried spamming with smaller frigates, but was easily defeated. A balanced fleet is a good one, and the Devs seem to have hit the nail on the head when it came to making sure of it. The Same can be said for the balance between the factions themselves.Graphics. Wow. The explosions seem legit, and make the camera shake if you zoom in. Which, I love. The level of detail in the game is astounding. Then again, it being a space based game, you'd really hope so. Truly well thought out and beautiful artwork. Same can be said for the sound. Very, very well done and aesthetically pleasing.Complex, but simple. It is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy and really make you think about your next move, yet simple enough to where there is a minimal learning curve; especially for someone like me who has never played a Sins game before. Little to no micromanaging of your planets and/or colonies, which allows you to truly focus on your fleet, defense, economy, and of course diplomacy.Now, for diplomacy. The devs offered up something I haven't seen in diplomacy before I played this game. It is complex with your actions affecting not only the intended faction, but rippling through to the other factions in the game. And likewise with their actions. Not only that, but to create alliances and forge pacts, not only do they have to like you, but your people have to like them. I, for one, absolutely love this. It prevents you from going all out and forging alliances just to win an allied victory and truly brings into perspective just how closely and how far the devs went to instill a balance into the game.Voice acting. It is phenomenal. 'Nuff said. Some of the best I have seen. Or heard, rather.Diversity. The diversity between the three races, and even their Loyalist and Rebel sub-factions, is outstanding. The research options differ greatly between the three races. The technologies are different, the voices are different, everything is different! Mostly. Each time you play as a different race, it feels and plays completely different from the last.The Bad StuffCampaign. There isn't one. The only mode, aside from multiplayer online, is relative to skirmish mode on Command and Conquer games. That's it. No campaign to play through, nothing. Nothing but a repetitive procession of skirmish after skirmish. Set up, conquer, win. Set up, conquer, win. As amazing as the game looks, it gets old. Unless you're like me and use Galaxy Forge(Comes with the game, program you can use to create your own maps) to play very sadistic games with the AI.Speaking of AI, it is very finicky. If you have great defenses, they don't attack. Even when you set them on the hardest difficulty, they wont attack. The only good thing about the AI is the diplomacy, and watching them fight between themselves. I once sat for two hours watching five AI's battle it out over 2 different star systems. There was a tug of war, take and lose. The AI's fight each other real well, but if you're too powerful they leave you alone like you have the plague. If you maintain a decent level of awesomeness, they will attack you. They will take what you have and own you. So it is somewhat of a balancing act. Depends on how you want to play it.Micro Management. I put this in the Bad Stuff section as well because if you're like me and love micro managing, then this game will disappoint. Yeah sure you build things in orbit to advance your culture and spread it, but so what? I want to be able to see who the leaders are, select the political whatevermajiggs, change the funding from research to defense if I wanted, and truly see what my people(ingame people, you know, in my empire) are made of. But no. You get a planet, some aircraft whizzing around it, and city lights if you're on the nighttime side of it. That's it. To me, once you learn the game and how to play it, there is sooooo much room for micromanagement. But, I can see why the Devs didn't do it. It is an RTS game, and sometimes not enough time for micromanagement.ConclusionNow that I touched on just a few of the high and low points of the game, here is my condensed review of my review of the game. To be frank, the game is amazing. Excellent mechanics, balance, diplomacy, voice acting, visuals, diversity, and a true pleasure to play. Tutorials are available if you have questions, but in the end you will still be discovering little things here and there that you can do months after the fact. Lack of a campaign makes the endless C&C and Starcraft-like map skirmishes repetitive and give it a lack of long-term playability(Invented that word just for this review). In this game, I feel, the Pros outweigh the Cons and thus I give it a 7 out of 10.			"

												Absolutely love this game! The graphics excellent, the AI can be very tough to fight on Hard difficulty alone (let alone the ""Very hard"" and ""Unfair"" diffulties!) and the variety in ships between the factions and their research and powers provides a continuous feel.My main positive with this game though, is how mod-able it is! ""Sins of a galactic Empire"" (Star Wars full conversion), ""Sins of the Prophets"" (Halo full conversion), ""Star Trek Armada"" (Star Trek full conversion), ""Dawn of the Reapers"" (Mass Effect full conversion), are just a few of the mods you can find that are just mind blowing and yet keep the same Sins feel to them!PROS:+ Excellent gameplay+ Excellent scenery + Great effects during conflicts+ Huge numbers of ships can be recruited, giving potential to massive conflicts at a time+ Love the music and sounds+ Very mod-able, opening up a variety of other gameplays+ Multiplayer+ Large numbers of maps available to play with various sizes and star systemsCONS:- Can be difficult to get used to some of the features and the pace of the game if your new to it. Give it some time and perhaps start on a small map to work out the controls and your style of play before taking on the larger maps and harder AI's (trust me, you'll get obliterated otherwise haha)- [This is more of a personal con] - Wish there could be a bit more detail in wreckage. One thing I seem to keep missing when playing sci-fi RTS games like this is that when a ship is destroyed it explodes and then nothing is left behind. In this game there is only a small amount of wreckage left. If you have a big enough battle it's not such an issue, but more wreckage would add another level of greatness to conflict. However there are some mods and full conversions (such as Star Trek Armada) that address this.OVERALL: Fantastic game that is a perfect addition to the RTS genre. If you're looking to expand your RTS collection or just add more games to your library list, this game is certainly worth the buy!			"

												Sins of the Solar Empire Rebellion is a combination of the classic RTS genre with the 4x games. The main focus of the game is absolutly the real time battle between the six factions. The colonisation and construction part of the game is very limited (got slightly expanded with the DLC) but fits perfect in the gameplay. The battles could reach epic sizes (on large galaxies) where hundrets of  ships fight for one planet. Titans and Corvettes, which was both introduced with Rebellion, changed the way to play extremly if you compare it with the predecessor.All three main factions plays different and focus on other ways to overcome there enemies. The grafic is absolutly impressive for a 4x game. Music and Sound are also up to date and give you the right ""space feeling"" while playing. The AI is a very hard opponent in higher difficulties, so the game keeps challenging.The Multiplayer is active and you can always find someone to play against the AI or each other. A single game could take 1 - 6 hours, depending on the size of your galaxy. There are also a lot of mods that change or improve the gameplay, so anyone will find something for his taste.A last hint, if I only could take one game with me to a lonely island, it would be Sins - Rebellion			"

												This game has been adding new game objectives, research, ships, orbital structures and planet types for a number of years now and it has turned it into a really great game. Each of the races and now factions within the races (Loyalist/Rebellion) offer higher defensive, offensive, economic or boosts to your culture (culture will overthrow enemy planets non violently) which gives a varying amount of replayability and playstyles. The learning curve for playing this game is low to mid, it doesn't take long to learn how to play.In this game you'll be able to build up a massive fleet armada or split your fleet in two or three and raid the enemy's core planets after destroying their fleet. You'll be able to build starbases that can halt the advance of armadas until they are dealt with that also protect your trade empire from pirate raiders, jumping away from a starbase before it is destroyed seriously damages ships automatically.This recent expansion breaks each of the three races into a loyalist and rebel faction. Each group has unique researchable abilities that offer different playstyles (defensive, offensive, culture) and each loyalist and rebel race receives a different Titan ship, a juggernaught of a ship that is 10 times larger than any capitol ship. These Titans can easily throw a pitched battle by special abilities that will either do area effect or very high single target damage, while others are disablement oriented, reducing the damage your fleet takes and reducing the firing rate of the enemy.General overview of races:TEC (Trade Emergency Coalition) - An economic powerhouse compared to the other races with quicker access to trade ports and higher research done that gives you extra credits anytime another faction buys something. The ships they field are considerably weaker though at end game research, as they have less fleet support abilities unless you have they loyalist capitol ship in the fleet to help reduce incoming damage. Their ships have high armor and their ultimate weapon is the Novalith Cannon, a weapon that sits in a planet's gravity well and regularly fires shots at enemy planets destroying all life on them and making them temporarily uncolonizable.Advent - This race, in my opinion, fields the best armadas in the game. Their capitol ships and cruisers offer a lot of support abilities to spread damage to each ship, redirect damage from their own ships back to the enemy, area effect shield recharge all the while fielding a massive amount of fighters and bombers making the need for direct engagement with an enemy fleet purely optional. The flip side to this is they have a really weak economy and the worst ultimate weapon compared to the TEC or Vasari. Their ships have very high shields and their ultimate weapon shoots at enemy planets your planet's culture which is easily countered.Vasari - A brutal alien race that terrorizes the galaxy thru subjegating and enslaving other races. They get a later start with building up their economy but their economy is pretty great at end game. Their units have a variety of disablement oriented abilities and a area effect hull repair and they tend to have higher hull values than the other races. Further research into missile technology allows you to bypass shields making them excellent against advent in a stand up fight. Their ultimate weapon is the Kostura cannon that will shoot at enemy planets damaging and disabling enemy structures in that planet's gravity well. If an enemy fleet is there, the fleet will be temporarily disabled and be unable to move or attack making it an invaluable tool to use while attacking with your fleet.If you are a RTS fan or just enjoy viewing space warfare, I'd definetely recommend this game.

												Alrighty, as a hardcore enthusiast of RTS and similar strategy games, this worked it's way into my top 3. The online scene is a little dead, but that doesnt take away from the fact that this is a fantastic game.There are 3 things that set this apart from most other RTS's I have played:1) The diplomacy is challenging as you have to build a relationship with a faction. Unlike other games with diplomacy mechanics, you really have to work at it.2) The resources are scarce. It's not like Starcraft where you can just start mass-producing probes/drones/scvs to boost your economy intake. You need to manage resources and take advantage of the refining boosts you get through research.3) The research tree. This is probably one of the most standard mechanic of any good RTS, and because of that I have seen some terrible tech trees. This game however has a balanced tech tree that allows for a little variability in expanding and is grouped into nice little sections for easier maintenance. I like this a LOT.Aside from these three things, the game is also visually appealing, with an interesting (if a bit cliche) backstory and lots of available strategies for play. The only true downsides are the somewhat annoying and repetitive unit voices, the rather repetitive soundtrack, and the steep, steep learning curve.In any case, I give this a 9/10. Excellent game to pick up if you dont mind spending an hour or 2 per match.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is the latest iteration of Sins of a Solar Empire, a space themed real time strategy game with a truly fantastic scale. I’ve seen battles with hundreds of ship engaging each other as more reinforcements filter in from distant star systems. Even friendly comp stomp games can last for hours as your forces slowly conquer the cosmos. Whether this is epic or tedious is a matter of taste, but I fall into the epic camp.Sins plays a little like a 4X game. You’ll explore the universe, colonize and develop planets, research all manner of military and civilian technologies, meet other peoples, and kill them.  Throughout you’ll be struggling with issues like whether asteroid colony Y would benefit more from a refinery, trade port, or capital ship factory. You are Space Stalin, staying up late in your space Kremlin while devising plans to ensure your people are mining enough crystals to build the ships you’ve just researched. This isn’t a game where you’ll dance a little hero unit around the map. Yes, you can do a little micromanagement. However, you’ve got a lot on your plate already. It’s best to just let the Battleship Captain decide when he wants to fire his special Gauss Rail Gun.If you want to play an RTS during a lunch break then this is definitely not for you. It’s possible that you could order units to help save an ally’s distant home world, step away from the computer, go out and grab some lunch, eat said lunch, and return before the battle finished. That kind of scale and speed will be a turn off for many people. However, I highly recommend Sins of a Solar Empire Rebellion to patient people with an inner Ming the Merciless.    "

												One of the best 4X space strategy games I've ever played, proven by my 250+ hrs of gameplay.  The game offers excellent balance, interesting factions that, while similar in organization, offer enough degrees of difference to allow for a variety of strategies in gameplay.  The software itself is solid, but one of the features that makes SoaSE so sustanable is the developer and distributor supporting, wholeheartedly, the modding community.  Just when you thought you were growing weary of the Vasari's dark fleets, or the TEC's economic supremacy, you can download any of several well-developed mods to suit your favorite sci-fi franchise.  The utter collapse of Kerberos' Sword of the Stars II left a void in the 4x genre that Sins has continued to fill with ease.  What the game lacks in the finer points of empire building, it more than makes up for with good macro-economic management tools.  But the brilliant tactical and strategic engine is what makes Sins the standard in current space-based strategy games.  If you were a fan of the Galactic Civ franchise, Masters of Orion, or Sword of the Stars (the original), this game is a need-to-have part of your collection.			"

												If you are looking for an epic space combat simulator then look no further, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion delivers a fantastic experience with a few hicups but, they can easily be ignored. For the most part this game looks great, especially when there are hundreds of ships duking it out for a vital planet. On the other hand, some ship models look to have some basic textures and some planets do look a bit dated. These problems however, arn't big enough to pull you out of the massive battle experience; when there is a massive hundred ship battle it brings a manly tear to your eye. Enough about the graphics lets move onto what the game has to offer, for £30 the amount of content here is excellent if you haven't played the previous games (which I haven't) however; after watching many gameplay videos of the previous games I would wait until a sale to pick this one up as I have seen some repititve gameplay. The amount of hours that I have sunk into this game is ridiculous, the gameplay is complex and indepth, this is a very good strength for me because alot of game developers nowadays try to dumb down their games to make it more casual, this is a refreshing change of much needed complexity in games. Complexity is also a problem with this game, it can take a while to learn with a steep learning curve; I would highly recommend new players to start with offline matches and tutorials before diving into the multiplayer which is fantastic by the way, apart from the fact that games can take a long time to finish I am talking litural hours, make sure you arn't going to school or work that day or you may have to cut the game short. One final note is the fact that the depth and scale of this game is amazing (coming from a Total War player). Another problem with this game is the fact that there is no single player campaign there is however, a nice backstory intro scene at the start of the game which I catch myself strangely watching over and over again. If you're looking for a complex, well executed game with good multiplayer buy this one it is worth it. If you're a more casual player looking for quick online games then you might want to miss this one.			"

												I LOVE this game, by your self? or with your firends? dosent matter. once you start destorying other planets all you want is MORE. i only wish there where more factions to mix it up a little more.... Once you have mastered playing by yourself, get your mates online AND form a massive allience. Go smash the enemy as the ultimate force, or be the ULTIMATE sinner, and go to war with your allies for no reason, destory all there stuff while laughing at them as they rage at there fleet that is stuck in another system (he he he)BE WARNED - GAMES TAKE A FUE HOURS if youre on the massive maps, and once you start, say good bye to sleepI would recommend this to all my firends, infact bulk of them have this game because of me :PAND REMEMBERMORE CRYSTAL REQUIRED			"

												A good grand RTS game of scale comparable to Supreme Commander but in space.You can fight on 'maps' that are anywhere from a single star surrounded by only a few planets to a few stars with upwards of a hundred varied planets, from dwarf planets and giant asteroids to molten and ice covered planets. There are three factions, both with a loyalist and a rebel side to choose from that mostly comes to a choice of offense vs. defense. And it even has mod support with no shortage of mods to choose from be it Star Trek, Star Wars, or even the Stargate SG1 series among other mods that add whole new factions not pulled from other scifi.Taking planets could be more interesting, given that you can only bombard them into oblivion or overwhelm a planet with your culture to break it's loyalty down. Combat itself isn't too involved either, most any abilities are auto-cast and there's nothing dynamic about the damage system. It can become a bit boring after a while because of that but this is a grand strategy so what's to expect.There is zero reason to pick up the previous games because every single release, including this game, since the original's release has been a DLC pack.

												Sins was a game that honestly had me relatively surprised in a number of aspects. Here's my thoughts:Graphics: 7/10; For a game made more than a couple years ago, it manages to push a rather impressive resolution, detail and ambience. Everything from massive capitol ships and Titans, to small units such as fighter squadrons are well textured, clearly defined and able to give a good visual experience that's both impressive, and incredibly well optimised. So well in fact even older PC's can handle the game on higher graphics levels. Sadly in large scale games with multiple players the game does tend to putz around a bit with the number of items and commands being issued but thats simply a common feature among RTS games.Gameplay: 8/10; RTS at its finest, with a bit of micro-RPG elements attatched to each ship, the game is fun to play, flows well, and encourages good strategy as well as economy management. The controls are a bit much to take in all at once, and it like many other games involving a 4 tier RTS, requires a bit of a learning curve. However, once understood the game is able to flow well, it rewards tactics and an understanding of your opponent, and a satisfying feeling of accomplishment.Sound: 5/10; Its an older game, but the sound effects hold up, and are fairly solid. Listening in on battles is an enjoyable experience and the sound levels are accurate. However some of the more notable abilities used by the Titan units seem unnessecarrily loud, and if listening with headphones can be somewhat deafening if zoomed in close to observe the battle.Addictiveness and Depth: 4/10; The game suffers from one major flaw. Its absolute lack of a single player campaign. The game has all the makings of what could be a very entertaining single player space domination game, however it is restricted to arena style RTS combat over a set number of worlds against 1 - 7 opponents. The game does have an interactive level up system for Capitol ships, which are allowed to level in a manner you can guide them in by increasing their abilities, and the games heavy amount of depth via a diplomacy system, a working active and live economy, as well as player issued missions, falls by the wayside when faced with the knowledge that the entire games structure is simply a Starship based battle arena.Overall: 6/10; The games very fun if you can settle into its niche setting. Enjoying well detailed space battles happening in real time is difficult to manage especially with the graphical quality this game manages to provide. However the lack of a single player campaign hits this game hard, and pushes it onto a back burner if you're looking to pick it up. Best to get if you know a friend that plays it as well, or if you enjoy the competition of facing down another player in a 3 Tier RTS game. Only reason this game isnt being reccomended is its heavy reliance on other players for any sort of content.			"

												over all a solid game from a mechanical point of view. the only mechanical draw back ""if you want to call it a drawback"" is while each faction does have a personality the basic mechanics beyond a few key points are identical to the other factions, the basic ship, the siege ship, the carrier ship etc etc all work the same way. compare to say other rts games like starcraft each faction and their units are unique in how they approach a function or role in combat. in Sins you have the same core mechanics and approach to roles uniform across the board. This makes the game easier to transition from faction to faction with only a general style change with a few key talents to take into account however it does reduce replay appeal.the game does have a cool lore but lacks a single player story driven campaign which to some will be a drawback.

												One of the greatest 4X RTS games of all time. If you like space, spaceships, epic space battles, and empire management, then this game is for you. I played the original before it was on Steam (have the retail box here) and Rebellion basically combines the basic game with all released expansions; the end result is an amazing game extended with more awesomeness.+ The graphics are beautiful, you can freely zoom from a scale showing the entire solar system down to a single ship, the detail is amazing and space and especially the battles look incredible+ The expansion packs have added a lot, giving more defensive options, more offensive options, and more diplomatic options+ You can make custom maps and many maps have random elements for which planets or anomalies appear where, making for great replay value+ Full mod support+ The scale of this game is amazing+ The interface holds up really well and makes managing large empires easy- The game can be very performance demanding, especially as games drag on and everyone fields fleets of hundreds of ships, paired with hundreds of trade ships- you get the idea- Even though diplomatic options have been expanded, it's still more action focused in general- The three (six) factions all play fairly similar, they are about as different as Nod and GDI in C&C- No campaign, this game is focused on skirmish matches both in Single- and Multiplayer			"

Support is very lacking, as contacting them they provide the same answer, re-download and delete all mods.  Funny as I had no mods installed.  If you have it working it is a great game.			"

												A wonderful combination of 4X and RTS, but for the hardcore 4X fans out there, be warned, this game is lighter on that aspect then the RTS. There also exsists a very active modding community allowing for gameplay ranging from Star Wars to Star Trek, and many many other franchises in between. There are also many other different types of mods that makes this game worth ten times more than it currently is. A definite must have for any RTS fan. Like the best kinds of games, takes very little time to learn, a lifetime to master. Don't pass this game up, you'll regret not having tried one of the greatest games of this generation, but you won't regret the countless hours of fun you'll have while playing this game.			"

												Your basic so-so space related tactical sim game. I bought a half dozen of similar games from Steam on sale, and while each has their good and bad points, all play basically the same with little variance and limited tactical ability. Get it on sale, not even close to being worth the full price. Good points. Space battles aren't the quick turn based fights that many such simulators have. The battles in Rebellion actually take a while, you don't need to micromanage them.. just send your ships to enemy area, and your off, they can fight their own fights. Lets you work on your planets, research, etc while your fleet is off doing stuff. Also pirates. Most maps have a pirate homeworld that constantly spawns harder than normal pirate fleets to harass you and the npcs/other players playing the map. Sadly this is easily handled by just giving money in bounty thus letting the pirates attack someone else. Bad points. Game is pretty easy once you figure out a few basic things. Fleet battles will determine map winner, you won't win on diplomacy, or other tactics. Biggest best fleet wins. Pirates are a pain until you quickly figure out how to post bounty switching them to other players.. easy enough. System defenses? kinda useless since fleets can just fly past your defenses unless they are specificially attacking that planet. They can just fly past your fleet until they get to the system they are targetting, so managing your fleet well = win.  Other than that, you simply do what all other space sim type games do. upgrade your planets, do research, build ships to fight other systems. But it isn't super hard, kind of boring after a while once you learn the few basic things to do (expand fast, build up fleet fast, focus more on trade/research than system defenses).Plus there isn't any campaign. Just pick a map and play. Again, boring after you figure out how easy it is to beat opponents with a big fleet. Of all the space games, i'd say the best thing about this one is the real time fleet fighting, much better system than many of the few turn-based fighting that occurs with other games.			"

												One of the best strategy games i've ever played. This game makes me feel a player feel like a real space general or something to that effect. You will be in command of hundreds of space crafts, can be the same type or different types. The key to victory can be due to resources, most efficient science, cultural influence or just plain firepower.The only downside for me is that there is no campaign mode. The lore presented is intriguing and i believe should have been delivered in a story mode. A must buy for strategy fans (space). "

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a comprehensive science fiction fleet simulation. You take the role of the miltary commander (or everything commander honestly) and you make ships that you can send to blow up other ships (or you could send ships to be diplomatic but that's boring). It's your duty to mke sure that your faction beats all the other factions in bloody space RTS warfare (pew pew).Pros:- lots of ship variety- highly customizable scenarios- factions don't lock you into a specific playstyle- lore is cool I guess- pew pew laser fights that look really cool- lots of graphics options- UI is pretty good- some cool mods out there (not on Steam)- each faction has a superweapon- a SUPERWEAPONCons:- voice lines can get a little repetitive- unforgiving on some difficulties- game can end up having a LOT of ships at once on screen (be prepared for lag)- resource management can get tedious- the explosions for smaller ships kinda suck- diplomacy system kinda sucks- mods can come from some pretty sketchy looking sites (be careful)Overall, it's a good RTS if you like shooting first and asking questions later.

												Lots of boat ships with pew pews and sometimes people win by saying, ""Hey let's be friends!"" but there's lots of planets for you to name weird things and ships with rather gross sounding names as well. If you want to pew pew more you can research it in the big guns panel. It takes place in a space with christmas lights in the middle and when you tell your boats to move the paddlers get lazy and it takes a while to get to the fight. The game features yar har fiddle dee dees as well that you can pay with honeycombs to go and be jerks to your enemies while you make more breadboxes and boat ships. The game has 3 different types of man peoples they are all different but kinda the same. Some like the fight, and some like to drink wine, and one does a bit of both. This is a good game to bring to your friends so you can play this for 8 hours instead of cards against humans. In the new expansion pecks there are huge boat ships that don't sink like the titanic, they are really strong and pew pew more than normal boats, each type of peoples get 2 to choose from. If your christmas ordaments get under attack by the boats you can buy these duplo blocks with guns to defense but they can cost you a bit of honeycomb and aren't the best defense against large pewpewmadas. The best way to win is build giant houses in enemy christmas ordament range to mess with them and make them feel like they aren't people before bringing your pewpews to the fight. And this is signs of a somber elephant Ripe onion, play this game because it's pretty good!			"

												One of the greatest 4X RTS games of all time. If you like space, spaceships, epic space battles, and empire management, then this game is for you. I played the original before it was on Steam (have the retail box here) and Rebellion basically combines the basic game with all released expansions; the end result is an amazing game extended with more awesomeness.+ The graphics are beautiful, you can freely zoom from a scale showing the entire solar system down to a single ship, the detail is amazing and space and especially the battles look incredible+ The expansion packs have added a lot, giving more defensive options, more offensive options, and more diplomatic options+ You can make custom maps and many maps have random elements for which planets or anomalies appear where, making for great replay value+ Full mod support+ The scale of this game is amazing+ The interface holds up really well and makes managing large empires easy- The game can be very performance demanding, especially as games drag on and everyone fields fleets of hundreds of ships, paired with hundreds of trade ships- you get the idea- Even though diplomatic options have been expanded, it's still more action focused in general- The three (six) factions all play fairly similar, they are about as different as Nod and GDI in C&C- No campaign, this game is focused on skirmish matches both in Single- and Multiplayer			"

												Something always draws me back to this game. Dumped over 300hrs into it now. Fantastic options for modding. DLC is good value for money.Make sure to pick up the ""Enhanced 4X"" and the ""Star Trek : Armada 3"" mod. Both are enjoyable conversions.			"

												Takes long time to play, awesome anyway. Lacking multiplayer support - no matchmaking - unless you buy this with multiple friends and actually plan the game ahead, you don't have a decent chance at playing something bigger than 2 v 2 and even that is rare.			"

												Worth every penny. At first glance it might seem like a alot, but given some time you will learn what to research and build first and what not to. After you learn the base game, there are some great Star Trek and Star Wars mods that really change it up nicely. Along with numerous others mods that do as well.I hope to see a sequel to this game eventually, as there is a lot of room for potential once they move to a 64-bit engine.9/10 - One of the best Real Time Strategy Games out there.Why this gets a 9/10 as opposed to a 10/10 is because there is unfortunately no story line campaign to help build interest in learning and playing this game. But I will only afford it a -1, because the game mechanics are solid through out. So, If you ever see this and all of its DLC on sale, you might as well pick it up and try this out, especially if you have an interest in the following big name franchises. Star Wars, Star Trek and Halo. Space Battles won't be any better than this. Until DirectX 12 64-bit engine and making pieces of ships come off, shot after shot until the hull implodes or explodes. And also, No, you don't need the DLC you play any of the mods, etc, most of them are all designed to work with or without the different dlcs enabled/disabled.			"

Posted: August 5, 2016
												I bought this game 4 days ago, I have already played it 60 hours...I have to say a lot of things in this game is awesome and that its a great game... but I can't recommended because it becomes an unplayable lag fest half way through every singleplayer match due to the outdated game engine because its a 32 bit engine that is not multithreaded. Out of those 60 hours I played, probably 50 hours of it was just because the game lags to the point where the game plays at less than 1/5 of the ordinary speed. And trust me on this, it isn't my hardware specs since my current rig is up there on the high end charts with an i7-4790K processor, R9-390 gpu, 16  GB of RAM. The vanilla game doesn't even use more than 1 GB of RAM, and it doesn't even make my GPU break a sweat since its just sitting their at its base clock of 350 mHz. Now usually I don't give negative reviews on games simply because they lag due to not being multithreaded (e.g. Total War Series), but the second thing that really irked me was how unbelievably dumb the AI is in this game. As if the lag wasn't bad enough, it just pisses you off even more when you watch the AI just constantly parading their ships back and forth, phase jumping between Solar Systems with over like 1000 ships and never actually fight each other due to their path finding and retreat logic.Not to mention I am the tech savy type of player, where I like to mod my games. And I don't mean I just go onto the steamworkshop or Moddb or the Nexus to download other peoples mods and call it a day. I mean I actually mod the game myself by tinkering with the files... and I got say too many damn things are hardcoded in this game. So while the modding community for this game is a lot better and friendlier than other games like Crusaders Kings 2 and Total War series, there is just so many basic things that they can't do. For instance do you want to build more than one Titan (the end game super ship for every faction)? Well to bad its hardcoded to be limited to 1 ship through ordinary means of building it. Do you want to change the priority of which ships the AI builds to reduce their Carrier spam that causes the game to lag so badly? Well to bad its hardcoded also, and there is no way to simply limit what they build since the game engine requires them to build every type of ship otherwise it crashes. There is no way to limit what they build without creating a specially made factions by duplicating the entire normal faction and removing certain ships from those factions altogether... because there is no way to change the AI's ship building priority weight scaling value.Not to mention the last  minor thing that bothers me in this game is that you can chose what faction the AI plays as, you can chose their faction color, their empire symbol, their play style, their difficulty levels... but you can't manually chose which of the 8 player portrait sets they use... you can cycle through them if you just constantly disable and enable their player slots, but even then the AI can't use the same portrait set as another player slot until 8 of them have been used. Which is annoying because how the portraits are set up is that there is 3 pictures per set, 1 for each race in every set. And there are 8 of these sets... but even when you play a different race from the AI, the AI can't use that portrait set even though you're not even using the same portrait.So in conclusion, the sound design, and graphics in this game is amazing. The concept and game mechanic wise its also great. But I wouldn't recommend this game due to the fact that the game engine is outdated and a poor match for game of this grand scale, which makes the game lag to the point where its unplayable. The AI is frustratingly Dead on Arrival if you play a map that has more than one solar system due to the fact that they will just keep phase jumping back and forth between stars unable to carrying out any actual cross system war. So due to the fact that the AI can't handle cross solar system fighting, you will never really be able to play any grand galactic empire building matches that involves more than 1 solar system. Though I am pretty sure you wouldn't want to anyways due to how badly the game lags. If you're planning to get this game for its modding value... sadly there isn't much to it beyond reskinning ships, planets, and buildings. Changing some of their basic stats and changing up some of their abilities... otherwise everything else is hardcoded. I was wondering why this game didn't have a steamworkshop when I first got the game... and the answer to that is because the game wasn't designed to be modder friendly, and that mod support was an after thought to the developers. So yeah there is still some great mods for this game, but at their core they are still going to be plagued with the problems I stated above, which is sad since I know how much effort and patience all those other modders put into their mods.

												The game itself is great - IF IT RUNS.But it has so many bugs and crashes so often that you will undoubtedly change the settings file so that the autosave time is between 30 and 60 seconds, as the game crashes at least once every 5-20 minutes.Really ridiculous - especially in single player (local) gaming mode.At least you can load multiplayer games properly if you simply copy the savegame file to all others, since it regularly happens that the savegame is not saved on all players and participants of the multiplayer game.(However - opposed to Endless Legends, the game can actually load multiplayer properly 100% IF everyone has the same savegame file.)Of course you can only call it a medium sized 4X when compared to epic and complex (as well as just as badly written) games like Endless Legends.Also note that you need at least the mod for deactivating ""experimental weapons"" if you play against the AI as it is annoying to constantly have to rebuild the planets, since the AI just spams thos weapons (google it).So considering that it has a lot less to offer than Endless Legends I can only recommend it to people who know their way around settings files and want a real-time strategy 4X for a change, since only round-based 4X can get boring after a while.In a rating I would give Sins of a Solar Empire 3 of 5 points since the bugs are really destroying a lot of the game atmosphere and feeling and are happening every time you play a game - but at least it is possible to play it and end all games (as opposed to Endless Legends).

												over 2oo hours should tell how much I enjoy this game. It is pleasing to see an entire enemy fleet try to launch an all out assault on one of your most defended fortressworlds with your entire fleet stationed in orbit and watch as you and your enemy lay waste to one another. The fear when your capital ships begin to fall and your flagship titan heavily damaged but you come out triumphant. with your victory you launch your counter attack and watch world after world fall under your battlefleet, conquering and expanding as you push deeper into your enemies empire. They surrender yet another challenges you for the right of the sector, so you press on.best for free for alls since nearly every time my ally is pratically useless, everyone always seems to gang up on them before one another. Its always a struggle on huge maps with over a hundred worlds in the webbing of jump lanes as your fleet could be cut off from one end of your empire( unless being the Vasari with phase stabilizers), resting pure faith that the border defences can hold any invaders as you try to break through enemy lines and face thier fleets on the other end of the map.  games can take hours or in a few cases half a day for larger maps. but seeing the victory sign in the end and seeing the stats of your domination is a welcoming feel.The Rebel TEC faction is my favorite as thier extreme xenophobic and hostile actions are purely intended for an offensive assault, they mock diplomacy except with other rebels or pirates. I mean would you be hostile against everyone else after 3 decades of constant warfare, rebellion, and failed diplomacy? wouldn't you just want to tableflip and yell 'thats it, everyone dies!""? I love thier titan flagship as it barges through entire fleets singlehandedly, bristling with gauss cannons and a massive railgun sniping captial ships and starbases from afar.			"

												This game is probably one of the few reasons I still love and trust the developer Stardock Studios. As a longtime Homeworld fan, this game was a lovely jaunt into a lovely mix between Civ 5's grand scale and planning and Homeworld 2's spaceship combat. I flat out adore this game. Its an excellent epic RTS game with a fantastic amount of depth, strategy, and sheer gaw dropping moments geared into it. Small space scouting and colonization leads to small skirmishes, which depending on how you play can lead to dozens of different outcomes - from skirmishes, to cold wars, to flat out epic space fleet battles, to interplanatary bombardments. Would recommend to anyone with a mind for strategy and eyeballs.			"

												So far from what I've seen this is just anothe RTS. If your into RTS you may like it. If your looking for a little deeper game play then you probably will not. I'm glad I got it on sale. Another game that will be put on yhe side line. I tryed to study this game before I bought it. I read the reveiws, read the forums. It's listed under deplomace game tag. Most of it is not true. If your looking for Command & Conqure great, but if your looking for more like Civilization forget it. I have found a couple of RTS games I like, But no matter what they say, I will stick to Turn Based Games.I'm marking it as Recommend because it is not a bad game. But if your like me then I would not recommend it. I will try a bigger map and see if it's any better but I don't think it will be. If I find it is better with bigger maps or more game play I will edit this. But if you get it make sure it's on sale.			"

												Lots of boat ships with pew pews and sometimes people win by saying, ""Hey let's be friends!"" but there's lots of planets for you to name weird things and ships with rather gross sounding names as well. If you want to pew pew more you can research it in the big guns panel. It takes place in a space with christmas lights in the middle and when you tell your boats to move the paddlers get lazy and it takes a while to get to the fight. The game features yar har fiddle dee dees as well that you can pay with honeycombs to go and be jerks to your enemies while you make more breadboxes and boat ships. The game has 3 different types of man peoples they are all different but kinda the same. Some like the fight, and some like to drink wine, and one does a bit of both. This is a good game to bring to your friends so you can play this for 8 hours instead of cards against humans. In the new expansion pecks there are huge boat ships that don't sink like the titanic, they are really strong and pew pew more than normal boats, each type of peoples get 2 to choose from. If your christmas ordaments get under attack by the boats you can buy these duplo blocks with guns to defense but they can cost you a bit of honeycomb and aren't the best defense against large pewpewmadas. The best way to win is build giant houses in enemy christmas ordament range to mess with them and make them feel like they aren't people before bringing your pewpews to the fight. And this is signs of a somber elephant Ripe onion, play this game because it's pretty good!			"

												This game has been out for several years now and the fact that it still gets content upgrades (although the last few were somewhat less exciting DLCs) shows that is staying power. And honestly it's not coming from nowhere. It is probably one of the best space themed RTS games that you can get currently and the graphics, while a little dated, are still serving their purpose by giving you lots of beamy and exploding goodness when it comes to space battles. What however probably speaks the most for why this game is successfull is it's excellent user interface. All the information you require is easily accessible with the click of a button, if it's not displayed on screen right away. There is no rummaging through submenus and other distracting stuff to find out how many ressources are produced in which colony. The three different factions, which with the addon Rebellion got further split up into Loyalist and Rebel factions also provide many different approaches at how to play the game as each faction has their specialities. Want to have staunch unmoving defenders that will be even harder to remove from a system than cancer? Go with the TEC loyalists. Want a seemingly endless horde of♥♥♥♥♥♥cheap units to drown your enemies in AND be a pirate on top of that? Go with the TEC rebels, and that are just two sides of one race you can play.If you want a space themed RTS with huge space battles, then this is the game to go for.			"

												The latest version of the franchise. It improves graphics and mechanics, while adding new ships, technologies, and planet upgrades. its a real-time, 4 dimensional, space strategy game.you capture planets, and gather resources, while building a fleet to defend your territory and making or breaking alliances with the other factions through diplomacy. you can win a diplomatic victory if you get enough points, which only happens if you keep the right factions happy and attack the otherrs. now planets can specialize, which is  a great addition to a game that needed a focus on the planets. now you can focus a planet on industrial or social production, that gives bonuses to ship production and trade or culture (which sacrifices the other two). this lets you boost production at the heart of your empire while spreading culture at the fringes fast enough to push out others. there are also new types of planets that tend to have increased resources, for example a greenhouse world will have a lot of metal asteroids that let you extract metal faster than other planets.then there are the new ships the titan and the shriken corvettes (of the terran players) add a new, somewhat irritating element. if you are caught without a titan, and a small fleet, the game is over, they are massive ships with huge health and weapons abilities that have to be researched first and are kind of expensive (each faction has its version). the rebel and loyalist forces now have differing abilities that give bonues to various aspects of gameplay.

												An awesome slow paced RTS in 4X style that will keep you entertained for hours. Its an older game (2008) but still has a lot of staying power that keeps the fans coming back for more.Downside is that its engine is a bit out of date so going full bore (mega map with all the trimmings) can make the game a little sluggish.

												If your planning on buying this game be sure to clear your schedule, one match will take quite sometime. But the game is very fun you start off owning a planet and must expand your empire through multiple solar systems fighting enemy's along the way. You can use diplomacy, cunning, and military to win. there is no campaign for this game only the type of mode i was just explaining previously. In this game there are three factions and each has a loyalist and rebel version both with different ships and abilty's. Another great thing about this game is you can get great mods such as sins of the prophet which is a halo mod. I would not suggest buying this game at the 40$ retail, wait till its on sale for around 20$.			"

												I bought Rebellion eventuality. I'm not planning do it ever.But I like that game from first minutes.I tried many space strategies before. But they was... not what I'm looking.Too hard (not because they really hard. because it's hard to understand them), too overwhelmed - economy, interface, races. Where you need to press 10 buttons to move your fleet.Here everything easy - here your fleet, here your structures. Go! But game not become simple. You still need to think, planning, tactic. And what a beautiful space here! Last time I saw such beautiful space was Haegemonia: Legions of Iron (2002) But that game was really overwhelmed.So if you want to try really good space strategy, then Sins of a Solar Empire®: Rebellion your choice.

												Wanted the game for a while now.Couldn't afford it with the 40 dollar asking price.I pirated it. I know I'm a filthy pirate :c I just really wanted to play this game.Saw that it was on sale for 20$ including all dlc and sound track.Had 20$ in my steam wallet.Noticed the updated the game a bit since my filthy version. Little things like bigger/competitive maps.At first I couldn't find a game in multiplayer but learned that it was because it was only 11 o' clock on a friday.Was really surprised this game even had people playing online.People actually care for the game to, when everyone gets into one lobby they all talk about what they should keep on and off such as locked teams, pirates, random events, etc....Recently learned they support mods.I still think 40$ is still a bit much of an asking price, and honestly the dlc is kind of a rip off if it's not on sale.In my opinion it should be 30$ and you should only buy the dlc when it's on sale.Worth my 20$, wouldn't have minded spending a bit more on it though.8/10 One of my top five games.

												This game is appealing, I had SOME fun with it. The problem is almost no one plays this game online, and the single player AI is way too powerful. As in I am only just starting my fleet up when im getting hit by their titan, 2 capitals, 15 cruisers, and 5 frigates. I cannot enjoy myself because I cannot get anyone else interested in this game to play it with me, and online is incredibly meh. And as I have described single player is right out. So I want to like this game, I really do. I am a big fan of fleet v fleet games, and the graphics in this one are really nice. But the gameplay is severely lacking. I start every session TRYING to enjoy myself, and I always come out dejected and angry. Sorry, but I have to say I wouldn't reccomend this.			"

												Been A Wile Since I Played, Came Back To A Launcher For A Launcher..... Always A Bad SignDo your engineers really have nothing to do?  I do not care about unsolicited SD news, ads or any other crap forced onto my screen.  I do care that SD has forced something on my machine without any heads up about what the install would do.How about leaving well enough alone and putting your team to work on a real project?Crap like this is usually a bad sign from  the publisher.Seems that SD takes great umbrage calling an application that I did not ask for or give permission to be on my system and force advertisements onto my screen before a product I bought outright will launch (much like the win 10 sneak installs got labeled by various security software producers)..... Malware.  So since this extra totally not asked for install that added an extra layer of unwanted ads and unwanted news (not even going to hypothesize about data collection) is totally not-malware, really and truly.To prevent the totally not-malware launcher from launching the launcher from the launcher  copy the totally not-malware launcher .exe file and the  SoaSE  .exe file  (or rename them as you see fit).  Then delete or rename the totally not-malware .exe file to something like notamalwareinstall.exe or whatever you like, then rename the SoaSE .exe file to the original totally not-malware launcher file name.

												  Well, I'm reviewing now. I will say that while I would recommend the game, yeah, it is very difficult to play.- The computer opponents will sometimes be rendered toothless, by creating no armies on Normal difficulty. - The lack of a workshop is REALLY surprising for a game like this, Modding for this game on steam would INFINITELY make the game more playable and fun, and want to sink more hours into the game. However, as it stands, it is only the same strategy, over and over again, on the AI. I guess it just boils down to poor AI, it's either too easy or too hard, longer matches do not provide a fuller experience, and I suspect multiplayer to be as caustic as Starcraft's. For the amount fo time I have played and already getting bored, I must say that as of Feb. 1, 2016, this game is NOT worth $40.			"

												Bottome line up front: 8.5/10 game, tons of fun. However I do not recommend purchasing Sins on Steam. The Steam verison is buggy and crashes randomly. Purchase Sins from another third-party vendor, or directly from the developer / publisher.I came across Sins while I was deployed to the middle east, a buddy of mine gave me a pirated copy. I immensely enjoy this game, and I put countless hours into it when I was off-duty. If I had to guess I'd say I played around 8-900 hours over 9 months.I never had any problems with the game, except for the mulitplayer not working due to it being a pirated copy. It crashed around 7-8 times over 9 months, and most of those were when I was intentionally pushing the game and my computer to their limits. Whether it was single player, LAN, small pre-made maps or huge custom ones, the game worked as it should. I would notice some issues with frame rate late-game, when there would be hundreds of ships on the screen during battles, but that's likely my computer reaching it's upper limits and not any issue with the game engine.I recently decided to buy Sins in order to support the developers for making a game I have so thoroughly enjoyed. I Downloaded and installed the game, launched it, and the steam bootstrapper kept crashing and rebooting. I didn't restart my computer before attempting to launch the game, and yes I know you should, but I've never had a problem with running a steam game after installing it without restarting. That was the first sign of something being wrong.I restarted, and that fixed the issue. I get into my first match, a 1v1 on the Gemini medium map, and the game randomly crashes around 20 minutes in. I relaunched and got into another game, this time a 2v2v2 on a huge multi star comp map, and it crashed again at around 90 minutes.I can count on my hands how many times the pirated copy crashed, over the hundreds of matches I played. The official copy of the game from steam crashed twice in a row in the first two matches. And I bet you my next paycheck it will crash again the next match I play.A pirated copy of the game is more stable than the steam release. Absolutely pathetic, Valve.Edit: I have since played 6 more matches, two of which crashed. So Steam Sins is 4 for 8, or 50% failure rate. Going to try reinstalling to see if that fixes the issue for me. Revised some portions of this review, as I wrote this while slightly intoxicated.			"

												Where can I even start with this game.......so put yourself in my shoes. A veteran total war player looking to find new RTS games to get away from the dying series that I spent years getting good at. Leaving behind, my friends I'd made, and achievements, to find a new, and refreshing game to take my mind off, if even in a small way. Upon my travels, I venture upon this game......the artwork looks cool, the screenshots look amazing, the description looks epic........but then my eyes wander down to the price tag. For the rather steep price of 39.99.....I can be a galactic tyrant vying for control of the galaxy. I think long and hard on the issue......do I really wanna go back to total war? After some thought, I decide to take a chance....I pay up, and to my hardrive, this magnificant software is installed. I enter the game, and instantly I see promise with a great sound track and breathtaking visuals. I feel so humbled by the new game that has surrounded me in it's atmosphere, and I meekly wander over to the tutorials, where I learn the way of the galactic conquerer. Then I start up a real game, and after only a few adreneline soaked engagements, I am thrilled to know that my money was spent wisely and have no regrets on the risk that I took to experience this game. Ever since that fateful day, this game has been my therepist.....calming my mind with it's awesome gameplay whenever I am stressed. I love this game and have no doubt that anyone with the slightest fanboyism for sci fi and strategy will love this too. I highly recommend this game if you are looking at it's page, wondering the same way I wondered whether or not to take that risk.			"

												What to say?This game depends on what you paid for it.The original game is meh. Complete, in that all elements are present, but meh.Now, the Star Trek Armada III mod makes the game shine. Except in one area, which I'll touch on shortly.The STA3 mod is fantastic, in fact it's just about the best mod for any game I've ever come across. Whereas the original game was meh, the STA3 makes it shine. Most elements are improved, and in fact the mod is more professional than the original game, IMHO.Of course the one thing that modders can't really do, most times, is alter code. And that's the glaring problem for the meh original game and the brilliant STA3 mod.I've played almost 50 hours on this game, and at least the last 20 have been a struggle.The game is boring.Boring. Once you've explored it, that's it.  I'm used to slow burns playing 4X games, and while this is an RTS game with 4X elements, I'd rather play SEV at 1/4 impulse power than this game, despite the massive difference in graphics between the two.So to recommend or not? Again, depends on what you paid.I got the game at 75% off, so I've got my money's worth. If I'd paid full freight I wouldn't have been happy. So, as the game is mostly full price, no recommendation.  But if you can get it on sale, do it.			"

												This is a solid game that I would recommend buying on sale if you aren't really dedicated to the genre and have only a slight interest in it. My main complaint is how OP titans are when they get to lvl 8 I believe. I have played this online and had my entire fleet + lvl 3 or 4 titan killed by a single players high level titan. I've seen a couple mp games where the players just get titans and send them to the enemies homebase, ignoring all the worlds inbetween. Really feels cheap in an other wise fun game. I can't recommend this solely because of that, sorry.Additionally, the game will choke up and occasionally crash if you have a large amount of ships in a gravity well.			"

												NOTE: I can't claim to have played this to any meaningful depth. Actually I've only slogged through the tutorials and played half of an AI game. Now then:This is an excellent GAME ENGINE just begging for an actual GAME to be written in it. All the prerequisites are in place: well-balanced races, deep technology tree, diverse win conditions, diplomacy and culture. Which makes it a 4X game, but even better, because it's also a RTS. With SPACE BATTLES! There's even a background story presented in a short movie to go with, and while it's mostly standard fare, it would allow for many, many directions. Hell, a good writer could turn it into a five-season sci-fi TV show.Elsewhere I read that the fans have been bugging Ironclad for a campaign practically since the game came out, and they refuse to do one, claiming that the engine won't support the necessary coding. Excuses, excuses. This game needs a campaign to give it direction. To give the player purpose, to make them part of something greater, to have them work towards something they care about. Without that, all we can do is make them up in our heads. Or keep the story and game separate: think tabletop RPGs, but with the story elements done in text outside the game, and the battles inside. And even there this engine doesn't really deliver: you can't create scenarios that would support it, nor can you for example fix the technological level or starting planets and units of a player or AI opponent. Which means it's from scratch every time.If it did have a campaign, I'd probably waste innumerable hours on it, I love my epic hard sci-fi, and the feel is certainly there. But there's no game here. Just an engine.			"

												Gameplay-wise Sins of a Solar Empire is great (SciFi strategy) and I had lots of hours of fun playing it. The thing that really annoys me about it is that Stardock decided that you need another layer of DRM on it after steam. It comes in the form of a stardock account that has to be created with your email adress and you have to remember it every time you reinstall the game. I am ok with steam because it is a one-for-all account which minimises the hassle of dealing with log-ins and passwords. Thats why this is bothering me so much. Just now when I decided to play another round after a while, the game forced me to log in with the stardock account which password I have long forgotten and I dont want to invest more time to create a new one or restore the old one. If every company did stupid things like these, playing your games would become really annoying. The game itself is good, but I paid for it and I dont want additional hassle. I dont care if Stardock wants to turn their games into facebook, but as long as they add such unnecessary inconvenience, I wont buy another game from them again.			"

I give it a thumbs down not because it was a bad game, but because I wouldn't suggest anyone spend their money on this game in it's state.			"

												Who knows if this will get read or not, but I  hope I can provide a word of warning. Sins of a Solar Empire was one of the first games that made me want a gaming computer when it first came out in 2008. Lacking the funds, I was stuck with low-end graphics and abysmal load times. Its been 8 years since I've played the game, and seeing it on sale, I grabbed it for some quick nostalgia. The game runs fine. Any computer from the last 3 years should handle it with zero problems. Technically, its almost flawless, completely delivering on the promise of full scale immersion in a 4x game, zooming effortlessly between multiple star systems down to the individual starfighter. The graphics are decently done, and large-scale battles have the potential to be impressive and pretty, if not awe-inspiring. Thats about where the positives end. My major complaints with this game is that the amount of effort that was put into certain areas of the game is severly lopsided. The tech tree is the biggest transgressor, with tiny, incrimental techs that require constant micromanaging to ensure that you don't get caught woefully behind. When trying to construct a unit or building that you don't have the tech for, it takes many frustrating minutes (ESPECIALLY with a new civilzation) to figure out which tree it is under, and then locate the correct icon. The tech interface is tiny and wastes a lot of space. In fact, nearly every interface is a mess. From simply having to click through each and civilzation to see which are defeated and which are active (maybe a red <DEFEATED> next to their title would help..?"", to confusing and unexplained treaty organization, it seems that information is deliberately hidden. Massive amounts of work apparently went into the detailed sidebar which I have never looked at even once while playing. With each of the available civs having completely different icons, names, and abilities for buildings, and totally different sets of units, there is a steep learning curve to just understanding what each of them DO. Upgrading planets is boring and repetitive. The game punished you for expanding, and it takes a lot of time to make new planets worth the investment. So all of this takes MASSIVE amounts of time to learn, and to balance effectively. Which would be fine, except that none of it is fun or rewarding. Its the most frustrating part of the game, but it requires huge amounts of time. I know what you're thinking, 'dude, thisi s a 4x game, micromanaging is kind of a given' Which is true on its face, and for any other game, I'd agree. But its sooo boring. And unrewarding. And this is where Sins breaks down, because all of this should have some kind of payoff, namely in space battles. Battles are basically just jump your ships in, have them attack the largest ships in order... they just sit there. It would be amazing to divide your fleet into squadrons, have flanking options, order all of my bombers to prioritize carriers or support ships first... but no. You have to do each thing manually, and again, if you haven't played the other civs, its IMPOSSIBLE to tell what ships do what. I can't recommend this game. Its just not fun.  "

												A great all round startegy game with diversity and as far as most strategy games go a pretty daamn good eco system. Mod support is also great with hundreds of great mods around all of which easy to install using the ingame mod feature and best of all, if one of your friends has a DLC, you all get it.Only cons I can think of are the real lack of faction diversity with only 6 playable factions but on the flip side of that all the factions are well balanced and play well.

												I have played 14 hours of this game and only 14 hours because shortly after that the content broke for me. I have an apprently unresolvable error which appeared out of nowhere. I've even sent in tickets to Stardock on multiple occasions and recieved the same generic answers that didn't work in the first place. After having to techs run me through the FAQ (nothing dynamic about there assistance at all) I got fed up with the whole thing. After three weeks without any resolution and not being able to refund the content (which I tired roughly a week after purchase, sadly for me i'd played more than 10 hours). While the game was marginally enjoyable, it wasn't much of a step up from Trinity in any regard. But what really makes me not reommcend this is the customer service from Stardock. IF you are one of the unfortunate people who runs into an error that can't be resolved via web page directions, be prepared to wait days just to get more than two responses to a support ticket and don't expect anything you didn't already know from reading it.

												A slow paced game with a bit of a learning curve, but the tutorials are decent enough to get you started. There is a lot of strategic depth to this game and the AI is a challenge. It involves very long-term planning. Decisions you make early in the game will have long-lasting effects later on, and things generally don't change very quickly. It's a game which I think does not have nearly the amount of popularity that it deserves.			"

												When I first bought this game the voice acting really annoyed me.  There are still elements in the voice acting I can't stand.  For example, the sound of water sucked through a straw doesn't count as good sound effects.  It just sounds dumb.  Also the sound of THE SAME voice actor over and over again for different parts, or some of the ridiculous alien monster sounds.I hated it so much that I actually wrote a script to copy those sounds out to be replaced by sounds that were neutral.----- ENOUGH RANTING ALREADY -----That said, there is also some good voice acting, like ""I hope this isn't another suicide mission!"" and when a new colony is founded ""A new colony has been founded"" and there's some dramatic orchestral music.  ""The price on our heads has increased!""  Those I really like, and the more I play the more it grows on me.The gameplay is simplistic - all the ships do whatever it is they do, and there are minimal choices for changing how they work.  And the capital ships have level caps (maybe that's fixed in some mods).There are a number of mods which I still have to try.What I like about this game: it goes pretty fast.  Unlike SotS or Star Ruler or GalCiv - this feels like it plays much faster.  Maybe I'm hallucinating too.  The tech tree is certainly much smaller than those other games - so the whole game feels smaller.So for a ""quick space game 4x"" this is one I find myself going back to.			"

												This game nearly ruined my relationship! In the best way possible though as it is so addictive and engaging. There are only three races to choose from (6 if you count the rebels) but they all have such a well developed back story, and each race has different tactical challenges and opportunities. The space battles are nothing short of epic and the 'God like' abililty to zoom in for a close up of your fleet slugging it out with the enemy is miles better than any sci-fi space movie I've seen. The difficulty levels are steep as you progress through them and you will have to think quickly and tactically at a moments notice to stay competive on the higher levels, but it is ultimately a very satisfying feeling once you master it.The only real drawback to this game is that there is no campaign mode, which would have been nice, and a couple of extra races just to add a little more diversity would have been welcome too. I also recommend spending some time playing through the tutorials just to get a good grasp of the game, as there is a lot to take in initially, which I find is common with similar games to Sins.Overall, I highly recommend this game to fans of strategy and 4x games, you will not be disappointed....

												This game is GREAT. It is so addictive, starting from scratch with your empire with one planet, gradually working your way into the solar system and into other galaxies with MASSSIVE fleets of ships. Also there is an upcoming mod for this game which will be EPIC, look it up: Star Wars Ascendancy on ModDB. That mod alone would make getting this game worth it, but this game is great by itself. One of my favorite RTS's in recent years.			"

												That RTS game you have been looking for forever.Be sure to grab some friends or make some friends who own it already as Really, if your friend is not playing this he is more than likely waiting for somebody to play with!In Single-player the AI is good but as you may know, not like any person and you can't say ""HA HA!  Look at your Titan BURN!""As far as ship combat, it may seem slow, and for the most part it's true but micromanaging is non-essential and there are better things to devote your time to.10/10 the best RTS game I have played.  Would be even better if they offered Non-steam versions for LAN parties!A bit expensive for $40 but I got the boxed edition for $20 and I must say, it was the nicest box I have ever had, well worth the wait.  Or you could wait for a 75% sale which happens almost every steam sale time!			"

												Awesome Game.It will have a long life time as it is moddable, and a nice game to relax and play, or panic as you try to save your empire.Great selection of ships, not to much in the way of this kills this, then this kills this, but not this.Dowsides in My opnion, none.No campaing, but that lets me make my own story.I can be trying to save civilian ships from a all consuming alien force as I try to research my titan as a final end the war. Or, im running from them in a rag tag fleet of ships, slowly losing a battle on ship at a time.Has a slight learning curve, and the game can be unforgiving at times, but its worth it. Researching is awesome, as is attacking the merchant cargo ships to destroy that small advantage some one else has. Or making a alliance, just to backstab your ally because they have a weak fleet.I highly recomment this game, its great fun, and is great for making up your own story. Feel free to add me to play a few rounds (or 1, as the game takes long to complete, but keeps you excited all the way.)			"

												One of the more fun current generation RTS games.Sufferes from balance issues when you actually good at it, so either have to live with this, or accept that you'll ban certain tatics/ships.If a fight goes on long enough you'll run into extreme performance issues when you have ~2000+ ship fights (total ships), its quiet annoying, but far superior to a lot of older RTS games just because for the visuals and briing something slightly different to the RTS genre.

												I was sceptical. I play such games only alone against AI or maybe coop against AI if one of my friends plays such a game. Without a story driven campaign it was some kind of risk for me to buy this game.But if you look at my playtime you can see that i enjoyed this game anyway. I love the big space battles against a good AI. With space stations and the Titans there are explosions everywhere. But that reveals the only big drawback of this game. The outdated engine. With big fleet battles going on and having many AI oponents the game needs a very good CPU with much power per single core because it will only use one core.But besides of this technical drawback i have much fun watching 2 big fleets battling each other, micro manage the special powers of my starship and after the fight extend my Solar Empire. And defend it at the other side of the empire one minute later. The research of the updates and the diplomacy are the icing of the cake.And dont forget the good mods out there. First of all i have much fun with the ""enhanced 4x mod"". Great work.			"

												This game came out in 2008. You had to use Stardocks ""steam like"" hub to play it. Worth it. Rebellion was an expantion pack. Worth it. Now it's on steam and you could link your origonal copies to steam. Worth it.It comes with all three origonal expansions. Worth it. Oh look it now has three more DLC stuff. Worth it. I can't play as a scruffy looking nerf herder. . . . Deal breaker. ... I can mod it. Worth it.  "

												The Base format of this game alone will provide quite a few hours of fun! If you can get your friends to play with you it becomes an even grander experience! Games can last for extremely long times and develop its own history. Periods of war and peace along with large defensive fronts and subtle strikes against production planets. If you ever get bored with the original game the amount of modding content available on the web is crazy. From Star wars to a remake of Homeworld. You can find just about anything. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in 4x Strategy. However be warned this game does have a high learning curve and the scale of war can get quite overwhelming!			"

												That RTS game you have been looking for forever.Be sure to grab some friends or make some friends who own it already as Really, if your friend is not playing this he is more than likely waiting for somebody to play with!In Single-player the AI is good but as you may know, not like any person and you can't say ""HA HA!  Look at your Titan BURN!""As far as ship combat, it may seem slow, and for the most part it's true but micromanaging is non-essential and there are better things to devote your time to.10/10 the best RTS game I have played.  Would be even better if they offered Non-steam versions for LAN parties!A bit expensive for $40 but I got the boxed edition for $20 and I must say, it was the nicest box I have ever had, well worth the wait.  Or you could wait for a 75% sale which happens almost every steam sale time!			"

												GREAT GAME!. I love the concept of a game and a must buy if you like space game RTS.  What i miss about the game is kinda being able to see the action up close from a bridge and more real time approch with more action. Sadly, there is a game out there ready to be funded, which will be in a 1st person realtime and both stratergy,and shows great promise, just a like a dream game for a space game lovers!. Allthough i recomend putting your money on this,  but a 1st person RTS will blow your mind! They are just on kickstarter for a 13 more days. And is most likely not going to make it without all the support it can get.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2049430629/flagship-space-strategy-from-a-first-person-perspe "

												As a long standing fan of Sins I have always been a serious supporter of the franchise. I played trinity on disc before it went to steam. This time however I am not impressed. There isn't much in the way of special extra content here. It's a resale of an old game with a few add-ons' and no real core changes or upgrades. The addition of a new ship and each faction split was not worth the price paid. There was no innovative thought put in this game. So it saddens me to not recommend this game.Only a handful of changesSame game as originalGame has serious crash issuesTech support is terrible""like taking a childs favorite toy, wrapping it up, putting a bow on it and putting it under the Christmas tree as a new toy""			"

Posted: September 26, 2015
												So I have hap this game for about 3 years now, and recently I told my friend about that game because it was on sale. (not this sale,but the last one.) He sees it and thinks it's amazing, I tell him that it is. He gets the game and we immediately begin playing. After about 5 hours of teaching him how to play, he gets tired and leaves.Now a little bit ago I say we should play again, he is hesitant, but he agrees to anyway. We start up the game and I set everything to faster so he can play a quicker game (faster training, mining, culture.) Everything is going great for the first 10 minutes or so, until we establish first contact.Now since he is still learning, I have had to teach him up to this point and our technological advancements and colonization have been slow. Not to mention I had to help him learn how to play the Advent as I was playing the TEC. I expected that star to star jumping would be reached within 10 minutes, but they are already here. A couple scouts are not really an issue, so we continue to expand, then my friend is alof a sudden really scared because he had lost one of his colonies. I simply thought he accidentally scuttled it and he was paying attention to his (small) army fighting rebels. It wasn’t until the third colony that I went to investigate. There, I found a HUGE war party in his late colony’s system.Im freaking out and Telling him to Bring his army back to defend his home world, and that's when I notice that the same this is happening to me. With an army of that size, they must have been expanding into the other galaxies without much trouble, and now we were paying for it.About 20 minutes later, and 20 minutes of constantly defending our colonies, I have a great idea. I immediately start rushing siege frigates and my titan (the Ragnarov titan is personally my favorite, which is basically a giant rail gun, with engines and smaller guns all around it) and I tell him to do the same. Confused, he has to listen because he has no other ideas. My idea is to win by sneaking 100 siege frigates and a titan into the enemy territory, and take their home planet before they can gets troops back from the front lines (our colonies). And very soon, the pan is under way. We have literally every single ship, which added together is only a fraction of our enemies army, and send them on a straight shot for his home world. During this time, he has taken almost all of our colonies(be both have about 2 left) and they don’t seem to care that our armies have disappeared. 5 Minutes later, we make the final jump into a heavily fortified system with gauss platforms and mines EVERYWHERE and a fully upgraded starbase. Note that at this point, all of his ships are flying back to save his home planet, but by then it's too late. we destroy his defences and being bombing the planet. Sadly, about half way through destroying it, my friend lost his Capital, and his ships lost all ties with me, but is was too late. The final nuke was fired, sealing his fate as the first of his ships jumped into the system. We had won in probably the most dirty and underhanded way, but we had won.10/10 would accidentally understand the plot to Ender’s Game. "

												One of the best RTS ever!  The interface and the core gameplay have too many innovations to list here.  Graphics, sound, and music all great as well.  Balance-wise its no Starcraft II but still not bad, and the many map sizes and configurations, as well as the new victory conditions, mean the game is as long or as short as you want it.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this one.			"

												I'd say if you like games that are filled with detail and super strategic I'd say get this game. Solo gameplay I'll admit is pretty boring, but if you grab a friend or even a group of friends to set aside a day to LAN or just have a half or full-day event for the game its totally kick♥♥♥♥♥ there are small, medium, and large maps. I played a medium map with a friend against two computer players. 5 HOURS! It was intense. HUGE TIME WASTER BUT FUN!			"

												This is a great space, 4X RTS games.Its in-depth, as you have to explore the galaxies, expand your empire as the Rebels or Loyalist of the three main races, Advent, Vasari, or the TEC, exploit the resources on each planet, as well as artifacts, and exterminate all who stand in your way.Manipulate your opponents, send pirate raids after people that annoy you. Defend your empire with a range of different ships and structures, trade within your own empire, as well as others, and command your massive armadas of ships, with a slick interface, well balanced ships, and an intelligent AI, which seems like it cheats the harder you set it to.(If you watch the replays, the AI literally spawns ships in. D:<)Rebellion is a great addition to the series, and the DLC, while seeming minor, expands on the gameplay in surprising ways.11/10			"

Hours of solar empire building entertainment await you within this game. Rebellion includes the full game, the Rebellion expansion, and the previous expansions for SoaSE (Diplomacy and Entrenchment) in one convienet package. I highly recomend this game!

												Excellent space 4x game. Real-time but no need for a click-frenzy. Choosing between 'Rebel' and ""Loyalist"" versions of each of the factions is cool and customizes the faction to your own playstyle. Beautiful graphics, tons of maps to play (including random) that can get freaking huge. Pretty good diplomacy options, actually. If you play against AI, the jump from Medium to Hard is pretty large so you'll want to ease into it. Lots of tech to research and each main faction feels really unique. Hard to stop playing.			"

It is so addictive, starting from scratch with your empire with one planet, gradually working your way into the solar system and into other galaxies with MASSSIVE fleets of ships. Also there is an upcoming mod for this game which will be EPIC, look it up: Star Wars Ascendancy on ModDB. That mod alone would make getting this game worth it, but this game is great by itself.

The factions are different enough so that gameplay is new with each one and a variety of strategies needed. Even being an rts, there is no needed ""mouse rush"" to perform well in the game, and there is no workers to control. Direct input during the battles has an effect and tactics as well as strategy is needed to conquer.Definitely a very good one!			"

												This game is probably the most addicting RTS I've ever played. The massive space battles between empires is nothing short of spectacular. This game is very easy to learn. The beginning can be really slow, but once you get around 6 planets, you really boost your income, and things start picking up. A downside to this game is you kinda need friends to play with. Battling against AI by yourself kinda gets boring after a little while. But this game is really worth the money.			"

It a RTS that can explode from a 2 hour long game to a 46 hour long game, trust me I know:/ but even with that it never gets old and you cant have the same approach twice with the same results like other RTSs. Sins of a Solar Empire is one of my many favorite RTS games out there right now.			"

												Rebellion is not much of an expansion over the original sins. If you do not own sins go aheadand buy rebellion if it looks cool. Its really low on bugs, I cant recall seeing any honestly andis a lot of fun for a great many hours single player. I say rebellion isnt much of an expansionor sequal over sins, because I owned sins. Rebellion as a stand alone adds a few new ships anda modified research tree based on faction.I'm not sure you should buy this ""sequal"" if you own the original... are you a big fan?Rebellion does not fully satisfy the cravings I still hold for masters of orion 2, but it is the bestplace holder I have seen for now. (or sins, there is little difference)A fan of strategy games will enjoy sins, and it's defininately worth a look if you find it onsale! I find the idea that rebellion is a sequal offensive. There have been no changes tothe engine, almost no gameplay changes. Recommended, but not as a sequal, only if you dont presently own sins. "

												Got this game when it was first released years ago and I've loved ever since. The only problem with it was the super speed in multiplayer that you couldn't fix and the ""stop-go-stop-go"" crap in multiplayer. But now with the latest update that seams to have been fixed for the most part!Great for strtegizing the units in your fleet as you just can't simply spam one type and expect to get anywhere, unlike most other RTS that have an ""I win"" unit spam. It also has an AI that can challenge you at almost any ability level and multiplayer of 8+ players; with or without AI.			"

												I had seen the original SOSE game played by my Uncle, & thought it looked like an expanded on flash game (Space Battle) that I had been playing. I was wrong (at least as far as Rebellion is concerned)While I hate having to touch a keyboard unless it's to type, this game is not playable by mouse alone, if after I get through these very boring tutorials I can make the game appear as one dimensional as it is, that'd be great.I've heard nothing but praise for this series for years, so I'll just say that I haven't seen or gotten to any good stuff yet. If I begin to enjoy this game as I check back on it, I will update here & indicate how many hours investment I made before fun came out (IMO).			"

												This game is quite deep and fun.  Each of the races plays differently and the two factions per race both have their individual strengths and weaknesses.  The graphics are superb and do not tax your system too bad either.  There are also tons of mods for the game as well if you are looking to extend your play.  One warning though, there is no campaign to speak of.  Singleplayer plays like multiplayer but with AI, though thankfully you can customize the AI a good bit.			"

												One of the most complex and challenging games I've ever played, just keep catching myself coming back for the large space feel and wanting to test my abilities with new tactics. SINS is a game you must play if you have an overactive brain that wants something substantial to chew on it is the far opposite of Battlefield or GTA5. it has a charm to it's space exploration as you discovering interesting qualities about the planets you colonize and look at how to best tactically control your part of the galaxy. Do not play on large maps until you are familiar with it and expect EVERY game to take atleast 1.5 to 3 hours from start to finish.  Totally awesome, my only criticism is that unlike starcraft's casual and fast gameplay the tech and expansion take SO long, there is no arcade mode so to speak, you really have to invest a whole evening into it.

												SUCH A GOOD GAME! I can't get enough! It's so immersive! It's great for people who enjoy real time strategy and sci-fi. You get to choose between 3 factions, TEC(Humans), Vasari(Aliens), and The Advent(psychic zealotous human-ish). Each faction has two sub-factions, Loyalists and Rebels. Did I mention that the soundtrack is AMAZING? If you're gonna buy, I'd reccomend getting the bundle with all DLCs and the sountrack. If you can't get it all, at least get the soundtrack. It's so good. I give this game a 10/10. My only desire is for this game to have a story mode, but I understand if it can't happen. Get the game!			"

												Good UI, very balanced factions, nice difficulty (when playing against the harder AIs), splitting into rebels and loyalists opens up new playstyles.Overall a very good DLC/Sequel/Thingy to SoASE: Trinity.Eventhough i got this game gifted, and didn't buy it myself, i still recommend buying this as its just SoASE: Trinity with more features.

												What can I say about this game having spent almost 500 hours on it. Well I can start with the huge scale of the game with simply amazing gameplay mechanics and a UI thats easy to navigate. From playing defensive building huge stations and orbital defences to building massive fleets 800 ships strong to conquer your enemies. Ship deisgn is top notch with each race having their own unique look and feel. Wide selection of maps from small 1 vs 1 maps to 10 player maps. Theres maps with just one solar system and a handful of planets to maps with 20+ solar systems and hundreds of planets. (note 10 player matchs can last for 12 hours or more easily but you can save the game at any time and the game also supports a really good auto save system.) Tech tree is really good with good descriptions explaining what dose what. The games AI on the hardest difficulties will give you a run for your money. The game seems to be well balanced with counters to almost every unit in the game. The mods for the game make it even better with the likes of Star wars, Star trek Armada, Battlestar Galactica etc.  Negitives I ran into was the lack of a campaign, Slight slowdowns on the big maps (could be my rig personally) lack of lore and story, Titans can be a little over powered. Other than these small problems the game is amazing highly recommmend it 9.8/10.			"

												Do I even need to write a review? Old as♥♥♥♥♥♥ rebellion comes as complete and adds mirror rebel versions of the 3 base factions (giving you 6). Awesome game if you're into space empire building from the leaders seat, ala civ.Very enjoyable for a hardcore-but-also-simple 4X Real-Time Space fleet strategy game. Base building is done inside a planet gravity-well / static defence, planets themselves are your strongeholds. they are capped not destroyed, but similar to lowering a flag and raising a flag, or controlling points (of a galaxy map). Civ in space, in real time, with space ships and planets, pew pew!Maps can be randomly generated and theres already a spew of hand crafted offical ones, there a few map editors (I believe an official one as well) can be found online, some give you way more control then others. Players can choose from 3 base races, 2 variations of tech paths per race, giving you 6 different choices (6 different factions).Ships start as frigates, work up in class/shipsize to mega-capital ships. Capital ships are Hero units (inc. mega-capitals), and cannot ressurect XP once killed/destroyed (obv. can rebuild). Common/Regular Ships themselves come as types, some types are grunts (swordsman/rifleman feel), some are support types (Medic only abilities) some house fighters/bombers of your choice(how many of ea.), obviously there are dedicated carriers as well. Each base race has different ships avialable to them, most mirror one another to create simple balance mechanics.Credits and materials are generated based on a gather rate / time unit. Tech trees are fairly big, espeiclly at first but you learn short-cuts, what you need/don't need pretty quickly after a couple of games with your prefered race. Each race also has different tech options, with different effects- but the rebel factions (mirror factions) have slight modifications to them, mostly for different ships that are available, or a niche tech that really bennifits them and sets them apart. (I mostly play Terran (Traders) and the above written is more so the observed comparrison between the two (traditionalists and rebels))Pirates / Bounties on other players are a thing, can hinder the game, some times break it depending on how aggressive other players don't want to get♥♥♥♥♥♥on at the last moment and how much money they have, and you have, and obviously how much your both willing to rappidly 'dump' by clicking the bounty button, each click ensuring more pirates, and grow a horde (rapidly) thats seconds away from dropping on one another (You'll know exactly what I speak of first game, if you and your enemy have the cash!). The resulting mess of pirates can wipe multiple players out on the way (if in the way) as well as decimate the player who just happened to have the timer close on him (almost like musical chairs!). You CAN DISABLE PIRATES before you begin a match. And also, Pirate come from specific 'homeworld asteroids', if you conquer or wipe out these planets, the Pirates will stop coming- because they are 'much dead'.Matches can last anyware between 1 hours - 12 hours+ (I've never played more then about 12 or 13 hour matches at most). And of course matches can be saved.Depending on number of players, AI, and your system; performance in late game CAN and most likely will take a hit, at least until people start getting wiped all over the space-floor. If you get games just too big for your system though, you can quickly find that in 45 minutes of gameplay your frame rate just peters out and the matches can become 'unplayable', which can become quite suprising if you're just getting into a match  / having 'a blast'.It should be noted that there are quick gameconfig.ini to tweak different effects, max ship numbers, etc. etc., all to boost or lower your performance (If you have some sort of ""Mega-Rig"" and you just want 100X more ships then the initial release suppored, it's do-able quickly by editing your INI's, but it's mostly on you to figure out what your system can do!).Apparently theres also great mods (Starwars total conversions, etc) available as well, though I haven't had much luck getting them going myself.-------Simple, but can be complex, short or long. massive space battles and some glorious captial ship victories really bring this game together, if you're into the 4X at all!

Even being an rts, there is no needed ""mouse rush"" to perform well in the game, and there is no workers to control. Direct input during the battles has an effect and tactics as well as strategy is needed to conquer.Definitely a very good one!			"

												While sins of a solar empire: rebellion has great balance between the races it does so through extreme similiarities between them.  It feels like you are playing the same race with a different skin and very slight adjustments to the stats/abilities of each unit.  It also takes 2+ hours just to complete a single game.  Way too slow for me especially since you have to fly a ship back the moment it's shields have dropped to another system in order to do any micro at all.  It makes the actual skill in it almoast completely non existant.			"

												What can I say about this game having spent almost 500 hours on it. Well I can start with the huge scale of the game with simply amazing gameplay mechanics and a UI thats easy to navigate. From playing defensive building huge stations and orbital defences to building massive fleets 800 ships strong to conquer your enemies. Ship deisgn is top notch with each race having their own unique look and feel. Wide selection of maps from small 1 vs 1 maps to 10 player maps. Theres maps with just one solar system and a handful of planets to maps with 20+ solar systems and hundreds of planets. (note 10 player matchs can last for 12 hours or more easily but you can save the game at any time and the game also supports a really good auto save system.) Tech tree is really good with good descriptions explaining what dose what. The games AI on the hardest difficulties will give you a run for your money. The game seems to be well balanced with counters to almost every unit in the game. The mods for the game make it even better with the likes of Star wars, Star trek Armada, Battlestar Galactica etc.  Negitives I ran into was the lack of a campaign, Slight slowdowns on the big maps (could be my rig personally) lack of lore and story, Titans can be a little over powered. Other than these small problems the game is amazing highly recommmend it 9.8/10.			"

												Do I even need to write a review? Old as♥♥♥♥♥♥ rebellion comes as complete and adds mirror rebel versions of the 3 base factions (giving you 6). Awesome game if you're into space empire building from the leaders seat, ala civ.Very enjoyable for a hardcore-but-also-simple 4X Real-Time Space fleet strategy game. Base building is done inside a planet gravity-well / static defence, planets themselves are your strongeholds. they are capped not destroyed, but similar to lowering a flag and raising a flag, or controlling points (of a galaxy map). Civ in space, in real time, with space ships and planets, pew pew!Maps can be randomly generated and theres already a spew of hand crafted offical ones, there a few map editors (I believe an official one as well) can be found online, some give you way more control then others. Players can choose from 3 base races, 2 variations of tech paths per race, giving you 6 different choices (6 different factions).Ships start as frigates, work up in class/shipsize to mega-capital ships. Capital ships are Hero units (inc. mega-capitals), and cannot ressurect XP once killed/destroyed (obv. can rebuild). Common/Regular Ships themselves come as types, some types are grunts (swordsman/rifleman feel), some are support types (Medic only abilities) some house fighters/bombers of your choice(how many of ea.), obviously there are dedicated carriers as well. Each base race has different ships avialable to them, most mirror one another to create simple balance mechanics.Credits and materials are generated based on a gather rate / time unit. Tech trees are fairly big, espeiclly at first but you learn short-cuts, what you need/don't need pretty quickly after a couple of games with your prefered race. Each race also has different tech options, with different effects- but the rebel factions (mirror factions) have slight modifications to them, mostly for different ships that are available, or a niche tech that really bennifits them and sets them apart. (I mostly play Terran (Traders) and the above written is more so the observed comparrison between the two (traditionalists and rebels))Pirates / Bounties on other players are a thing, can hinder the game, some times break it depending on how aggressive other players don't want to get♥♥♥♥♥♥on at the last moment and how much money they have, and you have, and obviously how much your both willing to rappidly 'dump' by clicking the bounty button, each click ensuring more pirates, and grow a horde (rapidly) thats seconds away from dropping on one another (You'll know exactly what I speak of first game, if you and your enemy have the cash!). The resulting mess of pirates can wipe multiple players out on the way (if in the way) as well as decimate the player who just happened to have the timer close on him (almost like musical chairs!). You CAN DISABLE PIRATES before you begin a match. And also, Pirate come from specific 'homeworld asteroids', if you conquer or wipe out these planets, the Pirates will stop coming- because they are 'much dead'.Matches can last anyware between 1 hours - 12 hours+ (I've never played more then about 12 or 13 hour matches at most). And of course matches can be saved.Depending on number of players, AI, and your system; performance in late game CAN and most likely will take a hit, at least until people start getting wiped all over the space-floor. If you get games just too big for your system though, you can quickly find that in 45 minutes of gameplay your frame rate just peters out and the matches can become 'unplayable', which can become quite suprising if you're just getting into a match  / having 'a blast'.It should be noted that there are quick gameconfig.ini to tweak different effects, max ship numbers, etc. etc., all to boost or lower your performance (If you have some sort of ""Mega-Rig"" and you just want 100X more ships then the initial release suppored, it's do-able quickly by editing your INI's, but it's mostly on you to figure out what your system can do!).Apparently theres also great mods (Starwars total conversions, etc) available as well, though I haven't had much luck getting them going myself.-------Simple, but can be complex, short or long. massive space battles and some glorious captial ship victories really bring this game together, if you're into the 4X at all!

												Rebellion is not much of an expansion over the original sins. If you do not own sins go aheadand buy rebellion if it looks cool. Its really low on bugs, I cant recall seeing any honestly andis a lot of fun for a great many hours single player. I say rebellion isnt much of an expansionor sequal over sins, because I owned sins. Rebellion as a stand alone adds a few new ships anda modified research tree based on faction.I'm not sure you should buy this ""sequal"" if you own the original... are you a big fan?Rebellion does not fully satisfy the cravings I still hold for masters of orion 2, but it is the bestplace holder I have seen for now. (or sins, there is little difference)A fan of strategy games will enjoy sins, and it's defininately worth a look if you find it onsale! I find the idea that rebellion is a sequal offensive. There have been no changes tothe engine, almost no gameplay changes. Recommended, but not as a sequal, only if you dont presently own sins. "

												got this game for cheap because i bought the soundtrack too. belive it was 7 or 8 bucks. i have also played the 3 games that came before this one and sadly you cant really call them games. just over the top DLCs that dont work together. each game has just a little bit more content than the last but at the cost of a full 20 dollar game. the graphics havent really improved (Though not bad ) and the gameplay hasent either. specificly with the lag which happens late game. I know it is not my PC as it is useing hardly half of it's resourses running the game at it's peak when i watch all of the ships and meral/crystal/credits tick every other tick. honestly this game is better with mods a single one will put more content into the game than the game has over the course of 3 titles. and is in fact the only reason I got this game when i did because all the better mods require it. and the only reason i will complain about paying for this game is becuse it wasnt worth it. i paid a full  20 for the collectors set before this game came out. and this title has hardly anything new to offer aside from  the titan ships and twice as many factions which are just copies of eachother with slightly diffrent abilitlies. again a single dlc would give all of that and more for free. this game only added about 2-3 dollars worth of content and i paid double that. if they come out with another game i would wait until it was it's approprate price unless you have never played this game before and do not own a copy.

Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is in its core a Command & Conquer type RTS in space with light 4x elements 4x FeaturesLet's start with the 4x elements first. There is almost no planetary development. You can grow population, add some slots for buildings, improve your planet's health all with a couple of clicks. It will take a few minutes to fully develope your planet. The research tree is generic. When you build let's say a frigate factory you will unlock one ship type. There is a research tab for every ship in the game for unlock only purpose.  There are 4 tabs alone for upgrading armor, doing the same thing for every tab. Same thing for laser weapons, 3 tabs where every tab is divided into 2 levels ( need to research 1 tab twice) for every incremental increase in laser damage. There is so much unnecessary stuff in the tree that it is just not tech tree worthy as a whole.Expansion is pretty straightforward take a planet by force or take it over by influence. Panets are connected by phase lanes (strings) over which are you able to move and spread your influence. I'd say diplomacy is the only 4x worthy element this game has to offer and worked out well. You can accept missions to increase their relation with you or you give them a mission to improve your relation with them. If the relation in both ways is high enough the chance of them accepting heavier stuff is more probable.You may ask (missions) a faction to destroy ships, capital ships, structures etc and the amount of it. If they kill 5 or 15 enemy ships for you depends on the relationship. You are also able to join pacts. The better the relation, the more pacts you can join like cease fire, peace, vision or trade treaties. Managing your economy is just as thin as in any other RTS, colonize asteroids for metal and crystal income and max out your population for credits.RTS based gameplayFirst of all there is no singleplayer campaign, it is just pure skirmish against bots and multiplayer. Second point I want to make is that the majority of your game time is spend by battling enemy fleets. Gameplay wise you build up a fleet of mixed unit types. Attack the enemy, lose a big chunk of your fleet, rebuild your fleet and go for the next planet. Flanking does not pay off. There isn't any tactics involved other than timing the activation of your ship's special abilities.There is no stealth, no surgical strikes, no flanking. Every game plays out the same, build a big balanced fleet and overwhelm the enemy. Quick building is your way to succes. This is a casual RTS game with extra bells and whistles (4x elements) which lacks strategic depth. The game has good graphics and the battles are nice to see when you are zoomed in, which rarely happens anyway. I did not expect this game to have such a lack of tactical gameplay, such a shame. For a casual RTS experience this game is good. Good graphics, flashy space battles, lots of cool units, wonderful sound effects, always things to do, mods and the 4x elements , altough very minor, are a plus. I would not buy the game if you expect a 4x game, total war style of gameplay or the ability to use tactics to decide battles. I would only recommend this game if you want another casual RTS experience (with casual I don't mean quality, but there are more of them on the market in terms of gameplay). I will give this game thumbs down however (has nothing to do with rating but with recommendation), the reason for downvoting is the lack of depth gameplay wise and the bells an whistles don't make up for it.

												I thought I would love this game but it just doesn't do it for me. I'm not going to say its a bad game but I cannot recommend this title. The pacing is reaaalllly slow. The tactics boil down to death balling with a proper mix of ships and spamming defensive structures at choke points. Playing against AI on higher difficulties just seems to give them a massive resource bonus and they can outspam you. Just left me feeling meh.			"

												i really do enjoy playing this game. there is just 1 fundamentally game breaking condition, that the developers know and wont do a thing about. the developers shrug and say well, its good enough for us... we did what we saught out to do so F U.this game has the potential to have the largest and awesomest battles. its all there, the ships, the massive fleets, the massive map, the scenery.. so whats wrong? 32bit and no multiprocessor support. yeah a game that has huge maps 1000's of units and runs off of one core? thats just dumb. play a round it runs great till later on, once it gets interesting and fun that is.... then it turns into like your taking pictures and waiting 5 seconds to see the preview over and over...essentially stopping game play. but its okay its too hard for the pansy coders to code. i guess sitting in a chair typing and thinking is considered excruciating hard work these days.  and too costly for the company to actually make a game that delivers its potential. but hey quick and easy is in these days. afterall making 4 ""seperate"" games that are actually the same game with some added stuff here and there is worth rebuying a ""new game price"" for. oops this turned into a rant...

												It's an RTS with almost no micromanagement, in space, in real time, with lots of glittery fighter swarms and pew pew lasers. The races are all interesting and play fairly differently from eachother... seriously, it's hard not to recommend this game, it fills a niche that desperately needs filling.But, unless you're willing to play for diplomatic victories which use an arbitrary point system (that I found too annoying and silly to try more than once. Everyone spams you with quests and I think you just suddenly win if you make enough friends or something? It's weird, I hate it.), or if you're only interested in vs players (which I know nothing about), I'd pass on this game entirely, even though it looks and sounds really good on paper.The game is paced so unbelievably poorly that I, almost without exception, regret the time spent after I'm done playing... and it's entirely because of the poor AI, it's too smart where it shouldn't be (you have to level up your ships with combat, but enemies run away from any fight they can't easily win) or too stupid where it should be smarter (space stations aren't considered at all when they're sizing up if they can win a fight), and difficulties do nothing more than tell the computer how much to cheat, and then after a point I guess the AI just decides that you've won, because it never attacks you ever again... but it also doesn't hit the surrender button, and sense it's always running away from you the game becomes just hours and hours of bombing planets wondering if anything is going to happen.Spoiler alert, no, nothing is going to happen, the moment you max out your fleet you might as well quit. They don't even put up defenses, it just takes forever to kill them all and then you're done.Not to mention the achievements are some of the lamest busywork tasks I think I've ever seen, ""win as [race] researching each and every tech in only [this tree] and nothing else ever"", what? That doesn't make any sense, why are there 9 copies of this achievement? This isn't a reason not to buy the game, it just annoys me.A friend of mine has all the DLC, and so long as he hosts I'm able to play with all the DLC. We haven't exactly tested it exhaustively, but none of the above problems appear to be fixed or even improved by them.			"

												This was the first game of the series that I played, and having been a huge fan of the Age of Empires series, I absolutely loved it. Sins of a Solar Empire takes RTS to a whole new level; you don't just takeover the world, you take over the universe!On the other hand, being new made it very hard for me to get to grips with the game, I'll keep coming back to it of course, but it was very hard to understand what was the better unit. Three classes and six ships within, along with five different branches of a technology tree with near a hundred options for each - what do I choose?!?The visuals were quite amazing - though I disliked not being able to much of the battle graphically, rather than with icons. The interface made sense, and despite a couple of bits I didn't get first off, it worked very well. All in all a great game, well worth buying for any fan of RTS or Sci-Fi nut.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is yet another example of a space 4X RTS game with a good concept but poor execution. The UI is very badly designed and doesn’t help with locating and keeping track of ships much at all and you’ll be zooming in or clicking to confirm things because the planetary tab interface on the left is ♥♥♥♥ing useless. Combat is clunky and awkward and micromanaging ships will quickly become an exercise in futility in larger battles. The pirate mechanic is kind of neat but ultimately ends up just being a money drain since the AI likes to be frugal in most cases. Also be prepared to switch to manual targeting as your forces will still try to kill “paid off” pirates. Additionally real-time just isn’t a fun thing to have in 4x and I feel like it’s a feature that nobody really wanted but developers are trying anyway “just because”. I guess if I had to say one thing positive about this game it would be that at least the overall pacing isn’t as tedious as in Stardrive, but it could be a lot better too.			"

												It's an addictive game, especially if you play on huge maps with multiple star systems. Unfortunately it suffers from an extremely annoying issue that the Developers won't provide the option to turn off, requiring players to download a mod to disable the extremely annoying super weapons spam, which otherwise makes late game unbearable just from the notifications alone (not to mention the effects).Of course, good luck disabling those annoying space mines, there's no mod for that. You pretty much have to learn to perform delecate code surgury from arcane forums. I'm being more critical of the devs than the game here, toggle options. Seriously.			"

												A great RTS for space lovers. Keeps the game play relitivly simple while not feeling boring. If you liked the previous games, you will love this one. If you havent played the previous games, you like space, and like RTS, then check this out.Great blend of resorce managment, building an army, and expansion gameplay. Large space battles are a regular event in this game, where hundreds of ships clash in epic battles over planets. For those who love to just brute force, you will enjoy that part.For those who enjoy more subtle gameplay, the diplomacy and civilian trees offer that. Spread your culture to your enemys worlds and eventually spark a rebellion on that planet, making it ripe for you to come in and colonise it. Ally yourself with those close to you and trade resorces and tech to enhance your own abilities. Or go it alone and give missions to the pirates to have them assault your enemys. No matter how you want to play this game, you can find a way to win that is challanging and satisfying. With the 3 default races, and the 2 factions in each, you can find a race and faction that fits your play style.			"

												Monopoly with spaceships.Titans, titans, titans! What's missing is a video of a starbase owning your entire fleet, because that's what the game is all about: starbases killing everything. The most important upgrade is the AI, they are now smart enough to own you with just cannons and starbases and will adapt to and counter your play style. I recommend lots of strikecraft.TEC cheat with their minefields, Advent cheat with their culture cannons, and Vasari cheat with resource plundering. They all frickin' cheat.			"

												Back in the day, when Sins of a Solar Empire first came out, it was already quite apparent that what Ironclad Studios had made was unique. Then the Entrenchment and Diplomacy expansions came and changed the game entirely for the better. Ironclad was content to let it be after that, but when a dedicated group of fans started churning out optimization mods, the Sins team took notice and decided to give us exactly what we needed: Rebellion! With a fully custumizable interface and with more than fifty high quality mods (not to mention the ability to create your own maps in the Galaxy Forge), Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion has some of the highest replayability factor in any game I've ever played. The online play is intense, and while there is the occasional crash or two per game, the real time tactics and deep character behind every aspect makes it more than worth playing through. If that's not enough for you, there are some excellent mods that can be easily installed. I would highly suggest using the E4X Mod, the Star Wars Interregnum Mod, and the Epic Scale Mod. However, if Star Wars isn't your thing, then you might be more interested in the various Star Trek, Babylon V, Stargate and Halo Mods! Nothing is impossible with this game; I've actally made a few private mods and skins myself, it's that simple. Next time it comes on sale, I highly suggest you buy it along with all of the DLC. You won't regret it.			"

												A great game that combines real time combat with a stunning environment, in depth economy and diplomacy. Since the whole game takes place in real time it adds to the tension and fun of the game. Never gets boring.Edit:This game is very old, could even be considered a classic, but point being that it is one of those games that lasts for very long, an old game that people still love. This game is amazing, even now I would pay double for it, it is just amazing all things considered. To add to this there are some great mods out there (no workshop, mods are external), and the mods I have seen are some of the msot fun and dedicated I've ever seen, and I have used a lot of mods for a lot of games. Altogether, worth a buy anytime, even without sale, DLC isn't nesseccary to the game being great, but if you really wanna there's no downside to it.Altogether, amazing game			"

This game does NOT have multi-core support, and it does have native support for more than 2GB of ram. what does this mean? it means that later on in gameplay expect things to really slow down... and hoo boy does it start dragging if theres a alot going on... honestly this is the engines fault, and probably won't be addressed unless they make a sequel of the game on a new engine that can address these issues... i will say this, the game has been really optimized to make the most of the resources it can use, and in that, it gives me great hope for the sequel, as they will hopefully keep up with their resource efficiency and make a well polished game.Despite these massive drawbacks for performance, i believe the game itself outweighs the cons and is still very worthwhile to play. but like most massive RTS games, expect a game to last multiple sessions on bigger maps.

But never say the most negative thing about it. Lots of community mods and expansive gameplay, you are hell going to be stuck here forever watching the cinematic and mindblowing experience of the sci-fi genre in space itself.""""Moddable, cinematic like battles delievers the sci-fi genre into the next level.""8.9/10.0 -NepNepCritic			"

												Welp, here goes my first review:Imagine a less complex Civilization, set in space where the main focus is warring the eff out of your enemies, and betraying your allies. There you go. Although you can indeed ally with another civ and win together, the possibility of they stabbing you behind your back is always there. With that interactivity in mind, add pretty graphics for a 2012 game, a handful of civilizations for you to try and master, it is a must for RTS players.Bear in mind though that it does not have a single-player campaign, neither an interactive tutorial.

												This game is awesome!! I love the new titans, they bring a whole new layer of stratagy to the game. The races are very different yet well balanced, and the game goes smothly regardless of the fact that there are so many things happening at once! The AI varies from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to Genus, and the shipd diversity is good. Multipayer runs smothly, with only a little early game lag, and the online comunity is freindly and active.Little pricy considering that it dosent add much from it's preveious instalation, but anbody new (or anybody with change to spare) should definitley consider buying it. The graphics are stunning and the map selection is great. Modding opens new doors, although i normaly dont use mods myself. The music is good, althogh the voices are not anything special. The names in the game are pretty uncreative, but it's not too much of a problem because you can rename almost anything.Even if your computer is bad, the game still runs somewhat well, as long as you turn down the graphics settings and keep your armies at a resonable size. other than that I say get the game, sit down, build some factories and join the rebelion!

												Right, this game is outstanding, only got a it a few days ago... even though it came out last year... whoops, oh well but anyway back on track.Firstly this game is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! completely took my breath away, the units, the 4X gameplay as well as the tonnes and tonnes of maps in which is included in the game itself as well as the map creator and forge. Multiplayer is brilliant and the overally graphical and stunning game. I highly recommend people that you buy this game as this will be the most fun and time-consuming game you can possibly play. :P			"

Posted: January 2, 2013
												I've played Sins since the original 1.0 retail release and I have to say.. I'm actually disappointed in this version.What you have to understand about Sins of a Solar Empire is the effort put into making a game in the style of other galactic empire builders but without the turnbased element which had turned off a large portion of gamers is an extremely ambitious endeavour which WAS delivered... and THAT was awesome! The idea of making a 4X game turnless is just.. mind boggling, enough to rival titles such as the X series in scope.Sins of a Solar Empire, Entrenchment and Diplomacy really upped the ante in each subsequent release and I always felt like they were advancing the gameplay significantly each time (though I always felt like the AI were becomming more and more subdued to the point of being pointless to learn from as 1.0 had very difficult AI that still allowed you to learn from them) to the benefit of the people wanting something new in each release... and then Rebellion was released.I was fairly unsure of what Rebellion would have instore for us: would it provide more ships and much more fine tuned balancing to the existing mix? Will we get more AI modes to play against? What about fixing up the research trees? and seriously, I never felt more let down. Where Sins 1 through to Trinity would allow the player to emmerse themselves into a fairly competitive environment and challenge them to find solutions to what could be a not so standard problem: Rebellion allows you to just spam your way to victory. Novel ideas introduced in the micro-expansions of Sins and in the Trinity pack are now just... a given.The Entrenchment micro expansion gave players the ability to fortify sectors under their control or even build seriously destructive weaponry inside an enemy gravity field to screw them over, there were other advancements but this was a serious turning point as before... there were methods to seriously improve defences for what could be otherwise defenseless zones and really just left some sectors as worthless.The Diplomacy micro expansion did for the diplomacy end of things that the entrenchment expansion did for defense options for each race and really allowed the player to use the economic empire they had build from the ground up to REALLY good use. The game of Sins of a Solar Empire really became a new beast with what had become the Trinity set (it was the game in the 3 incarnations, each separately loadable with the most uptodate version minus expansion content not in that version)Now we look at Retribution... we have 2 versions of each faction to make up a total of 6 playable 'factions'. We have a titan ship unique to each version of a faction as well as some different tech to research but largely remaining the same over all (except for certain faction only advantages which seriously skew the balancing, don't believe me? build 2 starbases to each system and deck them out with trade ports and watch your money grow incredibly fast.) and that's it... unless you buy the 'dlc' which include new system types, new colonizable planetoids/misc objects, random events, etc but the game didn't really CHANGE so much as become more convoluted.Titans are just capitol ships that cost more and have more abilities to learn at each level. Different 'factions' within a faction are the same damn thing with minor differences (rebel TEC can become friendly with rebels and incite rebellion on other worlds, loyalist Visari can strip a planet of resources for a big injection + leave the world dead and useless to all others) The only real differences comes for the Visari loyalists that can use their capitol ships as replacements for monetary income and research tiers.Rebellion felt like Trinity 3.5; Rebellion is just an addition to what trinity already had. I know Ironclad put a lot of effort into this title but it is so not worth the price margin considering the DLC is not free and the expansion on existing Sins stuff is fairly uninspiring. Play the game if you missed out on Trinity or don't mind playing current gen games but if you want a real challenge, something to test you over and over... play the Trinity set instead.			"

												Very superficial and monotonous game.  Also the overall look of everything -- space, planets, stations and ships -- is very generic and cheap.  Of course you could zoom waaaaay in to actually see them, but then you can't actually play.After you colonize a few planets and attacked a few ships, you've done 99% of all you'll ever do in this game.  Same thing over and over.  And you don't actually do anything; you don't place strategic buildings or resources really... you just press buttons, then everything is built automated.  (and the few defensive structures you build and strategically place are more or less worthless and make little difference)  REALLY boring and shallow.I bought this on sale for $14.99, wasn't worth it.  If this is how all these space 4X games are, the genre sucks.At least this gave me an itch to play my old Alpha Centauri.EDIT:  tried playing a few more hrs.  Yeah, this game sucks.  The various difficulty levels and the AI not following the rules of it's own game is another suck-factor.  (Either the factions do nothing, build nothing, and just sit there... or at higher difficulties they'll produce a massive amounts of ships and zerg spam you, far beyond what they're resources would allow.)Another Steam ripoff, due in large part to gushy fanois giving unwarrented positive reviews.  No more reading of Steam reviews for me.  Will look elsewhere, finding those who have actual standards.			"

												If you like space combat, if you like strategy, or if you like just seeing explosions buy this game. I cannot recommend this enough ecspecially if you're a 4x strategy game fan like myself. Its got immense battles, an immense amount of tech and structures and a good AI to boot. Lets back up though, this is a ""standered"" space strategy you start out with one planet with a host of other planets to jump to and explore and colonize if you so choose in a universe with multiple galaxies to jump to if you so choose. You can build up massive fleets and defences and watch them clash with enemies in real time in what can be some massive battles (I would recommend a pretty good computer for this part though with a good amount of RAM otherwise those thousand ship battles can be sluggish). The modding community for this game is also amazing, from star wars to star trek to adding hundereds of different planets, ships, factions you name it its probably out there and there easy to download as well. So all in all just go and buy it please, if you like strategy at all you will not be dissapointed at all in this game.			"

												One of, if not, the best Space based RTS game I have ever played. Hands Down. Yet, with the numerous patches and the DLC releases they have yet to be able to provide a platform in which more than 2 people can enjoy the game for any length of time.You and a friend want to do a 2 v 3 AI map? 40 minutes in and the game is running on it's hands and knees for no specific reason you'll be able to determine. Have a latest gen i7, gtx 970 and 16gb of ram with an SSD for your rig? Want to play 10+ player/ai maps? Enjoy still having to deal with crippling frame-rate issues shortly after launching the game. It's absolutely disgusting that a game this amazing cannot be enjoyed to its full potential.			"

The customizing parts of it are cut down, ship models are fixed, weapons are prechosen ect. the planet managment was basic at best, it seem to me to reach a peak very fast enless you are playing one of there premade games thats is made to limit resorces and such. So if you want a decent game dont do a randomly generated game like i did my first time or you will be twidling your thumbs after a hourTo put it basicly the game is fine i just expected more from all id heard			"

												If you're here because you're in the mood for a science fiction RTS, or Sins is on sale, let me dispense with the formalities and tell you straight out that this is one of the best, most intuitive and fun space RTS games ever.It's hard to believe it came out in 2008 -- the visuals have aged extraordinarily well, the UI is easy to navigate and easy to get used to, the units are responsive, and the research trees are deep, powerful and varied.There's no homogeneity here -- each race has unique ships with unique abilities and playstyles, and they each have research trees that emphasize their strengths. Certain lines of research are proprietary, meaning another race doesn't have an analog or way of replicating it, but you can be sure they have their own singular perks.The races also have different approaches to economy, space travel and fleet logistics. While the backbone of a dangerous Advent fleet is the Illuminator vessel with its devastating beam weapon, amplified by the synergistic effects of Advent's carrier capital ships, the heart of the TEC fleet is the JRM Missle frigate, protected by a front line of heavily-armored warships. Likewise, the Vasari appropriately feel more alien than the other two races, but they have proprietary stardrive tech that lets them cross vast distances quickly, and the ability to ramp up their economy quickly.With the updates (included), each race is further split into two factions each, providing a choice of six different races/ractions you can select from and fight. Additional updates added powerful starbases and more powerful defensive units, in addition to other features that have made the game deeper and more enjoyable.I've been playing Sins since it was released, and probably have a few hundred hours of play time aside from the 95 hours or so I've got on Steam. If you give Sins of a Solar Empire a chance, you'll get more than your money's worth -- and you'll certainly have some late nights as you tell yourself, ""Just one more planet, one more capital ship, one more battle...""

												This is a great sci-fi RTS game. I don't usually like RTS games because they are usually to frenetic for me, but this can have the construction, research etc all slowed down so you can take your time to make decisions and appreciate what is around. From what I have seen the enemy doesnt move that fast on normal difficulty which is perfect for me. The best bit about this game is the massive space battles you fight once you meet the enemy - they are very impressive and you can change to cinemagraphic view with one button click for some great screenshots. The only downsides to the game are that the frame rate can get a little slow in really large battles due to its 32bit structure, and that the Titans are a bit over the top. But it has fantastic GUI that makes managing large fleets a doddle, it is still going strong with plenty of players, some great mods (Star Wars and Star Trek ships for example) and interesting DLC.At the moment I would say its the best space strategy game on the market but such a shame the game engine struggles with very large amounts of ships.

												I like the idea of this game, 4X mixed with RTS. But I just don't like this game, I wonder why.I hate double DRM, but it's not the reason.This game lacks a complete tutorial or campaign/story mode, but well it's OK, I normally only play a few campaign battles in RTS games, then only play skirmish once a while.As a 4X game, SOSE don't give you much time for planning. This game has a big tech tree, and in 4X games I usually take a few minutes to think about which tech direction I want to go at the beginning, but the realtime gameplay just doesn't let me. Well if you played a lot it could become as easy as muscle memory but still, if it is a 4X game, player should have some time for planning.Star development and ecnomics are simplified a lot compared to other 4X games. More like RTS: Build mining drones, improve the population, build factories, build defence platforms. And then, build as many ships as you can.Diplomacy seems totally broken. AI hates you at the beginning if you are a different faction. In most 4X games when you meet alien ship, the first thing is a greeting, but here when your fleet meet theirs, they just start firing at each other AUTOMATICALLY, and it hurts relationship. You have to research technology to communicate with AI, before that you may already at war, and even when you finished that technology and offer AI pacts and trades, they just laugh at you and refuse. The only thing you can do to improve relationship is complete their missions, which are usually to attack others, so there is actually no peace play. (If you don't complete them, relationship also gets worse) And AIs just gradually become friendly with each other, because they don't do missions.As a RTS game, SOSE's battle is very slow paced. It could take a minute to move from one star system to another, with normal game speed setting. And you can only move through certain lanes. So it could take minutes to send reinforcement, and when your fleet gets there the battle is already over.The fleet battles themselves also looks boring: you move fleets into a star system that has enemies there, and ships just automatically move to each other and start firing. You can control ship movement and manually choose target, but it doesn't help that much: Ship maneuver is super slow compared to projectiles and lasers attack range, you always fight in open space, and often get surrounded at the point you enter a star system. You can't see formations in traditional RTS games here, it's mostly just numbers and rock-paper-scissors that matters: You get more ships, you win. One ship type is stronger against another, you build right things, you win. Furthermore, you upgrade to more advanced tech and get more big ships, you win. Once the battle starts, you can only retreat your fleet, or watch the result. That's good if this is a pure 4X turn based game, but RTS elements are added in, and doesn't work as expected.The graphics isn't bad, it's quite good considering this is released some years ago. Problem is, you don't have chances to really see details like the screenshots above, if you're playing normally. You would take half your time watching the star map. Clicking on systems to build ships and upgrades. And another half, controlling your fleets moving from here to there, (and this can also be done in the star map interface) and micromanaging fleet battles. Even when you zoom into a star system to control your ships, they look as small as ants. Ship attack range is super long compared to their size, when you zoom in until you can see details, you can't do anything but only watching.Combining 4X and RTS looks like a good idea, but the 2 elements turn out to be conflicted with each other in many aspects. I think this game did its best, but I don't see it solves all the problems. It's like they put a simplified RTS and a simplified 4X together, and I can't enjoy either of them.			"

												Bare graphical improvements over Sins: Trinity, but costs double the price.+ When on sale, it is usually $9.99. Not bad at first glance.- Pre-discount price is still the same as the launch price in 2012: $39.99 (for a small expansion added onto a game going back to 2008). A 75% discount only looks impressive because the price has never been adjusted.- Graphics and gameplay haven't been much improved from Trinity. It's an example of something old given a touch here and touch there, and repackaged and priced as something ""new"".- It has 'super-capital-class' (aka titan-class) ships that are overpowered and limit the gameplay. All roads lead to building a titan, whether you wanted to use one or not.- It doesn't truly have six factions; more like what should have been additional tech options for each original faction, got marketed to ""hey, now you have double the number of factions"".'Old Games, Same Debut Prices'Stardock is one of thousands of publishers on Steam that list their old games at ridiculous regular prices. When these overpriced games go on sale, the discount by themselves are high - 50%, 75% -  many of us get distracted by that percentage figure and buy old games at what should really be regular prices, but are advertised as ""discounted prices"".They have all the advantages (reduced costs, easier marketing, global distribution, greater profits) through Steam, selling copies upon copies of old hits that would receive little attention and garner little sales without this platform. But they do not change their prices from launch and profit even more greatly, all without offering any added value for  customers. I hope Steam's userbase becomes more tight with their wallets - it's the only way publishers that offer good value for their games (both old and new products) will benefit, while publishers who 'double dip' on cost savings and price gouging, will adapt.

												The base Sins of a Solar Empire game is very good and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately, most of the additions that came along with Rebellion detract from the otherwise fantastic 4x empire building experience. Late game is laregly about Titans instead of your capital ships and their support fleet, and the Titans are not especially fun or interesting to play with or against. To compound the problem, killing or losing a Titan is a temporary setback at best as it can be reconstructed again in short order with its level and upgrades intact. The graphics upgrade is nice, but overall, I strongly recommend buying Sins: Trinity instead of Rebellion.			"

												An amazing RTS game. HOWEVER, the engine has been the same for 6 years now and the price for a little upgrade to the base game(Trinity) is just utter nonsense. The DLC's feel like a rippoff if you paid any money for it because the content feels like it was created in a few hours, not much to notice or feel like its worth anything.I used to recommend this game but it has become clear that Ironclad is just trying to milk everyone for cash in exchange for next to nothing in return.If they make a new SOASE with a modern engine then I'll buy that, but for now i just suggest you keep playing Trinity or wait till Rebellion is on discount, a steep discount, the DLCs are NOT WORTH IT, it only adds something different here and there but fails to make the game any more interesting than it was the past few years.

If you really want a game that will bring your blood to a boil and wants to make you throw your PC out the window, then by all means give this log in screen a shot.  Apparently my e-mail  was already taken, so I go for their password reset, set myself a new password, try to log in but I get a error.  And the fun part about this, is that you can't play the F'N game offline.   I might change my recommendation for the game from ""NO"" to ""YES"" if I ever get it to go past the registration window.  Until then, I got better games to play with that doesn't require a stupid registration window to be completed to then get a error.			"

												As a big fan of 4X strategy games, I picked this up on a recommendation from a professor I had.  I've always wanted a really good space themed 4X that gives me a lot of options of play.  Sins of a Solar Empire is not what I was looking for.  The subtle nuances of each faction don't feel unique enough, the combat is fairly monotonous , and the games drag on for quite awhile for a real time game.  It's not a trainwreck by any means,  but it lacks the variety I was looking for.  If you are looking for a game that feels like you're building a galactic empire, this isn't it.  If you're looking for an RTS 4X hybrid then take what I have to say with a grain of salt, but I don't feel that the two genres mesh in an enjoyable way in this game.			"

												The basics are solid, no bugs etc., although (for me) it felt a bit repetitive after the initial struggle. Take a system, establish yourself in the system, move onto the next system. I imagine that unless you and your friends have a fair amount of free time to do multiplayer matches, only being able to play against the AI provides somewhat limited entertainment.My real qualm is with how the game is advertised though. All of this backstory and lore doesn't really go anywhere. No solo campaign, nothing. And calling the game the ""next installment""? It's an update, but one that you have to pay full price for, seeing as it's a standalone release. A real kick in the teeth for anyone who bought the original near or after the release of Rebellion, based on the advertising, and essentially bought the same game twice.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire is a game that really feels like it should be good, and that I really want to be good. It has a ton of interesting mechanics, delivers solid space-4X gameplay, and has a lot of strategic depth. What really holds this game back is that there are a few annoyances (slow pace, takes a while to meaningfully interact with other players, minor UI annoyances, etc) and doesn't really excel at anything well enough to be a reason to play the game. If you like 4X gameplay Sins of a Solar Empire is a good addition to your roster and is one of the better space-based games in the genre, but if you're not a large fan of the genre there isn't any particular reason to pick this game up. You can become a rogue planet-devouring mob, so that's pretty cool.			"

												Really fail to get the fuss over this game. Just bought it on sale and still feel robbed. Why the heck has the 4x genre failed to come up with anything new?Tactically this game is lacking beyond build a butt load of ships and turrets while rushing to call dibs on unowned sectors.			"

												This game is one that just looks great, from the story line to the combat.  Unfortunately they substituted an infinitely boring tutorial for a campaign so the storyline stops at the intro video.  The combat unfolds into an incredibly slow paced snore.  This is good because you'll be needing all that time waiting for your ships to move an inch to read the explosive research menu that happens to be in no way intuitive and absolutely necessary for victory.  The research is also unique for each race so you'll be spending most of your time in this game reading what things do in this one menu, this one menu, this one menu, this one menu, this whole game is based on this one fing menu. What the f guys?  Want to build a media hub?  Thats simple, just click this button that is nowhere to be found nor is there a suggestion as to where it can be found.  In the hour it took you to find it, your ships have moved 4 whole inches only for the enemy you were chasing to warp away.  Figure out that one menu?  If you did, you got more suprises in store!  Suddenly the enemy ships have 150% hp, so u use that one menu again to research a new ship that looks vaguely competitive.  Its not.  If you get them good, they warp away.  Excercise in futility.

												The game have potential... but...First.. there is no campaing... the ""single player"" goes as a skirmish only and there for no history to backup the gameplay.Without a history line its impossible to entangle with chars and units porpouse... as ppl might notice most of the games uses a historyline to show u how the units ""work better"" and what is the ""ideia"" of the game...Second... overkill techtree .. too many choices that u will end up not using ever...Third... u cant really manage the planets... u cant very poorly adjust the type of ""civ"" (industrual/Social)... ""Battles""... for a 3d its VERY VERY poor 3d control over the field... i did not notice any impovement or real control over placing the units on a Yaxis...Well... the game  have a good engine but lacks somethings... I would go back to ""HomeWorld II"" "

												This is one of the best games ever made, it simply has no trouble beating any thing you could call a rival in its own genre.So why the bad review?White Knights. = Forgive everything allowing devs to not improve anything.Devs. = Made a lot of money, still make alot of money of this game alone, they invest none of it. (4k and new .exe do not count, a weekend job is not reinvesting)A decade old engine. = No multi core support, any game going over 4 hours, becomes unplayable. These ♥♥♥♥s could reinvest a fraction of the money into upgrading the game, but they wont, why, only response is dont ask.. ♥♥♥♥ you.An almost perfect game, ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs who have no grasp of whats right due to fanboys kissing their♥♥♥♥♥♥to the point like all other devs they dont think they can do wrong. Why the salt if its so old? The devs still make money and put out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless changes to the game, which only add to the resources needed to run it.. But DO NOT IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO RUN THE GAME..  ♥♥♥♥ anyone who says they couldnt set aside 40 grand, a small dev team and 3 months to do this, that wouldnt even dent their profits, hell more youths would buy into it and turn a huge profit of a small reinvestment. But no, just ignore what your fans actually need.			"

												Thought this would be like ogame, which it isn’t.  The only thing you can do is take out the other player’s capitol and win.  You can’t adventure out and find new worlds, just the pre created ones.  Once you scout them all that is it.  Basically just starcraft.. in space.  Once you figure out what everything does it’s very boring.  Not much fun on replay.			"

												Would be a great game if not for the extremely poor CPU usage. In the beginning of the game, no problems, but as soon as you pass a certain ammount of ships/fighters the FPS drops below the 20's. Continue playing and you'll sit at ~10 FPS, does not matter what system you use. Adjusting the settings etc only adds a few FPS for a limited ammount of time, eventualy you will end up at the ~10 FPS range again.Only way it would be ""playable"" is to use small fleets, lowest settings everywhere and go 1v1, not exactly a fun way to play a game if you ask me.

												Really an awesome game to play. There's a lot to learn, but given a little patience and care, it comes naturally, with research that makes sense, and a generally good GUI.The AI can go into replication mode, and while it isn't too hard to beat, the uncontrolled growth of the AI can quickly overwhelm a player.Aside from that, it's great!

												I bought this game thinking it was going to be a similar experience to Planetary Annihilation. I was so Gaben-ly wrong. I'm not going to evaluate the whole game because I couldn't even get that far into it before I became frustrated. I bought it at a discount Weight and got the 4 Gaben bundle. I can't even give it away because of the painstakingly long gameplay that everyone else seems to be aware of. I'm 13 hours in and I still have no grasp of the game. Even worse, an average game lasts 3-4 hours at regular speed and I have yet to claim honest victory to a single match, let alone completed one. The damage types (or labeling) are different in each faction which makes it hard to compare and the values switch positions from one unit to the next. Their counter for it? All units automatically prioritize targets even if you direct the next attack. There are some cool things about this game which will keep me from giving it a 3/10 or less but I'm so sick of the drawn out matches and time wasted that I don't even want to elaborate and waste any more time writing a review on it. User-friendly will never describe this game. I honestly don't see myself playing it again. EDIT:Since these cult followers feel the need to comment on my review as if I'm stupid rather than letting the numbers speak for themselves (since this game does uphold a very high review status), I figured I would go into more detail about why I don't like the game:░░░░░░░░░░░█▀▀░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀░░░░░█▄▄░░░░░░░░░░█░█░░░░░░░░░░▐░░░░░░░░░▐▐░░░░░░░░░▄░▐░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░▄▀▀░▐░░░░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░▐░▄▄▀░░░░░░▄▀░░░▐░░░░░█▄▀░▐░░░░░░░█░░░▐░░░░░░░░▄░█░░░░░░░░█▄░░▀▄░░░░▄▀▐░█░░░░░░░░█▐▀▀▀░▀▀▀▀░░▐░█░░░░░░░▐█▐▄▄░░░░░░░░▐░█▄▄░░░░░▀▀▄▄▄▀░S░░░░░▐▄▄▄▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░ins░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░Rebellion░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  Tutorials,  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ Campaign,  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ and Tech Tree ░░░░░░░░ And I'll bump up my rating since I was a bit sour when I initially wrote this.You're welcome.5/10 for being a finished and cool looking product and not a pay2play game			"

												I love this game so much, so why am I giving it a negative review? Well the game in and of itself is fantastic, I would have loved the game to death if not for one issue: The Game Runs like Absolute Trash.This might not be extremelly noticeable at the begining or when you play on small maps against  1 to 2 opponents, however on bigger maps with many foes, the game starts to run like a slideshow after 4 hours. Concurrently in a game in a large galaxy with 5 other opponents about 6 hours in, the average fps which I am getting is around 8. Not exactly acceptable.So why is this? Does my computer just suck? No. Its because the game is not at all optimized well for 64-bit systems. The game can only access 2 gigabytes of your ram and for me uses only about 15% of my processing power on average. With mods such as the Large Adress Aware you can make the game use  3 gigs instead of 2, which will give you a couple of frames, but maybe for like an hour after that it will drop to hell again as the sizes of fleets of the AI increase. Conclusion:- Later in Games it runs like a slideshow, if you dont mind the mindblowingly low fps, its a fantastic game in every other respect, in fact possibly my favorite RTS of all time. Save yourself the pain of having to abandon this masterpiece due to the broken performance and buy some other game.			"

Not only is finding and getting a game started very slow, the over all community is full of trolls, racist.The ICO servers are always crashing during online play, even solo play you are still crashing due to ""mini dump"" errors that are never fixed. This makes even finishing a long solo game close to impossible unless you remember to CONSTANTLY save after every major battle.If you are looking to play this game, you need to have a group of friends willing to play with you online to have the most fun. Or you can download mods to keep yourself having fun during solo play.			"

												Real-time 4X strategy with equally deep choices for warfare, diplomacy, and colonization. I haven't played since vanilla but the expansions have added tons onto the base game including: starbases (death stars that can effectively control uncolonizable sectors), ""Titan"" class ships, new research trees, restructured diplomacy, improved victory conditions, deeper piracy options, more difficulty settings, tons of new maps and map sizes, and who knows what else I haven't discovered yet.Rebellion contains all the previous expansions and new content. I played vanilla Sins for hundreds of hours before it came out on Steam and probably will sink many more into this. I mean, it's basically Civ in space, you should really go play it.			"

												This game looks good in the video and description, but the actual game is a different matter.The tutorials are unintuitive and don't explain the concepts in detail, and there is no single player campaign, nor any kind of mission or scenario. As far as I can tell you can't even make your own missions. When I tried playing against the A.I., I found that the random sub factions (they have faction labels but don't count as actual factions, so you can't do anything about them) were a lot  more of a threat than the a.i. at the beginning. As you build up your planets and colonize new ones I continuesly got attacked by pirates, despite the fact that the bounty system for controlling them should have made them only attack my enemies, having a 1000 credit bounty on them and none on me. The description of the faction I chose to play as also has in its abilities that it has a peace treaty with the neutral and pirate fleets. TO top it all off, the pirate base was much closer to my enemies than it was to me, but only I seemed to be targeted.Over time that one base grew far more powerful than my entire empire, and had no ship or resource resrictions like I did, making it impossible for me to amass the forces to defeat them. I have never played such an unblanced game before.			"

												Not what I was expecting.Billed as a fusion between RTS gameplay and 4X Gameplay, I was stoked.  But while the gameplay was fine, I was a bit put off that the only choice I had right out the box for Singleplayer was to basically just choose what type of map I wanted to play on, and how big it was.  I played Trinity first, then this one, but neither gave me much to do when it came to this place's universe.  Civilization can get away with no ongoing story campaign because that story, at least, is already written, and it's fun to see how much any Civilization game with its familiar faces diverges from our own history.  When it comes to a Sci-Fi universe, when there's a blank slate to work with, I'd expect more attempts on the game's part to engage me when it comes to caring about the fate of whoever it is I am playing, but Sins of a Solar Empire disappointingly seems to prefer more of a Sandbox approach.Maybe I completely missed the point here... but I just plain can't recommend this game to anyone looking for a good solo experience.  Maybe give it a try if you know you've got a group of interested friends, or if you REALLY love playing against random strangers.  But for anyone else, you're probably better off passing on this.

												I would not recommend this game to anyone. The reason is with stability of the game and player community is beyond terrible. Not only is finding and getting a game started very slow, the over all community is full of trolls, racist.The ICO servers are always crashing during online play, even solo play you are still crashing due to ""mini dump"" errors that are never fixed. This makes even finishing a long solo game close to impossible unless you remember to CONSTANTLY save after every major battle.If you are looking to play this game, you need to have a group of friends willing to play with you online to have the most fun. Or you can download mods to keep yourself having fun during solo play.			"

												looking for a new strategi space game, watching all those extremely positive reviews i had to give this a try, although its not bad, but after only 3 matches i already feel like theres no more content to entertain me further.maybe i missed something, or this game is seriouslt inferior and overrated by far!you are much better off with galactic civilisations 3 its basicly the same just turn based and has much more content and way better space feel, all in all just much better then this.

												I was extremely disappointed in this game. I read up on this game and I saw a rich background. I was intrigued and I wanted to play the game to find out more about the story. After buying this game and playing it, I found that this has no story, no single player to further the back story or plot. Instead it has an incredibly stale tutorial, and fairly boring pvp game play. I guess maybe I should have bought the original game from 1998 or whenever. Maybe if they had a single player aspect to the game to drive the plot, that they have on their website, then I can be excited and want to play it more. As it is, this game gets a double thumbs down.			"

												Hi. To be honest I bought this game because of the really good reviews, so I thought it must be a really good game and actually I'm quite disappointed with it. I would say that the worst thing in this game is graphics. I know that graphics is not the most important part of the game, but here looks really ugly. The ships and stations looks terrible. Even if you make a zoom you can see how simple they are. The way how the engines are presented is very poor. The way how the stations are build is totally basic. The star systems and asteroids are very basic, too basic. I run the game in max settings already. So if you look for a nice graphics avoid this game. To be honest because visually is very poor I didn't even want to explore all the game mechanics, so I can't say are they good or bad. Because the game has so good reviews probably the best part of it lays actually in game mechanics. But for me to spent 90 min of playing was enough to notice that this game is not really good. I didn't discover there anything to keep me playing. Also the standard price is very expensive. For this price there are much better games to choose from. My only advice is to download first Sins of Solar Empire Demo. It is slightly different to Rebellion but you definitely will have a taste of the game and if you like the demo you will like the full game. Otherwise just forget about this game and move on the the different one.			"

												In my honest opinion Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a biggest waste of money so far. Let me tell you why.It's a type of RTS with many features, it's not simple, there's a lot of text to read, which itself is of course not a con. The problem is, that the font is unreadable. Bold letters with almost no spacing between them makes the eyes struggle to read the words. I was forcing myself to play the game in hope i will get used to it. Then the gameplay issues came. Many pointless actions to make while they could be much simplier. To select groups of units you have to zoom out, using the hold&draw option doesn't seem to work as you would think it should. Moving to different planets is also pain in the *ss, why it is not as simple as selecting and clicking the other planet? Half of the game is Zoom out/Zoom in/Zoom out/Zoom in either to do something or see something.Maybe I could use to that someday.. Maybe I would like it.. but I didn't make it that far, it is just too painful and that's where the game fails as entertainment.			"

												Good visuals and the only real 4x RTS on the market thanks to the current trends (console crowd, I'm looking at you). Other than that, horrid balance, pathfinding and AI, not a big mp crowd on the net. Good for skirmish and mods mostly.If you are into few tactics and many useless abilities, constant patching that breaks the balance even further, ridiculously powerful units that will negate your last two hours of effort in building fleet and defences by some magic gimmicky bs, this is definately for you.It is a step back (a giant leap for a mankind, though) from gems like Homeworld or any good 4xTBS, but there is nothing else on the market that would actually run without constant crashing or at least would try to represent 4x space srategy, so I give it a ""thumbs up"".The great amount of lore written for this title is wasted, because the game is watered down for multiplayer, so it feels hollow. And since you'd using the same tactic in MP over and over again until a new patch will change it only slightly, you will always win, because if the tactic works literally nothing can beat it. Even the Necrons in early Dark Crusade were more balanced, at least you could win against them if you really tried, here any other tactic except the winning few is useless. No strategic flexibility make this hardly a strategy game.You want a good in-depth strategy experience? Play Supreme Commander.Or better yet, find yourself a copy of Homeworld : Cataclysm or maybe Master of Orion.			"

												There are better empire building games.I spent a long time looking for something new to play and I have to say, I'm quite disappointed. The game has its fans and plenty of decent reviews, but for me, it fails on several fronts. 'Galactic Civilizations', 'Haegmonia:Legions of Iron' or 'Star Wars: Empire at War' will offer a better single player experience. ( I haven't played it multiplayer)Complex Diplomacy: good & badFleet Management: poorPlanet management: simpleShip classes and tech tree offer nothing newThe diplomacy is new compared to most games on the market. You have to research new options, use planets/starbases to expand influence or send envoy ships to boost good will. But by the tme you've got round to reseaching all those options chances are you'll already be banging heads with the neighbours.Fleets battles are not very fluid to control. Ships can be controlled either by grouping 1-9, specific fleet icons in the command bar, or zooming in at low level. But to select individual ships can be difficult and I found the command interface jumps around too much. Again its difficult to check how much health each ship has. Against lower levels of AI even a small fleet of Capital ships will win most battles.'Homeworld 2', 'Nexus: The Jupiter Incident' or even 'Star Wars: Empire at War' to me, offer better fleet simulators. Not much of an Empire game when your planet construction is limited to two types of Mining Facilities, Two types of shipyard (frigates and capital) and a trading post. Then a small mix of defences and a titan depot. The research tree handles some benefits, but the planetary shield only defends against super weapon blasts and soon fails against a small group of frigates.'Galactic Civ' 'SW: Empire at War' and the 'Total War' series can offer a better planet/city management.The ships range from Corvette, Frigate, Crusier, Capital, Titan (1 max). The amount you can have is limited by 2 reseachable upgrades that boost 'commanders' (needed for capital and titan) and 'supply' that limits you overall fleet size. Titans need 2 commanders and 150 supply, a frigate 0 commanders and 6 supply. Each ship has special abilites, a Torpedo/missile crusier, a heavy hitter, repair.  No stealth abilites though. The capital ships gain experience and unlock extra skills, so you need a mixed bag to win, but similarly just build a lot of big guns and you usually can still win. Coupled with the low survivability and skills of the smaller classes, once you start building big ships, frigates are redundant, and there isn't enough depth to the sytem to micromange the ships properly.

												Hi first of all,I do not hate this game, and it was a hard choise for me not to reccomend this.first of lets start at what this game does right.1 the game has nice grapichs. 2 fun gameplay. 3 intense battles.those are a few of the key things the game does right. but it can be hard at times.the game has you focus on stratagy more then anything else. witch makes it hard. I only recomend this game if you plan to play online with friends.what this game does wrong.1 No singleplayer campain. 2 games can take to long (not neseserly a bad thing. but can be really anoying if you dont have a lot of time to play.)3 Diplomacy is really bad.I did not like this game becouse there was no singleplayer campain. witch was a real downer for me, as you dont get to know why the races battle eachotther. or who they are to begin with.so you dont form a real connection with the races that are in the game.also sometimes the games take to long, even 1vs1 matches. can take you 2 hours. depending on map.it is not a bad thing. but when you have limited time to play can be fustrating,diplomacy is bad, I never got a computer ai to join me the best I got was trade. but then they suddently attack me.even when I trew tons of credits and recources to them. they never became friendly. or when doing their quests.this was reall annoying,so if you want to play with comp allies simply choose, locked teams. and add one to your team best thing to do.that was my review thanks for reading.hope it was helpful.

												THIS GAME HAS NO SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SKIRMISH AGAINST THE COMPUTER OR PLAY MULTIPLAYER WHICH TAKES FOREVER.^That's not the only reason you shouldn't buy this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game though. There's a whole lot of game mechanics that don't work as advertised, or are just annoying as hell. For example, if you are playing against all computer opponents and the pirate faction is ""on"" then trying to place money for a bounty on a CPU player in order to make the pirates leave you alone never ever works because the CPU players are programmed to spend twice as much to have the pirates come and attack you, and they will place the money to do it just a second before the pirates go active. It's completely broken and shouldn't be a part of the game. There are some things you simply can't toggle off, however. The worst example is superweapon spam by CPU players. And no, I shouldn't have to go download a mod that someone else made in order to fix it. That's the game studio's responsibility.The game also takes a LONG time to play a single skirmish or a game with your friends.The only pro I can think of for this game is that a bunch of enterprising modders have made some incredible overhauls for this game like Star Wars and Star Trek. But there again, Stardock doesn't get the credit. The base game you are buying sucks. SUCKS. Do not buy.			"

												It's too difficult for my taste. I've played 4X's and RTS's quite a bit, but combining them and giving the player a highly unhelpful tutorial, adding extremely complicated processes to everything, and making me pull my own hair out after five minutes in game, only made me hate this one instead of love it. I've requested a refund, and do not plan to touch any of the other Sins games.And before someone decides to berate me: Yes, I looked up a beginner's guide. It didn't help me one bit, as what the tutorial had 'tought' me had decided to completely fail to stick. I even went to YouTube and watched some videos. Not one of them helped either, as everything was too fast-paced for me to keep up with.Basically: This game may not be your cup of tea, especially if you really don't want to spend the next twenty-four hours or so just trying to wrap your brain around just the interface.

												TL:DR;If you are looking for extensive, in-depth 4X type of the game, turn back. This isn't it.Disbelieve all reviews that claim it is epic space strategy like a MoO or something. It's notReview:Sins of a Solar Empire is time and resource management RTS focused primarily on multiplayer.There is no single campaign, only skirmishes.As the game focused in this area it lacks depth pretty much everywhere. Pros:Good graphics.Different factions, ships, techs.Average sound.Overall faction balance, except pirates.Cons:Everything else. Really.- Shallow, silly research trees. - Limits on the space construction in the system.- AI cheats- no Single player campaign- dumbest achievements ever- overpowered pirate faction- ridiculous maps- very severe limits on the amounts of ships in game- price, DLC prices- very clunkly and messy UI. I had to lover resolution on 24"" display to be able to read fonts and see icons from a meter away!- diplomacy, totally pointless and confusing as hellConclusion:This is a game for quick online skirmishes, and if this is your thing, go ahead buy it.But if you are like me, fan of strategies with deep elements and ability to manage and plan and conduct spying and diplomacy missions, this simply is not your game.For me, it's money wasted :(			"

Like many games these days they demand account elsewhere in this case ""Stardock acoount"" wich main purpose seems to be a DRM one.Yet another account, name and password to be forgotten, yet another bloody way (at worst) to push community, newsletter, spammail rubbishry. I do not want any of it, I just want to play the damn game I paid for!This may seem quite petty, but one has to draw line with♥♥♥♥♥♥poor DRM and at worst spammail somewhere and this is where I draw mine. I can't recommend this game to anyone, even tho I have not seen one minute of it. But I can say that some lot should stick their acoounts and DRM's to a hole where sun doesent shine nor the solarwind reach.			"

												I really enjoy space rts games like sins. Unfortunatley the game cheats blatantly. if you play against anything other than the normal opponent (aka so easy i beat 8 opponents without losing one capital or even taking any planetary damage) almost all of the opponents will team up and attack at the same time. which is ok it makes it challenging, but for races at war why are 6 of the 8 computer players teaming up on one team??? if you are to drive them back and defend the game finds other ways to screw you. i have played many skirmish games in sins and when you start to beat the computer it will do things like speed up all the enemy ships... all of them, their fire rate goes up and my favorite which happened again today the game will halt all of your ships or let them move very very slowly to defend a world and only let your ships go one at a time and in order of weakest to strongest. what the ♥♥♥♥?? my titan arrived to warp first. all of my other ships caught up and jumped starting with my carriers. then once my first capital ship died my titan finally began charging up to warp... all of my ships were ungrouped and my titan was about 2 minutes ahead of the rest of them. this game has stupid bugs that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers need to fix. hard is fun cheating to this point makes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

												Well, unlike perhaps most gamers here I think SoaSE can absolutely not hold a candle to MOO2 (Master of Orion 2 Battle at Antares, a 4x turn-based space-strategy game from 1996! ). When starting the game and during the first 10 minutes or so it´s fun to play. The maps are large, you have to scout and to think which building to build next and so on. But: SoaSE just seems to offer more fluent gameplay due to being real time. But the more planets you conquer, the more gameplay grinds to a stop. Since your fleet supply is quite limited, you can only support 2 larger fleet groups and spend most of the time ""hyperjumping"" between systems looking for a weak spot in the enemys defense. This hyperjumping also being real time makes it a boring experience. Because there is no campaign but mere ""missions"" or sandbox gameplay, I can only recommend this game for multiplayers when it´s on sale. I have played SoaSE Rebellion and all it´s predecessors, always hoping the next title would be THE ONE that can get near to MOO2...  but I was disappointed all the time in the end.			"

												As far as a RTS space game goes, I really like the SoSE series. I own a few iterations of the series and find it to provide hundreds of hours of entertainment.As far as a company that can support their product, I've been frustrated. I went back and forth with Stardock regarding a previous Steam installation and a new install after a rebuild of my hard drive. I put Steam games and My Documents on a drive that is not my boot drive and Stardock is not able to handle the scenario. So...as long as you don't rebuild your computer or move away from vanilla windows settings you should be fine. Thankfully, Steam was very sympathetic and refunded my money.			"

												I would only vote yes But this game has nothing much to offer besides an uncharismatic sandbox game. No cinematics, no story line fellas. And after your first 20 maps you begin to feel that this game is quite lacking something.It quickly becomes boring... And the music begins to annoy you so much that you might need a bottle of aspirin on your desk as you romp through set made solar systems.A decent system is also recommended for the larger maps and if you want maxed out graphics as well otherwise your not gonna be happy. A graphics card beyond a Nvidia gtx 260 is your best bet. A safe one.My recommendation is to wait till this puppy's in the bargain bin and even then use a full conversion mod.I'd promise better results for whatever gameplay there is.Angry army reporting out.

												I played this game assuming it was all about domination adn taking control, basically a civ game in space but focusing on domination, however after playing many games with no ""culture"" in sight i assumed this wasn't a factor but after playing about 3 hours of one game and then loosing all my planets to someone elses ""culture"" i have decided enough is enough, you are not informed or warned about enemy culture or how to deal with it. The games mechanics are poorly desscribed (if at all) and at most the game is a 5/10, if you want to buy this game for cool space battles i strongly suggest  you buy something else. otherwise you will be overthrown with culture.if asked if i would recomend this game i would say yes but be warned it has many issues, many problems and in general is not well explained, i would recommend watching tutorials or let's plays before even approaching this pproduct.

												This game is just trash plain and simple, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to take a connect the dots RTS Ala Nano war or hyperpath (Which are both better games & free might I add) Then make it needlessly complex while simultaneously taking all entertainment out of it.The game pacing is dreadful, some games take over 200 hours to finish, I swear building my own space armada would be faster. This is not a game where time flies whilst playing like a good strategy game like Civ V or Age of empires, the sensation one gets from playing is much like waiting in a hospital, let this represent the high point of entertainment you get out of this game.Selling this game or any game for that matter based off of 99% cinematic trailers should be banned as they don't even serve to tell story (Which really there isn't any for this 'Game') This is not a game but an exercise in human will, to what length will 'Fans' go to pretend that they actually get any sense of enjoyment out of this god-awful rip-off of a game, this game is not worth the physical space a digital copy would take up let alone your money.Avoid it at all costs if you value your sanity and will to live.This game makes the steam refund policy deserve a rewrite.PS: Stardock/Ironclad don't post reviews on your own product it just looks bad and only serves to strengthen my arguments of the game being an overhyped piece of garbage.(It is also consumer fraud as stated in the comments section, the deletion of such is potential spoilation of evidence.)PSS: If any developer wishes to confront me, do it directly my messaging me on steam.Edit: Anybody who downvotes this without commenting is just proving my point and being part of the problem that is complete and total alienation of the consumer.

												Cool game. I remember playing it a few years back and was challenged for a few hours. Got a new PC and thought I would re live those moments. a few hours later, all installed, hit play, and get an account registration request. Canceled out of that as this is Steam. Nope. Have to create an account. Tried crteating said account, only to be greeted with an error and to email support... Not really worth the effort. I do not recommend. tl;dr: have to create stardock account to play. If their system doesnt work, you dont play. 0/10			"

												The AI is dumber than a pile of bricks and has all your information available in real time. It will not attack you unless it has a 100% chance of victory. It surrenders at the drop of a hat.I have had a few things brought to my rememberance about this game.....1. Desync issues2. No adjustable speed in MP any longer..... They broke it with entrenchment.....3. Single player is boring and not fun to play.....			"

												You will wait ages for the game to fill up and then the host will be away and on you go finding another match. half of the games will be either praivate or will kick you. If you manage to get in the game, one player will start lagging and will freeze the game ruinining it.so I can say it's literally unplayable			"

												What a piece of trash game. When you download a game from steam in 2016 I think you should be able to et a game that is  working properly. Not a game where i canno't connect to the Ironclad Servers which seems so have been an ongoing problem ever since this♥♥♥♥♥♥game was released on steam back in 2012 (2011?) and there still isn't a fix. So after spending 3 hours yesterday with two friends trying to figure out why I could not connect to the servers we gave up. What a waste of life and time.			"

												If you enjoy massive space battles, this isn't your game! Yes! It claims to be the biggest RTS game, and it is! But, one BLARING ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM WITH THIS ""MODERN"" GAME! NO MULTI-CORE CPU SUPPORT! What does that mean you ask? UNBELIEVABLE LAG when you produce large amounts of ships. I have a very powerful PC, but even with it, I can't play it. The lag gets so bad that you will literally sit for ten minutes, and about 10 frames have passed. 1 frame per minute. No I'm not joking. Stardock is a cheap, lame piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥company that refuses to make any form of decent foundation for a game. The game is ♥♥♥♥ING INCREDIBLE if you excuse the lag. They do not plan to fix it. There is no work around. So basically this game is broken.Better luck next time stardock.			"

												This game is slow paced, and when I say slow, I mean really slow. It gets boring after 20 minutes. I tried so hard to like this game, but I can't. There's not much you can do, all I see is that battles are painfully long and boring. It seems to me this game is mostly about battles and nothing more. Research is incredibly dumbed down, and the interface is annoying, especially where the units are shown at the top-left.This game is overrated.			"

												I'll keep this brief because I didn't play this for long. What it boiled down to for me was two things: 1) No story/campaign to play through, and 2) Poor game mechanics.

												Alot of people claim the AI cheats and after several restarts I can definatly say this is a huge yes. The last game I played I rush colonized 10 of the 15 planets with no resistance leaving only 5 worlds (1 pirate infested the other 4 taken by the AI). I set the AI at easy, disabled random events, and shut off the bonus starting stuff. I then sat back and fortified my stuff to the hilt including 2 fully armed starbases in each one (TEC special power). I built a huge fleet and leveled my capital ships to 3 (because you can't pay to train higher, at least thats what it told me over and over when I tried) when the AI finally built its Titan ship I sent a scout into the pirate sector and it was exactly the same meaning he had never touched it either. yet 10 minutes after building his titan and no enemies to fight in order to level up his capital ships, he flew into on of my gravity wells with a level 10 titan and 5 level 10 capital ships.... WTF!!! seriously? .... Well I am done with this game, Going back to MoO 3 at least its not a flaming bag of crap!			"

												The game is dated. Very dated. Extremely dated. How dated? The orignal game came out in 2008, and even after it became clear that the stats were lacking, the engine was never rebuilt. This game is so dated that at the time, they figured that, despite supporting mods, it would never need to use more than 2 GB of RAM. Rebellion was built as an expansion, using the same engine. These days, the game has been adjusted for modern RAM usage: it can now use 4 GB of RAM. As a result, graphics can be potentially better. Last I heard, Stardock was still facing legal challenges in various countries, so who knows if or when a Sins 2 will be released.In the meantime, this game is being milked for the last little bit of money that can be obtained from it. The Pricing of the ""Ultimate Edition"" being pushed in some places is a joke. The paid DLC content is something you can easily live without, because someone with a mod has probably already done it. ModDB is the place to check for mods that actually work.All that said, it's a fine old game for its time, with a value of perhaps $20, as a pack, all expansions included. It is NOT a $40 game. DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT GOES ON SALE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PRICE REDUCTION! Just don't. If you can get it for more than 1/2 off (like a 66% sale) buy it then. If you can get it on GOG.com, DRM free (don't try to work the Steam Sync BS), then buy it there instead.			"

												I think game is slow paced and too time consuming before anything interesting happens.I am a fan of grand stratagey games and love total war. I was hoping for total war in space but I got a uninvolving game that seems to be repetative and not exciting. I found no nail biting moments. It is advertised as epic space battles and managing an empire but seems a bit basic. I found it slow and it didn't drag me into it.  I forgot I owned the game. I clicked on the advert as it looks amazing but it didnt deliver.			"

												If you're a fan of either Homeworld or RTS, then just stop reading now and buy this game!  :)  Definitely one of my favorite titles - although I play it almost exclusively in LAN mulitplayer.  Excellent balance and nice research tree - each race has it's distrinct advantages, and with Rebellion you have two variations of each.  The AI is challenging, especially when you play vs 3 or 4 and have them allied together - plus it has random solar system generation, so the gameplay is basically infinite.			"

												This game is major fun by itself, and it's incredibly beautiful. Plus the mods are great: ""Sins of A Galactic Empire"" is a total conversion for Star Wars and ""Sins Of The Prophets"" Is a total reconversion of ""Halo"" If you read the Halo novel series you'd share the desire to fight in space against the Covanent. Imagine Playing on an 132 planet map and an hour in you're managing your capital planet and 270 Covenant warships slip-space in system and you're scrambling to muster your defences to make a last stand or for sins of a galactic empire mod fighting against the empire as the republic pretending you're the remenants of the republic which didn't join Darth Sideous.

												A 4X title where you play the role of one of three factions looking for galactic domination in a three way war. This is generally done by killing off the other factions but can be done in a variety of ways such as sending pirates to mess with their planets constantly, spreading your cultural influence and causing rebellions or just blowing their fleets and structures up with massive fleets and/or superweapons. The game itself looks stunning with every ship model looking amazing even when you can have hundreds of these things flying around and in all shapes and size from the tiny Cobalt light frigate to the massive Ankylon titan.Only downsides are there isn't a huge amount of players playing due to the fact that games can take a huge amount of time and it can lag quite badly with just the sheer mass of ships flying around. However if you can overcome these problems, this is a great way to spend a day with friends or just to kill some hours off. 9/10.			"

												I give this game a solid 7.5/10.  As far as RTS games go, this one has a lot of customization options that allow you to tweak it to your liking.  I bought it on sale and am glad I did, because for the full price I would have been let down a bit but simultaneously it fulfills that RTS need in my gaming collection better than any other I've ever played.  Pro/Con as follows:Pro:Great look, its amazing to zoom into the battle and see ship fleets just tearing each other up.  Micro is there, and you'll be rewarded for your skill, but its not as in your face as SC and other RTS games I've played before.  Macro in this game is a big part and most of what you'll use as the empire you build can be enormous.There are tons of maps to play, making the game very replayable and exciting.6 somewhat unique races that carry specific abilities to fit your style of play (might i suggest picking one and sticking with it until you understand the game)AI can be set to your liking and believe me, it delivers if you so choose it to.  Downright nasty even.Con:Battles can be so long. Honestly, even a 1v1 match can take more than an hour.  You'll definetely be saving and continuing at a later date with this game more often than not.  Not many people I would think have the time for large 50+ planet battles in one sitting.Huge learning curve if you've never played the Sins of a Solar Empire games, took me several days to even understand what I was doing.  Do the tutorials as many times as need be, it'll save you time in the long run.Maps are diff sizes, you can pick how big the map is and therefore roughly decide how long the battle will be, but know that most of the maps are bigger maps, and I feel the games just take too long.  The complexity of the game favors those that keep at it.  Just a little here and a little there won't cut it.  Those that practice their strategies and stick with their fav race will end up becoming extremely talented while those that play here and there will be left in the dust in online play due to the sheer amount of content you as an empire builder must be keeping track of at all times.  You've been warned.Music is annoying.  Turned it off within the first few hours.In closing, this game has so much to offer.  Those that want a very complex, high maintenance empire will love it.  Again, overall its a very good RTS game that I enjoy and it fulfills that role in my gaming collection extremely well, however, its not worth as much as they're charging at full price, sale price is where its at.  And I can't stress enough: make sure when you start a battle online that you've got some serious time on your hands.			"

												I'm not a huge strategy game fan, and I'm not very good at them. The reason I love this game is that it comes closer than any other game I've played to making me feel as if I'm leading an interstellar civilization in its conquest of the stars. There are games with better content, more variety, more control, more realism-- but this game just has the feel. I think that comes from the fact that it is real-time and your units are all fully rendered with their own individual positions and ranges, etc... You have to think about the battles as real events where every variable has to be considered, rather than a combat system that plays out more predictably with probabilities and numbers making all the difference. The other thing that creates this sense of authenticity is the camera. The camera can be seamlessly zoomed from a map of the entire galaxy down to an individual fighter craft. This makes the game feel as if it has real things in a world, and not pieces on a game board. While people still play this game in multiplayer, it can be hard to get a match going, and hard to keep everyone playing for the 8 or so hours it can take to finish a match-- and it can take much longer if you want! When you do get one going though, it can be pretty glorious. Playing offline with the AI is very enjoyable though. This game has lots of options when setting up a match and you can create all kinds of interesting scenarios for yourself. There is no campaign mode though, so players will need to be self-directed. The variety of gameplay is further increased by a map editor, random maps, and mod support. I would recommend this game to: someone who wishes starcraft was in space and on a grander scale; someone who wants a streamlined 4x game with lots of action; someone who wants to lead vast space armies in their conquest of the stars. If you're looking for the end-all be all of micromanagement and simulation you might be dissapointed. If you have the itch for epic space battles however, this game will surely scratch it.			"

												One of the grandest scale RTS games out there, it plays like a larger version of Star Wars: Empire at War with increased micromanaging and interactions between factions. It runs reasonably well on mid-grade systems with smaller maps, though the sheer scale of larger campaigns will bog down all but the most powerful machines. Unlike SW:EaW there is no ground component, so defend your planets carefully as you won't have the opportunity to repel invasion once the system falls to enemy naval forces.Great if you have a friend to play it with, but the games tend to run too long to just find a match online and play it. Be prepared to sink five hours into a medium campaign or even more into a larger one.			"

												""A very suprising game. Definitely a good purchase, spent quite a few hours in the game and had fun playing against AI. Can't wait to get better at this game and play some online some time.""This was my original review when I only had clocked a few hours of game time. After having played more games I would definitely recommend this game to this anyone who is fan of the RTS or 4X genre. The strong points of the game come in the form of great research trees, wonderful diplomacy aspects and an interesting pirate mechanic. There are 3 seperate research paths for each race, with some unique upgrades to each race. Diplomacy has to researched in the respected research path, with the ability to offer pacts and agreements to other players. The pirate system in the game works by having a neutral race (which can be toggled on and off) attack the player with the highest bounty on their head, this often leads to bounty war in order to get the pirates attention off you and onto the enemy. One of the downsides to the game is that each game takes an eon to complete. We can be talking hours to finish a medium to large game.Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in Sci-Fi RTS games.			"

												From an RTS fan to other gamers, this is one of the best Sci-Fi RTS games out there! If you don't have it yet, you must add it to your collection.Sins of a Solar Empire's story is that the Humans (Trade Order, Trader Emergency Coalition) was living in a millennia of peace where the only ''real combat'' was light skirmishes with pirates and such, until a menace called the Vasari arrived and began exterminating Human worlds one by one, until, of course, the Humans converted their vast trading fleet into a military asset. The new fleet held the Vasari back until a long forgotten enemy - the Advent - arrived back and stormed the other side of the TEC colonies and that's about it. The three sides have been at war for decades.The story for Sins of a Solar Empire could be a lot longer, but it's gameplay is fantastic! You research new technologies using materials like credits, metals and crystals, and to unlock new ships you must research their hull design and then build them using the appropriate shipyard. There are multiple types of Capital ships in the game, ranging from a Battleship and Battlecruiser to a massive Dreadnought that can annihilate planets.The smaller ships are also of different type. The most basic frigate is a light frigate, a multi-purpose combat vessel that serves as the bulk of ANY fleet in the game. The light frigates can be supported with support frigates, like ones equipped with Flak cannons or planetary bombardment frigates. Then come the cruisers. The cruisers are heavier, more durable ships than the frigates, but are still divided into support roles and combat roles. The heavy cruisers are close-range combatants that close the distance between the ships and fire with their punishing close-range weapons. The support cruisers include light carriers, starbase constructors, diplomatic envoys and command cruisers.Light carriers, as the name implies, are smaller than the carriers in the game and they are lightly armed, however, when in bulk, their swarm of fighters can chew down even a small fleet of enemy ships. Starbase constructors are ships that assemble the mighty starbases - outposts of your empire that can serve as military superstructures in orbit around your planets, distant trading outposts or as an auxiliary government. The diplomatic envoys are ships used to establish and improve relations with other factions and they are unarmed and lightly protected. Command cruisers are ships used to improve fire coordination among the ships of a fleet. It can increase accuracy to all ships, but they do not sport heavy guns themselves. Only ones used to protect against fighters and bombers.The game also has a diplomacy aspect of the game. Relations in the game are improved using the envoy-type ships. When the relations between factions are ''warm'' enough, both sides can establish treaties among themselves and eventually form an alliance.All in all, the game is a wonder in today's gaming world.P.S. If you don't like the vanilla game, you can apply mods to it. For Halo fans out there - there is a Halo mod called ''Sins of the Prophets''.			"

												Sins Rebellion added some interesting ships and abilities and that was just fine but giving one faction the ability to move a mobile starbase into an opponents planetary orbit was a questionable move. As I understand it a lot of players don't want the faction to be an option in thier multiplayer games unless an agreement is made not to move the bases into unfriendly orbits. While I have not experienced this myself I have been told of it by three seperate people. Other than that I don't have a big problem with the additions made to the game. Very much like the new planets and stars, extra variety is almost always a plus. The Titans (while powerful) are not locks for victory but they sure can help. Just one other thing I would have changed. I would have gotten rid of mines all together. Don't have a very good reason other than they just irritate the crap out of me.			"

At one point i had a fleet of about 100 cruiser and 2-3 capital ships and thats just what i can remember.  Titans in this game are ridiculous as well, pretty much their own fleet really.

												This is what RTS is all about.  Build then expand to take over all other forces.  Fun exciting an has a lot of great features to provide good challenges for yourself.   Excellent map making mode with the ability to add tons of star an planets around to them to try an over take.   Only downside for me is that they have not added new units to each faction to have more fun with to play with.  TBH i wish they had a expansion pack that was roughly 10$ worth that added at least 10 extra units that did more for a selected faction in which players liked to play with.  To give more entertaining fun.    Increase the number of troops to beable to be built an so on.  All in all if you like the old school C&C game play but with space an more modern graphics.  This game is well worth the money an fun with friends or online vs others who enjoy it.   I personally would recommend this game to rts fans.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion doesn't fundamentally change the series; however, it brings together the concepts developed in the trinity that came before it and prefects them. Each faction feels unique, with both strengths and weakness. Take the galaxy with an armada of capital ships, use swarms of fighters and bombers, or dig in with giant defense stations and slowly advance through cultural domination; the choice is yours. Sins of a Solar Empire is a fast, intuitive, and beautiful RTS that shouldn't be passed up by anyone interested in the genre.			"

												Sins is a great RTS game.  If you love to plan out strategy, build defenses, amass giant armadas of ships, definetly check this out.  Plus, rebellion allows for two types of specializations for the core three factions of Sins, and Titan ships are exceptional to use.  Great graphics, smooth gameplay all around, and even a map editor!  Learning curve is pretty smooth, and you can even ramp up AI difficutly mid game.  With diplomacy and special defensive options, plenty of research, and epic scale galaxies to use, this is a very fun game.The only problem you may have with it is it takes long times to begin games, and they can last very long.  But you can always save and come back to them later, so its a minor problem.Look it up, its very underrated but awesome!			"

												This gameis like a hybrid between Civilizations 5 and Starcraft. There are 3 races, withan offensive and defensive track for each. This is technically an RTS, but gameplay is drastically slowed down. You generally won'tbe able to fit in a whole game in one sitting. There is no campaign which is one of its only drawbacks.			"

												I really enjoy 4x strategy games.  While I am usually more focused on the turn based 4X games this game really appeals to me for 2 reasons.  The research mechanics are still there and are timed like most RTS games however the tech tree is vast and I find myself changing my tech tree choices from game to game, rather than falling to a single pointed strategy each time.  The only downside I can really see if that the UI (particularly the empire overview) can be very hard to follow for a new player.  Another downside is that Combat is slow and battles seem to lumber on.  While I don't see that interfering with my enjoyment I can see how that migh prevent some people from enjoying the combat.			"

There are certain paths you can take that always beat the computer no matter what, or so it seems.  Didn't try playing a networked game against other players though.  That may change my mind a bit.

												One of the best games I have ever played, and most definitely the most impressive space based RTS/4X game I've ever had the joy of playing. Stunning visuals and solid gameplay make this game a must have.This game is made great for any playstyle, with versatile early game units to quickly rush your opponents, and beefy end game starships for trully epic encounters and turtling. For those with quick fingers and reflexes, every single unit has some kind of ability that is great when auto-cast, but even better when manually timed making micro a viable option. On the other hand, by late game you can bunch up a ton of poweful units and capital ships with abilities on auto-cast to make short work of any traget or fleet of any size.The three factions are balanced to a key. The Vasari are built around hit-and-running lightly defended planets, and completely strip mining less useful planets. The Advent are good for more tactical and micro-managerial attacks, relying on shields and debuffs to overpower opposing fleets. The TEC are built around smashing bulky and heavily armed and armored ships against even the strongest defenses and fleets while remaining safe behind powerfull starbases. On top of that, each faction is split into a Loyalist and Rebel faction creating even more diversity with six different abilities and ultra-ships, the titans.With solid action-filled gameplay and thought out lore (found mainly in the research you do) this game will provide a satisfying experience for anyone; casual or skill-based, turtling or rushing, fast or slow, strategy and action, visually and technically it is one of the best investements in a game you can make.

Fleets in the thousands commanded by capital ships who are dwarfed by a factions unique titan that has incredible abilities.... if used right. From culture overthrowing to  sniping a planet with a Novalith canon. This RTS allows player to play on their own speed. To those with Sins of solar empire experience already. This stand alone expansion only requires a upgrade from the stardock store which makes it cheaper to purchase.			"

												A fantastic game that will give you hours and hours of enjoyment, this includes all of the previous games and expansions for this 4X-lite series. Epic space battles and armadas and strategy on a multi-galactic scale, the only slight problems I have with this title are the fact that there's very little micro-management (so don't be expecing a 200 APM Stracraft 2-alike) and the research trees are a little bit lopsided. However, if you want a game with tactical thinking, a strong cast of 3 different races and some truly brilliant in-game systems as well as some very, very pretty graphics (just watch a battle unfold!), then look no further. For fans of the sci-fi RTS genre, I wholeheartedly recommend this title.			"

												This is a nice space RTS game, without a campaign (which is a pity). It's 2D tactics with a 3D engine. The research trees are quite extensive for an RTS, and there are some minor variations betwen the 3 playable races.You can set up games with several AI or human opponents, in maps that range from small to pretty enormous, meaning some games will easily take many hours. It's a solid title and it could have been great with a good campaign, but if a campaign is not what you're looking for give it a shot.			"

												If you like any classic 4X game, you'll like Sins of a Solar Empire. This version, Rebellion, is essentially everything that was missing to round out the original game. More depth and strategy through added titan ships, starbases, and different ways to win the game (haven't tried any of these, still use traditional kill everybody else for a win).Personally, I think this game is one of the easiest in the RTS genre to get into. This could be due to starting with the original sins of a solar empire, which had fewer ships, only three research paths, and each race didn't have the loyalist vs rebel split. However, if you're looking for an easy game to learn for getting into the RTS genre, I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Sins Rebellion added some interesting ships and abilities and that was just fine but giving one faction the ability to move a mobile starbase into an opponents planetary orbit was a questionable move. As I understand it a lot of players don't want the faction to be an option in thier multiplayer games unless an agreement is made not to move the bases into unfriendly orbits. While I have not experienced this myself I have been told of it by three seperate people. Other than that I don't have a big problem with the additions made to the game. Very much like the new planets and stars, extra variety is almost always a plus. The Titans (while powerful) are not locks for victory but they sure can help. Just one other thing I would have changed. I would have gotten rid of mines all together. Don't have a very good reason other than they just irritate the crap out of me.			"

												What you're dealing with in this game is a 4x macro RTS. Ie you cant effectively micro manage any forces aside from your workers. Even still this game is great to play and is an excellent time sink and I'm very happy purchasing this game.			"

												Any sins of a solar empire game is amazing.  Build large armies, upgrade technology, capital ships have special powers.  There's a lot of strategy and a lot of very intense battling.  Very good ai and lots of customization,  lots of great mods for the series also.  I think diplomacy was my favorite however.  Tons of action, depth, strategy.  Such a great game!!!!			"

												Amazing graphics.Amazing gameplay and strategy.And above all, its so much fun!The games can be played quickly or slowly. Sometimes your game takes 30 minutes, and sometimes you can make it last for hours.And mods allow you to change the entire game, you can turn all the ships into StarTrek, Starwars or even Battlestar galactica ships with a single mod.A musthave!

												From an RTS fan to other gamers, this is one of the best Sci-Fi RTS games out there! If you don't have it yet, you must add it to your collection.Sins of a Solar Empire's story is that the Humans (Trade Order, Trader Emergency Coalition) was living in a millennia of peace where the only ''real combat'' was light skirmishes with pirates and such, until a menace called the Vasari arrived and began exterminating Human worlds one by one, until, of course, the Humans converted their vast trading fleet into a military asset. The new fleet held the Vasari back until a long forgotten enemy - the Advent - arrived back and stormed the other side of the TEC colonies and that's about it. The three sides have been at war for decades.The story for Sins of a Solar Empire could be a lot longer, but it's gameplay is fantastic! You research new technologies using materials like credits, metals and crystals, and to unlock new ships you must research their hull design and then build them using the appropriate shipyard. There are multiple types of Capital ships in the game, ranging from a Battleship and Battlecruiser to a massive Dreadnought that can annihilate planets.The smaller ships are also of different type. The most basic frigate is a light frigate, a multi-purpose combat vessel that serves as the bulk of ANY fleet in the game. The light frigates can be supported with support frigates, like ones equipped with Flak cannons or planetary bombardment frigates. Then come the cruisers. The cruisers are heavier, more durable ships than the frigates, but are still divided into support roles and combat roles. The heavy cruisers are close-range combatants that close the distance between the ships and fire with their punishing close-range weapons. The support cruisers include light carriers, starbase constructors, diplomatic envoys and command cruisers.Light carriers, as the name implies, are smaller than the carriers in the game and they are lightly armed, however, when in bulk, their swarm of fighters can chew down even a small fleet of enemy ships. Starbase constructors are ships that assemble the mighty starbases - outposts of your empire that can serve as military superstructures in orbit around your planets, distant trading outposts or as an auxiliary government. The diplomatic envoys are ships used to establish and improve relations with other factions and they are unarmed and lightly protected. Command cruisers are ships used to improve fire coordination among the ships of a fleet. It can increase accuracy to all ships, but they do not sport heavy guns themselves. Only ones used to protect against fighters and bombers.The game also has a diplomacy aspect of the game. Relations in the game are improved using the envoy-type ships. When the relations between factions are ''warm'' enough, both sides can establish treaties among themselves and eventually form an alliance.All in all, the game is a wonder in today's gaming world.P.S. If you don't like the vanilla game, you can apply mods to it. For Halo fans out there - there is a Halo mod called ''Sins of the Prophets''.			"

												This gameis like a hybrid between Civilizations 5 and Starcraft. There are 3 races, withan offensive and defensive track for each.

												I really enjoy 4x strategy games.  While I am usually more focused on the turn based 4X games this game really appeals to me for 2 reasons.  The research mechanics are still there and are timed like most RTS games however the tech tree is vast and I find myself changing my tech tree choices from game to game, rather than falling to a single pointed strategy each time.  The only downside I can really see if that the UI (particularly the empire overview) can be very hard to follow for a new player.  Another downside is that Combat is slow and battles seem to lumber on.  While I don't see that interfering with my enjoyment I can see how that migh prevent some people from enjoying the combat.			"

												This game is like Civ but in space and a little bit less focused on specifics. It's more combat/space oriented. It's a great game though. The music is good. The combat/strategy elements are interesting and mildly expansive. I prefer to play these types of games with the largest maps and as many adversaries as possible to dominate. This thing offers maps with 145+ planets to colonize and up to 12+ different other civilizations to fight against (though they don't call them that). It is a fun game, although I only played one very long campaign, which isn't reflected here because Steam seems to forget my time randomly. I recommend it for RTS players who enjoy Sci-Fi in general. Though don't expect to take it so seriously. The game isn't /*that*/ deep. I didn't touch the multiplayer section. Not my thing. But I can see it being pretty great for those who like that stuff.

												I never like to recommend games or review them based on the first 10 or so hours of gameplay. But you start this game and it's enough to convince you. At first the game looks absolutely daunting by the array of strategic choices you can make.Surprisingly the game is pretty easy to manage once you have everything in motion. All of the management aspects are easily accessible and information is very clearly displayed. Combat pretty much resolved itself as long as you have managed to make them powerful enough to overcome anything they come across; this can be both a good and bad thing depending on the level of micromanagement you desire.This game runs beautifully, I expected framerate drops when huge clusters of fleets meet in battle but to my delight I experienced smooth gorgeous gameplay.

												This is an amazing game. It's great for playing with your friends, and for skirmishes with the AI. Unfortunately that's all there is to this game. Multi-Player and Skirmishes. There is no campaign, and that in itself is very disappointing. But don't let that put you off from buying it. It's gorgeous, challenging, entertaining, and loads of fun (albeit a bit difficult at times). Unlike Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations, Sins is real time. So every split second decision counts. The AI is a juggernaut of difficulty no matter what setting you have it on, so every little plan makes the difference of success or failure. Unless you're a master of strategy, this game will frustrate you at times. One moment you're blasting away at the galaxy, the next moment there are Titans coming at you from every angle.There are lots of different research topics for each and every civ you choose, and each one is vastly different than the others. Ship options are quite large, and every ship has it's own abilities and strategic usefulness. The buildings have a build limit, until you start to expand your empire. Each new planet adds new resource bonuses, building caps, tech options, etc.Unlike games like Age of Empires, Sins sort of forces you to expand and explore, otherwise you won't get the necessary amount of buildings certain research items require, the resources needed to build massive fleets, and so on. You also can't just sit around and let your stockpiles grow, build a battalion of ships, and expect to win in one attack. You'll soon learn that the enemy has already colonized 4 planets, each with it's own armada, and enough spare ships on it's way to wipe out your home planet.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is an awesome experience, and a very challenging one. If you like that sort of thing, you will absolutely love this game. The only disappointing thing about this game is the lack of a campaign. Everything else is a work of genius, a real masterpiece. I highly recommend any RTS lover to buy this game right away.			"

												Awesome 4X RTS. Imagine an entire solar system at war... Fleets of Frigate and Capital class duking it out in the gravity well of a planet... The surface of a planet being scoured with nuclear fire... Solid shot, missiles, lasers, plasma bolts and particle beams zigzagging accross the void of space. This is Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.A must have if you love space RTS with an excellent selection of balanced races, ships, space and planetary improvements to constuct. Starting out from a single undeveloped planet, you expand and conquer your way through entire solar systems with the help of industry, technology and lots of big ships and guns of course... There are also nice diplomacy features which can really cement and improve your standing amongst the allies you definitely will need to create the foundation of your space empire (remember to keep your friends close, but your enemies closer).  I must also fondly mention the Starbase aspect (mostly static super defensive structures) and Titan Class ship (unique super ships) which really turns the late game into quite a battle for domination.I heartily recommend this game to anyone who wishes to sit for 4 hours playing a game without actually noticing the time going by... because they are having a blast (or too busy watching a planet getting scoured by dozens of nukes (or orbital laser weapons) ;-) ) "

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion attempts to enhance the overall gameplay while also adding in new factions (Rebels) and new units called TItans that Ironclad Games hopes will make the gameplay all the more enticing. Coming in at $40 (USD) and cheaper during sales, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion tries to be more than just a simple expansion pack, but can it keep the gameplay as engaging as ever?Well, first off, don't go into this game thinking ""oh it'll look MAGNITUDES better than Sins of a Solar Empire"". Sure the game is still quite a looker, even this long from release, but, in the end, the game just refines the graphics from the original. Though one has to say that the Titan's designs makes them look not just unique, but intimidating. You KNOW when bad news is coming when you see a humongous Titan burst forth onto the scene. This, coupled with the overall improvements, helps make Rebellion look as good as it ever was.Sound wise, the soundtrack here is still outstanding. It keeps the change in tone based on what is going on in your field of view that made the soundtrack in the original Sins so good. Needless to say, there is rarely a bad song in this soundtrack, so it is almost entirely recommended to buy the soundtrack to this game when you pick it up (either at full price or during sales). Audio design si also really good, as you have the loud explosions along with the various ""pew pew(s)"" that each ship does when firing on enemy. Granted, unless you zoom almost all the way in you won't hear the rumbling of the engines, but overall the sound design in this game is really good.Which takes us to quite possibly the most important aspect of this game: the gameplay. The game gives you a variety of different win conditions. Some of these include: last flagship standing (turns games into more of a ""hunt for the enemy's flagship"" than outright domination), last capital standing (not the best of modes, considering you can easily win just by rushing the opponent's homeworld with bombers), and research (which, to be honest, is really only good for single player games). While it doesn't offer the ginormous ways of winning in, say, Galactic Civilizations II or even Civilization V, the modes still serve to help make each game feel different.In terms of maps and scenarios, well..Ironclad separates them into four categories: small, medium, large, and the user-created Galaxy Forge (which I'll get to in a bit). Each size drastically changes how each game plays out. Say you want a simple 2v2, you can pick small or medium-sized scenarios and each will require a different set of strategies. Take small, for instance, this map size nearly requires rushing the enemy as soon as possible, and games usually end fairly quickly (well for a 4X game at least). Medium sized maps offer the most variety as you can go for heavy defense, but also succeed with rushing. With large-maps, building a gigantic army and grinding the opponent down almost always takes precedence. The scenarios themselves offer up a great variety of gameplay. One puts you in a system with only three (four?) planets, but grant you the relic that allows early wormhole usage, but at the cost of the wormholes being about the only way of travelling across the map. Another may give you a lot of resources, but put you in what can be technically called a giant arena. While another splits one half of the map into ice planets and the other into lava. Needless to say, you can easily spend hundreds, if not thousands, of hours just playing each scenario by yourself.The fundamental gameplay is improved upon from Diplomacy. The advent of Titans changes things up enough to where you now have more than just three ways to play the game (attacker, defense, resource). Now you can play the part of someone going straight for his/her Titan and building strarbases for others. The new factions as well change up the gameplay. Each faction has around six technologies (as well as one Titan) that makes them play out differently from each other. Even factions of the same race (like Advent) can play differently from Rebel to Loyalist. Take the given example of Advent. While you would still be going for the culture victory (which is what Advent is strong with), the fact that the Rebels have a technology that pracitcally gives you a free replacement ship (though the chances of it happening are not very high) when one dies, changes things up to where you don't have to worry as much about your fleet being decimated. You will still be going around and playing it 4X style, however. But, the fact that this is in real time (like the original Sins), changes things up as well. Now you have to always be concerned about enemies knocking at your door no matter what you are doing, as playing the game as a turn-based 4X game will only lead to failure. RTS skills (and copious amounts of micromanagement) literally win the day over slow, methodical movements.The aforementioned Galaxy Forge practically guarantees an endless supply of new maps...if it worked like how it did in Command and Conquer. Sadly, sharing these maps with friends is a huge pain in the rear, despite the ability to make different types of galaxies. Also, the in-game editor leaves a lot to be desired, as you only get to set planets, map size, and such from pull-down menus. There is no custom placement of planets and phase lanes in-game, though if you run it outside of the game, you can technically make some amazing maps. Though, again, it is rather unfortunate that sharing said maps can't be done in-game with a downloader to encourage more people to use the Galaxy Forge.Mod support for this game is hit or miss. There are amazing mods out there, yes, but most of them (Sins of a Galactic Empire (the Star Wars mod) comes to mind), are broken beyond belief because Ironclad broke the finely-tuned mod support. Now, despite finding a mod that is SUPPOSED to be amazing, you have to read comments to make sure it doesn't crash like crazy. Granted, some of the blame CAN be put on the modders themselves, but, the game is still pretty broken for mods in general.Average game length once you get started varies by map size. The smaller maps take, at most, two to three hours to complete; medium is around three to four; the biggest can take upwards of eight or more hours to complete, leading to some rather epic (in length) games. This basically means you should NOT go into this game thinking that the games would be as long as, say, Command and Conquer or Starcraft 2. However, for those of us who love these types of games, Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion satisfies that itch almost as good as a good game of Galactic Civilizations II.Should you buy? Well, yes and no. It all depends on what your tastes are. If you love 4X games, and don't mind them being in real time, then Sins is a must-buy. However, if you want an RTS game that doesn't take forever to complete, then avoid this game. Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is a finely-tuned, and (despite the broken mod support) great blend of the 4X genre and real time strategy games. With plenty of differences to make this game feel different (but not unique) to Diplomacy (and the original Sins, at that), Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion offers a lot of value for the dollar. Plenty of scenarios to keep you engaged for a long time, gameplay that stays engaging even ten hours into a single game, and graphics that, while not mindblowing, are still a treat for the eyes makes this game an easy buy for anyone who may be curious about it. Though, as I said before, avoid this if you don't like RTS games with matches that take hours to complete, as you would only be wasting your money.			"

												This game features massive real time strategy without the speed and accessibility of real time strategy. Engage in games that take 8 hours only to end in an unwinnable stalemate or perhaps go online and experience the joys of having a pre pubescent sociopath question your sexuality for hours over the mic and then rage quit after you finally build up for an attack. That being said the futility of this game isn't immediately apparent and some basic calculus determines that the area under the rapidly diminishing fun curve still warrants a buy in my opinion. "

												Highly reconmended game for those that are fans of space combat or empire mangement. Given the good amount of replay value this game has, it is definitely worth it's price. Also to note, the first dlc showed good worth from adding new planet types and a new planet specialization (either a social or industrial focus which was an interesting and agreeable addtion) it gave the gameplay an even better dynamic. As a notice towards the dlc, it was a pretty fair add-on which was surprising to see given the way companies do add ons to games these days.			"

												The best of a Real Time Strategy game that went under radar. It is what a RTS is and should be. This makes any other known RTS games like young kids play. You start of so small to first conquer adjacent planets and steroides of many types, then conquer the solar system to finaly conquer the galaxy in the biggest largest scale ever seen. You can zoom out your camera to see all galaxies up to zooming in to the single vessel all in HD quality and very very detailed especially when 200+ ships are in combat and they're all firing in the same time makes the battles so very satisfying.In this game, you do not simply building an army. You develop your culture, religion and anything socialy related or you can also develop your industries to manufacture ships, weapons, stations. You can concentrate on your resource retrival effectiveness. So many things to do all so important! Space pirates are a constant threat especially is your opponents have bribed them to attack your planets.One negative thing about it: Even if it's a 1 on 1 on a small scale map againts the computer, one simgle game may last an hour or two. So huge games where it's a 8 on 8 with half a dozen galaxies could take days even weeks to finish. But if you ever wish the game to accelerate it is possible to adjust the speed of the game.There's default maps where it's always the same planetsat the same position  with the same resources or you can radomize the map making it different every time you play a game.I can give all my money that this is the best RTS ever made so far.** 9/10 **+ Lots and lots and lots of diversaty+ Supberb graphic and very detailed on ships and planets+ Maps of all sizes are small to impresively huge- Long matches			"

												I never like to recommend games or review them based on the first 10 or so hours of gameplay. But you start this game and it's enough to convince you. At first the game looks absolutely daunting by the array of strategic choices you can make.Surprisingly the game is pretty easy to manage once you have everything in motion. All of the management aspects are easily accessible and information is very clearly displayed. Combat pretty much resolved itself as long as you have managed to make them powerful enough to overcome anything they come across; this can be both a good and bad thing depending on the level of micromanagement you desire.This game runs beautifully, I expected framerate drops when huge clusters of fleets meet in battle but to my delight I experienced smooth gorgeous gameplay.

The fact that this game is unpopular shows how yucky a taste this generation has for games, I am hooked I LOVE this game! I really can tell you guys put all your heart and soul into this game as previous reviewers have said, the detail and scale is incredible. You guys at Stardock/Ironclad really know your stuff, a very original one of a kind game for sure I will not only be buying all dlc's/expansions but any future sins games! 100/10 Love it, everybody should give it a try and make an effort to learn the game, you owe it to yourself. I saw a very disturbing review here where a guy saidd ""Do not buy it unless it's on sale"" ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? This game is worth every penny!!! I would pay $60 for this game if it were that much! He has more than double my playtime logged as of now, not a true fan though it seems, if you are so unhappy with this game explain why you spent so much time playing it???????

												Having played SoaSE since its original release in 2008, I can say that this game is the definitive iteration a space RTS. It is a bit sandbox, since no campaign exists, but the back-story sets up skirmishs well enough. Rebellion has gorgeous graphics, and scales well on older machines (I had a budget laptop from 2010 that could play this on low, no dedicated graphics card).The Titans are glorious beasts without being too overpowered, and the new Stellar Phenomena DLC adds more ambience to Rebellion. The sense of scale is astounding: you can go from managing a single colony ship, to watching a massive fleet duke it out over a resource-rich terran world.Each race has a different UI, which helps with immersion, as well as very well-made musical pieces that is played during gameplay.

												I can't stop playing this game, too good. A lot of people complaining are complaining about a lack of story/campign or that it's too hard to get into. The story is there, you're making it up as you play the game is my attitude on the story, I do this with most rts and 4x, i go in a certain way and play a certain way. I did hope there was a campign when i bought it, but nope. BUT it doesn't need one at all. Regaring the difficulty playing or getting into it, those people MUST be trolls honestly. I didn't even do the tutorial, I've never played the older Sins game, I've never played 4x  before this and from the Gecko i figured it out in like five minutes. Do degress I played Civilization V without tutorials, it was pathetically easy and that game is greatly more in depth.Get this game!On a side note the only dlc worth getting is the forbidden worlds, the stellar Phenomena is all right, it just adds like random events like these magnetic clouds that stop abilities or strike crafts and these really annoying rebels that come off the map to like undefended worlds. It doesn't really affect the game much but it can if you take advantage of them which is solely relying on luck. So it's not needed. "

												""A very suprising game. Definitely a good purchase, spent quite a few hours in the game and had fun playing against AI. Can't wait to get better at this game and play some online some time.""This was my original review when I only had clocked a few hours of game time. After having played more games I would definitely recommend this game to this anyone who is fan of the RTS or 4X genre. The strong points of the game come in the form of great research trees, wonderful diplomacy aspects and an interesting pirate mechanic. There are 3 seperate research paths for each race, with some unique upgrades to each race. Diplomacy has to researched in the respected research path, with the ability to offer pacts and agreements to other players. The pirate system in the game works by having a neutral race (which can be toggled on and off) attack the player with the highest bounty on their head, this often leads to bounty war in order to get the pirates attention off you and onto the enemy. One of the downsides to the game is that each game takes an eon to complete. We can be talking hours to finish a medium to large game.Overall I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in Sci-Fi RTS games.			"

												Great strategy game.   *****  9/10Good fun when playing online with friends or singleplayer against computers (which get cry-yourself-to-sleep tough). there are 3 factions each having a loyalist and rebel choice with there own style of play and awsome abilities. From big♥♥♥♥♥interstellar nuke weapons to moving starbases to crusiers that dwarf the smaller planets. The scale of the game is massive.  Not to mention the fact that you can create your own multi star-system maps and customise every detail about them: from Planets to Pirate bases and Asteroids to Antimatter pools floating about in space.The game is huge. Mindbogglingly huge. There is so much detail and so much fun that it can easily take up half your day.There are 2 issues however;The first is that it's highly addictive... OK that isn't really a problem. However the lack of a campaign limits the depth of which you can play. Although you can still crank out a good 6 hour game with virtually limitless variability. Also, if the gameplay doesn't win you over, then the simple beuty in the detail of everything from the intensity of the laser weapons right down to the windows on the moving fortresses are sure to get anyones engines rolling.

												One of my favorite games. The level of strategy involved in this game will make any ARTS fan busy for hours as you as you try to one up your opponents with researching technology, building fleets, fortifying your home worlds, collecting resources and trying to out maneuver your enemies in one of the best space RTS's out there. The graphics are amazing and the game was well polished with smooth frame rates and no glitches. With expansions packs always being developed, there is always new content to expand what was already an amazing game from the very beginning.			"

												I have over 100 hours into this game, and here's my thoughts if you're thinking of getting it.Your gameplay experience will evolve in real time from starting on your home planet, scouting nearby worlds/asteroids/gas giants/etc, and gradually expand your empire.  Most of your fleets will consist of one to a few capital ships (basically your hero units that can level up) supported by anything from light attack frigates to carriers to support ships with unique abilities.  You'll quickly come into contact with other races, and you can try to work with or against them.  You'll start working on your tech tree and focus on unlocking new ships, defensive structures, or diplomatic measures.  All items can be researched, but you'll probably focus on a few core areas. Routes into your empire can be fortified, or you can spend that money on another fleet and attack.  It's really it up to you how you dictate the flow of the game, and that's a strong part of it.There's communities you can join if multiplayer is your scene, but I would approach this as being a single player game.  There's no story or campaign though, just various maps you can adjust to play on.  There's an editor to create your own maps, or you can find ones made by others online and play theirs.If you enjoy space based games, you'll love this.  The visuals work well together, and the music adds to the ambiance.  There's lots of pew pew laser/missle/drone/cannon/etc battles you can zoom in and watch, while directing your various armadas.  There's ships that range in size from recon to destroyer of worlds.  I've tried other similar genre 4x space games, but after playing this, I can't get into them. The easiest comparison I could make is to Civ V, but both games are different.  Sins Rebellion has the 3 main races, and these are divided into two groups, giving 6 different ""empires"" to play with.  They all have different strategies and styles.Tech, trade, diplomacy, war, both offense and defense, culture, or combonations of strategies are viable (against the AI).There are two mini DLC's available, and they both add slight depth, but not essential to the experience.  You can always get them later on, and I do reccommend them.Cons - Space battles can feel like they can drag on at times.  They game time itself can be hours long, anywhere from 2-6, depending on how aggressive you are and largely on the map size.  If you want a quick game, this may not be for you.  I would really like to see more fluff or story built into the game, but the game experience itself isn't lacking because of that. "

												I've played Sins of a Solar Empire since the first iteration, played the expansions, and now, I've had some time to play Rebellion. On the basis of gameplay alone, I'll say 5/5. Highly recommended.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is intuitive and interesting. The learning curve is rather steep at first, and I would recommend anyone completely new to the series or to 4X gaming to spend some time against a single easy AI opponent on a very small map. Once you get the basics down, though, you'll be on your way to conquering worlds and repelling the vile alien (or human?) forces.Of all of the games I own, Sins has some of the most depth in research, economy, and planning I've ever seen. It's my go-to strategy fix when I'm kinda in a turn-based mood (ala Civ V), but I want things a little faster paced than that.COMPARISONSI'll do a couple of comparisons first, starting with the one that many people are making:SINS vs. StarCraft II: Whereas StarCraft II has become more of a ""twitch RTS"" requiring fast reaction and very rapid buildup and expansion, SINS doesn't require nearly as quick reaction, rapid buildup, or quite as quick thinking. StarCraft II is played on the basis of ""minutes into the match"", but SINS is moreso based upon ""hours into the map"". StarCraft II matches may take an hour to complete, while SINS is a multi-hour investment. I've had very large games in SINS go on for weeks, playing an hour or two on it a day. (which is phenomenal in and of itself, considering this is an RTS game)SINS vs. Civilization V: Yes, I know Civ V isn't an RTS, but SINS isn't a typical RTS, either. I think that players of Civilization V who enjoy science fiction bases will probably also enjoy SINS. The pacing is very similar. One of the primary differences is that you don't advance ages in SINS the way you do in Civilization V. Technology in SINS is meant to bolster and improve existing principles, not create entirely new gameplay as one advances technologically. Some things come about as technology improves, but don't expect something as major as going from spears to gunpowder to laser beams, for instance.			"

												*I have purchased Trinity from the Stardock/Gamestop store prior to buying Rebellion on Steam. You will not need trinity if you have purchased Rebellion as it seems to include all the contents from Trinity.Sins of a Solar Empire is an amazing real time strategy game that focuses on 4x gameplay (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) across the stars.Highs: Absoultely phenomenal space battles as you wage war across the galaxy to put your empire on its march towards galactic supremacy. Simple learning starts and basics, but incredible depth as you attempt to conquer the galaxy at large.Graphically, it is very good! Probably not going to knock you out if you must compare it to games like Crysis or Far Cry. But when you're looking at literally HUNDREDS of ships duking it out in space...Lows: No campaign/story mode.*Not really a minus, given that you basically select a map and start the game and each game goes for HOURS at a time if you are not worried.I cannot comment on MP as I haven't grown tired of the AIs in single player.I am not ashame to admit it, I can sit hours at my chair and play this game (I think my longest 1 sitting session is between 6 or 7 hours in one go WITHOUT completing the game).If you like turn-based strategy games, I highly recommend looking at Galactic Civilization 2: Ultimate edition (Also from Stardock). I have poured countless hours into that game as well after purchasing it years ago and have it registed on my Gamestop account.			"

												One of my favourite games. Three totally different factions fight endless interstellar war. Normal humans focus on economy, lots of ships and a lot of punch. Aliens have advanced phase technology and they can strip planets bare, fleeing from unknown enemy. Psi-humans focus on lasers, shields and mind over matter. I've played all factions, but my favourite are Vasari Loyalists. With them I'm able to play Battlestar Galactica style games on highest difficulty, where I'm quickly conquered and remnants of my fleet (VL can survive with no planets as long as you have necessary techs and a Titan-class ship) have to fly from one planet to another to escape their destruction, regroup and crush their enemies. In some games I was left with only one, badly damaged Vorastra Titan and no other ships and after many hours of mostly running away from my enemies, finally crush them :) With right techs, Vorastra has the ability to ""construct"" ships in deep space, so as long as you can find resources, you can rebuild your fleet. Other factions are fun too. Advent with their psi-technology was my favourite faction until Rebellion expansion, which introduced Titan-class ships and Vasari Loyalists enabled BSG-style games. Try to survive.			"

												Fans of space combat strategist, REJOICE. For this game will bring your desires. This game is strictly strategy with no story and or campaign. Everything starts as a set-up senario where you choose allies, vicctory options, and how fast you want the resource to be given to you.Rebellion has only a few noticeable differences to Trinity. Graphics is more improved as the game is using a better graphic engine. Another differences I've spotted is AI are responding very well. They are a challenge to fight against. This game a lot can be seen as a cinematic space-combat simulation. Ever wonder what Star Wars would be like with you being able to control the camera? Well you can fully see the entire battle as if you were in SPACE, without the ""cannot breath"" thing. You can a lot follow ships by zooming into the ship, then the camera will follow where ever it goes. More fun when u zoom in tiny units like bombers or fighters. Great for someone who would like to make a movie.Regardless, this game will get repetitive, It's addicting but it is repetitive. When you dwell into it, you see a lot of options and a lot of things you can do. Sooner or later, you'll be taking the same step over and over as each game starts. Upgrading are pretty fun too. Discovering what each race have and their advantages along with disadvantages to exploit. This game is WORTH it if it is on sale. It is a stand-alone so you do not need Trinity to play this. Have fun in space, fair warning, there will be tons and tons of debris. Space combat is never not-boring to watch. Unless you are losing the battle, of course.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. It has wonderful visuals, intrigueing gameplay and a wonderful soundtrack. If I had to pick out the most glaring (and perhaps only real) flaw; it would be the lack of a storydriven campaign. With that aside, the game let's you command massive interstellar empires and control monstrous starships with a wonderfully (considering the expanse of the game) simple and well designed interface. I look forward to any and all sequals to this series. In the mean time, do yourself a favour and buy this game. If strategy is your thing, so is this.			"

												A really fun game to waste time on. However theres not much indept tactics during a battle. There's basic strategy, choosing how to move your fleet and ships around, but during actual combat it basically comes down to how many commaning ships and titans you have. Theres almost no line of defense as an enemy fleet can warp to your planet then just rush to warp to your next planet before your ships even get to them. Theres a mode where if you lose your capital you lose the game, it mostly involved how many turrets i can put around the thing and actually being able to leave it alone. Strategy games need to have two things during combat- strategic fighting and tactical fighting.Strategic involves placement of buildings, moving fleets to critical locations, and being able to interact with the enviremont to decide your decisions. At this rate it doesn't matter where anything is because theres really no way of defending it unless you wrap your planet with turrets, the enviremont is basically point to point and doesn't have much change. Strategy gets a 5/10 for me.Tactical involves micro management. You have unit of army fighting against the other fleet. You should have multiple amounts of tactics to choose from, different angles to come at, just dozens of ways of approaching an enemy to create endless battle tactics. In this its quantity over quality, and based on how many titans, commander ships, and frigates you can squeeze together. Every time i want to micromanage the ship stops outputing damage and takes a while to move as the enemy is still shooting you. This is common because it makes sense- but then what. I've moved my ship but it didn't do any good, it doesn't accomplish anything other then, ""oh look i moved it."" The only tactic that really works is just put the fleet in let them auto target the enemy- if I try doing anything else there's not much of a bother. I even tried pinceriing or moving my ships around the fleet- it doesn't stop them from retreating or does more flank damage. I would give tactical a 2/10.I won't go into the tech tree, pirate buying, or even the market (because no matter what or how long you wait the market will always be expensive). That stuff is basic research and buy. The economy handling is rudimentary (like all games).Really I've seen nothing special from this game. It's move army, fight other army, and hope you have better tech and more troops than they do.Despite the crap I've been giving it- the graphics and art design are legit. I hooked my pc to a HDMI cable to my flat screen TV, put the game in theater mode, and watched a massive battle. It's like seeing that space battle scene in Ender's Game towards the end. 10/10.My overall quote on this is probably a 6/10. The graphics really saves it, and I still enjoy the game- even though it'll get boring and repitive after an hour. If I were to buy it again I probably would, but I don't see myself playing it for long periods of time. It's that one game you use to video the scenes or play if you run out of other games to play.Hope this helped to anyone bothering reading it and considering buying the game.			"

												Gorgeous game, relatively simple but fun way to kill a few hours. Unfortunately it has limited re-playability since it has artificially low limits on buildings per system - unlike other 4X games you *have* to expand at the beginning of the game into as many other systems as you can hold in order to even be allowed to increase your tech tree, and if you lose those systems you don't just lose the resources, you also lose your research (?!?), so you pretty much always have to play the same basic strategy for the first half of the game.Would love it if there was a mod that ""fixed"" this enabling you to build a true capital system.

												I've played Sins of a Solar Empire since the first iteration, played the expansions, and now, I've had some time to play Rebellion. On the basis of gameplay alone, I'll say 5/5. Highly recommended.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is intuitive and interesting. The learning curve is rather steep at first, and I would recommend anyone completely new to the series or to 4X gaming to spend some time against a single easy AI opponent on a very small map. Once you get the basics down, though, you'll be on your way to conquering worlds and repelling the vile alien (or human?) forces.Of all of the games I own, Sins has some of the most depth in research, economy, and planning I've ever seen. It's my go-to strategy fix when I'm kinda in a turn-based mood (ala Civ V), but I want things a little faster paced than that.COMPARISONSI'll do a couple of comparisons first, starting with the one that many people are making:SINS vs. StarCraft II: Whereas StarCraft II has become more of a ""twitch RTS"" requiring fast reaction and very rapid buildup and expansion, SINS doesn't require nearly as quick reaction, rapid buildup, or quite as quick thinking. StarCraft II is played on the basis of ""minutes into the match"", but SINS is moreso based upon ""hours into the map"". StarCraft II matches may take an hour to complete, while SINS is a multi-hour investment. I've had very large games in SINS go on for weeks, playing an hour or two on it a day. (which is phenomenal in and of itself, considering this is an RTS game)SINS vs. Civilization V: Yes, I know Civ V isn't an RTS, but SINS isn't a typical RTS, either. I think that players of Civilization V who enjoy science fiction bases will probably also enjoy SINS. The pacing is very similar. One of the primary differences is that you don't advance ages in SINS the way you do in Civilization V. Technology in SINS is meant to bolster and improve existing principles, not create entirely new gameplay as one advances technologically. Some things come about as technology improves, but don't expect something as major as going from spears to gunpowder to laser beams, for instance.			"

												This is an amazing game. It's great for playing with your friends, and for skirmishes with the AI. Unfortunately that's all there is to this game. Multi-Player and Skirmishes. There is no campaign, and that in itself is very disappointing. But don't let that put you off from buying it. It's gorgeous, challenging, entertaining, and loads of fun (albeit a bit difficult at times). Unlike Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations, Sins is real time. So every split second decision counts. The AI is a juggernaut of difficulty no matter what setting you have it on, so every little plan makes the difference of success or failure. Unless you're a master of strategy, this game will frustrate you at times. One moment you're blasting away at the galaxy, the next moment there are Titans coming at you from every angle.There are lots of different research topics for each and every civ you choose, and each one is vastly different than the others. Ship options are quite large, and every ship has it's own abilities and strategic usefulness. The buildings have a build limit, until you start to expand your empire. Each new planet adds new resource bonuses, building caps, tech options, etc.Unlike games like Age of Empires, Sins sort of forces you to expand and explore, otherwise you won't get the necessary amount of buildings certain research items require, the resources needed to build massive fleets, and so on. You also can't just sit around and let your stockpiles grow, build a battalion of ships, and expect to win in one attack. You'll soon learn that the enemy has already colonized 4 planets, each with it's own armada, and enough spare ships on it's way to wipe out your home planet.Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion is an awesome experience, and a very challenging one. If you like that sort of thing, you will absolutely love this game. The only disappointing thing about this game is the lack of a campaign. Everything else is a work of genius, a real masterpiece. I highly recommend any RTS lover to buy this game right away.			"

												Great old game that reminds me of the Command and Conquer times. The main difference here is that each game will take many hours JUST TO GET A FOOTHOLD. Then it is constant kiting by the AI until you can eventually take over all of their planets, but with many adjustable game options you can truly play this any way you like. My favorite is to create everyone's spawn on an outer ring and put super resource rich planets near the center of the map or in another galaxy. The game however has horrible AI scaling as they didnt even try to make it intuitive. They just give the harder enemies a huge resource boost from thin air and slapped names like ""insane"" or ""impossible"" on them. So just stick to normal or hard if you play the computer otherwise it will just be frustrating.			"

												Love this game every time I fire it up over the years. This one is on top of my favorites list in games I have played (and I was playing games since the Atari was new....).  There is nothing negative I can really say about this one.... Only the things most would say after playing a lot of time on a game. Sins is running at $10 right now and worth every penny. If you like 4x and strategy this is $10 you want to spend. All the DLC and Expansions are worth it as well.The modding community is also great for Sins.... a LOT of mods and conversions out there that are high quality and can add whole new levels to gameplay in case you get to the point of putting it on the shelf after a LOT of play time.

												The game has a great idea to it, but falls short of the expectations. It is a extremely slow paced game and takes even longer to play. The few hours i have spent on it seemed like a eternity due to the gamepace. The online is not much better, if by chance you actually get into a game most people will leave before you can do anything!If you are looking for a space RTS try out Star wars Empire at War! its pretty good and you can download a amazing mod called republic at war! If you enjoy a slower paced strategy game that takes entire days to complete, you should get this. be warned though it might possibly be a soul crusher!Pros: Great Graphics! Great Concepts! Great Civs!Cons: Takes forever to play, Not a active online base.			"

												I truly love this game. I did my research and decided to shell out the $10 during the fall sail. This really suprised me. Though there are plenty of tutorials, I sped through and decided to take on a small map in order to decide whether this was a waste of cash or not. I was quite suprised to find my relatively peacful neighbor building a trade empire of 'one'. My barbarian hordes overwhelmed him and secured a satisfying victory. I decided to delve deeper, and found that I could pick the strategy of the AI, the difficulty, and the victory conditions, which made this feel like a positive return. I also picked up the dlc (worth it) and this gave me a broad set of scenarios, maps, and stellar disasters that made for particularly delightful  gameplay. I plan to sink in many more hours into this game and I would support a whispered 'resurrection' of the game for stronger rigs.			"
