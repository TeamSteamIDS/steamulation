												Fun past timeWhile this game is clearly old its still quite a bit of fun.   The user interface has a few issues but they are managable.  the biggest downside was figuring out how to play the game which for me meant making the AI very dumb â€¦. well below the beginner level ai for a game, figuring out some core mechanics then notching up the challenge after figuring a few things out.

												This is a game from 2003 so graphics and interface are not quite up to modern standards.  During its time, GalCiv was probably one of the best 4X space games available and certainly the one with the best AI.  So much so that I have spent hundreds of hours on it (boxed retail version).If you are new to the GalCiv series, I would suggest you start with GalCiv II instead.  It is better in many ways:  bigger universe, modern graphics and better AI.GalCiv I is less demanding on resources than GalCiv II so if you are running an older PC or laptop, its worth considering.

												I bought this version because I wanted to try it cheap and didn't know if it would be any good. But I was amazed.Finally a game that can truly match the amazing gameplay and addictiveness of the Sid Meier's: Civilization franchise. Now I regret  not buying the package deal of GC1&GC2, becouse I sure will buy the seqeul and am really looking out for part 3.When your a Civilization junkie like me? You sure should try this game out! You will find yourself finally having something to beat your addiction, just get your self a new one!			"

												Unfortunately, this is not really a review of the game, so much as a warning that on some modern machines, the game does not work at all. There have been reported problems getting this game to install or run all over the forums, and while I didn't encounter any of the installation problems, even the proposed solutions to getting the game to launch don't work for me.As such this is a thumbs-down, but mostly as a warning that the game may not work at all for you!

												THe game play sucked me in.  The only issue was some of the auto focus changes but was common for the year it was released.  I have not played II or III so I am guessing they learned.  I am about to purchase II in hopes they got rid of the more aggrevating behaviors.  Overall the game is very playable and well woth the $10 I payed for it.			"

												This was one of the few games I played over and over as a teen.I'll be honest, I never got into the sequel, because I didn't like the way the planets were depicted (though it probably made influence more intuitive). So I don't know how this one holds up to GalCiv II. But on its own merits, it's a good game.In Galactic Civilizations, you start out as ruler of united Earth. The various alien races, having gotten the secret of hyperdrive from the humans, have turned off their massive wormhole portals and scrapped them for hyper-capable colony ships. The real space race has begun, and it's up to you to determine the path you want humanity to take.Madcap conquest is definitely an option, but if that either doesn't sound appealing or isn't practical, you can turn to other means - being a technocrat and staying ahead by selling and leaking techs; buddying up to the top dog; making everyone's economies dependant on your trade; or amass cultural influence by convincing the aliens how awesome Hollywood, Nike and Coca-Cola are. In practice, most games tend to involve a combination of all the above - the alien races tend to be more receptive to your diplomacy if you have a lot of ships with big guns, or if a significant chunk of their economy is powered by trade with you. And being ahead in tech is useful for keeping a welfare economy afloat by selling techs to other empires, or to prop up an enemy of an enemy without going to war directly. Conversely, rolling in dough means being able to bribe your rivals, buy state-of-the-art warships from a militarist friend, and ramp up domestic spending (including research and social projects).Along the way, you get to decide whether to be an evil empire, a benevolent federation or any combination and variation of them. A sprawling but sparsely populated expansionist nation, or a handful of highly-developed star systems? Military juggernaut or trade linchpin of the galaxy? Underhand arms dealer or open warmonger? Your answer to these questions is often simply ""yes"". It's telling that a game that allows you to build aphrodisiacs and massive theme parks also give you the option of building propaganda machines and pseudo-Death Stars - often at the same time (who says star-killing not-moons can't have fun water slides?).The alien civilizations all have distinct personalities - by default some are good, some are neutral, some are evil, but fiddle with their alignment setting at the start of the game and they change accordingly - a civilization that originally extended a friendly hand will now threaten to exterminate you at the slightest excuse, and vice versa. They will gloat when they're winning a war, grovel when they're beaten; extort you when they're much more powerful and don't like you, give you periodic gifts with mincing courtesy when you're the powerhouse.Though a thoroughly old game by now, this game has plenty of charm and solid mechanics underpinning them. I'm sure nostalgia only affects my verdict -that is still amazingly fun- only a little.			"

												GalCiv1 was thoroughly enjoyable, and fortunately I managed to pick it up and play through it before getting knee deep in GalCiv2.  This is definitely the case where playing through one obsoletes the other, in my opinion... still, the amount of game you get for the 'Ultimate Edition' on Steam sale can't be ignored.			"

												Received the game free from Humble Bundle.Also tried Gal. Civ. II many years ago.Galactic Civilizations I is similar to Civilization games in may aspects, but all in all are less about micro-management, which is good, because it would be tough to micromanage something which so futuristic.Game runs okay on Windows 10, although many people have claimed recently quite the opposite. UI seems really outdated even for 2003. Reminds me rather of late 1990's. But that is the good part, because it really feels playing a retro game, rather than just ""old"" game. And also, as for a modern taste UI is somewhat counter-intuitive (at least as for Civilization V player). All in all, I think I may give it a try some time later, as I have already blew my economy on a first attempt.I recommend many turn-based strategy fans to give it a try.If you cant run it - just get a refund.

A Space 4x out of the past.When you are interested in this game please keep in mind that the engine that is used in this part of the series is quite old. The game was developed in the year 1994, and it can't directly evaluated against MOO1 that apeared one year earlier. For that age the game still feels quite crisp with the options regarding this game, I still have my old boxed set in my archive and I was quite happy to see the game apear on Steam. And had to take note, that the Hype that the game caused some time, was really a blown bubble. I was reminded why the game was a weak contemporary of MOO, MOM, CIV and other Games that were the rage at that time. Furthermore you will have a lot of trouble getting this game started at all! Especially on modern machines, it will run only on my older Notebook with an Windows XP Op, and only with a lot of tweaking to do. Still it does crash regulary and at most unopportune times. You might of course give it a try, but only when you are experienced in getting games tweaked for running, and you have a rather high frustration threshold.This said, I really can't recomend the game. Sadly as it is, some games better remain in the past, even though they might still feel fresh and crisp - all this ""retro"" also digs up some of the real underdogs and rotten tomatoes of that time, because I still do remember the issues we had with the first appearance of the game and the trouble that ships couldn't be customized. You had to buy an add on to do that - later in a more viable option the game had some more stuff added as standard contents.Addendum: The game will actually run on higher end machines, but not with the Steam overlay active... So it still can be used...			"

												Wow, this one will suck your time away. A really solid 4x game with excellent AI, a sensible interface that (gasp) actually presents information well, and a few little tools that allow you to manage a large empire without having to click through every planet. One of my favorite aspects of the game is that it de-emphasizes the necessity of combat. yes, you can certainly pursue a military path to victory, but the extensive work put in to building the trade and economic systems mean that you can also win without firing a shot, simply by building your empire into an economic juggernaught. This one has caused quite a few sleepless nights.			"

It basically is Civilization in space, so if you like that kind of gamves, you can try it :) Although it looks a bit old, it's far from being unplayable, and the music is nice and relaxing too.EDIT: Actually, I got in a spaceship fight and the game crashed. Seems battle animations need to be disabled. TL;DR: Somehow works on Win 10. Get it if you like Civilization-like games.			"

The galaxy has 6 major civilizations including humans and a race is on to colonize, conquer, and dominate the galaxy using whatever means necessary. Those means include using military, technological, economic or political might to become a major power in the galaxy. Players must research new technologies, colonize and defend planets, build social improvements, build a fleet, fight wars, win elections, and gain influence in the United Planets Security council.

I didn't realize that the focus of the gameplay was closer to Civilization than a turn based ""Homeworld"" (focusing on spaceship combat).  Besides a handful of scenario missions there doesn't seem to be much to play besides setting up stand alone games.There's plenty of playable alien races and a couple different classes of ships, but I found the interface and gameplay to be hard to comprehend, and no real tutorial to teach you during play for people that don't want to read the manual.

												Old clunky and impossible to win, even on easy. And I'm a vetern of the old Master of Orion series so I'm not a noob or whatever.			"

												Waste of money if you're running anything newer than Windows XP. Installs but won't run in windowed mode and has unusable blurred graphics if your resoution is larger than 1024. Unplayable. Save your money. I regret wasting the $3 I did for this game, could have had a Big Mac!			"

												Whilst i am not one for saying never play a game this is one that comes very very close. From the start far too much is given to you and a lack of useful tutorial leaves you feeling lost or even failing. Once you figure out what to do a majority of the fun is lost and game simply doesnt invite you to play.i give this game 2/10			"

												Don't ever run this game if you are on Win7. It freezes in the worst was so you can't even make Alt-Tab or invoke Task Manager, and only way to unfreeze it is hard reset. And it'll mess with your display settings - after running it I had my working display resolution 1280x960 to disappear from the list suggested by video card and still can't make it back!			"

												Started the campaign, clicked the tutorial button, got almost nothing for how to start. Half an hour later the enemy overran me with ships and I lost interest in this game. Gonna try the second one now, hopefully that one actually tells you how to play.			"
