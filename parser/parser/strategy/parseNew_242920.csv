												Remember when you paid $60 for Simcity and EA kicked you in the junk?  This is the exact opposite of that.  Banished is a city builder in its purest form.			"

												Banished is what many city/village building games wish they could be when they grow up. No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building with intelligent villagers, clever mechanics, and thoughtful details. It's easy, it's relaxing, it's soothing. Until the realities of colony life bite you in the backside! Banished is addictive. :D			"

												Banished is the best city builder I've ever played (and I've played a lot, having been a fan of the genre since the original Sim City and the old Sierra historical builder games). The game is deceptively simple, you start with a few settlers and minimal supplies and you build a thriving settlement. Sounds easy enough, but it's probably one of the most challenging games I've played.There are a variety of crops, animals, and natural resources. Your setttlers will plant and gather and use these to build a rustic town. Steel tools and stone houses represent the pinnacle of your settlement's technological advancement. You can barter goods with a few visiting tradesmen and some nomads may periodically ask to join your settlement, but that's the limit of your outside contact. Peace reigns, you won't need any military (or even police) here. The only hostile forces you will encounter in Banished are tornadoes, fires, diseases, starvation, and cold. And you will encounter them, a lot.Although the game is relaxing to play, it can at times be incredibly difficult. Your settlement might be going along nicely for 100 years, with plenty of food and lots of citizens available to fill all the jobs that need to be done, and suddenly everyone has cholera and you're closing down the schoolhouse to free up some child laborers to expand your cemetary. Banished is brutal that way. But it's also beautiful. The music and graphics and effects are really appealing, and the immersion factor is high. It's definitely one of those games you can sit down to in the early afternoon and play for hours and hours and then be surprised to find your stomach growling and oh hey when did it get so dark outside?The developer is very active and involved in the community, and new features are added often. Now the game offers modding capability and Steam Workshop. So far the community has responded with some amazing tweaks and additions which only make the game even better (also a little easier, if you find the challenge a bit much). I can't wait to see how Banished continues to evolve, which it seems to do in much the same way that my tiny settlements grow and evolve, with all of the little details coming together to make something really satisfying and enjoyable.

												Banished is an amazingly fun and intense game. Some people have described it as being ""zen"" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You will build up a large, bustling, seemingly succesfull town only for a small disaster to bring your whole population to it's knees. But when you do succeed, it is oh so satisfying.This is the city builder you've been waiting for.An example of what can easily happen:

												You start with the minimal needed to begin your soon-to-be expansive town.  The basics are pretty simple to grasp -- keep your people warm and fed, give them a place to live, and make sure they have tools to survive.  It's much harder and more challenging than it sounds, but it is also extremely rewarding once you've got a thriving town.  Don't think it will last long though!  There's a population to grow, more land to settle, the occasional disaster, a trading-post to manage, and the ever-present feeling that you could be doing better if you just did one or two things differently an hour ago... but that's what the next game is for... and then there's the *hard* difficulty.And yes, I helped test the game (for almost 40 hours), but I had so much fun that I will be playing at least 40 more.  Luke did an amazing job with Banished!  Congrats! "

												After everyone else in my city starved to death, only Nesto was left. I followed him for several more years as he lived off what others had left behind; moving from house to house to find food and firewood. Nesto spent half his entire life completely alone in a post-apocalyptic city, finally succumbing to the cold one late winter day at the age of 60. When Nesto died, the overall happiness of the city increased. This is the best game I have ever played.			"

												Was doing great. The little town of Aviono, 20k food, 78 adults, around 12 children, and 15 years in. When the 16th year came around, it all went to hell. A fire started, burning one of the three storage barns stocked with food. I tried to get my little people to fight the fire with the wells nearby. They failed miserably and the other two barns caught fire, (this is about the time I realized putting all my food storages close together was a mistake). The fire started to spread to the wooden houses nearby, so I paused the game and looked up how to fight the damn fire. I figured out prioritizing the fire would help, so I did it and it did the trick. After the fire was put out, I checked out the damage. All my food gone and 5-6 houses destroyed. I knew my first priority should be to get my food back up to support my ever growing population of little people. This is where I realised I had made another mistake. Over 70% of my food was coming from potato farms, and guess what? All of my farms were right next to each other and an infestation started. Farm after farm were getting infected and loosing crops and I had no idea how to stop it. (I'm not one to go back and load and earlier save) So I paused it and looked it up, I couldn't find out how to stop it this time and I let it run it's course. Now the starvation began, and the graveyard began to fill up with little people's grave stones. It was too late to plant crops to get enough food to feed them all, so I basically gave up and watched everyone die a horrible death. I closed my eyes, mourning the loss of the little people that I had led around for so long. Then...I opened my eyes. I had three people still living! One 19 year old male and one 22 year old mother with her 6 year old male child. I had another chance to fix the broken city and save Aviono. This female was my last hope, unless I could get her with a female child, all was lost. So I set them to work tearing down the now unoccupied houses of the original Aviono, since I was almost completely out of materials.  I got them to live close to eachother and waited paitently untill....success! A female child was born. Life was good again. I set my new couple to tearing down everything not needed for materials and the future growth or Aviono. In the end, I had two stone houses, one of every type of resource production buildings, a town hall, and a cemetery (to remind me of the past mistakes). I got my population back up to 16 little people, and I sat back and sighed with relief. I had saved a town.Then I realised that the new towns folk were all inbred children from the three survivors....			"

												I love this game, it's a city builder game made by only one guy.Even though there are no wars or attackers there are several ways to die, mostly to starvation or them freezing to death.The creator (Luke) said he would take a day or two off and then on to bugfixing and work on a modkit to the game, making users able to mod the game, and the possibilities are endless. Things NOT to expect.It's NOT an action game, it's casual and slow going (you can speed it up).It's NOT a multiplayer game (And probably never will be, he made the engine for the game himself, with singleplayer in mind).It's NOT a triple A game (that being said it's worth the money if you like good indie games).Now thats over i can say i love the game, and gonna put alot of time in it im sure.Update to this: It's been a week now and i just made 100% Achievements in this game and i STILL love it.There is i must say some bugs, and it's a little laggy once you got the town to big, it's easy to see if you scroll around the map with the time on 10x with a population of 1k+.Also once you get a big town there are some problems with people dieing of starvation even with more then 150k food in storage, simply because they can't get back to the house they live in fast enuff to eat and won't eat on the way in other houses, or marketplaces or anywhere.Im sure thats gonna be fixed, but he's one guy so might take some time.But even with those bugs it's well worth it to get the game, i would have paid 30$ for the game and still not feel screwed..

												Banished is a distillation of what a lot of city-building fans missed from newer SimCity games.  It’s a smart, fun twist on the concept -- instead of ruling over a metropolis through a mayor’s lens, you play a more intricate role in the development of a small colony.  Every citizen is somebody you can see and control (though not directly), and your role is to see that your citizens are well-fed, happy, and warm through the long winters.  The result is a more nuanced and satisfying game than the EA flagship franchise which inspired it.Every Banished game starts on a randomly generated map, where you control a small band of settlers (about 10 adults and 10 children) who have ostensibly been banished from wherever they came from.  You have nothing but the minimal supplies they carried with them, and the resources of the land around you.  Your first objective is to survive the coming winter, which you can do by building houses, creating a source of food (a fishing dock or gatherer’s hut would do), and a source of heat for winter (firewood).  All of these things require resources such as lumber, stone, and iron, which your citizens can scrounge from the land around them.  After the first winter, your options explode.  The basic idea is to increase the population of your town by building homes, while balancing the basic needs of the citizens with the resources required for those needs.  Every citizen in your town is a resource as well; the player personally assigns jobs to accomplish every task, and must make sure their labor force is well balanced and not spread too thin.  Should the population dip and you no longer have enough farmers, for instance, the consequences can be dire.All of this may sound a little daunting, and it can be, but Banished provides a helpful tutorial at the outset to ease the difficulty curve a bit.  I was able to get rolling with my city and survive my first winter with its help.  The mechanics are satisfying and relatively deep, although after 20 hours or so I found myself finding a groove and more or less following a formula for increasing the population of my town.  It was still fun to see my town sprawl across the map (which can be sizeable), but the gameplay got a bit tired.Banished does come with robust mod support and for those who find themselves growing tired of the gameplay, there is an extensive library of mods which breathe new life into the game.  Colonial Charter is a large mod which adds an incredible amount of new content and greatly extends the life of Banished.  It’s great to see mod support for a game like this, and it’s a shining example of why we should see more mod support for games going forward.Overall, I’d recommend Banished to anyone pursuing that city simulation itch, but finding themselves disappointed with recent EA offerings.  Populations of your city won’t rocket into the millions, but the level of control and visibility into the workings of the simulation is very satisfying.  It’s a game which, while probably inspired by games like SimCity, does plenty to establish itself in this genre with new ideas.			"

												This is for me, the best game ever made. It exactly reach all I want in a game. It's a city builder, there's math, there's production chains, there's inventory maintenance, there's beautiful graphics, endless scenarios, tough achievements, the game constantly has updates from a mod called Colonial charter, which is the only mod you need and it makes the game 3 times as big and fun. This is without a doubt, a must-game in any game collection. The best 20$ I've ever spent in my life for the amount of hours of fun it gave me in return.I nominated this game in 2016 for the Steam awards.			"

												So I got vis game in the hope that I would be able to build a balanced city and survive at least one winter, how wrong I was, I died like 16 times in a row, then I discovered plums, I traded everything I had for one plumb seed and the plumb boom began. I found that if I devoted my entire town to be a plumb nation so to speak, nothing could stop me. I dedicated all my time to plumb manufacturing. I set up a trading post and traded my vast abundance of plumbs for clothing and materials. After my brief time on this game I really feel I discovered the true value of plumbs in todays society and will never take them for granted again.     For example for 10 years in a row I found my population to be stagnant and it hovered around the 66 citisen mark (not including children) for these 10 years. My solution to this was simple, I set up plumb farms all across the coast, from what I can gather with my basic understanding of immigration, traders come into my city on canoes and see the plumbs, they then return to their families after trading their iron and coal for my nations plumbs, they tell their families tales of he great plumb nation, then they tell friends and co-workers. This all led to the great population inflation of 18AD.   After 10 years of 66 citisens I grew to 88, many historians argue this was due to a better education system and advancements in stone houses and such. But these people are heretics and should be shakled and plumbed to death. Of course the real reason was due to plumb based immigration. Unfortunately the great mine collapse of 18AD saw the death of 15 good miners, so this countered the growth, I decided to close all mines and quarries and focus solely on plumbs and the occasional gatherer for berries. All in all I would give plumb simulator 2014 a 9/10 would deffo play again.			"

												After over 100 hours of playing it is definitely time that I write a review for this game.I bought Banished on a whim during the summer sales, I played lots of Sim City 2000 during my childhood and I was after another game like that but of course at the time Cities Skylines was out of my budget, so after a bit of YouTube research I added this to my games collection.When I started my first village I was completely lost, in fact my first four or five villages were complete failures. This game had a lot to balance up, a constant battle for resources that I always seemed to lose, it was very frustrating at first and I almost abandoned the game with about five hours playtime. I took to YouTube again and learnt the basics of making it through winter and keeping up with farming and eventually I made it past the usual three year mark and got a village that was actually growing and moving forward. With the town in full swing I was able to expand further and further, making smaller communities that would join with marketplaces and eventually with trading ports to bring animals, all leading up to the town hall which is great for prediciting resource consumption, housing needs and allowing the entry of nomads.At this point I was spending almost entire days just tending to my village, I built a huge bridge spanning across a lake to connect up two distant communities and made both self reliant, with each year adding more houses, schools, forester lodges and so on. The problem is that if you don't maintain just one element of your village, the collapse is VERY sudden. One year my sheep got sick and this affected the whole herd, meaning I had to kill them all; in tern this meant that my tailor couldn't make the highest quality coats and since I didn't change the settings to a lower material, I had no coats stockpiled for winter, leading to many of my villagers freezing to death.My newest village is going strong with around 280 citizens but everything lies in the balance, the further you get the more you have to keep track of, but it feels very rewarding to make it through a year without someone starving to death. I have to juggle my farmers around so that once a harvest is finished they are then pushed into the mines and quarries to retrieve resources until spring comes again, if I forget to change that option in time then that causes a huge drop in my food production, so yeah you need to stay on top of everything. My screen is usually covered with all my building objectives that need to be filled and the town hall stats that will show where to put my labourers.That all being said, Banished isn't going to be a game you will return to every week, I could play for days on end at first but now its a bit intimidating returning to my town, that could be because of the stress of it all. The music can get quite repetitive but overall I did really enjoy the soundtrack, very appropriate for the theme of the game, but when you hear the music on start up everytime it can just get you out of the mood of playing, i'd put a playlist of your own on standby if you're going to play for more than two or so hours. I have been lucky to avoid most of the in game disasters unlike other players but that can be toggled to your preference. I agree with some players that there could have been a few more build options on top of what there is, more types of housing is something I would have enjoyed, but i've been playing without any mods so far and haven't felt the need (yet) to go in search for them.Once you get your first successful town, the game is very cosy and its great to have the different map seeds with flat land or valleys to spice things up. You are going to need patience at first that is for sure, look up guides if you get caught in the lag of the first few years and that will help move things forward. The art style is quite detailed for such a small game and the camera feature that lets you cut back and forth to far apart settlements is so useful, in fact many of the shortcuts available make management of the game a lot less stressful as you go along.Banished is a game I would definitely recommend to anyone I know. While it has difficulty options available to you, I would say this game is for people in that middle zone with it being a bit challenging for casual players and maybe lacking that complexity a more hardcore simulator player would prefer. Go watch some videos and add it to your wishlist! "

												My entire village burned down, leaving two teenage boys alive and no-one else. I had a very successful economy so they survived on their own for many years in the burnt out husk of what was once a thriving merchant town by living off my extensive stockpile of most resources. Unable to have children for obvious reasons, they slowly grew old, and in late winter of Year 108, they both died at the ripe old ages of 72 and 73 respectively. 11/10 would play again.			"

												My friend had a Banished game with a man named Garther in his town. He was among the first settlers. Garthar was educated and handsome, but never took a wife or had children - much to the dismay of the town. Instead, Garther took the tough jobs. The hunting jobs - slogging through deer innards to butcher and skin wilderness animals to feed the lesser peons of his civilization. Garther did this for many brutal winters before finally retiring to a small house near the edge of town due to old age. But this didn't stop Garther.Oh, no. Garther took it upon himself to then educate the new generation of town inhabitants as their new teacher. In his late 80s. The rugged, elderly mountain man taught them all how to hunt and fend for themselves - and most importantly - how to not be ♥♥♥♥♥es. The town still stands to this day, all thanks to Garthar. Rest in peace, sweet prince. 10/10. Would relive the saga.			"

												Everything seems fine. Winter rolls around. Food stocks are well beyond surplus, everyone... Okay, most people are wearing clothes, people all seem healthy. A group of nomads come to your town hall upon seeing your vast reserves of resources and food. You allow them to join your settlement, what could be the harm in adding some more workers?A little bit rolls by seemingly fine, but suddenly you have no food reserves and the planting of new crops have just started! People are starving in the streets. Nobody has any food in their homes. Then you notice that fuel reserves have dwindled while you were trying to solve your food shortage problem! People are now huddling in their homes with their families freezing to death and you can't stop it! Then an outbreak of Influenza comes through, your town's only physician died of starvation not too long ago. All hell has broken loose and your citizens are dieing too rapidly for you to do anything about it.You watch in horror.Everything you knew has crumbled before you. A sprawling settlement is suddenly eerily empty after only about a year or two of commotion. Everyone is dead. You didn't get the 0 population nomads mod.You turn off your computer and go weep in the corner of the room after the mass extinction that just happened due to your negligence.12/10. I love this game.			"

												 Thinking of buying this game? Well let me help you out with that. First take the time to look at these two youtubers, Start with TotalBiscuit's WTF is ... Banished, still interested? Now take the time to watch quill18's ""Let's play : Banished"" it has 18 videos of game play for you to sink your mind into.  Now that you've taken the time to watch the video's take this into consideration. This game was devoloped by a one man show , Luke Hordorowicz. (Shining Rock Software) He started making this game in Aug. 2011 and in 3 years has made something I have been really enjoying. This game isn't really a city/town builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading hordes, ninja's, bandits or jabba-walkies, but to me it's not needed. Micro managing your town is plenty, for now. There is going to be mod support for this and with the talent I've seen out there I'm sure new buildings and other things you might miss will surely be added.  The game itsself does start at a slow pace like most building games. (there is the ability to increase the speed x2, x5, x10) but that can change pretty fast. My first two towns ended up ghost towns from thinking I could afk for 10 mins. Lesson learned. Starvation, disease, fire, etc. will make short work of your town if not ready for it and it willl happen. There is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader. Exchanging items your town has crafted for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, placing a bunch of houses down and not having food for your new rapid growing town will end poorly.  This game isn't meant to be rushed, take time to pause the game and look at your map and plan ahead. There is no winning in Banished only failing. You either find the right groove and keep getting bigger or watch your little towns people turn into compost. Three dificulty levels, I find medium or hard a lot more fun. Random map generator which is nice to see. 3 different map sizes, plus a choice of valleys or mountains. Weather and seasons, and plenty more.  In closing I'd like to say the game is worth 19.99$ and honestly I find any game I can spend hours playing on the first day well worth my money. I've bought 60$ games from the big AAA companies and either have them beat in 5-6 hours or lose interest in 30 minutes. This game is going on my favorites list for sure. Thanks for reading, cheers!

												Banished strips the complexities of the city-building genre to their essentials. Shining Rock Software has rolled the genre back to the middle ages. There's no sewer system to manage, no power grid to maintain. Just a group of settlers pushing into the wilderness, and a wilderness that pushes back.This simplicity creates a focused game in Banished. It starts as an intimate simulation and grows to be a taut, strategic experience.Banished feels more like a survival simulation than a traditional city builder. I was plopped into the middle of the wilderness with a dozen people and some supplies, which they immediately began consuming. The race was on to clear enough land to plant crops and build houses before winter.Each step in this arduous process is shown off by delicate animations that give life to the individual tasks. And each of those animations has a one-to-one relation to the city's production. Ask a citizen to fell a tree, and watch as they chop it down, carry back and deposit a single wood resource into the town's storage. Banished's towns look like a busy little ant colonies from afar, but all the activity is something more. The game rewards careful study, and those rewards made me begin to care about my little citizens.At the expense of making laborers anonymous, Banished provides an enormous amount of control over their virtual lives. The game's mechanics are closely tied to the cycle of the seasons, so in the spring and early summer I shifted everyone into the fields for planting. In the autumn I pulled laborers out of the mines to bring in the harvest. With such high-level strategy driving my decisions, I felt like a leader, not just a deity pushing at abstracted levers. While I couldn't get to know my citizens as individuals, I had control over their lives. This worked perfectly until the mid-game, where the simulation gets tedious. Once I pushed the population over 50 workers it became less about dictating the free time of each individual and more about the careful accounting of performance of the population as a whole. But at this level of gameplay, Banished struggles with giving players solid feedback on their actions. For instance, a gatherer will roam the area around town and carry back little baskets of roots and berries. But when the forest has been picked clean they just mutely wander. You have to zoom in, below the trees, and check to see if their hands are full. When you're tracking a small population of workers on a one-to-one basis, this is fine. When the population has ballooned, it becomes a major frustration.The struggle for information makes Banished especially difficult at points. As I swung wildly from feast to famine and back again, lots of people were left cold and hungry. Entire towns died off before I had an understanding of how to cycle through methods of generating food in order to reliably collect enough to make it through each winter. And even then it was more guesswork than fact; let's try hunting more this year, fishing more the next. While future towns benefitted from my experience, Banished put me through an emotional wringer to earn any pride I felt for my little ant farm.My only comfort during these tough times was to zoom into the gorgeous fully 3D world. Banished looks phenomenal, and it ran without a hitch at maximum settings, even in the late game when my town of nearly 200 began to sprawl across several screens. At such a large scale Banished resembles a little clockwork machine with hundreds of tiny parts. And as the movement began to slow, the complexity of the simulation allowed me to easily pull off the gears and reassemble them in clever ways. When a disaster, say an infestation of insects, began to attack the crops, I pulled workers from the quarry to quickly bring in the harvest. At the same time I repositioned workers from the coal mine to clear more land for fast-growing, alternative crops. It was a joy to find that sometimes my improvised solutions even worked.Banished demands your attention. It's a game that shows instead of tells, and at times I wish it had told me more. I failed over and over again as I got my bearings. But the grand scale of those failures just made my improvements feel all the more genuine. Past the steep learning curve and trial-and-error gameplay of Banished lies a methodically crafted labor of love that is as precise as it is thrilling.			"

												A good city builder is often the kind of game you can relax with. It's like an ant farm or a fish tank, you have a certain level of input, but from there you just watch nature take its course. Banished is a deceptively relaxing game, with its pastoral themes and gentle, lilting soundtrack. Beneath the inviting exterior however is a persistent test of your planning abilities, one that can have you sweating before you know it.""Banished"" refers to the tiny group of country folk you start the game with, a group of exiles in a wild, untamed land. From a humble start you help them assemble food, shelter, and comfort for themselves against the harsh winters. This is a personal-level game, similar to Tropico or Children of the Nile, where you can follow each individual resident from their house to their work and back. You'll also find elements of the Anno games, with each home and structure having its own inventory of goods that must be balanced against the consumption of the ever-growing population.This is where the game can make you panic, because I wasn't kidding about the harsh winters. Your people need food, firewood, clothes, tools, medicine, and other goods and services to survive and prosper, and their needs change by season. When winter comes you'll see a run on the food and firewood stores that can quickly leave people starving and freezing if you haven't adequately prepared. Shortfalls can be extremely hard to recover from, because farms are planted and harvested by seasons, orchards take years to grow from saplings, and your livestock ages as your residents do.Once you master the balance of goods for your populace, the rest of the challenge is up to you. Banished gives you access to all the buildings right up front, only gating them behind required quantities of the basic building materials. You can have your people farming, fishing, herding, hunting, gathering, brewing, trading, and so on in just a few years, and then aside from the seeds and livestock you have to trade for, you'll have seen everything. From that point on the challenge is entirely in balancing your resources as your village expands indefinitely. The margins get thinner and thinner and curveballs like nomads joining your community en masse can throw off your plans, but the basic rules of expansion do not change.The magic of the game is that you'll play for a few hours, set up a perfectly functional town with all the buildings and services, put it down... and then find yourself coming back to expand again and again. The quaint graphics and simple mechanics make it a delight to simply keep building out further and further. There are no scenarios or campaigns, just you and the random maps to fill, and even without anything pushing you forward to fill them you might find yourself inclined to do just that. Banished ended up being one of the more addictive city builders I've played, making up for simplicity with more than enough charm.			"

												So, I now have about 100 hours in to this game. I've played multiple games, with my best reaching a population of approx 900 people before the wheels fell off. I've played easy, medium and hard. I've read all of the guides  on the wiki, the forums, and even Reddit. I really, really wanted to love this game. I waited for it to come out for what felt like *ages*, stalking this guy's FB page for update info. And I am just so sad that I can't love it.Why? The inconsistencies. I am a creature of habit. I place all my buildings  in a predictable pattern, and I'm a hoarder by nature so I'm very careful about pathing to ensure maximum efficiency of the workers. And yet, despite my consistency in behavior and detail, there is no consistency in output. In one game, 2 woodcutters will provide enough firewood for a population of 120 with firewood to spare. In another game, 14 woodcutters cannot keep the same population afloat, despite over 4k backlog in wood. Woodcutters placed directly beside stockpile containing 2k logs. Woodcutter (A) will cut 42 logs in a season, while Woodcutter (B) will cut 298 logs in the same season, and Woodcutter (C) might cut 3 logs that season. All three are educated, and are situated in homes very close by. Their food is supplied by the gatherer and hunter that are always paired with foresters on my maps. They want for nothing, but they do not work. This is a problem that I find repeatedly throughout the game. You want a field of about 40x40 cleared, so you free up  100 or so laborers, prioritize that field and wait for them to get to work! And you wait.... and you wait.... and you wait. You re-prioritize the field. You de-select everything else on the map for clearing. You wait..... 8 seasons have passed, and your field is not cleared. 8 seasons of 100 laborers that could have been doing any number of other things. This is a randomly occurring problem within the game. You could go 50 seasons without a hitch, before you get a spike of random unproductiveness. Whole fields can produce less than 50 food per year, woodcutters that just dont show up for work, miners that idle the entire season away in the Cemetary. Oh! And for funsies, when you get a disease outbreak, and the diseased persons refuse to go to any of your multiple, fully staffed hospitals for treatment! They just wander the map, going about their business like Typhoid Mary from Hell. Every town center I make gets a hospital, and the sick folks generally find their way to them in short order. However, every now and then, you will get a Typhoid Mary who will inflict their disease on 100+ of your population before they finally die. Yeah, inconsistent.  "

												Banished is a city-building game with a heavy focus on survival. From humble beginnings - just a few families exiled from their past lives and a handful of supplies - you will have the opportunity to build up a thriving community.While Banished has all the footprints of a typical city-building game, it sets itself apart from the rest by including a diverse pool of resources to manage, each with impacts on your villagers’ happiness, health, and productivity. Each citizen adds to your total consumption, meaning you cannot afford to be complacent; you must always be planning ahead lest famine or disease wipe out most of your population. You must also manage your labor force (working adults), and should do so as efficiently as possible in order to minimize their struggle to survive. The setting and the art-style compliment the survival theme quite well. There is never any doubt that you are building a barebones medieval-era town - all the buildings are made from wood and stone and the whole thing feels very quaint. The seasons change, which has both a visual effect as well as creating a growth cycle for plants and crops (can’t farm during the winter!). As the years progress, your population ages, has children, and eventually passes away leaving the newer generations to repeat the circle of life... that is if they haven’t suffered any misfortunes along the way. Merchants will periodically visit and trade crop seeds, farm animals, and all kinds of goods once you’ve built a trading post. Wandering nomads may choose to settle in your town if you allow them. There is a healthy variety of crops and buildings, and there is also Workshop/mod support. Although the modkit for Banished is only fresh out of beta, there is already a significant amount of additional content that improves the base game immensely. For example, the Colonial Charter mod provides a complete overhaul of the game with tons of new resources, buildings, and production chains.If city-building games are something you enjoy, I cannot recommend Banished enough. This was one of my most anticipated releases of 2014 and it has definitely lived up to my expectations (and then some). A word of caution though, there are many hardships ahead; this is in no way an ""easy"" game.

												After accidentally closing my eyes to blink while tasking my first batch of villagers, I opened them to find everyone dead from starvation except five children. Thankfully there were enough cabbages in storage for them to survive for two years until they grew up. After tasking them as fishermen on a nearby river I learned fishermen can consistently fish about three fish a year, enough to sustain almost 0.000001% of my population. As my village began to grow once more I felt the shattered fragments of my soul beginning to piece themselves back together. However, six fishermen in a village of seven people was not enough, and I quickly learned this as I watched all my young adults starve once more. I still had two people left. As they progressively had more and more sex and my incestual village was for the third time repopulated I knew what I had to do. Farms were the only way out. Now I have a monopoly on the cabbage industry, and even now my 4000 cabbages each harvest is not enough to sustain my village of twenty people. As I watch those I love slowly starve, I can't help but remind myself through the many tears that flood my room what a great game banished is. 10/10 would starve the incestual children again.			"

												I really love this game, the whole experience was very enjoyable while playing, and it actually proved to be quite a challenge, however....... I've played for 10 hours and I've basically seen everything this game has to offer, I've maintained a population of around 190 people, built all the buildings in the game, expanded a far distance across a large map, and kept my whole population 4.5/5 happy and healthy for the entire duration of my playtime, the only thing left me to do is just build more houses.... in turn building more food->wood->woodcutter infrastructures to help maintain this. While I really enjoyed this game, the graphics, the design, the art, the mechanics, the game is extremely short and lacking in more... I don't know stuff. I know that it is only a 1 man team, and for that He's done something amazing. I just can't help but feel this game could be one of the best city-building games out there, if there were more things to do, maybe an advancement in technology (not like, pewpew-lazers), or perhaps the option to build larger houses, or more entertainment facilities, or just more buildings in general. Basically the game turned into the same, repeat infrastructure too fast and to soon in, where-as similiar games had a lot more longevity to them, such as Anno 2070 just to put as an example.In closing, I would say this game was really fun to play, I am just saddened that it has nothing left to offer me after only 10 hours of play, I really want to play more, but there is literally nothing to do, just build more wood gatherers, and more food... and then more woodcutters to supply the demand, thats it........ It's too easy to keep your people happy/healthy and in turn disaters came few and far between, and once you get into the big population numbers random deaths don't have any impact when your playing around with a standing work force of 15-20 larbourers at any given time.Regards "

												If you want to see how we, as a population, might fare into the future, then take a look ""back"" at Banished. Set in the era of middle ages/horse and cart/pilgrims this is a very pretty game with a very simple to learn playstyle. There are no goals except for achievements and it's what makes this fascinating.A plodding ""city"" builder with a balancing act like no other. The skills, the knowledge and the subtle finesse needed to make a city survive past a few hundred is nothing short of a miracle on some maps. Errors in planning are usually not detected until well into a game and are usually the result of something you did a long time ago. You will then either suffer ""Aha"" moments or pound your keyboard in frustration when you realise what you were *supposed* to do. From hero to zero in minutes. The balance in this is superb. Everything suffers cause and effect. Too many sheep creating too much wool that fills the barns that prevents the harvest that causes the people to starve is just one example. SO just build more barns yeah? Then wood becomes scarce and the toolmaker runs out. So no tools are made and you run out and nobody can do anything. Including the toolmaker! Scrambling around grabbing every bit of iron and wood to make tools so you can harvest so the people don't starve. Or freeze to death!A wicked dev made this and he's a clever one. I've spent a long time looking for those little exploits that circumvents game logic and give me an ""I win"" button but I can't find one. Even the data that might give you clues to what is going wrong (or right) is cleverly hidden despite appearing to have lots of data at your disposal.  After many hours of losing your perfect cities, again and again, you will understand what I mean here. Not that it matters. There is an evil monster lurking in the background of every game. Meet ""The Cascade"". It's that horrible nagging doubt in the back of your mind that the map you've just spent hours, even days on,  is doomed. Death for all is inevitable.  You *know* something is not right and you try to overcompensate but you cause supply problems elsewhere and create even more problems.And your whole town dies. Quickly.As your cemetary fills up, you madly juggle the myriad of tasks each citizen must undertake until... NO... he/she died too!!  After the cascade crash of most of population, you may be left with enough to regrow but be careful now. You need to make the corrections to prevent it happening again. Can you? Will you?You won't.  You will reseed another map and start all over again, ever the wiser. ""I'll put the farms over there and the fishing huts here and the market here and the mine there and the church here and.... and.... and.....""You'll die anyway. It's unavoidable. It's inevitable.  Unsustainable growth will kill you. Every time. A lesson for us all perhaps?gg9/10PS: A few more hours after writing this review I finally pulled the 900 citizens achievement. As a pundit who cried foul and ""it's full of bugs"" the first few days of playing, take heart all who play her. She can be ""beaten"" but she's a tough queen to satiate.			"

												This game is fantastic, but its lacking in ""what to do"" so badly. Its real fun to play and expand your town, but its matter of couple hours untill you build everything there is to build and the only thing that is there left for you to do is to start again, or try to get some achievements or just simply keep increasing population that will make you keep increasing production of resources untill you cover the whole map, but there arent any more targets to aim for. So very quickly you suddenly start asking yourself ""What now?"" and thats why it gets my no, its a fantastic game, but needs to give more to do to the player			"

												This is my dream strategy citybuilder, with the mods. Alone, it is pretty great still, but there is a huge community that adds so much more to the game, and is encouraged by the creators of the game! The developers of the game even give example mods for you to download, use and examine so that you can make your own mods for the game! On it's own, howerver, the game is still great. I recommend learning to play it first without the mods so you can see what sort of mods would suit you best. Personally, I have found the aging mods the most useful, and the ""pick me up"" mods for the fields, so that when the farmers work the fields, they make a quick first pass to put the produce into containers, then a slower second pass to put the foodstock into storage. It has saved whole fields from suddenly harsh winters! Pointers for starting out: First build a gathering hut, then within circle distance, place a forester shack. Then place one more gathering hut on the opposite side of the forester's shack, as far from the original gathering hut as you can, but within the circle of the forester's shack. Two workers per hut, and one forester. This will take care of food, and firewood/building supplies. (the forester will cut down and replant trees that shelter the food that gatherers pick up) Then build the woodcutter and put in one worker. This should keep you in good with food and firewood for a bit, but be sure to build them a place to live in, either a Boarding House or no more than two to three houses. Once you feel a bit more stable again with food, build a school, because the more educated your workers are, the more they can gather and produce. Also DON'T go too long without a blacksmith and tailor, so that your people can continue to work and be protected from the elements. A herbalist should also come early, so that the herbs can keep your people healthy.Fields for crops should only come after you are short on land and space for gatherers and fishers, since they need to be a distance away from each other. Farming should not be bothered with early in the game; it consumes a great number of workers, and it can all be for naught if your field suddenly dies in an early winter or from a sudden disease that ruins your crop.As for iron, coal, and stone; gather all you can around your little village. Once your people have to travel too far to gather more however, it is time to build mines and stone pits. If your people have ""Warm Coats"" and are plentiful on food, they can travel a larger distance with little risk to their health. In any case, this is the Strategy Citybuilding game I have always dreamed of. Get it and enjoy!			"

												Finally decided to write a review for this game as it's on sale. The developer deserves all the praises he can get.AAA quality game under 300 mb. Reminds of good ol' days of PC gaming when hardcore coders not artists / modders used to make games. Yes its true that 'reinventing the wheel' is waste of resources. But it doesn't mean to forcefully fit the same wheel on every cart/car regardless of its purpose and size. When game are made from scratch with less reliance on generic ready made engines or recycled tools and more under the hood coding, they require less resources and run blazingly fast even on old hardware.And that is the first thing you will notice with Banished. You can feel the engine underneath while playing. It feels like you just need to press a hidden button to see everything in code Matrix style. It reminds me of the days playing Quake 3 Arena.  Very raw yet very crispy.Banished is developed by a lone coder so it doesn't have detailed tutorials, introductory videos and all other sorts of  babysitting that gamers of today have gotten used to. But for someone like me that just adds to its appeal of truly open ended sandbox game. The difficulty I had to stop letting my village starved to death was the best part of the game. And I think that is how the game should be played. Stop reading guides and experiment on your own. Because that is what the game is all about. There is no specific objectives in the game. How city building games should be. The way they are meant to be played.Having said that, the game doesn't have a huge scope like that of Total War or Civilization games. So without multiplayer, it's not a game that you can keep on playing forever. So don't rush it. Enjoy the game and try different things.This game will appeal to you if you are a gamer who likes to explore, experiment, decorate and set your own objectives. But if you are someone who likes hand holding, being told what to do while following scripted sequences one after another with specific objectives to accomplish than look elsewhere.Highly recommended!

												I was quite interested when I got the game on sale, and my hopes were dashed fairly quickly, even after playing as much as I did on it, hoping it would get better, or something would kick in and start working right.Graphics are fairly decent (on a decent system it's quite lovly to look at)The game mechanics to play it are fair (simple enough, click here drag there, collect resources, click on building sellector, and make them build the structure)As a city builder, it lacks in content in so many ways, upgrade wooded to stone houses. watch the people run around aimlessly. build a city hall to get nice graphs and charts that are supposed to deal with the city. No real upgrades for the buildings, and even the stone houses burn to a cinder, costing lots of resources to even build it.The Ai never amounted to anything, as the people moved in and out of buildings often times leaving an age 10 by themselves, or an age 60, even tho there are more than enough spaces to support 15 people. And they won't let anyone join them. The long house actually prevents the people from having children, tho in the Nordic times, The Vikings only lived in longhouses, raised the children as a community.Wells on every corner, when a fire breaks out, and no one bothers to draw water and even try to put the fires out.No in game rewards for accomplishing anything at all, make the people happy, keep them happy, eventually they all starve to death, cause they can't do anything after building on your city for so long.Farmers/hunter/gathers all starve cause they refuse to eat the food they are carriing when hungry, rather they go to the storage bin, unload, walk around and starve before going back to grab food to take home.Even after forcing specific people into particular homes close to where they are supposed to work and store food, after a short time, they had moved, and their job description changes on it's own.schools in the game are pointless, as they are supposed to be educated, yet they do not act like they are.Hospitals in game are useless, sickness happens, and they all refuse to go see the doctor.Up till those points the game is relaxing and lazy for the most part, tho leaves lots open. Sure, your people have been bannished, from where, and why? Why does the incomming trader always insist on charging exortionist prices for an item? And why does the trader always come in on a boat? Where is the caravan traders? How does my chicken farmer get trampled to death? (must of just laid down with a bucket of grain on the other side, then as the chickens past, must of molted and dropped feathers in their mouth, but then that would be suffocation, not trampling... meh) Where are the wild animals that randomly attack the villagers that stray too far away? Or the child that wanders too close to the stream that drowns, cause the parents don't teach their child to swim? Passing down of knowlage from elder to child, as in the days of old? You were born and taught a craft by your parents in the eura the game is supposed to be set in.At $5.00 this base game would be worth getting, for it's simplistic laziness, more than that, I would consider to be a waist of time and money. After waiting a year and a half for some sort of steam update, (to fix the bugs) and none happening, I finally removed it from my system. For the listed price, it is not worth paying for, even on sale it's not that great.If you want true fixes, you have to turn to the modding community. Where their hard work and effort makes the game more enjoyable. (not even going to bother, as the maker of the game didn't even try do it themself)Knowing my post is negative, chances are it will be voted unhelpfull into oblivion... Would mention other games that the dev(s) are actually updating their product through steam even long after actual release dates.			"

												Honestly as someone who has sunk WAY too many hours in to this game my honest opinion is that if you're looking for as realistic a simulation of a built from scratch city builder than this it the game. The fact that instead of the generic cookie cutter city builder type game which largely revolves around money as the sole resource and currency of the game, the element of having to make sure you produce actual resources to support a community instead of just cash is one of my favorite features of the game.They've put a lot of work in to this game since I initially bought it many moons ago when getting the Tenure achievement was nigh on impossible due to either A) crashing and losing your save on a semi regular basis after a certain point B) horrific priority designation on villagers who would always die to starvation every year because they lived on the complete other side of the map and despite passing barns and markets a plenty did not stop for food (I think I went hoarse once actually screaming at them because I lost like 60 in one winter alone) or C) you got blocked by resource production and trade capability in the tools area since after a certain point it's easier just to trade for tools rather than produce them and the trading posts were severly undercapped from where they needed to be and are now. Now all those things have been fixed and I just need to sit down and get the last couple achievments....Negatives I would have to say are the fact that population growth can be a royal pain and a half. Either you've for villagers not popping out babies fast enough and suddenly you've got only about 40 students when you've been operating for the last two hours with twelve fully loaded school houses. Or you can so easily overcompensate and just mass spam houses to the point where not long from then you've got a baby boom on your hands and whereas you once had over 100K food in every category you're now frantically trading with every merchant you can to just simply bulk up food reserves to survive again. It's a tricky balance to maintain as it's easy to forget until it's too late, but if you can master it then you'll thrive.Overall a game well worth the price and the time spent playing it.			"

												Banished is what many city/village building games wish they could be when they grow up. No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building. Remember when you paid $60 for Simcity and EA kicked you in the junk? This is the exact opposite of that.It's an amazingly fun and intense game. Some people have described it as being ""zen"" to which I disagree to a point. It gives the illusion of being peaceful, until it stabs you in the back. The game is stressful, the game is hard, the game will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You will build up a large, bustling, seemingly succesfull town only for a small disaster to bring your whole population to it's knees. But when you do succeed, it is oh so satisfying.This is the city builder you've been waiting for.			"

												It's a city building game mixed with survival.In Banished just getting your town/village up to around 100 people and making sure no one is dying from some sort of plague or hunger is an achievement in it self.Every wrong thing you do, the game will punish you ; expand to fast, your people will die from hunger, expand to slowly , your people will die out from old age, focuse to much on mining and certain materials, suddenly you're lacking everything else and die, oh you're doing good ? Well here have a tornado that will kill half of your people, it's a game that keeps kicking you in the balls but instead of complaining you just ask for more.It's addictive , it's fun, it's challenging,it's hard and it's the best city building game iv'e played and it was all made by a single guy.Pick this straight up if you like city building games, don't even wait for a sale, just get it now.

												So according to the sychophants on the forum, this game is now ""complete"". Let me tell you what you do in it:-Get banished from the kingdom of ?????? because you and the rest of the inhabitants did ????????-Grow crops-Dig giant holes in the ground-Dig giant implied holes in the side of a mountain-Have a family of two hog the first and only house in the village so far while everyone else freezes outside-Occasionally have a trader row (just row. there's no land trade to speak of so even if you're in a relatively flat area where you'd expect caravans you just get one♥♥♥♥♥♥in a row boat) and try to barter some beans with you-Make a church so the already insanely happy people are even happier-Make a tavern so the already insanely happy people are even happier, and drunk-Make a hospital so everyone doesn't die from the chicken pox or something-Make a town hall so you can get pretty graphs and detailed accounts on how many potatoes Joe Blow has stuffed in his kitchen cupboardAnd, well, that's pretty much it. Nothing wrong with that. It's a great start and I do enjoy what little there is. My issue comes with the ""completed"" status and the fact I've seen maybe one update since I bought the game several months ago (which as far as I can tell was mostly just bugfixes). There's simply not enough game here.Like I said, it's fun. I won't deny I enjoy watching my little lemming men run around, chop trees, and build roads so straight and villages so organized it'd send the Romans into a fit of envy. I'm just left wondering ""what about all the other stuff?"" Where are the wild animals that tear lonely loggers to shreds if they venture too far from town? The bandits and barbarians who threaten to raze the city if they don't get a tribute of food? As far as I can tell getting banished from ?????? for ?????? (It really doesn't fill you in on any of this. I'm sure someone will pass it off as ""leaving it up to the player"" but anyone with any idea of how to write things can tell you that's lazy writing) was more of a blessing than a curse, because if you don't make outright stupid decisions your village will be flourishing in a matter of years, and there's just not enough to threaten that prosperity. The winters mean less and less as your wooden buildings are turned to stone and your leather coats are lined with the wool from the sheep you traded six trillion beans for. Outbreaks are handled quickly and efficiently by the magical witch doctor that just rubs some plants on the afflicted's face until they're suddenly better. The only thing that will eventually theoretically threaten your village (assuming you play this long before getting bored) is running out of room for graveyards from all the people that eventually die from old age, and I'm sure even that could be avoided by keeping everyone happy enough they don't care Old Man Jenkins's carcass was thrown into the woods for the nonexistent wolves to tear apart.I'm not really angry. I'm just disappointed. There's too little game here where there should be, and I'm finding myself questioning the legitimacy of its ""completedness"". I'm sure I'll be Not Helpfulled into oblivion by the raving drones that insist it was money well spent and can't take a lick of criticism, but all I can say is welcome to the reviews section, kids.

												Firstly, Banished is amazing. It blends city building and survival well... a little too well. Well enough for any goal to merge into one. This makes long playthroughs boring for there are barely any goals to achieve beyond building up your population, feeding your population, surviving a disaster or two, rinse, repeat. If the game were to have a larger array of feature then it'd be even better. So I give it a 75/100.My ideas on how the game can be improved--add another entity other than yourself in the world. It's a good single player game but it gets a little lonely. Maybe add various NPCs to the game. -NPC houses, towns, settlements etc. Places where the player has to connect a path to so that an exchange can be made. Maybe have specialastions varying from a farming town (sells crops over a period of a year for tools), mining town (sells iron and stone for food and other items) and a lumber town (sells wood and firewood for tools and food).-NPC raiders or equal threat. A disaster event: a group of hostiles temporarily take over your town, slowly draining 50% of your food. To get rid of you must build a police station of sorts and train militia to protect your town. After they have been defeated they have a lower percentage of coming back to your town, until the threat equals 0.-Multiplayer- build a seperate towns in seperate areas of a MASSIVE map. To trade, you either must build a trade port and assign people to be merchants and fill boats with materials, or build a road to their town and assign people to be caravans to begin trade. Caravans should have a chance of being raided so (from earlier) the police should be able to protect it.Those are my ideas, if anyone thinks this should be in the game then why not send messeges to the creater to get this in. THE HYPE!			"

												It's fun for about the first 10 hours of gameplay. If you think the price is fine for that then go ahead and buy it!Said that the problem is there not much replayability. After you learn how to keep growing in a sustainable way without starving to death, it's all the same and if you start over it's basically repeating the same techniques. That's where it gets boring, once you get there there is not much else to do, that's it's only mechanic.Other than that sometimes a villager is an idiot that decides to take a 3 month journey to collect some wood and ends up dying in the cold, and there's nothing you can do about it.

												I was lucky enough to be able to help Luke out by testing Banished quite a bit over the last couple of months.  Full disclosure I used to work with Luke.That being said, Banished is a lot of fun.  It's a tremendous balancing act, managing your town's growth while harvesting resources and not getting yourself stretched too thin.  As other reviewers have seen, you can cross the tipping point quickly and go from thriving town to ghost town in a matter of minutes.  In every game I played I always felt like I was on the razor's edge between success and failure and that my every action meaningfully tipped the scales.  It's fun theorizing about different strategies, from being heavily into farming or trying for one of the very difficult achievements.  The many layers to the game kept me coming back.  I find myself wanting to see if I can progress any further with my next town, or if I'm doomed to make the same mistakes that have brought my previous towns down.  Congrats Luke for making an oustanding game.  I'm happy I've gotten to see your vision here and I'm unbelievably impressed with what you were able to accomplish.			"

												I played this game for hundreds of hours on GOG before getting it on Steam as well.Still one of the best horror survival building games. Your villagers will die of smallpox, starve to death, freeze to death, get crushed by rocks and become homeless after half the village has burned down. However once you learn the basic formula of the game, it actually becomes rather easy. and you can get a bit more creative with mods and design/decoration. However you always need to pay attention since anything from a tool crisis to a baby boom can send your village into a death spiral. There are tons of mods for this game, but I'd recommend playing it through without mods at least a couple of times first.No new features are being added to this game, so it's pretty much ""done"" at this point, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What you see is what you get.			"

												Banished is one of those games that you constantly think about.  After an unsuccessful foray into the world you only think about how you could have improved the civilization further.  I prefer to play my games slowly, at my own pace and this allowed me to watch and observe my banished people. Eventually, I built a family tree, working from the Adam & Eve setting, learning that the people of banished are not afraid of incest.  They grew into an enormous community, watching as they developed, became smarter and eventually operated with little help from me, this was very rewarding.  This game is exactly how I like my simulations, slow, steady and incestuous.			"

												I made an early review of this game and once I put a lot of hours in, it got really boring. I wish there was a Maybe recommend button, but for now I feel it just needs more substance.  The game is hard and unforgiving. Its not a bad thing at all, once you fail a lot you start to learn it and eventually it just becomes: I need more houses, now I need more food, now I need more firewood, now I need more schools, now I need more storage, now I need a new mine, now I need more house rinse and repeat. It doesn't take long to build everything possible, have a trade market full of extra goods and you have bought all the livestock and seed types and have no reason to trade anymore. In the description it boasts of no ""tech trees"" ect, but its really what it needs. Something to work towards.  A way to upgrade buildings, research new things, just some sort of driving force other than sitting there watching people spit out babies and build more of the same building to accommodate your growing population.  the game is a really cool idea, but doesn't have enough depth.  I understand one guy made this and that is more so why I bought it than anything, he deserves it for all the hard work, but I hope in the future there becomes more to do in the game.			"

												Like it, but to be honest, once the mechanic is understood and you take the necesary actions to support the population, there is nothing else to do but to replicate what you already have to have more. This game needs to have any sort of advance, progression, right now, there is none. Mods just add more color to the game, but won't change the dinamic. Very nice concept, lovely music, fastest speed isn't fast enough to my taste, but very limited. After 2 hours (when you grasped the mechanics) you will find yourself thinking ""now what?""			"

												Banished is a city-building strategy game developed and published by Shining Rock Software LLC. It was released in February 2014. In Banished, you control a group of individuals that want to start a new life by developing a new city. You develop your city by increasing your population, gathering resources, and constructing buildings. The game embraces simplicity as trade is the primary currency and not money. This review will cover the gameplay, the integrated Steam Workshop, and the performance and graphics. Banished presents strong and complex gameplay as game mechanics heavily alter the game. You will learn some mechanics as you play the game whereas other mechanics such as average health and average happiness are presented on the UI. For instance, average health represents an average of all your citizens health. The worse health your city has the less productive they are and the higher chance they have of dying. Furthermore, couple worse average health with the dynamic weather seasons and expect them not to be productive in Winter. As you continuously learn the game you will learn how to strategise and manage your city while incorporating the various game mechanics and the weather seasons, which all seasons have an effect on your city. Other mechanics have long-term implications. For instance, when children turn 10 they can enrol into a school until they turn 17. If they don't enrol you can use them as workers. If they enrol, you cannot use them as workers, but educated citizens will be much more productive long-term compared to uneducated workers. So by and large, these game mechanics emphasis strategy and they showcase the challenging nature of Banished because it is a very difficult game. Also on gameplay, the game incorporates randomly generated maps that have different amounts of water, hills, and so forth. These affect your plans for your city, but there is a very useful and very informative UI that is customisable. It allows you to add different data to your screen which constantly updates. Specifically, if you want to keep your storage house information box on the screen, you can move it to the top left corner. Overall, the game teaches you about strategy, understanding the mechanics and their consequences, and to assist you allows you to customise your screen with informative UI to help you manage. Banished uses Steam Workshop. Briefly, Steam Workshop allows individuals that own the game to tweak it, improve it, and mod it. I will admit for the majority of my play time I used Banished Plus, a large mod that provides more balance to the game by tweaking mechanics to reduce the fast-paced length of the game and increase realism. There are an abundance of other mods that once you download the game will inform you of any compatibility issues, which is a nice and handy tool. I use Banished Plus because I think the vanilla game is basic and fast-paced because there are not many buildings in the game are citizens can be very stupid and lazy. Furthermore, add these with the lack of long-term objectives showcase the need for mods to help improve the behaviour of your citizens and expand the amount of content. Therefore, using mods drastically improved my experience of the game. And as a side note, I generally think the developers should have made DLC to expand the content to give more replayability.  Technically, Shining Rock have excellently optimised this game. I can play it on max settings and achieve a constant 60FPS on x10 speed. Features like the weather system and the large amounts of population usually would hit the game in performance, but for the most part I did not experience that. At 110 population on x10 speed I stayed at 60FPS. At 220 population, I was managing a solid 50FPS with the drop due to a larger city and more population. It is evident the six patches in Banished helped improve the performance of it. Graphically, the game is gorgeous. Buildings and citizens are very detailed and the weather system adds a layer of realism to it.   Conclusion  Banished is a very good game. I love the complex gameplay through the variety of game mechanics and their effects on other mechanics. I absolutely adore the beautiful graphics as the buildings are incredibly detailed, the seasons are highly realistic and the scenery is just superb. Banished has excellent performance as I managed to sustain 60FPS for the majority of my play through. It was only at 200+ population I started to see a small dip in FPS and performance. At USD$19.99, I recommend purchasing Banished because overall, it has high replayability.

												My first expirence in the game:CockValley, Winter, Year 9It was winter, worse than anyone had witnessed since their exile.  The townsfolk of CockValley were freezing in their homes, shivering to what little warmth that dwindled in the flames, its embers slowly fading.  Food storages were running low fast, eventually the fishermen had to abandon their posts.  While there was much to do, as per usual, the denizens were powerless against the elements and began to soccum to their weariness.  Suddenly Aris fell, everyone suspected little considering her ripe old age.  Than another fell, and another, and another.  Eventually the children began to die out as well.The bewildering diety was powerless against the sudden infliction.  All he could hear was the constant echoes of his worshiper's dying breaths, than, nothing.  In the silence the diety scurried through the homes, hoping to find survivers.  He exhaled a sigh of relief, he found two survivors.  He was hoping that, by some miracle, he may at least be able to repopulate the desolate village.  But to his horror, he became paralyzed by a terrible truth.  The last two survivors were 20 year old men.  Powerless, he admited defeat and surrendered himself to fate.  He dubbed them Adam and Steve, and watched as they spent their final days in isolation.10/10			"

												I think that it may be difficult to play initially since there is a lot to consider if you dont want your entire population to die of and it is fun to try and work this out. But one you get to a point where you figure out how to manage your resources and anticipate food shortage, disease and so on, it is a little repetitive and making your city bigger is really not a problem. There are expansion mods that will revive the game until you get a hold of that too. It does take a lot of hours to get to that point, so it will entertain you for quite a while - and in general with building games, this feeling of repetitive action is normal  once you know how to do it ""right"". But that being said it is still one of my favorite building games and I think by now I have tried most of them. I tend to like the games were warfare plays a very small part best, and if you do too, and are a fan of builing and resource strategy, you will like it.			"

												I wish there was an option between thumbs up and thumbs down, because this game hit the middle ground ""eh, it's alright"" for me. Banished is an ok game, but it really doesn't feel finished! Once you get over the hump of mid-game and dedicate 90% of your workforce to collecting food, there's not much else to see. I played my first few games slow and steady and didn't have much trouble amassing a decent number of people, building all the available buildings, setting up my neighborhoods and work districts... and then I would get bored halfway through upgrading the houses to stone, because that's all that was left for me to do. I tried playing a little faster (and looser with the food) and it just dragged the experience out, but didn't actually add any more ""fun"" to the experience. If there was some sort of combat mechanics, or if there were threats other than weather and starvation, maybe my final opinion would be different. As it is, Banished is a decent town building simulator that can hold your attention for 20-30 hours. After that, you've seen and done it all. There's just not enough different options!			"

 First sorry for my english.     Sotto la recensione in italiano. Banished is a indie city builder title , developed by one person in C ++, which the goal is to survive your people as much as possible and the only enemy is nature; no military part so essential is the control of resources and everything is accessible from the beginning.Pros Support's BanishedKit mod and steam workshopExtremely reasonable system requirementsAffordable priceAmateur translation in many languagesGood achievementsLightweight downloadRelaxingCured in the sounds and in the interfaceAcceptable loading timesSufficiently comprehensive optionsOriginal approachNice graphicsDurable enough for fansFree of major bugsAtmosphere that capturesDisasters and your decisions affect the life or deathSandbox elements excellentCons They have stopped adding contentLack's steam cardsNo cloud savingNo in-depth tutorialToo much micromanagementMusic limitedWith no mod feels the lack of contentIt gives the impression that he had not expressed a 100% of potentiality of the gameGameplay doesn't have long-term goalsLack realism in  in mechanic'sNo missions or campaignsCan be frustrating (game has hardcore approach)No demo or trialNotes  Some crashes (when adding mod)Mac and Linux support coming soonNo multiplayerThere is a DRM free version on other platformsIn conclusion banished is a City Builder with fantastic atmosphere, it easily captures, but it is difficult to master; the mods help a lot to fill the gaps; you have to dedicate time and attention and in return pays you back with good fun. The only flaw is that the mechanics are limited. It would been perfect with the addition of a military component and increasing the realism, but that's another story ...I would absolutely recommend, but lacks the X factor to make it perfect.It's a game that request initially attempts and experience, not recommended for casual players. My advice: search on internet information before you buy it,the micro-management is not always good; It requires many hours for be fun.Finally to be noted that when the population reaches a high number you notice slowdowns and optimization problems.graphic 7sound 7longevity 8gameplay 7.5Vote 7.5 / 10 with mod rating 8/10Purchase price recommended under $ 5Mod recommended:""DC: New Frontier"" (always check the latest version because they constantly change name as the mod of the ""DC"" series, the game improves in all main areas, adding new buildings and resources).FANTARMA COMMUNITY

												Fun for the first 5 hours, but beyond that point it's mostly just a frustrating slog - build a town, figure out that you forgot to do something and it has doomed everybody, watch them all die, then start again from scratch, over and over until you learn how to keep these lemmings from killing themselves. The most frustrating part by far is your citizens' obsession with firewood - it's so easy to run out of it, and if you do run out,  it sends you into a death spiral. People start buring coal instead, which means you're no longer able to make Steel Tools, then everybody's productivity gets cut in half because there's a shortage of tools, then a bunch of people die from starvation, but because there are now so many empty houses, the survivors breed like rabbits and your city is flooded with hungry children that can't work.The worst part is that there's no way to stop them from switching to coal. People will starve without the slightest objection even if they're currently tending an orchard full of fruit, but if they get a little cold, they'll happily destroy your entire supply chain and doom your civilization just for a few extra minutes of warmth.

												Banished is a strange game. It has a great aesthetic - especially in the winter - that is compelling enough to keep you coming back for more. There's nothing quite like the sight of your little village covered in a blanket of snow, smoke billowing  out of every chimney. Aesthetic, however, isn't really enough to hold your focus for too long. Other reviews go into great detail about what you need to do to succeed but it can be summed up in two parts - gather resources and breed. At first this can be a fun balancing act to play out. Too much breeding and you're resources will start to dry up fast, too little and you'll struggle to get those resources quick enough to sustain your population much less grow it. Once you find the happy medium that works for your village you can plug along fairly well, at least for a while. Banished is big on throwing natural disasters at you - or at least it was for me. In three consecutive playthroughs I had things moving along wonderfully when a tornado would touch down and level my town. My population was decimated and despite my best efforts all three towns eventually died out. Overall, that's the issue with Banished. It's not so much a city builder so much as it's a city survival game. The AI doesn't help, either, as citizens of your town can be frustratingly foolish. More than once I watched a citizen wander into the forest looking for food only to starve to death out in the wilderness when there was a surplus of food sitting in the barn for them. An even worse example for you: I once had a town starve to death despite it being flushed with productive farms. Over half of my population were farmers, herdsman, and fishermen and they still somehow found a way to starve to death, all of them. There's nothing more bleak and yet ironic than watching a farmer harvest his crops, the only person residing in a town of once over 50, slowly starving to death. And rest assured, the farmer died just like all of his friends and family, starving to death in the middle of his field.Throw a tornado or fire in on top of that, leveling a perfectly good town in its prime, and the game can become painfully frustrating. Banished is not a bad game but like most of the reviews on here, I'll tell you the truth - there's not a lot to it. You can build a sprawling metropolis if you want but there's nothing to do with it. There's no end-game, nothing to strive for beyond trying to surive as long as possible. You can't go out and get revenge on the town that kicked out your founders or even interact with other villages. Your only contact to the outside world are solitary traders, the only evidence of life outside of your village. This game could be easily be cast as settling another planet for the first time, it's that empty. If you can get it on sale for cheap, buy it. It is fun at first and, like I said, can be beautiful in a quaint, colonial kind of way. Just understand that after a while it will lose its spice.			"

												Banished is a fantastic game, a city-building type focused primarily on survival. Your main goal is to expand your town and grow your population and most of the challenge is based on when and how to do it. There are no battles, your only enemies are natural disasters and diseases. One of the things that is great about Banished is that its AI works on individual levels. Every person in your town is an entity on its own. They are born, grow up, get married, grow old and die, in a very convincing simulated life. There are about 20 professions the townspeople can be assigned to and every one of them is important to the town as a whole. On the downside, there aren't much to do in the endgame but community mods can keep things fresh for a new run.			"

												Banished is a game that was good as a base game.  It's challenging and there is a lot of different strategies that you can try to help your settlement live.  Where the game really shines is some of the mods that people have created for the game.  Colonial Charter has made in-depth mods that add a TON of content to the game.  As of right now, I'm building a nearly 100% over water dock town.  I have almost 200 citizens in it and everyone is happy. If you enjoy building strategy games, I highly suggest this game to you.  Once you get a hang of the base game, head over to the workshop to add some mods to it.  It's almost like playing a whole new game. "

												tl;dr - Banished is a decently fun city builder/simulator that's held back by random bugs and shoddy AI. Getting the game for ~$6 (USD) off a trader, I felt I got my money's worth at the ten hour mark, but I can tell right now that this isn't something I can come back to time after time, or even in a few months when something else will have my attention. Just about everything in this game screams mediocrity, but it's a new(ish) game in a somewhat dead genre so, if this is something you find appealing but are on the fence, I say grab it at a steep discount (ten dollars is too much). You'll have some fun and for a few bucks you just can't go wrong. The reason I don't recommend the game is, when faced with the full asking price, the game's issues are too glaring for me to conscionably recommend. At the current ten dollar sale price as of me writing this review, I say you're far better off grabbing one of the Impressions Games classics off GOG. I first bought Pharoah with money I got for Christmas when I was nine years old, and I still boot that game up from time to time. It's disappointing to see issues present in Banished that weren't present in a game released 15 years ago and weighing in at 490 MB (with a content-packed expansion/spin-off game). The inability to give instructions to a specific villager was beyond frustrating in a modern game, and the random idling is off the charts. All of these games have citizen idling, but I've never seen it to such an extent, even on the easy setting, clueing you in that it's an issue with the design. It's terrible to be expanding your population, with your food supply being constrained as a result, only to have people starve because your workers suddenly decide that they've had enough of harvesting, leaving upwards of 25% of your crop to rot. What's more is the remarkable inconsistence with food output, particularly if you don't mouse over a particular area for a little while. I'm decently positive the game simulates items not in view at a different speed than the one you've set, causing obvious issues if you don't constantly observe your entire city. But oftentimes, there's simply nothing to be done, your villagers plant a pumpkin patch, one of the quickest farms in the game and one that often is harvested before even the start of autumn, only this time for them to never finish planting the field for some unknown reason. Compounding this is the fact they may or may not get the crops in time before winter, regardless of what you do, where the storage buildings are located, or when harvest begins.As I said, I enjoy this game, but I simply can't believe the developers would decide such a bare-bones (only two map styles!), buggy and downright flawed game was ready for release. Do yourself the favor and skip this unless there's a heavy discount and you're unwilling to play games from the 90s.			"

												Banished is quite a feat for one person to make. The controls are intuitive, the tutorials are thorough enough to get a solid grasp of the mechanics in a very short time, and the game world is quite pretty. There isn't, to my knowledge, anything else like this on the market. The game is worth the money and I do not regret purchasing it. I will continue to play it and hope that the development does not stop here -  that Shining Rock Software continues to improve on and build on the game.However, all of that being said, I am not going to recommend this game to the public overall, nor to my friends. It is very finicky and unforgiving, far too difficult even on the 'easy' setting, repetitive and frustrating. There are no indicators or popups other than 'low storage' messages when something goes very wrong with the economy. You are forced to build up very quickly. If you do not have at least 6 more families by the time year 15-20 rolls around your elders will die off and your population will not be salvagable because you will no longer bring in a fraction of the resources. I found no difference between the three climate settings. Don't get me wrong, I love high difficulty in a game and prefer to play most RTS/survival games on high difficulty for a challenge - but in those cases the enjoyment typically comes after I've finished a long map and have achieved something. There is none of that in Banished because of the mechanics of the priority system and the havoc it wreaks on resource management.At this point I've played around ten maps and I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about; The furthest I got any of them was year 24. I had a stable economy, 6k food to spare, and plenty of resources. My population at that point was around 100. I squared off an area for people to harvest resources from - and my fishermen, farmers and most importantly my blacksmith left their posts to attend to it. Tools, for a short period of time, were not created. It resulted in a drop in productivity, which resulted in less food being gained. When that sort of spiral starts, there is no way to stop it - within five minutes my population had starved itself down to 5.Some more examples:- If you build a building that costs iron and you do not have an excess, you will not be able to make as many/any tools and your people will starve. - Your fishermen will starve even as they fish food for the village, and even if they are the only ones left alive they will refuse to eat the food they are harvesting. I saw this on a hard-valley map; Suffice it to say that it was over by year 3 when all but one villager had starved to death. The last four villagers to die were all fishermen, and these died on the docks gathering fish.- People carrying food to the food barn will starve to death.- Disease will end your population in the span of a few minutes even with stacks of herbs and a hospital.- In order to trade for seeds you need to sell thousands of things in one go. The problem with this is that surpluses are very difficult to get and every resource in the game is useful - sell too much of your iron stockpile and you will have the tool issue. Sell too much of your clothing and you will have people freezing. Sell wood and you have no firewood. Don't even think about selling your food.  Without seeds you lose access to the most dependable way of bringing in food.These are not, in my opinion, elements of difficulty. Difficulty would be better attributed to colder/longer winters, harder soil to farm in, and more harsh starting conditions (less resources). Difficulty should not come in the form of a poor priority system that will send your fisherman out to gather wood instead of a less-needed role (labourer or woodcutter, for example) or in the form of a slight error (ie. building a trading post which uses some of your iron) that destroys an hours-long stable economy to where it can not be recovered. Overall, I give the game 6/10. It has amazing promise and potential, but in my opinion the mechanics are not allowing the game to deliver.			"

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingFor deaf/hoh gamers, I give this title 8/10!Overall GameplayBanished is a challenging civilization-building/survival game.  Rough around its edges, this game takes some getting used to before going right in to it.  Without looking at a guide to help get started, you will fail a few times before you incrementally start finding success.  I strongly encourage new players to go through the tutorials to grasp the basic mechanics of the game.In truth, the formula for winning this game is relatively simple once you have it down, and it becomes a balancing act of population and resources.  If played right, it is not a significantly active, demanding game, but can be a fun way to pass the time.The information windows are essential for playing this game effectively, but must be enabled when you start playing.  I'm not sure why that is except to provide a clean GUI for a new gamer.  It's a bit of a hassle to enable all of those windows each time you start a new game.It's a simultaneously challenging and easy game, which can turn quickly to frustrate you or plod along predictably.  I rate gameplay a 7/10.General AccessibilityThe game is a top-down style with great control over the camera.  Interaction with the game is in the form of WASD (pan), Q/E (rotate), Page Up/Down (tilt), and Insert/Delete (zoom).  Each function has a mouse alternative.In order to build the facilities your banished people need to survive, you make use of menus on the bottom right of the screen via F1-F9.  Each F key brings up a corresponding sub-menu, where options are selected with the number keys 1-0.  Buildings can be rotated with R and T to fit surrounding areas and to align with roads.All buttons are remappable for mobility-related issues.Subtitles & CaptionsSound options in the game are rather limited.  You can only alter the UI sounds, music, effects, and ambient volume with slider bars.  The absence of subtitles suggests this game has no spoken audio and the absence of captions suggests there are no particular audio cues indicative of emergency situations for you to take care of.Whether there are sounds associated with things or not, there are small popup notifications near your toolbar in the bottom right corner that let you know if a villager has died or people are going hungry/cold.  While these are helpful, I would suggest regularly checking your resource output vs resource consumption and ensuring that you either have sources established for each village or are able to redistribute resources across the entire habitated area.Because I have encountered no situations where I am confused by events in the game (indicating audio-only warnings), I assume there are no major audio-only events.  For that, I give it a 10/10.Chatting/CommunicatingBanished is single-player.No rating. "

												Well with a few hours sunk into the ""Vanilla"" experience.  I have recently Discovered Mods and wow, this game and its engine are great for producing a really well put together Strategy builder.  The polish that has been given to this title makes it an awesome gaming experience.  The learning curve was a bit steep at first.  But, there are several great guides that are available in the Community hub that makes this a 'null' point.   Plan to spend some time in this one if you pick it up.			"

												I love this game, but there is just not enough replay value to be worth it. I guess the only goal after a while is to see just how big you can get your city, but it feels empty.It's a good quality game, with few bugs, but not enough in it to make it worth the money.			"

												How do I feel about the game Banished? Well let me tell you, I purchased the game during the Steam Summer Sale because I was already curious about this game.   Basically when I started the game I blinked and it was 9 hours later. No lie.  I became addicted instantly.  There are 3 different modes you can play on, easy, medium, hard.  I started out on Easy just so I can get the grasp of the game.   It's not as easy as you would think.   It's a game of survival, in which you have to make sure your citizens are warm, fed, and happy.  I love how buildings and other structures are not instantly built with a click of the button.  You actually have to watch your citizens gather the materials, then start the construction.  I highly recommend this game for the casual player.   Also there are several mods that are available for this game, be sure to check them out.  PS. Pro-tip: I recommend getting your food sources down asap for you citizens, if not your people will go hungry and they will die sadly.			"

												If you're an expert in city builders and comparative games, to build the city just for the sake of building the city (e.g. Factorio) , this might be the perfect relaxation game for you. If you're more in need of a goal and a sense of a reason to why you're building this city, then maybe try something else. Because there is no campaign; no story, or otherwise tale for you to test your city building skills in. There is only the ""New Game"" where the game creates its own seed for you to try your skills at..I started playing this game without this knowledge, and played it as I would any other game - but without any other purpose than to survive as long as I could, the game turned out to be a test to my knowledge within the game even though I had never played the game.. .. It's a great game, as long as you're aware of what game you're pulling yourself into.It's not my kind of game.			"

Time for a real review.So Banished suddenly got popular, the reason I wrote that ""troll"" review up there is because I browsed /r/banishedmeme a bit too much. Anyway Banished is honestly a extremely great game I love it. To me, it's really worth the buy. The game is now Steam Workshop compatible so now everyone can experiment the community's additions to the game, like for example; the creamery/dairy add on and the fish farm, or decorative tiles, etc. The add-ons from just the Steam Workshop make it a hell of a lot fun then what it was before, and believe me banished is fun. I even got 2 out of 3 of my friends who didn't even know this game to buy it, both stating that its really fun. So, yes, yes it is  worth  the buy!			"

												What a beautiful game! 9/10 would cooperate to survive the winter.There are many reviews for this game already but I felt like writing one because it deserves it. Its well-made tutorial is probably worth the current £4.5 (~$6) price tag by itself.Oh, the apprehension when the ground first turns white and the relief of surviving each of the first few winters. The feeling of hope and comfort when the first merchant boat arrives and you feel you're not isolated from the outside world any more. This game is beautiful and it invites beautiful emotions and feelings when you play it. Amazing.Cons:This is a (very) positive review but there are so many positive reviews out there I'll start with the cons just to contrast (in order of importance):  Not that challenging for the veterans of the genre.   A bit repetitive once your town has enough resources to keep going.  A few very small interface quirks.        Like not having proper diagonal roads or not being able to expand crops/orchards/stockpiles/etc. without removing and rebuilding, or even the possibility of non-rectangular buildings of these types.  Sounds can get annoying (try to keep your camera next to a quarry/mine/blacksmith for a while and a headache is likely).  Information about some mechanics could be more clear.        What comes to mind now is the number of houses needed (do I have people who want a new house?) or which elements impact on the number of babies that are generated. But overall the amount of information is great, see ""pros"" below.Really, that's it. Despite what people say though, this is not really a very challenging game. It's just not very forgiving either, which are different things. It's fairly easy to not screw up completely if you think about what you are doing but the consequences of a screw-up can be harsh.For reference, I'm fairly used to tycoon games and to playing the likes of OpenTTD in very stringent economic settings. After the tutorial I've started my first Banished town with all on Medium difficulty (I thought it'd be a challenge). All went well and smooth, no hiccups, the town is packed with resources and only growing. I can't wait for a hard game but I fear it won't be really hard.Pros:On the other hand, the pros are many and quite convincing:  Beautiful and believable story line.        You can sympathize with your people.  Very pleasant graphics.         Only quirk is from very up close people ""skate/moonwalk"" a bit on the surface but nothing that impairs enjoyment. Lots of details on buildings and environment, seasons and weather look and sound great.  Believable and well-balanced ""disasters"".         From crops' diseases to people's diseases it all mends well with the environment. I didn't even get annoyed went they stroke.  Management without excess of micro management. A very good balance.   Sounds are very life-like.        From chickens to cows to market mumble it sounds really great. Only caveat is that some sounds can get annoying over time, as said in the ""cons"" above.  Mod-able.        I haven't had time to try them out yet but some of them look more like true expansion packs. And I feel there's only more coming so it sure looks promising for re-playability.  Good amount of available information about the game.        The tutorials are quite good and the wiki is somewhat complete so you don't need to wonder too much about what this or that does. There are only a couple of things missing, already mentioned in the cons above.  Very small download size.        At only a couple hundred Mb! Very well optimized. You'll be playing in no-time and the footprint on your HD/SSD is minimal.  Path-finding is rather good.        Path-finding is the kind of thing that can break and kill a game like this. Thankfully your people will do a great job at finding good routes to carry on with their daily business. Very very rarely you'll end up wondering why the hell did this dude chose to carry this basket of fish through the woods into nowhere.  Many hours of good fun!        This is the type of game you'll load up and get so entertained you'll wonder where did the time go when 2 or 3 hours have passed.Final words:An absolute must-have. If there's any chance you might like the genre and you haven't gotten this game yet, get it. Right now. The 9/10 score is solely because of the lack of a proper challenge in the long run. Things I'd like to see are more consequences for the lack of a balanced diet (there's not that much incentive for diversification as it is), or things like a super harsh winter every 5 or 10 years that may get you off-guard, that kind of thing. Anything to get you off-guard, to throw you a curve ball to deal with every once in a while. Maybe the classic citizens becoming unhappy if the town is too big, or if they need to walk too much to stock their households (beyond the lower productivity ""penalty""), I don't know. Just more mechanics to make the game interesting and challenging in the long run instead of ""if you're producing a little more than you consume your are safe forever"" current mechanic, which is a bit too easy to beat and a bit too stable/predictable.

												TL;DR: Like the Sims plus Civ.Never in my life have I yelled, ""MAKE BABIES, YOU STUPID PEOPLE!"" with such passion until I played this game.The game on it's own is a good and sufficiently challenging city builder (although the level of technology doesn't advance much past medieval), and there are quite a few good mods that help make the game feel just that bit more immersive and realistic. It's got the same kind of ""one more turn"" addictiveness that the Civ games are known for, without the megalomania. You start with a bunch of villagers. If you started on Easy, you'll have a good amount of people with a storage barn, houses, crops and orchard seeds. Pick Hard and you'll have a smaller pool of people, no barn, no houses, no crops to plant, and no seeds. If your village spawns in a decent area where they can scrounge/hunt for food until they get traders coming in with seeds/livestock, they'll likely survive, albeit not very happily. If you spawn in some♥♥♥♥♥♥ass dip valley surrounded by mountains and only a tiny stream running nearby... well, good luck. Why were these people banished? No reason is given, make your own. I like to think it's because they can potentially muddy the gene pool with stupidity.The villagers have the same level of intelligence as Sims in Sims 2 - as in, they'll do the job you give them, but not necessarily in the best way (they'll take the longest route to get tools and deliver raw materials, for example). Sometimes they'll go hungry even as they're carrying crates of fruit to the barn, or freeze to death because they didn't pick up a new coat. If you leave your computer with this game running while you go do Real Life things, you might come back to DEATH.My record so far is 4 deaths by starvation and 3 by dysentery in the time it takes to get myself some coffee. 10/10 best coffee I've ever had.

												First and foremost, don't let my time played on Steam fool you, since I got the game on here only recently. I've been playing the non-Steam Version on and off since its release however. Also, if you prefer the short version of this review, feel free to skip down to my summary. With that out of the way, let's talk the game.The Gameplay:Banished is a classical city builder sprinkled with survival elements. You build up your town, meet the needs of your citizens - mainly for food, firewood and health through food variety and herbs - and mine for classic resources like stone and iron. While this may sound simple at first glance, like many things in Banished, it is only in theory and much can go wrong. Grow your town too fast and you will run out of workers, but build too many houses at once to get new workers and you won't be able to feed them all, leading to starvation and yes, in Banished, that means the actualy death of your population and maybe your entire town.In the same vein natural disasters add another form of challenge. Entirely optional - as you can opt to disable them at game start - catastrophes such a spreading fire or a Tornado suddenly whirling through a carefully build up district can easily bring down a vital part of your economy, dooming your poor little town. And while you can arm yourself against some things, building a well in every district for example might be expensive but it also allows your citizens to put out fires before they can spread, you can only wait out others, like the Tornado and hope for the best.While this may sound like a flaw to some, it is to me one of Banished greatest strength, as it is this mechanic that allows your towns to never feel ""quite the same"". Different things happen to them. Maybe you won't expirience a Tornado. Maybe it will be there in your second year, when there's not much to be destroyed- or in Year 50 when you've just gotten to a good place. You might opt not to spend all this stone for wells on your next run and maybe your city can survive ""the great fire"".. Maybe all of these happen and produce a food crisis to boot. But which ever way, it will be part of your towns history, making every one feel unique and memorable.The Technical Side:Banished is a solo project, developed by Luke Hodorowicz, with nothing but its soundtrack produced by another person. For that it is a fantastic achievement. It also comes with a few quirks, which I notice are a big part of the more negative reviews on here - and partly unwarrented - which is why I'm going to touch on them quickly.Variety / ContentAs mentioned, Banished is a one person project, its content in its Vanilla form is therefor limited and you won't find the building variety or production chain complexity you see in triple A titles. There is no two ways about that. What people tend to forget, however, is that Banished was actually developed with the intention of the modding community providing additional content. And they have. From total conversion to dozens of buildings that perfectly tie into the Vanilla ""feeling"" of Banished. There is, as a matter of fact, more quality content on the workshop and the Banished forums than you could ever run in a single game.AIIn short, from my personal feeling, the AI is not half as bad as it's made out to be. Especially in comparison to similiar games, even those coming from big publishers. There are some minor flukes such as laborers tending to dilly-dally around while you're waiting for them to finish a project, but then, there's been a fix on the workshop for that as well since 2014. This issue might also come from the fact that, behold, Banished actually did what Sim City promised and couldn't pull off: actual, uniquely calculated AI. Every single one of your citizens has his or her own life. Their schedule, their family, their habits, their priorities. They are their own person. This becomes especially apparent if you enter ""follow"" mode and just observe a day in the life of one of your people. You will notice that what they actually do does make sense for them and that maybe the builder you're desperatly waiting on for your new project is busy collecting firewood and food from the Market to care for his/her family and that's why they're not showing up.Summary:Banished might not be a perfect game in its Vanilla form, but what it does set out to do, it does amazingly well. Wether it actually warrants its price tag or you'd rather wait for a sale is for you to decide, but keep in mind that there is a heap of free, high quality content to be had on the Workshop and if you're willing to utilize that, this game can provide you with hundreds of hours of fun, long after that first ""vanilla achievement run"". It is also a memorable expirience. I tend to play this genre a lot and for me Banished is easily one of my favorite games within there. In large part due to the fact that - through its survival elements and disaster mechanic - it does not suffer from the classical city builder problem of ""once you know what to do, it's always the same"". Every town is unique, every town has its own struggles to deal with and eventually its own history.			"

												Dude, this game is not easy. You think OK I can keep a bunch of little pixel people alive. Yeah it’s harder than it looks. Banished is a delicate balance between population control and food production and it takes time to master. Don’t be upset if your first few settlements go up in smoke (sometimes literally), this game is about what have you learned. You don’t fail with your settlements you learn new ways of what works and what doesn’t. There are some helpful guides out there that give you some great tips on making your life and the lives of your pixel people better. Here are some of mine.~ Be mindful how many houses you build. But just enough to house your people but not enough to let them breed out of control.~ FOOD! Food is your number one enemy in this game.~Firewood, you don’t need it much in the summer. But don’t let your little people freeze in the winter. ~ If you have people die, take workers off things like mining, timber cutting and blacksmithing (if you have a stock pile of tools) and move them to food. ~ Trade, trading is a key backbone to this game.~Chickens are your best friends. Cows and sheep take forever to grow but chickens are a good and quick food sorce.~ AOE players, throw out everything you know from AOE it DOES NOT APPLY HERE. "

												Before I get slammed for not recommending the game, it's worth saying that this is due to the oversimplicity of Steam's review system. Banished is a town building game similar to the Anno and SimCity series. What differiates the game from these titles is the real possibility of failure. Whereas in Anno, your economy may stall or crash which would require rebuilding a more sustainable city, in Banished, if you find yourself low on food, clothing, shelter or firewood, your citizens will rapidly die resulting in failure. This is an interesting change to what you may be used to in other city building games. Some other good stuff:Graphically the game is fairly low fidelity, but it has it's own kind of beauty. The environments feel alive and the visual changes across seasons result in some very aesthetically pleasing effects.The way you can customise the user interface is great. If you dislike being overwhelmed by information, you can choose to only have certain information windows open at once. If you enjoy a deluge of info, then have them all open (you will need to lower the interface size - something the options provides). However, here are some of the problems. The first problem is down time. The game requires as awful amount of waiting, either for your citizens to build stuff or for your children to turn into adults. Even at 10x speed, it can feel like an age just waiting for that extra labourer. If you build a school, this down time becomes even longer. And it is down time. You have absolutely nothing to do. To make a comparison, Anno 2070 included all kinds of missions and projects you could do while waiting for populations to grow. There is nothing of the sort here, and you may quickly become frustrated, even at the highest speed, at staring at very little going on.Second, but related problem: the lack of direction. In other city builder games there is either an overall victory state, or a set of tasks that can be achieved that act as kind of mini-win states. There is nothing like that here. So while staring at the screen with nothing to do, you may frequently find yourself asking ""why bother?"" Doing nothing in a game isn't fun full stop, never mind when it is a long time to go nowhere. There are achievements for the game but, if like me, you find achievement hunting rather pointless, then the existential nausea will quickly seep in. The final problem, and one that isn't the single developers fault, is the way that other gamers have marketed the title - in particular to do with difficulty. The game may be more difficult than SimCity, but overall it is not a wholly challenging game. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this (the idea that games need to be hard to be good or better than their counterparts is a myth perpetuated by those who can find no other outlet for an inferiority complex) but don't buy the game if you are expecting a super challenge. Once you have grasped the basic mechanics of the game and gained some understanding of efficiently using the game mechanics, you can play the game on hard and within two or three hours can happily leave the game on 10x, grab a cup of tea and watch some T.V. while maybe having to do some minimum micromanagment. It's still early days for Banished and with some adjustments made by the (single!!!) developer and/or with the introduction of some good mods, the game could be far better. For now I'd only recommend to die hard city builder fans who want to try something a little different. If you are any less than a die hard fan, I'd wait it out for a while.Edit: Some spelling and grammar mistakes cleaned up.			"

It also is quite challenging and has some interesting mechanics. Most of the time it does not screw up but when it does it screws up real bad.untill some major updates occur this game just dosent cut it.

												Most city building games have some sort of achievements that make you want to keep playing. The era advances, you get new buildings, there are nifty things to try and unlock.... Not so with Banished! A few hours in and once you have it generally figured out you are done. I keep trying to go back and play some more but find myself bored in 5 min. Plus something feels wrong when you are forced to play the game on 10 times fast forward just so things get done. I would recommend if its under $5			"

												First few attempts, my folks died to the cold in this game. That's bloody harsh, man. Finally though, I started getting it right. It's working!""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" ""Villager is hungry!"" OH LORD WHERE DID THE FOOD GO. And there's 3/5ths of your village gone.Sigh. Okay. Let's play this carefully. Let's get this done RIGHT! Keep tabs on firewood. Keep the houses solidly built. Make sure there's enough food to go around... and keep an eye on the population.""Villager has died from old age!"" Well, ♥♥♥♥. Okay, that's a thing. ""Villager has died from old age!"" ""Villager has died from old age!"" ""Villager has died from old age!"" OH GOD NO.This game is harsh. It's gonna smack you upside the head over and over with horrible deaths that are entirely your fault, with a few that are completely random, like the poor guy who died in the quarry from a rock falling on him.But I've got to say, as frustrating as it was, it felt very rewarding and satisfying to build my own medieval village, and really progress through the many attempts and reboots I had in this game. Playing the line as you slowly try and keep the village going at a good rate. Keeping the new blood coming in. Making sure there's enough to go around for everyone. It's good.All in all, this game is good. Remember to enable the UI elements, but from there on in you're on your own. Learn it. That's half the game right there, and it's more fun than it probably should be. Poor villagers, they've no idea what they got themselves into.			"

												I'm mixed on this game. While it is quite enjoyable, in my opinion, there's a fundamental design flaw. At its core, Banished is a fun, yet simple builder, survival game only made difficult by the ""flaw"". Toward the bottom of Maslow's heirarchy of needs are the physiological and safey needs of self. Yet, Banished violates this premise with its breeding model; the citizens will breed until all open houses are filled. This one, simple fact, makes it nearly impossible to recover from late game mistakes or natural disasters, making the game too finicky.Anectdotally (populatation graph in profile), in my fourth Banished game, this flaw occurred again. A tornado destroyed part of my town, nearly 500 strong. Even though the damage was small, it caused a chain reaction--a tool shortage, led to resource shortage (food and raw materials for tools and clothing), which led to 320 people dying before it recovered. Important note: the town had housing for 500+ people.Food stores slowly began to recover, all the while the adults were still breeding, never slowing. With a 500-citizen occupancy on housing, they kept procreating, but the resources didn't exist and after reaching 400 citizens (270 adults), the population crashes again down to one, lone hunter.TL;DR. The breeding model is flawed, which is an exercise in frustration instead of an enjoyable challenge.  I can't recommend it at this time; I'll revist my review if a patch is released.			"

												Banished is very unique in its play-style. I'm a huge fan of city-builder and strategy games, and so to find a game that really breaks the mold was very refreshing. No tech trees or restrictions is a nice touch, and the idea of being a challenging survival game blended with the usual city builder element is really great. I want to love this game. I want to say its the best city builder game to come out since Sim City 4, but there's a few crucial issues I have with the game.The most significant issue in Banished is that I find myself staring at numbers and messages more than anything else. It's a constant game of moving around my profession numbers. What's worse is that for being such an interface-heavy game design, the UI itself is actually not very well-designed or thought out. The micromanagement in the game suffers from a serious lack of depth. Once you've planned out your city, which is a matter of ensuring your people don't have to walk too far to drop off supplies or get to their homes, you begin your journey of tediously shuffling around professions endlessly while staring at the event log, professions and resource tabs. You're watching a number (Like food or fuel) slowly go down while you frantically try keep that number up by doing anything you can  but a lot of the time I feel like there's nothing I can do. If my people start dying from starvation, it's nearly impossible to fix it without losing a huge chunk of my population, because when people die the replacements take a long time to get settled into their new home and begin work. Relateable Games:• Sim City• City Skylines• StrongholdAll and all. If you like delicate city building simulations. This game is for you.9/10 From Me: Sweep "

												I would have recommended this game before it became $20.00. I think the asking price is a bit much for a game that gets boring very soon after you have played about 20 hours. For a city builder, it's unique in that you have to manage a wide array of basic resources to survive. However, it's also very short for a city builder. Once you attain a population of about 300 or more, there simply is no reason to play the game any longer. There needs to be a 'next-level' for players, after they've built past the survival stage, where grander buildings, regional conflicts (perhaps building an army for defense), or new villager specialist professions become available.I've been waiting for almost a year for updates in this game that would bring it to the next level, and offer a fuller building experience. I've held off writing my review in lieu of the developer's promise to improve the game. Yet, alas, it seems those promises were false. If one has money to spend, and wants to try something different for a small amount of time, they maybe will feel ok spending the $20.00 on this game. However, If you want a more enjoyable long-lasting game, buy Sim City 4. It's also only around $20.00 and is far superior to this game.			"

												After purchasing the game I watched a 20 minute lets play video of it online and then dived right in. It was very entertaining i expanded my village made farms and gathering huts, built bridges and houses. Keeping everyone well fed and warm was a challenge. My village was struck by a devestating famine due to my inexperience and poor city planning. My population was decimated and i was having a blast the whole time deeply immeresed in trying to pull my village out of the hole it was in. That first game lasted 20 hours and it was a pleasure. I then started a second game. I decided that the optimal strategy would be to build a large amount of farms and at all times (apart from winter of course) have roughly half my citizens working those farms. My population grew at a rapid rate and within 5 hours i had a relatively large bustling city and virtually no one had died from anything other than old age. When city builder games get to this point there in trouble, they have to have a way to keep you immersed and the immersion begins to fall apart when a simple strategy of having half your citizens working farms completely removes all challenge in the game. The situation got worse when i worked out that firewood was the optimal trading currency and that i could exchange it with the traders that came relatively often for pretty much anything. My city prospered and grew, constant exchanges of firewood for food with the traders and half of my citizen working the farms caused my food stockpiles to grow at a ridiculous rate and i eventually needed literally hundreds of barns to store it all. At this point one thing could of saved this game.RISKS AND DANGERS AND PROBLEMS EVERYWHEREEE!!!- where are those wild animals lurking in the forests ready to devour your citizens and the invasions of barbarians ready to wreck even the most prosperous villages. The disaster mechanic in banished could of served this purpose and made the game riveting . But they did nothing. In my 30 hours of play time i didnt see a single tornado, one or two fires sprouted up but they were quickly quenched by the 3 or 4 wells i had scattered around. The first time that a popup appeared telling me one of my farms was infested with crop ruining bugs i merely deleted said farm and built a new one. And the tiny loss of food meant nothing because of my ridiculous stockpiles of food. I got so excited when the popup saying two of my citizens were infected with some kind of disease appeared. But nothing happened they just went to one of my two hospitals and were cured. I got bored and moved on. If you look at the reviews for this game youl find that over 75 percent of them have less than 50 hours play time. This game will entertain you for one or two short games before you work out that having half your citizens working farms will solve alll your villages problems.In summary the graphics are nice, the interface is smooth and it has that one more turn addictive feel you get from civ games. This game could easily have become my number no.1 most played steam title. So it is with a heavy heart that i rate this game unfinished and broken at the core. However if the game is on sale for 75 percent off then by all means buy it for that first glorious game. BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN HANDLE IT BREAKING YOUR HEART !!!			"

												Anyways here goesThe game doesn't really have any story or anything, its a city building sandbox, to build a village and prosper. Very interesting game, supports dx11 but atm crashes, theres some bugs here and there but this game is very very fun if you are into city builders.Very nice tutorial and easy to learn. Graphics are ok quite decent, Music is relaxing, and the interface is very nice and easy to use. The controls are easy to understand usually hotkeys are f1-f9 and 1-9 so theres no confusion here,  and the gameplay is just very easy to understand and manage. One small wrong move and you'll end up being a homeless village, or can mean the destruction of your village. So Assign people through one of your professions correctly, and get your village going, get those people multiplying and prepare to prosper because it'll be a challenge!ChecklistAre you out of food? - YOU FAIL!Is your town not happy enough and breeding? - FAIL!Tornado hits your♥♥♥♥♥ - FAIL!Disease and no medication? - FAILnot enough fire log? - FAILeveryone dieing? - FAIL!Out of tools to work? - Get ready to fail!the list goes on+Impressive game made by one guy ONE GUY, CRAZY+Good Interface + keys are easy to understand+Music is catchy, very peaceful+Disasters!+Not an Early Release/Alpha+Addictive Gameplay+Runs real well and includes DX11+Beats the crap outta sim city for an indie title.+Good amount of buildings to make a nice vilage, you got your blacksmiths, herbalist, foresters etc+Managing your village at a large level will get intense, REALLY INTENSE+- the negatives are understandable and forgiveable due to the fact the game was created by one guy-Sandbox game, so no single player included no real story of any kind, you just build and survive.-Can be massively improved!- The only goal is to survive, no real force to kill you of any sort except disaster and missmanagement.-Once you mess up its almost a garunteed game over unless you can fix it, and just one disaster can completely destroy your hours of work, may be tough for the faint of heart.-Since the game doesn't evolve, if you built a village and it becomes self sustainable in a way, thats it. Theres nothing really else to do except make it bigger.- No real replayability besides the map seeding which changes how you will make a new village.			"

												This game is like building a house of cards. Not too hard to begin, you think you're doing well. Nearly 200 population, full happiness. Then some un-noticed event occurs, maybe a little low on logs, iron, coal. Maybe running low on labour causing things to stack up.Suddenly, you have no tools, work is down to 50% but your population is the same.But not for much longer, as without tools you run out of logs (so firewood), coal, coats, food, everything. Poeple are dying left and right.Now you have under 30 populatioon trying to run everything!Fun, fun game, but trickier than it looks!			"

												Banished is an indie town building simulation from Shining Rock Software. Banished is one of the best simulation games out there.In Banished you play to manage some people who were banished from their homeland because of something, it doesn't really matter because what you need to do is to do everything in your power to make sure these outcast can survive and build a new society of their own. Something like that I think. Either you become a great mayor of a great town, or you just simply build a small ghost town.Banished gameplay are so great, I can say it is quite so realistic as simulation games can get. You still can't do everything, but when you start playing Banished you're gonna realize that not everybody can be a Mayor. The citizen in Banished will age, they will grow old and die so expanding and balancing the population is important. Citizen can also die because of acccident too, for example a miner can die because of cave in or crushed by a rock, I even encounter one event where one of my citizen is murdered! Damn! Anyway, resources gathering in Banished is quite complex, there is no skill trees but production chains, and it is important to manage those production chains well or all hell break loose. To gather food we can build farms or pastures, do hunting or gathering some berries or roots in the forest, and even fishing. You can even replant the forest so you will never run out of woods. There is also trade, where you get most of your crop seeds and new pasture breeds. Then there's also disasters, a disease breakout (people will not turn into zombies however), or your own disasters because your people are starving or freezing to death. Lots can happen so keep on your toes.In terms of graphics, Banished doesn't have very advanced graphics, but it's beautiful enough. The graphics is sufficient enough for you to enjoy Banished and forgot to check on the clock. Performances are also good, just keep in mind if you want to build a big♥♥♥♥♥town, you better have more RAM, just like any other simulation games.Banished also has a workshop support for mods. Yes MODS! There are couple of mods that adds even more production chains to Banished, even more building and even more resources to gather. Some even has decoration thing for your town. The best mod for Banished currently is the Colonial Charter mods, which add almost everything to Banished that sometimes it feels like an expansion pack. You can also make your own mods that fits your gameplay.Overall, Banished is a great simulation. If only they add at least a little combat gameplay it could be great, It doesn't have to be a war but something like repelling bandits attack, pirates, looters or something. But that's just my thought. I really recommend Banished for you all simulation gamers.Rating 10/10			"

												I really enjoyed this game, but it's definitely not for everyone. The game thrives off of you failing. It's a game of trial and error. Cities get harder and harder to manage as the population climbs. If you're not comfortable spending hours on a city only to watch it crumble after a plague, this game may not be for you. The way I think the game was designed to be played was for you to build it up to the point of your society collapsing so that you can say ""okay, here were my mistakes, this is why it was unstable; I won't do that next time."" In this sense, the game is immensely rewarding as you're constantly able to learn from your mistakes and get farther each time. That being said, this can make the game more frustrating than rewarding for some people. You're constantly faced with small and large failures that can make the game seem impossible. But, when losing is part of the game, you're not really losing. Anyway, if you want a city-building sim and you like them to challenging, complex, and deep, this is a great game and you'll probably spend a lot more hours on it than I did.			"

												Literally the best building people person SIM game ever. Was wondering about purchasing myself. My village seemed to prosper the whole time while not having much food, I paid no attention. Everybody froze to death but my dear Stellamae. A beautiful sheila at the fresh age of 27, she work with her colleague, Kavia the stoneminer. Kavia died at 33, however Stellamae continued to persevere with her life, although it may have seemed bleak. With a mildly established infastructure to store her reapings, Stellamae continued with her daily routine for 50 years. At this time I had grown fond of her, and wished to counsel her for her trauma a half decade ago. We lived, we loved, we prospered. Years had gone by where we were what you could call ""a thing"", however, the lack of progress with the counseling failed to please me and eventually grew me ill towards the once beautiful Stellamae. At the ripe age of 73, I abondoned Stellamae in any form of love. Stellamae, a trooper, continued to persist. Alas, an exceptionally harsh winter storm froze the hardened Stellamae to death where I was then, in that moment, free to beseach the touch of another.			"

												Normani was a simple man. He graduated from his class with less-than average grades. But he got his work done in a timely fashion and was never tardy. He took a job in simple labor; Normani had no big aspirations; moving good to and from places was good enough for him.It happened one fateful winter. Normani was going about his business-- collecting lumber, moving stones, the usual. However, tradgety struck. Normani somehow found himself trapped behind a wall of houses, his back to the open river. What was he to do? His tool had broken, and he still had to collect the mutton some fool had left in front of the third storage barn! But this barricade of houses proved to be too daunting a task for dear old Normani, who, sadly, perished from starvation in the bitter winter cold, even though his salvation was right around the literal corner.Sweet dreams, my prince.10/10			"

												Recently i spent quite some time in this game to form some opinion. For a long time i was looking for a city-building game what is closest to Travian. If you are familiar with this browser game, you are awesome. If you are not, dont worry just check it out, to get some sense what i am going to talk about. In Travian you start with main building, some resources, you have couple citizens and you try to build and grow your city. Banished is in some sense just like that. Yes i know you can´t build army here and be victorious in this way, but me personally i didn´t care about armies in Travian. My biggest pleasure was build my city, take care of my people, to trade and stuff. I can do this in Banished, with higher level of survivability, where my decision what to build and when to build matter more. I have to take bigger care about my people. Not only i have to be sure they have enough food, they need to be warm in winter, they need suitable living conditions and so on. You also need to pay attention to age of your citizens and you need to make sure you have replacement for them when they die, so you wont end up with a ghost town.Resource management is also big plus for me, as well as current diversity in buildings.I adore tone and theme of this game and so far it was nothing but fun for me.I am aware of a fact that in some point i can get bored, and that replayability might not be case of this game when you fully master all mechanics, and when you find some solid path to build your hamlet to magnificent town.I dont have really much bad things to say if any.I love it, and i will for some time.Grade: A "

												Here's the short - This is a city builder survival game. Keep your banished townsfolk alive and build a town in spite of your harshest enemy - the environment. Sounds simple, but just buy this game. Full price or not, it is worth it, though it will frequently go on sale for $4.99.Something about the balance of keeping everyone fed and designing a town is just glorious. Then, when you get into mods that offer up various buildings and asthetic elements... my goodness can you design gorgeous cities with beautiful plotted out crops and medieval neighborhoods. The guy that made this game created something very special here. I pray to the gaming gods that one day he will create a sequel to this game (as the source code doesn't allow for a lot of things one might hope)P.S. Avoid the mods that make things easier. The point of many of those is for playing on a smaller map, and having those mods makes big maps much too easy to be fun. There's something special about building a nice town/city in spite of all the cold and starvation.Please hear me Luke Hodorowicz... Make me something else I can love <3 (as much as you)			"

My townspeople have an exceptional surfeit of food; I haven't eaten in hours. I should sleep, but I just need to see them through this winter - if I can get that forestry lodge finished maybe I can resolve the firewood crisis... then I can build more houses and get the population back on track for growth again... before I know it five more years have passed. I don't know what time it is, only that I need to build a new pasture, since I finally got some sheep from a trader, and who am I going to reassign to be the herdsman?On the one hand, this is a fantastically engrossing game that will easily give you your money's worth.On the other hand, if you want a productive real life, you should beware of the time sink it can so easily become!

Banished is a survival city building simulator. In charge of a caravan of settlers looking to eke out a living in the wilderness, establish a village where you must cater to the needs of every inhabitants, surviving the odds of the seasons from generation to generation.Pros: This is a very different take on an economy-based city builder. Each individual member of your community is put to the test. You must hunt, fish, and gather resources for food, clothing, firewood and building material, perhaps surviving long enough to grow your own crops or trade for livestock you hope will multiply. Population must be balanced: while children spend years being little more than additional mouths to feed, they are crucial to replenishing your workforce as your existing population grows older. You will come to depend on each inhabitant's individual contribution, but disaster might strike and see all your efforts washed away when half your population starves because a single crop goes bad, or dies of cold when you run out of firewood in the middle of winter, or loose all your investment in your livestock that dies from a disease. Unless you play in easy mode, you WILL fail, often, and the challenge lies in learning from your mistakes as you undertake the challenge of another town. Beyond being a game, this experience puts a lot of perspective on how early settlers of the western world tried, and often failed, to create a life for themselves.Cons: The game lacks variety, and while I understand the realism of its setting doesn't open it to much variety, the lack of a currency-based economy holds you back from successfully growing into a thriving city, meaning you'll always be nothing more than a village, big or small. That same lack of variety also makes the game somewhat repetitive from one playthrough to another, as you have a very limited amount of building types or sizes for each role. The weather effect washes the colors out of the game, and you spend your playthrough in this bleak atmosphere void of any optimism, even when successful.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youBanished certainly gets my recommendation, but it's meant for a specific, even niche, crowd. You don't get the thrill of sprawling a city like you would in a game like Cities: Skylines, but I suppose that's precisely what makes it different. Give it a try, who knows how many hours you'll spend on it.P.S.: If you don't care much for achievements (which Mods disable), there's a compilation of dozens of Mods that could address the variety issue I made mention of. Check out MegaMod in the Steam Workshop if it's your case.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Damn, I wanted to like this game... I really did.  As a big fan of both RTS and city-building games, the idea of survival being your primary obstacle really seemed like a fresh idea for both genres.  Unfortunately I cannot in good faith recommend anyone buy this game.  The problems are myriad, and I hardly know where to begin.  I guess I'll start by covering the good, since it's by far the shortest list.PROS Cool gameplay concept Looks cool for an indie releaseCONS It would be overly charitable to call the UI ""clunky.""  If you intend to have all of the relevant info tabs open (and you really should if you want to survive longer than ten minutes) anticipate them eating more than a third of your screen.  It really detracts from any visual enjoyment you might otherwise get from the game. The learning curve is exceptionally steep.  At less than 100 total population the slightest change in resource allocation throws your entire village into chaos.  While I appreciate that a fine balance is necessary for a survival game, this game really misses the mark.  Convert a fisherman to a forester?  Everybody starves.  Have three births over the winter versus last season's two?  Everybody starves.  Admit two nomads into your village?  Everybody starves.  They should have just called the game 'Everybody Starves' as that's about the only achievable outcome short of OCD-like micromanagement of every single in-game metric. There is nothing intuitive about the mechanics of this game.  There are tooltips, but they are vague and unhelpful, especially when taken in combination with the ultra-touchy resource allocation system.  I have played dozens of RTS titles and have never run up against a game that was so cagey about telling you what the ♥♥♥♥ it was doing (ie. how the game elements affect one another). AI in this game is a joke, and player control is nonexistent.  Sure, you can assign villagers to one of several dozen different job categories, but in some cases that seems entirely futile as they pretty much do whatever they want once assigned.  And of course, since you have no direct control over individual villagers, you're basically forced to watch them as they wile away the hours.  I've watched farmers nonchalantly gather wood during planting season, fail to make it to their assigned farm until halfway through summer, then wander off through the entirety of harvest time because they were cold.  If you lived alongside people like this in an actual subsistence village, you'd flog these farmers to death for constantly putting the lives of the entire town in jeopardy. AI is so garbage it deserves a second bullet point.  Builders cannot prioritize multiple tasks.  While there is a system in place to manage build priorities, it flat does not work.  I have consistently had buildings with zero assigned builders finish well before buildings which had my entire building crew assigned to them, because again: villagers do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they please, occasionally popping in to do 14 seconds of work at their ""job"" before wandering off because they're cold or hungry.  Why these morons can't dress and feed themselves before leaving the house for work is beyond me, but that's apparently how the developer intended for things to work.  The last thing I will say on the subject; because of their failure to prioritize the buildings you select, it's time-wasting and endlessly frustrating to queue more than maybe two buildings at a time.  Doing so causes the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥AI to split your resources among all future building sites (even ones without assigned builders), ensuring you don't have enough resources to start building *any* of your projects.  It's one of the stupidest designs I've ever seen in a civilization builder-type game.  This also makes planning for the future of your settlement nearly impossible.  As a bonus, when food reserves are running low, people forget how to eat.  I've seen dozens of villagers die rather than make the trek across the street to the market (where there is food).  This is another♥♥♥♥♥♥poor piece of AI programming.  Apparently, villagers like to shop like they're at Costco.  If they can't obtain a six month supply of food in a single market visit, they refuse to eat at all.  They will, however, attempt to cross the entirety of the map trying to find food somewhere else, even if it's miles away from their workplace and home.  Spoiler alert: they starve.Given what I've seen in my first couple dozen hours of play, I cannot see how this game would scale up in a fun and meaningful way.  I currently haven't made it much past ~100 villagers, at which point the game seemingly already requires autistic levels of attention.  Based on that, I can only imagine that a larger town would become an immediate and tedious grind.In summary, I think this game concept had a ton of potential that was just impossible for a first-time developer to fully realize.  If you can get it for $2 and pile so many mods on top of it that it effectively becomes a different game, there might be some (fun) replay value there.  I've heard great things about the Colonial Charter mod, and am keeping my fingers crossed that it can save this game.  However, if you're expecting $20 worth of ""fun"" from the vanilla game, I believe you'll be sorely disappointed.  I'm sad to say I couldn't recommend this game at anything other than bargain basement prices.			"

												An excellent city builder, Banished keeps things interesting in a dying genre.  Most city builders allow you to build freely with money, in Banished you must gather the resources to build.  While building can be repetitive, mod support offers tons of new options for buildings and game features.			"

												*edited to update after 2 years of playing*BANISHED is a city-builder that will make you question everything you think you know about survival, life, and humanity. It will take you on an emotional journey and force you to confront the idea of meaning in the face of an indifferent universe. The game is deceptively calming and Zen-like, with its peaceful music and pretty landscapes. But you can't play the game with a casual mindset, because things can go horribly wrong, horribly quickly. Starvation, fires, disease, and lack of resources are ever-present dangers. Things can be perfect for 50 years, and then collapse in a matter of weeks. Every time I play, I undergo a drastic change in mentality. At first, I'm very emotionally attached to my villagers, watching them live their lives and raise their families. As my village grows, I become detached and cool -- I no longer know my villagers by name, and I no longer become concerned when one (or two, or twenty) are homeless or starving. ""This must be what a god feels like,"" I think to myself as I roll my eyes at the death of a villager apparently too stupid to walk ten feet and grab some firewood from the marketplace.As you can tell by the number of hours I've played BANISHED, I absolutely love this game. I'll go a few months without playing, and then find myself missing it and open it up to start a new game. Every time I do, it's the same lovely, immersive, sometimes frustrating but always satisfying experience. BANISHED scratches some sort of existential itch in my soul, and I know it's a game I will continue to turn to for years and years. As far as mechanics go, I absolutely love that the villagers of BANISHED are ""smart"" enough to perform routine tasks without being told. If you want to build a house in a forest, you don't have to tell them to clear the forest, gather resources, and then build the house -- they will perform the necessary steps to achieve your ultimate goal. This alone makes the gameplay superb to most city-builders. I also enjoy playing this game with some of the many mods that other players have made. I love the new content and how easily it integrates into the basic game. But I think I'll always prefer to play it un-modded, because its very spareness is part of what makes it so real and so addictive.			"

												Banished is very unique in its play-style. I'm a huge fan of city-builder and strategy games, and so to find a game that really breaks the mold was very refreshing. No tech trees or restrictions is a nice touch, and the idea of being a challenging survival game blended with the usual city builder element is really great. I want to love this game. I want to say its the best city builder game to come out since Sim City 4, but there's a few crucial issues I have with the game.For the record, I've only ever tried Hard difficulty setting.The most significant issue in Banished is that I find myself staring at numbers and messages more than anything else. It's a constant game of moving around my profession numbers. What's worse is that for being such an interface-heavy game design, the UI itself is actually not very well-designed or thought out. The micromanagement in the game suffers from a serious lack of depth. Once you've planned out your city, which is a matter of ensuring your people don't have to walk too far to drop off supplies or get to their homes, you begin your journey of tediously shuffling around professions endlessly while staring at the event log, professions and resource tabs. You're watching a number (Like food or fuel) slowly go down while you frantically try keep that number up by doing anything you can -- but a lot of the time I feel like there's nothing I can do. If my people start dying from starvation, it's nearly impossible to fix it without losing a huge chunk of my population, because when people die -- the replacements take a long time to get settled into their new home and begin work. The game is very punishing when you do something wrong. There's no wiggle room, no room for error. If I make one too many mistakes then I'm going to suffer a major consequence - hundreds will die. This doesn't make the game challenging, it just means that due to a simple mistake I now have to wait even longer to see my city become large and prosperous. The game feels like a tedious chore more often than a strategic city-planner. The only way to prevent a few mistakes from causing all your people to die is to wait a very long time while your city stockpiles resources (especially food). It's kind of like grinding in an RPG game; it guarantees that you'll be able to progress without issues, but its boring and totally kills the fun of risky advancements.And even when you are doing really well the game does not reward you. At the height of your success all you've managed to do was keep that illogical, arbitrary number afloat. There are no milestones in Banished. There's nothing to aspire to, nothing to accomplish except see your numbers slowly rise and build more of the same. Every building I make is just another bland-looking brown or grey construct and all it does is help the numbers move along in some way or another. Brewery improves happiness numbers. Chapel increases happiness numbers. It's a game of seemingly-meaningless numbers going up and down forever. There also seems to be a surprising lack of information pertaining to what these numbers actually represent. What exactly does 100 firewood equate to? I never feel like I'm actually planning things out, telling myself I need X amount of Y, but instead just trying to make sure I have a surplus of every resource for when that 1 extra civilian is the straw that breaks the camel's back and my economy is thrown out of balance.If updated, Banished has potential to be amazing. Despite all of the drawbacks, I really enjoy the game, especially for its unusual survival/city-builder hybrid play-style. It was definitely worth my $20 bucks. Rating: B+			"

												This game will crush you, eat you, spit you out, burn your corpse, and pee on your grave.  And you'll love every second of it.There is no combat, no money, no infinite resources unless by trade boat...This ain't your momma's city builder, and the name of the game is survival.  People will freeze in the winter, use up firewood for their homes, break their tools, get sick, etc.  Every npc is precious, and even has a name, gender, a job you assign them (teacher, doctor, farmer, miner...) and a home they return to each day to warm up and eat and sleep.  It's like SIm City 1066.  Hard to imagine this was all made by a single developer, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a hefty challenge in a city builder/survival sim.			"

												Banished is a city builder with a heavy emphasis on survival. There are no tech trees, the goal is not to be the next big megacorporate empire or prosperous city, and also no combat. You simply survive. It's stressful and theres little in the way of reward so if this sounds not your thing, avoid it. This game has forced me to shutdown a school building so the little kiddies can work the field some more, after a horrible harvest. A tornado has destroyed 4 hours work. And I loved it.			"

												Few people are aware of my crippling video game addiction (mostly because I spent too much time playing therefore I have no social life) so today I’m outing myself and putting this problem to good use.Banished is the indie game brainchild of one man, Luke Hodorowicz, the founder of Shining Rock Software.  There isn’t a specific back story to the game; all you know is that you were banished (for an unknown reason) to a remote area and it is up to you to plan the city and keep your villagers alive.  It’s like a hybrid of Starcraft, SimCity, and the Civilization series.I've spent roughly 48 hours playing this game.  The first thing I noticed is how effing difficult this game is.  I started playing on medium difficulty, fair weather, and disasters enabled.  After a quick and painful death about 20 minutes into my adventure I had to switch to easy with mild weather.  I left disasters enabled because I couldn’t 100% cheat.Strategy is absolutely key in this game.  Villagers need to have enough food and firewood to make it through the winter.  Some clothes would be nice but my villagers quickly realized they can’t always get what they want.  Without depleting my resources too badly I was able to set up a woodcutter, fields, livestock pens, fishing dock, hunting lodge, and a house for people gathering materials (food, herbs, etc) in the woods.  Boom!  Everyone had a job and the town made it through the harsh winter with enough food and firewood.It was about this time I realized the game also mocks you.  I was celebrating my victory over winter by looking for a place to build a marketplace and a trading post when I suddenly got alarms that villagers were dying.  First three villagers, then ten…What the ♥♥♥♥?  My boyfriend would dub this episode “The Spring of Death.”  It all started with the tornado that killed all but five villagers.  They started to rebuild their houses and stockpiles and just when it looked like they might bounce back…they ran out of food and died.Overall, the range of play is great.  The maps are large and plentiful.  Each map (I’ve only played three but there are many more) has a water supply for fishing docks and trading posts.  Some locations are easier to play than others.  The location where all my villagers were wiped out was particularly difficult because it was surrounded by water and trees with little room for movement immediately.  Hence the total destruction of everyone living within three feet of each other.Unlike many strategy games players have everything they need right from the start.  All players really need to be concerned with is hunting down raw materials like wood, iron, stone, and coal.  Otherwise all buildings, skills, occupations, livestock, seeds, etc. are immediately available for construction and use.  This may be off-putting for some gamers but I didn’t mind as it just made me think a bit more about strategy: Do I want a schoolhouse to teach children to be more efficient laborers or do I want the church to keep up village moral (unhappy villagers are not useful laborers)?There is no story line which is great because I hate to play a plot based game.   Also it doesn’t appear to have a finish line either which is new to me. There is no way to “win”.  The whole purpose of the game is simply to survive and grow your town into a thriving medieval metropolis.  Occasionally things pop up where villagers might steal food and you have to decide how to handle that but there is no central plot based play.I loved this game.  Hardcore.  Even when I knew I wasn’t going to be able to survive a particular map I still gave it my all (I got a little involved) for the sake of the villagers.  I think that’s the thrill of the game: knowing that I could lose at any moment made the little victories that much sweeter.  Well worth the frustration and the money.			"

												Some families banished to the harsh wilderness. They own nothing but their coats, two dozen tools, a pile of firewood and potatoes that will last half a year. It is my responsibility to create a new society for them.""Banished"" is an indie developed strategy game, a sort of hybrid between the simulator ""Sim City"" and ""Settlers"". Here it is neither about building a metropolis or to defend the village against hostile tribes. Here you have to get the little people to survive by allowing it to live in symbiosis with nature.In ""Banished"" it's the village's inhabitants which is the greatest asset. They are the workers, and assigning them different kinds of jobs for the community to flourish. Collecting raw materials like stone and iron are essential, but equally important is to expand the food supply . Woodcutter shed and planting trees, but you need a wood-cutter to produce firewood. Fishermen, hunters and farmers in turn produces food. The commercial harbor, the only gateway to the rest of the world, offers the only opportunity to trade for seeds and livestock.At the same time one has to take into account residents' most basic needs - like giving people shelter. Otherwise, the population does not grow and during the winter they will freeze to death.Death is also ever-present . Residents dies sooner or later, and everytime someone dies, it is a huge blow to the community. Building a cemetery can actually make the villagers happier, because then they have a place to mourn their loved ones. It is both interesting and striking how well the population mortality integrated into the game.The basis of the game mechanics are simple but cleverly designed. The challenge of ""Banished"" is to try to balance the needs of residents with society's expansion - resources and raw materials must always be in phase with each other or else the village will encounter an massive starvation. There will be a reward in itself to construct new buildings, plant new seeds or build infrastructure because it takes time and hard work to gather the raw materials for the proposed projects.The clear and helpful tutorial makes the game easy to understand and engaging. The interface is excellent designed: informative without being overwhelming, with movable and dynamic windows. ""Banished"" looks very plain and lack the artistic variety, but it is an unusually accommodating strategy game.Despite it's ruthless thematics. ""Banished"" is rarely awfully difficult. Although uphill may be long on the highest difficulty level -  it becomes relatively easy when the population passed the hundred.But it is a challenging and entertaining strategy - at least as long as there is something to fight for. My involvement decreases abruptly once I managed to construct any building, buy all the seeds and obtain any livestock. Then there is simply no more to strive for.Strategic basis is brilliant and well thought out, and while there are still things to build, it is difficult to tear oneself away from the screen. ""Banished"" has the potential to be even better, and I hope that the developer will continue adding content. It was after all, a long time ago that a citybuilding game as captivating as this one was released.			"

												Banished is a game about a group of people who were banished from their home (for an unknown reason) with just enough food and tools to start a new life in the wilderness.In the game description, this is said to be a ""city-building strategy game"". Well, I think it is only 20% city-building. In my humble opinion, this is a ""strategic survival of a town against nature"". Things like collecting resources, building structures just the right way so your villagers can use the optimum route to their destination, planning village growth according to terrain, are what this game is all about. If you buy this game expecting a ""city-building game"", you will not like it. Actually half of the bad reviews are based on expectation of a ""city-building game"".Game's complexity is fair. It does not have hundreds of buildings, tools etc. There is only one ""tool"" which villagers use to collect resources and build structures. There are also a handful of structures each with a different purpose, from producing fuel to keeping villagers happy. Its complexity comes from learning what works best how and with what.Game does not have an end game goal. This may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on people's perspective. After you start a game and get the hang on basics, you put your own goal. For example mine was to grow to 600 citizens and got the achievement. It is not actually a sandbox game, but some people put some restrictions on themselves, like not building certain buildings. Some of these restrictions are also encouraged by achievements if you are into it.Pros:+ Good graphics: Structures are very detailed, villagers are distinguishable, trees and nature look good enough.+ Excellent simulation: Every villager has a status based on their hunger, clothing etc. and distance between their house and work place makes real difference.+ Nice tutorial: Tutorial teaches the basics but doesn't give too much detail. For a survival game, learning optimum ways is part of the game.+ Works great: My system is considered high end, but should work great on medium level systems because its recommended system requirements are currently considered very low end.+ Workshop supportCons:+ Slow paced: This is not necessarily a bad thing but it may make some people bored quickly.+ Wrong classification: Well, this game is about survival but classified as city-building strategy game. It makes expectations of new players different and most bad reviews are based on this.Verdict:I don't regret having this game and recommend it without a second thought. I hope developer (yes singular. afaik, it is developed by one person) considers making a sequel in the future.P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.Edit: Fixed some typos and formatting "

												After 10 hours I've pretty much seen everything there is to see. Amusing but over-priced for what could be considered a tech-demo. Nothing to unlock, nothing to beat and nothing to learn. Every game you play will be exactly like the one before that, the only question is whether or not you'll make it through the first winter. The modding community seems to mainly revolve around making the game even easier. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying it (at a huge discount, of course) but I wouldn't recommend this to any one. There just isn't enough content to justify a purchase and there's no new content on the horizon either. You also have to wonder why this game needs to be played at 10 times the speed it was meant to be played at it for it to give you a feeling of progression.Missed opportunity, really. Don't believe the hype.			"

												Another example of a good concept and bad execution.This game is not finished. I don't understand why people think the game is difficult while it's just broken or unfinished or buggy. I can't decide how to describe it. My freaking villagers should stop working and go get some freaking food, which is available in four different storage buildings, instead of working to death in some freaking forest. They shouldn't die the moment they step out of a market which is full of food. They should eat! It's that simple!This game is not difficult folks, it's just poorly coded.			"

												A very simple ""City Sim"" that is extremely hard to master.  You start this game out as a small town just building from scratch, a couple houses (on easy setting) a storage barn and some settlers.  The goal is to build a thriving town that can sustain the needs of all its habitants.  They need to eat, rest, and be healthy.  Sounds easy on paper however the developers have designed the game is keep you on your toes the entire time.  You have to balance your population growth just perfectly to enable your new production buildings to have enough employees, however not too quickly that they run out of food during their first winter.There are a decent amount of buildings in this game, from various vegetable farms, to fruit tree orchards, to live stock pens.  You can have stone quarries, and iron mines, hunter lodges and herb gatherers.  You also must build schools to teach your citizens how to be more productive at their jobs, and churches to provide happiness as well as graveyards so villagers can mourn the loss of loved ones.The maps are very well done, and easily thousands and thousands of variations, some having large lakes which can make your town more focused on fishing, or large forested areas where hunters do the majority of food gathering.  Overall this game is well worth the money.  As of right now I have over 20 hours played and still have not made a successful town that I am happy with.  However, each time I start a new one I get a bit further and closer to perfecting it.Very fun game, can't wait until more items and features are added. "

												Before I launch into the review, let me make clear - I love this game, I love this game dearly, it's going to eat my life, in big horrible chunks, I can see it beating Dungeons of Dredmor for time played with *Ease*. Recommending it is easy enough, but recommending it to all and sundry is a different matter, this is a game for a specific audience, allow me to explain :Banished calls itself a city building strategy game....Right. That's akin to calling Dark Souls a light and cheerful romp through some ruins whilst a few slightly less than alive fellows duel you with rusty metal objects and you meet some not quite all there people on a quest of JOLLY CO-OPERATION.Whoever came up with the store description is clearly a master of either understatement or satire. I tip my hat to them, I do. Banished is superficially about building a village, yes, but that's merely the outer layer of this rather hefty onion of a game, and it's made of many interlocking layers that are all simulated. Each citizen is simulated properly, they go to their workplace, they get hungry, they get cold, they get old, they die. They may have children, they may end up marrying someone half their age (oh, and by the way, I had a family who's father was the tender age of eleven, the poor kid's voice hadn't broke and already he was a dad, awesome!). These are people where you can see the interlocking mechanisms take place all the time, you can see them work, you can see them travel to and from, you can see them interact with the world around them.The simulation doesn't stop at people, it simulates wildlife and nature, you cannot just plop down a forester and assume that's the end to your lumber woes, it doesn't work that way in the real world, it won't work that way in banished. It takes time for trees to grow and mature, time for your foresters to build up an efficient cycle of logging, planting, and treetending, and as a result, much like everything else within Banished, every change you make is rarely immediate in it's effect, but it -has- an effect, and it's cumulative in nature. If you ever wanted a perfect exemplar of ""the butterfly effect"", this game can teach you far better than many textbooks.As a result this game requires a level of planning, thinking and pondering which extends far past most normal city builders, it puts it more on the plane of games like Gnomoria, and perhaps it could be seen as an intro to things like Dwarf Fortress (it's a lot less impenetrable than DF thank Armok), but make no mistake, much like such games, it's very capable of whipping around in the blink of an eye and sabotaging several hours of work if you do not take due dilligence when you plan out changes to your village (a single scuffed up plan of mine utterly wrecked what was a solid village of mine, back to the drawing board once more, but from that failure I learned).In the world of banished, the changes -matter-, treat the village with a genuine level of respect and plan your changes with a slow, methodical hand, and the game will reward you with perhaps one of the most intricate and engaging simulations outside of the aforementioned DF. Play it like a straight city builder and you will fail, and then you'll wonder why. Read the manual, do the tutorials, do your research, this game deserves that much out of you if you purchase it.With that, I recommend this game to those who are willing.			"

												This is a very relaxing and realistic game. Graphics are good enough for a game like this and the game works very well. The game has a lot of micro management which is awesome. Keeping track of population growth and seeing your village expand into a small town is great and very scenic. Having to keep track of everything makes this game never boring. And the maps are random, so every time you start over the map is different (unless you use the same seed agian). The music and ambient sounds are also very well done. Although I do not like the sound of the rain/storms very much. But besides that, the game is very well made and addictive.			"

												Great sandbox city-builder. I have been waiting for such game for a long time. It is quite complex yet not too complicated. Every stage of city growth brings excitement as you struggle with serious threats such as starvation or disease or minor problems such as planning road grid or choosing which crop to grow. There is no war, no money and no politics in this game, just peaceful city planning.			"

												I've played city building games since the original Sim City and I'm a big fan of survival/sandbox/crafting games, so this seemed like it'd be the kind of game I'd love.Sadly, Banished has the bare bones feel of an early access game that has been abandoned. In most games of this type, I usually feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what's on offer after 20 hours or so. In Banished, I felt I'd experienced everything after an hour and the novelty was already wearing off. I had already constructed every building type possible. There is no building progression apart from upgrading wooden houses to stone ones. All that was left was to unlock different crops and animals at the randomised trader who visits once per year, which didn't seem compelling enough to keep me going.I am OK with simplicity as long as a game remains fun, but beyond the initial colony construction there's just too little of interest to do in Banished. There is no possibility of cultural or technological advance, no politics, no contact or conflict with other groups, nothing to aim for besides building more of the same stuff and increasing your population. If this was an early access game I'd say the scope for development was huge, but it's not and as things stand it's shallow compared to the competition. You can pick up an older classic like Anno 1404 - with rich diplomacy, upgrades, trade, seafaring etc - for almost nothing these days.My biggest issue given the relatively intimate scale of the game was that I felt no emotional investment. It seems like a wasted opportunity, given how fascinating the intrigue of interpersonal relationships in a new community like this could be. Play Rimworld to experience a masterclass in this. In Banished, I felt no connection to or compassion for my colonists. They're crude identikit stick figures with no personality and little to set them apart or make you care. They all switch jobs constantly depending on who lives closest, with only a basic 'education' stat affecting their efficiency at anything from teaching to stonecutting - good in terms of optimal pathing I suppose, but totally immersion breaking. The colonist AI is woeful, by the way.I have recently had a blast with games like the aforementioned Rimworld and This War Of Mine, in which characters are full of personality and incredible and varied interpersonal stories constantly unfold that really draw you in and made you care. Losing one of my people in either of those games elicited a genuine emotional response. By comparison, Banished felt incredibly hollow. Yet another stonecutter has been crushed by a rock? No worries, another interchangeable faceless drone has automatically taken their place in the pit!The graphics are what I'd expect from a small indie developer. Sadly, Banished has a very clunky modular UI that deviates needlessly from established genre conventions. For example, speeding up and slowing the passage of time - which are easy to locate, always visible and quickly altered with single keystrokes in similar games - are in submenus here, requiring extra clicks or 2 hotkeys to get to. I could live with this if the game was perfect otherwise, but it's symptomatic of deeper issues.Other reviews complain that starvation is too hard to counter, but I found I had no problem as it was easy to feed the colony through the winter by assigning plenty of colonists to fishing.I can see how some people could get into a relaxed, zenlike state whilst playing this and might appreciate its simplicity and lack of progression. However, I feel like I already have plenty of other better games in my library which accomplish that. I'd say if you love building games and want any kind of depth or incentive to persevere, look elsewhere. Or do what I do and try it on sale - it's only a 300Mb download, so it's quick to give it a shot.			"

												Welcome to the future of knights and merchants, without the fighting. Some may like the fact it doesn't have battles while some prefer it. If your looking for a game where NPC's look after themselves, this is it. If you're looking for that but with a little war involved, I suggest you go look at Knights and Merchants (for a relatively low on-sale price)!What is the goal? The goal is to keep your civilians alive as long as you can and expand your village as best as you can. Banished is a game in which you organize the village and the NPC's do as you say. They do not follow your orders directly as they cannot be selected (only for viewing/status purposes). As you head the village, you call the shots on who does what. Say you want to build a house. You will have civilians at your disposal to complete such a task. The trick is choosing the right amount of laborers to be trained civilians. This means you don't want to have all 12 of your competent laborers to be builders. Why? Well, the more of one particular class means less potential for others. I usually hover around having one or two builders at my disposal while very rarely having any free laborers. Other professions include farmer, herdsmen, gatherer, fisherman, hunter, woodcutter (for fire wood), forester, herbalist, blacksmith, brewer, tailor, vendor, trader, miner (for iron), stone cutter (for stone), teacher, physician and cleric. The trick is to properly balance out the professions of each individual. The number one thing to focus on though is food and firewood. If you run out of either you'll start seeing civilians die quickly. Stone and iron can sort of be a rare commodity given how much you build. Your population will start to grow slowly and can sort of be pushed by building new houses. Problem is though, have too big of a population and watch your reserves drift away quite quickly. Before you know it, you'll have messages popping in at the bottom saying your civs are dying. There is a notification system in place by the tool bar (to the bottom right) that indicates if your full or have a shortage of supply. Some of these notifications also include a merchant, a disease or even nomads. Given you have built a trading post along the water, a merchant will appear every so often. New merchants will pop up offering different goods. You can choose to order every time this certain merchant comes to town, once or never. There is a bug in the game where if you kill off all your livestock, it's quite difficult to get them back again. I haven't quite grasped how to get more but I know there is one specialty merchant that will sell livestock to you. There are times instead of taking the livestock to the fields, they will be taken in for raw meat. I'm not sure if this is a bug or a lack of laborers but I wanted to make my reader cognizant of the fact. Merchants also sell seeds and product (such as pears or ale). To combat a disease, one must have a physician and a hospital in the village. Nomads will occasionally show up to your village asking for asylum which is great if your population is low. Again, beware taking in more population as your reserves can deplete quickly. A graveyard can also be built to accommodate the dead and a church to gain followers. There is a catch to getting civilians become skilled tradesmen. You will need to build a school to educate your population. Additions to the game include dirt and stone roads, a town hall that tells you the status of your village and a marketplace. A marketplace evenly distributes reserves (from food to supplies) to your village. Without one, you may have a few needy villagers take most of the supply. Building is relatively easy in game and provides you with a decent amount of options (buildings can also be rotated as needed). You may upgrade wooden buildings to a stone building. Beware though, don't do it all at once. You may leave some citizens homeless!The visuals tend to resemble city skylines almost identically at times. What you see is what you get. The animations themselves are relatively good and you may need to zoom in to see properly. You can get in pretty close and rotate the camera as you please. They're between a cross of realistic and cartoon graphics. The sounds are suitable to the environment. Not exactly diverse but good enough. The music is pretty good and sets the mood and setting appropriately. This is a game where easily you can spend a few hours in without knowing the time. Overall, it's a pretty good game and provides a bit of a challenge trying to keep your citizens alive and well. On the other hand, there are a lot of other unexposed perks that could have been put into the game such as invaders.RATING : 7.3/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  B-ScreenShots :The start of something amazing Arrows indicate that the production has reached it's limit whereas the octagon indicates no work is being done at that location  The merchants in town When nomads arrive, their fate is in your hands My best yet  Luckily, no one got really sick in my village "

												Banished is a spectacular game. I do admit that initially I went in thinking it to be a city builder and thats how I treated it. I bit me back very hard and I was very displeased. But then I really thought about how I was playing. I cahnged it to a more ""initally i'm screwed so husband your resources and educate your folks (so they do things more efficiently)"", and once I started my games with that mentality the game itself became a true challenge and a blast. This is a very well done SURVIVAL game. The Bad....If you get a huge batch of nomads, it can throw you into a death spiral with food or plague (once of my nomad requests brought in almost 50 people, within 5 minutes those 50 added such a strain on my food that half of my city died to starvation). You need to play very methodically. Build here, watch and see if it stabilizes, fix if it doesnt or leave it alone if it does. Rinse and repeat. Growing your population. Holy christ this one can hurt. You basically need to be in a constant state of building new homes (which is rough because that adds more strain on your initially reduced resources). Thats the only way to populate the village/town/city.Sometimes ya just get bad luck. The randomly generated map sometimes just gets ya in a stupid spot. The GreatDamn, this is a fun game. There is always something to fix, tweak or build to make your village/town/city more efficient.Plenty to build, plenty of ways to influence how your city looks and grows (with a forrester you can essentially make ""parks"". Great mods. I recommend the terrains plus and the Banished plus. They both add difficulties and streamline the overall gameplay.Tough as nails. This game was a great challenge to husband your resources and grow in a stable and healthy manner for your folks. ConclusionIf you like to build vast cities off the bat with no challenge, dont buy it.If you want to build a small village, work up to a bustling town, and finally grow to a massive city. But during each step of the way you encounter a good logistical struggle for stability. Buy this game. I cant tell you how much fun this was for me. Great job Shining Rock!			"

												I will not recommend this game, though, it's fun. Reason is, you cannot build a ""stable city"". You have to expand the city as you play the game. Or citizen in you city will get old and die. I don't know why the reproduction of people in this game is so poor.1 house can be occupied by 5 people. But, when the time past, people die. And another family member won't reproduce until you build a new house. So they will move in and start to reproduce 1 or maybe 2 kids.			"

												This game is good, flwaless in fact with the things it does, it's the things that this game does not do that is where the problem lies, as a stright up villiage builder its great but there are many aspects to the game that you need to know before blowing $20 on it,1, all the F**kING VILLIAGERS ARE GLUTTONS, i had a reaaly nice town with 1,000 potatos, plums, and venison and by winter its all gone. how is a poplulation of 80 people eat 1,000 of those items EACH.2. Crops, some grow in winter and some grow in spring, not in this game all crops even pumpkins only grow in the start of SPRING, like no thought went into this, apples grow in Fall right? not here only in spring, so you have to make sure that you have a huge surplus of food or people die left and right.3, as the game progresses it feels as if your people get lazy i hade 50 laborers cut down a small segment of trees, rocks, and iron and it took them 4 seasons to cut a ♥♥♥♥ing 20x20 set of land, why?4, trade costs, these things are outragous to grow your community and have a tavern to sell beer and keep your people happy you'll need new seed depending on the random roll you got when you started the game, some merchants you can buy seeds off of but you need 3,000 units of your items to apparently buy 1 pack of wheat seed to make beer with, now that would not be a problem but not all merchants take every item so your trading post could be 50% full of the wrong ♥♥♥♥ing things and you would have no idea.lastly some buildings you just don't build like a school house or an herbalist, i went through a game with a pop of 900 on hard mode, no one ever got sick, there was never a tornado, its as if the games selling point on being ready for♥♥♥♥♥♥to hit the fan seems to be broken and or just gone on some map seeds, and the school house, that bonus where it make your villiagers work better and produce more is all just a dice roll some of my wood cutters and stone cutters produce alot of stone and wood being uneducated ive also had the same thing happen with stone and woodcutters being educated, the game is just too damn inconsistant, when i do a thing the first time i expect that same thing to happen again on a different map seed			"

												This game caught me a bit by surprise, with my purchase entirely decided by an intense longing to play Settlers 2 again, and that it looked very pretty. It's about making Medieval civilization in the wilderness, starting with a group of twenty hardened fiends who have been BANISHED (the game doesn't say what for but I think murders), and seeing how big you can get. There's no external military threats, it's just a question of if you can balance your expansion, production, transportation and all that other stuff that makes a town tick, without everyone dying. Pure sandbox, no aim in mind beyond what you want to set yourself.My first few settlements predictably toppled over, when we ran out of food/firewood/clothes/all of the above, but eventually I settled into a nice, soothing rhythm of building and consolidating. Stuff takes time to happen, so you can't charge around building farms and smithies and whatnot, you get there gradually, and with planning. Secure basic food, fuel and shelter in the first year, scavenge materials, plant trees, open a smithy a few years in, maybe barter for some chickens, a few more houses, a bridge over a stream...seasons tick by at a leisurely pace while you think about what you want to do in the next decade, or how you're going to create enough food to support the next twenty people.It's not frantic, and once you know what you're doing there's not much that can surprise you, but sometimes you just want to do that, build up your little decorative fishtank of farmers and quarrymen. I think what it sets out to do, it accomplishes excellently, but the lack of surprise and novelty will (I think) stop me playing in the long run. There's nothing grandiose to shoot for, like Pharaoh's monuments, there's no pressing reason to keep expanding. Beyond occasional gimmicky disasters, you're mostly going to be staring at the streets, weighing up whether a tunnel would be a good use of stone, and adjusting the worker distribution to pump out a few more iron tools.It's relaxing, it's reasonably deep, it's pretty, just don't expect too much in the way of an epic saga and you won't be disappointed.

												Very little variety in gameplay. Aside from terrain differences, no town is really any different/harder than another.City grows and expands, but 100 years in the future and you still have the exact same, terribly insulated houses that you did when you started, for example.Yes, it's a one-person dev team, but expecting over $20 for this at normal price is way too high for the content. Oh, and the AI is atrocious. Fires are the most dangerous thing ever, not because they burn down your buildings, but because the majority of your villagers don't try to put them out, even when idle and with a well nearby, not starving, happy, and educated. It's a mystery.			"

												While the game does a lot of things right, there are many plain awful things about the game. The most important one is that when you've ""cracked"" the code on how to survive, there's not much challenge, except some random things thrown at you which you have no control over. Many bugs are still in the game, but most of them are simply annoyances. All in all you can get a few hours fun from this game, but once you get the hang of it, there's really not much to see.			"

												I bought it on sale for 6$, and for that price it was an enjoyable enough game. But, after a while it stopped really having much to do. You do the same things over and over and over again working slowly -- emphasis on the slowly -- to expand your settlement. If you expand to fast you die; if you expand too slow you also die. Leaving you with this middle ground of ""just right"" expansion speed that really makes the game incrediably dull. It takes forever to do much of anything, and for large chuncks of the game I was waiting on the merchant to bring me animals. I gave up after 10 years with out a single merchant bringing animals. I did have the same guy turn up six times in a row selling the same single type of fruit I had started with. That really sums up the game you can be doing everything right and end up screwed over because the AI is just awful. I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned the issue where people starve because the farmers  won't go harvest their crops -- that happened. But even worse than that was the total illogical issue where the game seems to struggle with allocating materials in logical ways.Even with low caps set on EVERYTHING that used wood were still freezing to death because EVERY SINGLE OTHER THING that needed wood got it before the woodcutter. It's so frustrating to have to micromange things that the AI should be smart enough to figure out.			"

												If you think you're good at management sims, you should step up and try Banished. It will humble you. Unless you do everything right and provide for about 17 different needs for all your people at all times without fail or delay, people are going to die. A lot of people. The game's resource generation vs consumption is incredibly tilted against you. Unless you have fully educated villagers using the best tools and wearing the warmest clothing and in exactly just the right amount of houses (not too few, not too many), it's a long slow slide into starvation and desperation. My village has been going about 43 years, but because villagers apparently age at 4 times the normal rate (I started off with 10 villagers in their 20s, and within 5 years the oldest ones in the village were in their 40s easy) there have been generations of turnover, especially due to all the starvation. You can't farm enough. You can't forage enough. You can't mine enough, you can't quarry or herd or smith or log enough, fast enough. At my peak, my village boasted almost 100 residents. After about a 20 year recession that worsened into depression (not helped by the frequently completely useless merchants that came to call, no I don't want to buy your stupid pumpkin seeds, I already grow my own, why the hell didn't you bring iron), I'm back under 30 residents, mostly from starvation. The game plays very similar to Tropico or Gnomoria in that instead of controlling individual villagers you simply order the places for them to live and work built, and manage as a taskmaster/city planner. It starts off kind of easy because a new map will have abundant resources just lying on the ground around you... but once you use that up, it's much slower and more expensive to mine it/cultivate it/quarry it. There are no goblin attacks, no rebels, no hurricanes or zombies... just your silent mental wail as you watch people under your charge wither and die because your skills at management were a single iota less than divinely perfect.

												Love it, its a small scale village simulator, but more than that its a survival sim. The people are your resource, and damn they are hard to keep alive, they can die from the cold, age, hunger, accidents. Don't expect to be building up some grand metroolis of 2,000,000 people, you'll be lucky to get your village to 200 people without starving or disease wiping you out.Superb. High recommended.			"

												Let me just say right off the bat that if Banished were a game of SimCity's scale, it would definitely land into my ""top five favorite city-builders"" list. And maybe it will, once mod support is finally added. If it's actually added. Dear god, please just add it. It's going to lead to amazing things, I know it.So what are we dealing with here? You've probably seen the words ""city-builder"", ""survival"" and ""strategy"" words getting tossed around. Imagine SimCity set in medieval times, but on a much lesser scale. Remember Stronghold 1? Take the economic aspect out of that. Add Children of the Nile to the mix, minus all the monkeys. Splice those suckers together. Bam! You get Banished.If that sounds exciting to you, then by all means, go nab the game. But first be aware that:- There are no quests, no war, no enemies, no money, no research. It's pure and simple ""build"" and ""survive"", or ""build to survive"" in this case. Also trade weed for chickens! Exciting.- There are randomly occuring disasters to spice up the gameplay, but the rate at which they happen remains a complete mystery to  me. My last hard game had none occur during the 50 years span. My normal game before that had two tornadoes in a row. Ho hum.- All in all, this game doesn't have much to offer: if you're familiar/experienced with the genre, there's a good chance that it'll only take you a few playthroughs to figure out the game's mechanics and grow a large town, at which point it becomes a very tedious experience... Until you start anew.- Finally, there's no end and no goal. If you really MUST have that sense of ""accomplishment"", you're gonna have to resort to achievement hunting, or set your own goals.BUT!- There's STILL a considerable amount of depth in this game. The only way to truly succeed is through careful management, strong infrastructure and a wee bit of luck. Do you enjoy bossing tiny pixel people around? Then boy oh boy, is this the game for you.- It is ridiculously addicting, so you better get some coffee before tapping that play button. Don't say I didn't warn you.- The lack of a goal is not necessarily a bad thing. While it may sound off-putting, that's where your imagination comes to play. There's not much room for roleplaying here, but planning your village's layout and dealing with terrain obstacles on each newly generated map is fun and exciting, like in any sandbox game.- IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON, FOR GOD'S SAKE, so mad props for that!My verdict? I certainly got my money's worth here. Good city sims are a rare sight nowadays, and the (hopefully) upcoming mod kit just might improve the game tenfold with the help of community. So good luck, and full speed ahead.			"

												Banished has a lot of potential but it really fails to live up to this, as a result of poor AI and obsure mechanics. I have fond memories of playing it when it first came out for many hours, but always the same frustrations arise.The game is challenging, but for the wrong reasons. Not because it is designed well, but because it is designed poorly. You are often forced to deal with chain reactions as a result of a 'bottleneck of stupidity,' usually a villager hording a material for no reason or not building a vital construction despite it being prioritised. Eventually, the town will become large enough so that any challenge (read: AI stupidity) is made irrelevant so you just keep expanding and expanding with the same buildings again and again.I have a number of questions concerning the game.Why do villagers keep idling for no apparent reason?Why does health gradually decline despite all needs to stabilise it being met?Why does one household decide to horde the entire harvest of a particular crop, plunging the village into starvation?Is there an answer to these? Probably. But no answer is surrendered by the game; very rarely do I have the feeling that I am fully aware of what is going on.I greatly admire the ability of one man to create this game, but really, it is more like an alpha after being released for over two years.I really *don't* want to give this game a negative review because really, it can be enjoyable. But I don't feel that I can give it a positive one.			"

												Oh Banished... Banished is hands down one of the more realistic city builders out there. Banished takes what we love about a city builder and adds even more to it. The constant monitoring of supplys, resources, trade and general health of your towns folk doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. The AI while impressive is anguishing at times, and yes I mean times of pure frustration followed by cursing and even having to get a beer to calm myself.Banished is almost detailed to a fault, a good fault but none the less a fault of its own. If you are lucky enough to make it past the first couple of years’ life in your town will continue to have its own unique struggles. My most successful town, now 105 years old, continues to go through its own challenges. Often brought on by my own ignorance or a minor hiccup in city planning. Occasionally you will have an outbreak of the flu or contaminated food but once you achieve a population greater than one hundred or so this really isn’t a problem as the doctor will be able to fix you right up. The greatest two issues every player will undoubtedly face is starvation and your citizens dying of freezing temperatures (lack of firewood). The issue here is while the game is addicting it’s easy to get caught up in the non-essential functions of your town. While having stone roads is great, having food and firewood should always take the gamers attention as an everyday issue. If the player is lucky enough to get through the troubling times of a village on the brink of extinction early on, fret not the threat is still real with even a population of five hundred plus. I found that allocation of resources is more important than ever in a large population. Perhaps a flaw of the AI used to control these villagers is that they don’t seem to do many things with any rhyme or reason. For example, if I have a large quantity of chicken in one storage shed but that shed is on the other side of the map my towns people with make the journey to find it. Often times by the time they arrive villagers that live closer have grabbed the precious artificial sustenance and have left their fellow man to die. The problem with this is that there is no “F5” for the villager now traveling what is going to take them a seasons time to get the meat that doesn’t exist. They will pass by fully loaded storage facilities as the AI has already populated a destination for them. This is my qualm. Now there are ways around this. Once your town becomes large it’s best to think of every area as its own township in a county. Each area needs its own food supply, its own firewood, its own foresters, harvesters, teachers, doctors and so on. Forgetting this will bring what is all but certain death to the citizens of your village. My village of five hundred still goes through its random shortages but is generally healthy, most recently I lost over two hundred citizens due to the simple errors mentioned above. All in all this game takes the cake. Its oddly addicting and you almost feel like you are part of this thing that has become great. While you won’t be protecting your city from outside invaders, perhaps the only con I see, you will be the “president” of something great. I’d love to see some updates but overall who can complain? Perhaps we can hope but this is worth every penny you spend. Good luck and have fun being Banished! "

												I never buy games at release, but after looking at reviews and videos, some of which were not entirely positive, I thought I saw something I liked in it, and decided to pick it up. After spending 11 hours (so far) playing it, this is not a decision I regret.I'm not saying I that I haven't found things in it that could be improved, but there's nothing so far that NEEDS to be improved or fixed in it. Nor have I encountered any bugs, large or small - and my entire play time so far has been in a single session.So, if you're into city building games with a bit of challenge, I think you would not want to miss out on this one.

												Banished is possibly the most challenging city sim. That i have ever played. The game is extremely punishing to those who go in there thinking ""Oh it's just like Sim City"" lol. No, it isn't. This game is very detailed in almost every aspect to how your town is from the overall health of your citizens, happiness, and, how many jobs are there avaiable as well as citizens. I mean seriously this game has a graph to keep track of progress of every little thing from resources, to population, to supplies. This game is very well informative. Plus the tutorials are also a big help. The developers really put a lot of hard work into the game. Just make sure you keep your citizens happy and use critical thinking skills in applying to the needs of your citizens and you should be fine :)Plus this game has a modding community behind it. To make the game better or slightly easier for newcomers to the game.The only downside to this game is the overall ""disasters"" In this game it's either natural (tornadoes, fires) or medicial (diseases, and such). With that being said, The game doesn't have any bandits, wolf attacks, or neighboring towns for you to take over. Lol, yes i know what your thinking ""But um this is a building city simulation. Not some sort of RTS conquest"" and yes i get that. However the disasters happen rarely. Sometimes not at all. This game is a great time killer. But that is actually the problem. Lol, i want to be more active with my village. Maybe trade it with other villages that I have created, or defending my town from bandits and wolves, or take over other towns that are randomly generated on the map. Perphaps share the world space with a friend who has the game as well?If the developers are going to make a second Banished game. I sincerely hope they add more ""disasters"" in the game. It's a great start, plus the game overall should keep you busy. Not everyone will like this game because of these elements or lack of certain elements. But hey who knows maybe a modder will make something like this in the near future? So don't get your hopes upAll and all. If you like delicate city building simulations. This game is for you. "

												Banished might be the perfect metaphor for humanity. Once you’ve mastered an expanding economy (which takes some doing), you will continue to grow, filling the space that has been provided to you. Eventually you will run out of most natural resources. You will desolate every inch of the wilderness in your quest for preservation. Soon you will have too many mouths to feed and not enough jobs to go around. Despite this, your people will continue to breed relentlessly until starvation makes them unable to work, collapsing the economy until every last man, woman and child is dead.That’s the game. "

Great simulation (each person has a family, job, home, needs) that you can observe and influence, randomly generated maps, wide range of difficulty settings, no set goals. Very intriguing food system that you have to tune to keep your people alive. The only issue I have is that you can not individually lock / unlock your storage barns for certain materials and that people tend to starve during ""the long walk"" passing filled markets.Recommendation: Buy this game!

												Also known as Kino's Journey Simulator 2014.Don't Let The Idiots Live, Ever.Banished! You and your sect of friends, family, feeble, and rabble have been banished from your home kingdom/city-state/fuedal village for whatever closed-minded reason, and have decided to settle your own hamlet/city/empire.Now, Banished is an attractive, medeival-looking city building game where you construct a small town out of the landscape around you, and then watch it wither away into dust as the idiots fail to harvest their own fields stay in that simple stage until the Netherworld (read:hell) freezes over.Sounds a bit boring, right? If not, go back to watchin' that paint dry.If it does sound slightly... bland, that's because you've not heard the terrors provided by nature. Remember the Oregan Trail? Dysentery is going to look like gold once you're done being Banished.The cold kills, diseases kill, idiots can't harvest enough crops to feed themselves, nomads will flood your town, the mines and quarries kill, mothers die in childbirth, there's a stabbing at the market! A fire!Hope you built a hospital to quell that plague, or some wells to keep your wooden shacks from burning like the Cleveland river. The stabbings can't be helped, people are just evil, sometimes.That's all just the general layout, too. Really, anything could kill the villagers - even themselves.But, the game also gives you all sorts of chances and options to thrive. Most basic needs are easy to access, and come in that wonderfully stepped system of mine, build, die horribly, profit. And people are resilient and happy if they're given the right help, so build that school! Learn 'em up!And now, my personal experience with Banished:Had the luck to spawn on a large lake where a river emptied out, so fishing was a quick way to grab food. Forests all around, and not many mountains, so plenty of supplies at the ready for my town. Soon, was running a village of happy, healthy people and managed to have it grow beyond the lake and into the wilderness, with nearly sixty educated people.Seeing a large, flat stretch of land close by, I set farmland out and began growing a crop of pumpkin. Life was good.For atleast five years, that system worked. Until, one day after building a long-awaited chapel and town hall, everything hit the fan with the full force of an atmoic detonation. I made the horrible, awful, absolutely terrible decision to close the school, believing it would benefit me for the time to produce faster rather than in larger yields.Bad, bad move.The now-moronic people of The Land of Equals couldn't create tools nearly as efficiently or quickly as their past relatives, and even with full fields from good weather, would not harvest enough to feed the nearly-120 person population. And the great decline into starvation began, until a decade later, when there were only 17 survivors who'd managed to stay alive and get through schooling.And, as I type, the educated remnants of that Banished pilgrimage are rebuilding with stunning succes thanks to their teaching. But the town hall's charts will forever show the great decline into Idiocy, and the impact it had upon The Land of Equals.So, TL;DR short, Banished is amazing. It can be calming, or stressful. It can give you a warm feeling of care, or a cold feeling of despair. If you take the challenge, be prepared for anything. AND NOW THERE'S MODS! =D9.1247/10			"

												I want to recommend this game, I really love it. But there's one game mechanic which just ruins everything . . . starvation. When you build a house and it becomes occupied, the people who move in will take whatever they need from your reserves of food and fuel and they will never ever share it.So picture this, a house with a 75 year old person in it, fully stocked with firewood, coal and food. The house next door has a family of 6 and they freeze to death, the family next door to them has a family of 4 and they starve to death. With this game mechanic you will lose lots of people, over and over again when it is not necessary, and there is no mod to correct it.			"

												I will start off with saying I put in over 160 hours into the game, according to steam. So with that in mind, I love the balance that the game provides. There is survival, there is city building, there is economy, and death. There is not much of a story to the game, so dont come in expecting to be thrown into a story while you build, you wont find that here. This game is a sandbox. Great modding community though. But its still a sandbox. And what keeps you going after you get the hang of the game is achievement hunting. So many failed towns, so many lives lost in the hunt. Let's take a moment of silence for all the abandoned towns that have perished trying to achieve the ultimate achievements. Alright. Thank you. Anyways.. Its a fun little game that if you love hunting them achievements, this game will keep you interested for a while, or if you love playing around with mods, this is also a thing that kept me hooked for the slow hours of the game. Personally, I love the concuction of the balance of the game, and in fact, I'm going to go play it a little bit more now, still hunting that one ""have a town of 300 people"" achievement. Keep running out of food for my people. Anyways, even with no multiplayer or Co-op I still reccomend the hell out of this game. Goes great with listening to podcasts! =D			"

												When I saw that a game like this was published, I really enjoyed the thought of having the possibility to play an Anno again. Building a town, furfilling the needs of my population, trading etc. After playing a few hours I just felt betrayed. There is no real enemy but the AI. Villagers do basicly what they want, even if you give them another order, people die of ridiculous reasons (my chicken sheperd got trampled to death...), plagues or tornados nearly have no effect on my population and even on the highest difficulty the game bored me. Why? Here are some reasons:- Most of the time I waited for the children to grow up, time I was forced to do nothing but watch the poorly animated people- There is absolutly no progress. Yes, your town grows. But unlocking technology through building schools? Nope. Getting better buildings because your builders get more experienced or receiving a better education? Nope. - Any competition against another AI? Nope. You are absolutly alone. Without any threat. So what's the point in building and enhancing your city? - It is too easy. Even without any alien danger, there could have been something. Maybe an economy you have to keep going (things like a currency for payments, work time, trading special rescources for happyness etc)  or citizens leaving your town to form a own community. There is enough potential in this game to furfill those things...These are my main reasons why I don't recommend buying this game. If you are looking for a challenge, don't buy this game. If you just want to build a town without any difficulty, without any point and just wait for things to happen, then this game is really a thing.			"

												Simply more incredible than I anticipated. I have been following and waiting for the release of Banished for 11 months. This is a must own if you enjoy city building games. Downloaded through ShiningRock and have been playing for 7 hours prior to the Steam release.Today is a great day for those of us that have been craving a game such as this. Great strategy game and very challenging in having to balance resources and economy to survive each winter while growing the population.			"

												I like this game, but I can't recommend it at full price. There just isn't enough there. On the whole, Banished is an exceptionally slow game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; it gives you far more control over your village, but the player grows past the speed pretty fast, and then you're stuck staring at the screen waiting for the glacier to move.  Population is the biggest thing, as it crawls up so slowly creating new, necessary jobs to keep your town alive is difficult. Seasons pass without much fuss or difference. I never had a problem with starvation or disease or... well, anything, and I was playing on medium. It felt like easy. I went 20+ years in game time without a single disaster, although I had it turned on. If you're going to have a disaster system, you should have a disaster system. The trading system takes about five years to start even after you build your dock, and then they only trickle in once every two to three years if you're lucky, and they only ever bring one or two items. Better hope it's what you want. Ordering my sheep took well over ten after the traders started coming, although I was very excited when I finally got them. Excited over buying sheep- the citybuilder life. Citizens seem to constantly swap jobs around with no rhyme or reason. They almost basically refuse to move outside the town's radius to harvest resources, and as of such you find yourself running out. You can't prioritise what business gets the resources first, so it ends up being grabbed by whoever wants it over the business that actually needs it (logs & the woodcutter). The hunter AI is absolutely moronic- I watched one stroll casually through a herd of deer, then wander off, still apparently working. This was not an isolated incident. The tiny size of the hunter's radius is another big no- I would've expected it to be a great deal larger because surprise, animals move around the map. I liked they didn't hunt them to extinction though. Coupled with the hunter's terribad abilities is the lack of leather, which creates hide coats, which is a main trading chip along with firewood and iron tools. They also keep your citizens warm, but whatever, they're worth a lot at the trading post. #priorities The music is beautiful, the graphics are nice, and I love the trees when they're mid way through growing (pine trees, but tiny. it's adorable). It's a charming game, and a decently relaxing one too (I do say this as someone who has never had a disaster, though. I imagine that raises the stress level). The controls are lovely, although in a game with micromanagement there needs to be... an easier way to do a couple of things? For instance, I should be able to stockpile items I don't want the town to use, I would've also liked the ability to move things from a storage unit to another- think Pharaoh, and 'accept all/get maximum'. (to those of you who have never played Pharaoh, do so ASAP. it's my favourite city builder by a longshot, and holds up extremely well despite how old it is... but set speed at 90%, not 100%). So, in short. I guess I like Banished, It's enjoyable, but it's mind-numbingly slow, even for a citybuilder, which aren't exactly known for their high action gameplay. I think it's worth $5, but it's not worth $20, so buy it on sale and give it a go if you like games that are slow paced.			"

												I have played just about every single kind of strategy game. all the way from the Civilization series to Divinity Dragon Commander. with Civilization being the world builder and divinity being the combat game. But i have never ever been able to find a game where i could just build. just expand my civilization. without dragons comming and ♥♥♥♥ing everything up. but now i have finally found it, and its name is Banished. Banished is a fantastic game, i cant even praise it enough, the graphics and crisp and beautiful, with the nature feeling basically alive. the music is relaxing as all hell. and the ai is suprisingly fantastic. compared to games like Castle Story where the AI basically is a can of ♥♥♥♥ the ai in Banished moves as they should, they do as they should. basically it all just comes together to form one hell of an awesome strategy game that will keep you entertained for hours. you want proof? this rigth here is me playing through some of it

												Addictive, fun, yet boring.This is a city building game which starts off as just pure survial and keeping your people alive, then slowly turns into a city management game.  The first part being somewhat more engaging.  Also a fire, followed by a tornano, followed by a fire followed by a shark attack (OK maybe I imagined the sharks eating my last 50 citizens) while at first seems ridiculus and game ending at first.  It was actually quite a bit of fun to try and come back from.  WHile the game does offer acheivements to earn it seems quite a bit open as to what the goals are, there's no progression per say since you can build any type of building from the start (other than aquiring all the crop types and livestock types).  This actually i think is a good thing.  Theres also tons of mods for this game which is cool too, in fact while in game you can look at mods to get.  I found this game fun to play as long as I was playing for fun, if you take my meaning.			"

												So, having logged 104 hours into the game and completed roughly 75% of the achievements, I figured I would sit down and write a review/recommendation for Banished.  Overall, this game is amazing.  It's got multiple (and I mean multiple) elements to consider in order for the player to achieve a healthy, happy, thriving community.  However, the basic mechanics are pretty easy to learn and the tutorials, while being somewhat bare minimum, are enough to at least get the player happily started on his own dreams of popuation building domination.  As I've played the game I've noticed: - Having auto-pause on tabbing out is wonderful.  Some people may be annoyed by this, but since the player's population can go from happily frolicking through fields full of plums and cherries to attempting to cut down trees or mine rocks with their bare hands, puking their guts out and then trying madly to find the nearest hospital while shivering from the cold... all in a few moments on 10x speed... yeah.  Hurray for auto-pause so the population doesn't die while the player decides to load up youtube and watch a 2 minute video.- Merchants in ships do not seem to use their spyglasses to look for supplies when deteriming which trading post to visit. When given the choice between a trading post full of workers and materials vs. a trading post with two lonely workers struggling to load 10 barrels of apples into an empty warehouse, guess which one the merchant picks fifty percent of the time? That's right!  He visits the seedy looking trading post with a few apples and completely bypasses the ten workers in the supply-laden trading post waving welcome signs and cheering. Sigh.- One basket of produce left in a farmer's field over the winter somehow magically prevents that farmer from planting seeds or harvesting crops from any of the rest of his field the next planting season.  I realize the basket probably does take up five feet of space, but Mr. Farmer, honestly, you can just walk around it. I promise. Or better yet, take it to the storehouse so it is actually useable.- All hunters in this game should be provided with a gps and a gun safety manual.  Hunters can produce an amazing amount of leather and venison in just one season.  Left to themselves, even alone in that huge mansion of a hunting lodge they get, one hunter can produce enough to feed a small army IF they are smart enough to find the deer standing outside the front door and not walk past them to aimlessly search for deer three miles away.  When they do eventually find a herd of deer, hunters seem to throw caution to the wind and take out as many of the cervine as they can, eventually hunting them to extinction and leaving no animals for the following several years.- Actions taken by the populace of each city give the player a sense of a helpful, industrious community bent on serving others and helping with daily tasks.  This is awesome and probably would be the ideal scenario for any group of people who were banished to a remote location and forced to rely on one another to survive.  I love that farmers will help carry supplies to build houses, miners will sacrifice time and energy to carry logs from the storage area to a build site, and the local brewmaster will even leave the pub to help someone down the road carry his basket of fish to the storehouse as soon as he has extra time.  However, this is hell when the player's wonderful generous workers decide to help the person waaaay on the other side of the map, or to help clear a group of trees approximately nine hundred miles away, leaving their own jobs to stagnate and become unproductive.  Upon realizing that nine hundred miles was probably slightly too far to walk in one season, they then try to return to their homes and jobs, only to become famished and cold since they apparently left without coats or a lunchbox...or a tractor trailer loaded with all the stuff they'd need to not die before they got back to town.- As it stands now, when building fields, orchards, and pastures, the player is unable to see how many workers will be required to serve at these locations once they are actually built.  While somewhat amusing, it is also pretty frustrating since this results in juggling workers back and forth unless the player has the size-to-worker ratio already memorized.- WTB: the ability to toggle trees, stone, iron, and other terrain features on and off in order to be able to see what is being built where, to be able to plan roads that actually go in a straight line, and to have better city planning ability in general.- Grats to the developer on coming up with some character names that made me laugh out loud several times.  I personally got kicks and giggles out of having three versions of the name ""Orill"" pairing up with ""Colon"" in the stone house I built for them and then surviving happily ever after presumably meeting each others needs quite well until their eighties.- Every once in a while, even the most robust woodcutter needs to see the herbalist for a remedy.  This works quite well, until the player realizes that their woodcutter should have gone much earlier, because even though his information tells the player that he is visiting the herbalist, he is hallucinating since the herbalist hut has not been built yet and said herbalist will not exist for the next two years.So, in conclusion, after a very long commentary and review, there are quite a few small tweaks to gameplay that need to be ironed out, but for a 1.0 release this game is incredible and impressive not only graphically but in its ability to release (for the most part) without a hitch.  I look forward to Banished 1.0.1 and beyond!			"

												City Builder just doesn't capture what Banished it. Call it a ""civilization builder"" and you're closer to it, because you don't just have to build them a place to live, provide them with resource and protect them from disasters, you also have to protect from themselves.You're in control of some kind of communist-anarchist utopia where there is no money and everyone has ""equal"" (first come, first served) access to resources, but where everyone acts like a greedy consumerist! They'll take as many resources as they need/can from the public storage without any consideration for other people (they'll happily watch their neighbours starve while they have food for a full month) and will rather have their civilization collapse than regroup in houses during harsh times to save on fuel.That said, it's an enjoyable (but very harsh) game that will reward your good planning skills by not screwing you at the first occasion and has some great potential with mods coming along in the next few weeks (depending on how much can be changed/added in these).But it's also a very harsh game that might not very be enjoyable if you just want to place good looking buildings/roads all over the place (building diversity is at the bare minimum, as you'd expect from a small medieval community struggling to survive) for only the sake of making a good-looking city, buy SimCity, not Banished.And if all these points seem fine to you, then you should expect a lot of late nights spend building (and rebuilding) medieval villages and possibly a few ""damn it's 3am already!""

												I really enjoyed the time I spent with it but I didn't really see a reason for me to keep playing, I saw pretty much everything the game had to offer in my first session. The brutal difficulty that had been reported by many was not something I experienced at all. I actually found the game to be a bit easy and I didn't feel challenged playing on medium difficulty. I feel that the game doesn't provide enough incentive to return unless you fail repeatedly which I didn't. It really is a wonderfull achievement on behalf of the single developer who created it, but when faced with competition such as anno it falls a little short.			"

												I bought this game because i thought hey, im bored. Thankfully this game awards my boredome with a challenge that is unforgiving in a positive way. The first city i built actually worked, until my people forgot to have babies and all died of old age. My second city woked until the hurican landing right in the middle. In the third city i finally got far enough to start farming, leading to my population starving. (don't ask, im dumb) Still this game manages to give you a challenge that is incredibly hard, then shoots you in the knee. (once again, im very bad at this game) Still, i find myself coming back again and again for more and loving it. If i were to describe it i would say a graphically pleasing, less random f*** you version of dwarf fortress (yes, i love dwarf fortress, got a pop of 500 in my fort right now). Currently i would rate this game a 4.5/5 with it only not getting a 5 because i would prefer some more clarity in the guide, one crash I expierienced twice (autosave saved my progress perfectly though so this point is kind of mute) and that i believe, just like kerbal space programm, this game really needs mods. (modsupport currently in development but i do not rate things that are not here yet)For anyone who likes strategy, citybuilding orchallenging scenarios i would highly recomend this game.			"

												If you look at the screenshots and see a game that you're interested in, this game is for you.  Like Anno without combat, randomly generated lands with city planning and a disaster rate you choose.This is the calmest game I've ever played.  Payday 2 is on the opposite end of the spectrum.On the same rating scale, this is near to Payday 2 in my mind.  Hard to rate this a 8/10 when the basic premise is to relax and not be so rigid with your thinking.'Moving Screenshots'

												This game takes city building in a different direction. It's not like the Sim City games (The GOOD ones, so definetly not SIm City 2013) or Cities XL, which I do not own but I've soon my friends who love city building games play it and it looks good and they say it's amazing. No Banished is different from traditional city builders where what you build is dependent on the money you have and what poeple want. In those games you're the mayor of your town of >insert name here< and you are there to serve the people that move in because that's government. In Tropico you are the dictator and you have a lot more freedom though the things you do may get you in trouble and it won't take long for you to figure out what to do to succeed (Still a fun game though with a great sence of humor). In Banished, there is no one to please, no income, no hand holding and no dumbing things down just because things should be simple.Banished adds survival and RTS elements to the city building genre. You start off with a few people, a few resourses and no real instructions (which would be nice for a few things.). It's like Minecraft, there is no shame in going online to look up information on what to do and you may end up failing many times before getting the hang of the game and even then you still need to be careful. What you end up doing is creating farms, houses, tailors, woodcutters and other jobs slowly and allocate the amount of people you want to work that job and you can even adjust the max number of people allowed to work on that location. And if your like me, at least early on, you'll find yourself constently re-allocating people depending on the season. That's another thing that this game has is the seasons which will affect things like crops. For instance, you can't grow crops when there's snow during late Autumn through Winter, so during this time you move people from growing crops to other jobs.Now one might think that since the player relies that much on the citizen's A.I.'s, if the game is glitchy then they're screwed. And they'd be right. HOWEVER, that is not the case here. Aside from one issue I had with crops that might be due to the A.I., I never had a problem and seem to be someone who gets glitches most gamers don't get. It's so well made that when I fail I have no one to blame but myself. The game did what I asked it to but I should have done something different. This game is so optimized I've never had a problem with frame rate and it takes up such a small amount of hard drive space! I find it amazing that this game was made by one person where games like Day One: Garry's Incedent are made by a group of people and fail on things like collision and even things that can be fixed by simply changing a number. (Seriously, why can't the gun in that game kill people who are wearing nothing but a piece of cloth?) Or even big dev teams with a big name company backing them releasing broken, incomplete games (Looking at you EA).I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city building. This is a game that can end up taking a lot of time out of you day. I bought it on a Friday and Sunday night I realized that not only have I not reach year 100 yet but it's actually 1 in the morning Monday and I have homework I forgot to do. This is something that has never happened to me with any city building game. Here I really felt incharge and what I say I want my people to do they will and when I fail, it's not to a glitch or poor A.I. but to my own mistake. ""I should have had more hunters and less fisherman."" or ""Should have made my sheep farm bigger."" I'm not even really one to play these types of games because I always failed at Sim City as a child. This game has definitly held my interests and I would even say it might be worth getting when it's not on sale. (Which pretty much when I buy all my games)			"

They're built right into the game for you to freely install and they dont hurt game performance. After 200 hours I've done all that can be done, waiting for different mods to come out.

												It is very early in the year but so far this is the best game that has come out so far. Think of the Anno series or Age of Empire series but have it more about survival from teh cold, food and natural disasters. The village you craft will be the new home for the banished people. Along the way you will build all kinds of things as you try to get a nice village made for you're people. Older people die, there kids get older and you have a new generation of people to deal with. It is a very challenging game, but at the same time some how relaxing (like Anno is for me), highly reccomended. Great gameplay, nice art design, fantastic atmosphere, great immersion, good UI and its just a blast to play. Mix in survival elements into the city building genre and you have my personal favorite strategy game since Anno2070 and Total War Shogun2. It really is amazing that only one person made this game. You WILL fail at times but you will learn and improve and each time you start a new game things can and will go differently but you have some new designs and ideas from previous games that might help!Go buy this game right now if you want a survival game mixed with a city building game, fantastic indie game and a early MUST BUY for 2014. Two thumbs way up from Kozzy.			"

												Essentially, Banished is a very simplistic version of SimCity, placed in a time period where your biggest concerns were the ones directly related to survival. There's no technology or development tree or anything, allowing the player to freely choose in what ways to progress in his or her town. The citizens have vague needs, so you can choose how to satisfy them. A town can be based on any and all production facilities, and so long as you have some form of surplus, you can trade to acquire things that you yourself are not producing. Finding balance in population expansion and resource production is still a challange, and a quite enjoyable one at that. The AI of the villagers is about average though, and there are still some things that need improved, such as the deer walking across lakes and rivers... or hunters dying of starvation when there are animals in their front yard. Overall, 4 of 5 stars.			"

												Banished is a strategy game where you start on a seeded map with some basic supplies and must build, maintain and grow a society, while managing your resources and keeping your people healthy and alive. It is a little more difficult than it sounds as players can easily run out of food and starve to death, grow old and die, or get sick, especially during the winter. There is no end-game to Banished, you essentially just keep playing until you no longer feel like maintaining your society, or until everyone is dead. It doesn't have a very good tutorial system, so there is a little bit of a learning curve to the game. It has a level of difficulty to it, which makes it a challenge, but the lack of direction or an end-game makes the game repetitive after a certain point.

												Banished is the most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. I was sold when I heard the story of one guy, who labored 3 years to make this game. From music to graphics, gameplay and sole support, it's all one guy. Beyond that, this is simply one of the very best city (villiage) building games ever made. It feels like a gamer designed it, instead of a big company driving a studio to push something inferior out on an artificial deadline.There's room for improvement, but nothing that interferes with game play or fun. This game is simply a pleasure to explore. It's only $20! Can you believe that? I can't! Check out the dev's page and learn about his journey. It's worth it.			"

												I was a little bit disappointed to find out that this game is already finished since I thought it was still in beta. The potential of this game is crazy but they abandoned it with a terrible AI and bugs all over the place. Nonetheless I had a lot of fun with this little game. The ones that sometimes miss Anno or Rollercoaster can revive old feelings with this. Others should probably just buy a more complex RTS game.Its fairly easy to build up an economy but there is literally no endgame content. I built the highest tier buildings in about 2 hours and then started to get bored... there are no opponents so all you have to do is watch the seasons go by and hope for a trader to offer you sheep ^^			"

												“Banished” is a city builder, pure and simple.  There’s no zombies, wizards, dragons or roving bands of raiders to fight off.  You start the game with a group of people that have been exiled from elsewhere and your task is to build a medieval-style community from scratch.  There are no buildings to unlock, since they’re all available to build from the start as long as you have the available resources.  There’s nothing to research.  You just need to build things.But don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s very simple; it’s not.  There’s a balance you need to keep: grow your population too quickly and they run out of food and starve to death.  Don’t build your population enough, though, and there’s not enough people left to take over the jobs of those dying of old age or accidents.  Don’t have enough firewood stockpiled and they could freeze to death come winter.It’s a simple game that can be quite complex.  If you’re unsure whether to buy it or not, though, then if the above sounds boring then it’s unlikely to be your kind of game.  If it sounds intriguing then I think you’ll enjoy it.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is a one man developer, so what he’s been able to achieve is pretty remarkable.  Personally, I haven’t encountered any crashes or obvious bugs.Update: One mistake many new players seem to be making is to play their first game on 'hard' mode.  I very strongly recommend starting on 'easy' or perhaps 'medium' the first time.  This will enable you to get to learn the game better, so that when you've built up enough experience you'll have the confidence and knowledge to tackle the game on hard mode.  Playing your first game on hard mode is an extremely steep learning experience, and all but guarantees starvation for your poor unsuspecting people.  Leave that until you have more experience.			"

												Alright, let's establish what Banished is NOT.It's not a city builder like Sim City, it's not a life sim like Sims, it's not a survival/crafting game like Don't starve and it's not an econ sim like Industry Giant. It's a little bit of everything, but Anno on a micro scale might be a pretty fitting description.You basically start the game with a few settlers and various resources/buildings established. You do not have ANY goals, your only goal is to survive and thrive. To do that you're going to build houses, establish an economy and ""produce"" new settlers.That means cutting wood, gathering/hunting/harvesting food, so your citizens won't starve to death, creating building materials, chopping firewood, so your citizens won't freeze to death during winter, and carefully establishing houses and increasing your population, so your city won't simply die out. Blacksmiths create tools for your citizens to work with, trade posts let you trade materials, etc.All in all there is a lot to do. You need to balance your need for expansion with a sustainable economy. If you have too many citizens and not enough of them producing food, then your city will simply starve, which will usually lead to a chain reaction of you losing the game, since dying citizens can't produce more food, but if you take too many citizens away from other production like fire wood, hunting, tailoring or anything concerned with blacksmithing, you will have other issues to contend with. The game can spiral out of control quickly, which is what makes it appealing, I guess. The larger your city grows, the more sprawling your infrastructure becomes, the more challenging the game gets.I would also definitely recommend the Colonial mod, which opens up the game immensely with new buildings.Not so great stuff: The UI could need improvements, several buildings share ""jobs"", so it's a bit finnicky to assign citizens to a specific building. It's also very hard to see dependencies of buildings. You want to build X, but you don't realize that you need to produce Y first...only having icons is not so great. Apart from that I don't have many complaints.Now the obligatory game report:Started my city, everything went pretty well, produced food en masse, unfortunately did not realize that my citizens were getting too old, so my 40 peeps city went down to below 30 pretty quickly. Thankfully my Banished were still in a happy mood and procreated happily. Still that took over 10 years or so, then my food supplies started dwindling, all the while my old guys kept dying, and I still could not make all my children work...damn it. Vicious cycle. After having burnt through about 6,000 units of food (a lot) I almost got back on track, but then my city was ravaged by a disease. I was able to erect a hospital in time and got that under control as well. After that things started to go smoothly again. I played for about 31 years, then I got ""bored"".Banished is a great game, but lacks longevity, unless you are content to just simply sand box your way for hours upon hours. Still, I liked it and getting 5 hours out of it for a product on sale makes it worth it to me :D			"

												It is a rather nice game with beautiful scenery, but it has some severe shortcomings.- You can't control or assign your villagers to specific tasks or roles, the AI will do it for you, and it makes awfully poor decisions. Uneducated villagers for doctors, educated villagers for fishermen. Villager whose tools just broke become the new blacksmith and works in slow motion for a year or so...- You can't choose which resources to store where, so the things you need usually end up in the farthest storage. Nor can you move them in any controlled manner, you'll have to start tearing the building down which will transfer everything to the closest (?) storage.- The AI will typically try to take the shortest path, even if it means that the villagers walk one square beside the stone road (faster travel) you just built.- You can level large parts of a solid mountain wall by starting to build a certain building near the edge of the slope, but you can't level a small dirt mound preventing the placement of a regular building (without using this exploit).- The villagers will not necessarily do what they are supposed to, and there is little you can do to control it. There is a ""work priority"" button which may send a few villagers the right way, if you're lucky. It's not uncommon to have to abort ALL other tasks, to get some villagers to do what they are assigned to do before a whole year pass in game.I like hardcore games, but it's no fun when you are in a constant struggle with the broken AI. I'll wait and see what happens in upcoming patches, but as of now I sadly cannot recommend this game.			"

												I love simulation/city building/base building/survival games and thought this game would be a good addition to my collection. Maybe the game just isn't for me but I found that it got very boring very soon. It's hard which is good - you have to concentrate to make things work. Although it just doesn't have enough content to keep me interested.Nothing is upradable apart from a wooden house to stone house. There is no progression, only expansion (and expansion is just a replication of all existing assets but building more of the same thing). It's great having mods but even those are limited. Your townspeople characters are just duplicates of each other wearing the same clothes, the music is short and repetative and the graphics are standard 'meh'.I'm glad I bought this game on sale. Considering that for a little extra money you can get the likes of Cities: Skylines which has far more to offer. Banished feels like an unfinished early access game to me. Again, this is just my experience with the game. It seems that there are a lot of people who are enjoying this game, maybe I just don't get it.			"

												Getting rid of the wordy mess that was my previous review.Banished, on the outset, seems very bare-bones and drab.  I wish I could go back and recreate the first few hours I spent on it, watching my townsfolk die within the first year because I had no idea how to accurately meet their needs.  Food was a nightmare, and the game will punish *heavily* any sort of wrong step the player might take.  Planning ahead is crucial, and the learning curve might be steep for some, but once you see your town exceed 200-300 people, thriving with plenty of resources to trade, you will feel a sense of major, satisfying accomplishment.  That never goes away.Now that I've mastered it, I've found a plethora of additional content in the Workshop.  There's all sorts of cool things to do, some rather cheaty, some full-fledged overhauls, some adding to the difficulty.  I expect this to be a game I go to whenever I feel like I have ""nothing to play"".  Banished might look a little gray around the edges, but it is a beautiful, well-oiled machine.			"

												Once you figure out how to progress without starving/freezing all your citizens, it takes off quite nicely. The challenge is at a good place, and it's really addicting. It's exactly what I was looking for in a city building game. I watch Netflix on my other monitor while I build my towns, haha. I'm hoping it will expand with some DLC in the near future; maybe with more structures/commodities like music/entertainment, law enforcement, Bakeries/butchers, faster travel like horse and carriage and even trains and boats eventually. Maybe even different cultures/architecture etc. I'd love to get some Chinese or other Asian style cultures/architecture in there; even South American and Arab and get more varied environments (jungles, deserts, swamps etc). I'd definitely be happy to purchase more DLC/content from this developer for this game, and I'd love to see what else they have in store for the future!Well worth the money if you like a challenging city building game. It doesn't advertise one thing and then ends up being something else. They don't try anything new or risky; it's honestly just good, wholesome city building and resource gathering. Love it.			"

												Why do we play games, any kind of games? Basically, we want to have fun, but we also want to experience an ideas in safe environment, without suffering the consequences. The thing that excites since the dawn of gaming industry are god/manager/tycoon games, games that let players experience what is it like to run something and to be alpha and omega behind the whole idea.Comparison of indie wonder Banished with Simcity series might come in handy if we want to explain to someone what this game is about in the term of mechanics. Yes, it's a city builing-management game, but it is also much more than that. It is a war of nerves, fast decisions and perfect example of hard, but satisfying gameplay.You start to build your city with certain number of families and objects, depending on starting difficulty. Terrain is random. You gather resources, handle building, give instructions to people. You'll need to provide shelter, gather wood, stone, iron, chop it to firewood to keep everyone warm. Gather berries, hunt and fish. As the game progresses, you'll start building schools to educate kids, mines and quarries to dig deeper in search for stone, coal and iron, you'll expand over rivers. Your city will be visited by traders from all around that will bring more seeds, more different trees, various cattle. But the traders will also bring diseases, your town will catch fire, there will be other disasters... The summers seem so short and winters so harsh. People will be born. People will grow up. People will die. Frozen. Starved. Or just of an old age. You'll see local cemetery growing every year and respect the sacred ground, knowing it is the final resting place to people who gave  everything for a growing city...Graphics and sounds of Banished are there to sooth you and to help you concentrate on numbers. Lot of green color will make your eyes relaxed and ready for long hours...Banished isn't an easy game. You will face numerous challenges, even with the help of guides and tutorials. You'll be on the brink of extinction, but the game is fair - so it is possible to fall down and rise to be powerful again. That's the most beautiful thing about Banished - it's rewarding and it makes you quit the game and go to bed happy and fulfilled - even when you lose everything, it makes you come back for more.And when the game does that - that's why we play it over and over again.***If you like this review, feel free to join me for some more recommendations at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/libereviews "

												I love banished, with my heart and part of my soul (the rest to Rainbow Six Seige)I love building my city, getting things from the workshop to make it easier.But I really love the graphics, sound, and AI. Nobody is dumb, all AI act lively. Sounds and graphics make up the most to this stunning game.Yet, why the bad review?Simply one thing, and one thing only.Contentwithout getting new buildings from the workshop, the game seems dull with only like 20 buildings. It is very plain, as it shows that you can build a huge kingdom, when I feel like I am just building a small colony.What can Banished to to be better?1. An easier mode to start with. (I'm bad)2. WAY more buildings, like- bank, or barracks. (this leads to my 3rd)3. Military- Nomads will come and ask to be part of your village. How about a mode where they can go to war with you? Make people become soldiers, armed with weapons and armor, all could be made in a barracks. The blacksmith can make weapons and provide to the barracks which will distribute to soldiers. Send them off to fight or defend. Build walls and towers. Can't be attacked more than once within 4 years or something. Better weapons and armor can be researched in maybe a new building.4. Quests- Maybe merchants will tell you, ""Get me a treasure buried somewhere over there"" or ""Defeat the nearby nomads"" to earn food, XP (will be explained in 5th), or livestock.5. The ability to, after doing challenges or quests to earn XP, progress to the next age or era. From the colonial age to modern, build an empire. (maybe to ambitious)6. Realistic government- you can make rules, like nobody can own more than 2 weapons, or must work for food, or even pay taxes in whatever you choose.7. Currency, like real currency. You choose this at the start- Whether you start to use money or coins at currency at your village, people around will. Use these to buy♥♥♥♥♥♥from merchants. From the 6th, taxes would be whatever currency you use.Hope the developers see this. Please vote up and comment suggestions.			"

In German this would be called a high ""Wuselfaktor"".The mechanics itself are explained in a neat tutorial and are easy to understand, but (medium) hard to master.It's well worth the money, even if you do not play it for a very long time, especially when bought during a sale.

												Wonderful, beautiful little city building game.  This game is elegant in its simplicity, and zooming in to watch your villagers carry about their daily tasks is one of the most serene things I've had the joy of experiencing in a video game.  Watching your first village come to life is utterly delightful.My main gripes here are that the game is somewhat limited in its content and depth.  After awhile, you stablize and simply run out of things to do.  Sure, you can grow and expand your village, but at a certain point growth just becomes a process of repeating the same building orders across a map until eventually you cover the entire map.  The game also suffers from a reverse difficulty curve--the first few years are usually the hardest part of the game, and as you keep playing the game becomes easier and easier to the point where your village is stable enough that it can self-recover from any natural disaster.Modding support is on the way, and with that will probably come more challenging scenarios and the like, but for the time being I feel like there's a finite amount of content to enjoy here.  Still, it's a great experience while it lasts.			"

												If you are like me and you play Strategy games to ""Build something"" rather than to destroy something, then Banished is the right game for you. Lead a group of cast outs to new glory and have them survive. In fact the goal is to have them survive, which ain't so easy. Hard winters, food shortage, supply problems, disasters... It's not easy to survive in the wilderness.The game never puts you into much stress, yet it is challenging on it's own away. You need to learn how to plan ahead. Even if you think you have a totally stable economy and enough supplies for yours the situation can change quickly if you try to expand to fast or if you ignored some issue.PLUS: Superb random names that totally ignore genders, citizens who mate with everything that is old enough to make children AND time travelling genetically modified humans who age 2 years per year.So far I did not encounter any bugs9/10 ( I so want to give a 10/10 but I miss a few simple ""not 100% needed but would be helpful"" features like sorting statistics, transport goods settings and other stuff)			"

												I would actually give this game a ""Not Sure"" rating. This is an amazing game and piossibly the best strategy/survival sumulator I have played. I did enjoy it and wouldn't change anything, but would at least add things but I was forced to stop playing because after 15hrs of playing, I feel like that one person who actually ready that one shirt ""How do yo keep an idiot busy? (see back of shirt). For me, the equivalent was spending hours on maps just to hit a brick wall when you reached a point where everyone died of stupidity, or at least the precipice of the programming.Cons:-After 10 plus maps that I spent hours trying to sustain a population of 12+ and making a town, those 10+ games ended with people starving within an hour+ into the game. The one before last everybody was hungry, there was no food, even though I had 4 crop fields, two orchards, a hunting cabin, a fishing area, and a gatherer. My very last game made me quit, because I was building houses for my homeless people when they suddenly just stopped all building at 30% and walked around aimlessly. I used the priority tool, I made everyone builders, I needed another stock pile for everything they had (I even had a Market Place) yet they all idled all over the land, far from even where they were supposed to be working as farmers. In the end, the 12 people I ended with were content to share two houses when they needed warmth instead of building the 5 houses they were supposed to build and use just to wander around aimlessly with 'House' symbols over their head, giving up their jobs just to starve to death. Tell them to tear a tree down it's a mass exodus to fullfill that one order. After that, wander aimlessly, some even winding up roughly the equivalent of 300+ feet away from anything that was being built or farmed. I had built a school to teach how not to be stupid, but that remained undone at 10%. Pros: -This is a wonderful game, the graphics are nice, it's really is beautiful, the controls are easy and I got the hang of it in no time, but this glitch or whatever it is that makes them stop, make it stop. I will continue to play this game, but I will use the Debug tool just so I can pop in more people that can just walk around aimlessly and not build a damn thing. So to all reading, yet I have played this game for 15 hrs, yes I played multiple maps and started differently in every way, always created a food source and homes first, used the priority tool when needed. Only on my last two attempts did I create the Hunter's Cabin first instead of after the crops and it worked out wonderfully, untill everyone just stopped building, eating and caring. I wasted all this try trying so many thing to make this game work for me and trying to convince myself it was just this map or this save got corrupted, but after 15hrs of trying to convince yourself, I let go og the ghost and decided to walk away from the money and hours wasted and trying to revive a dying horse and just went to play with another one. This game must have a bug because I am not the only one who has issues with this and had used attempts that others have suggested.NOTE: *This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall proffesional view if the game for general audience to use as a guide. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.*although this is based on actual gameplay and research done on others who have had same issues. My issue remains unsolved and unresolved.			"

												For any games, once one discovers a dominant strategy that can be repeatedly utilized to win any possible scenario, then there is no point in continue playing it.  The dominant strategy for Banished is this1) build a gathering hut in a large forest, prioritize-build it while the others go gather wood, stone, and iron in ANOTHER forest, put four people in it after it's finished.2) build a forester lodge beside the hut when enough wood and stone are gathered, put four people in it after it's finished, switch laborers to focus on stone and iron3) build enough houses to house the families, construct woodcutters, then either a taylor or a blacksmith, depending on whether you need more clothing or tools.4) build other buildings as resources come in, but always leave a surplus of food of around 100xpopulation, 10xpopulation of firewood; 2xpopulation of clothing and tools is recommended if playing conservatively.5) priortize houses as they are important for growth. They are where babies are made, and 30-something siblings living with their 70-something parents ain't going to make kids.Even on small mountaineous map with harsh climate, on hard difficulty, presumably the hardest starting scenario, one can double the population by year 10 just by doing the above, and get to 50 by year 20 is not out of the question.  The dominant factor for this game is the availability of space for more housing, balance against the food production buildings and wooded areas for firewood.  Variables like education and chapels are merely cosmetics that increase the efficiency of space, but not necessarily needed to grow your town.  As for natural disasters, since your town is likely separated into several parts by bodies of water, and as far as I can tell fire doesn't go through water, and tornados don't wreck more than one part of town, if one has enough of a surplus, one can easily rebuild and those are not game-changing disasters.So survival is simple.  If you like a game that you can play while playing another game on another computer, this is recommended.  This is a solved game; but people continue to play tic-tac-toe even though it's analytically uninteresting, so others may differ in opinion.Edit -- this is an evaluation of the vanilla game; perhaps with mods there will be enough complexity to make it less linear.

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but I just cant.There is but one way to play the first hour or so of every mission, stray from it and you end up losing very fast, mostly by starvation or death by old age.Once you know how the game is played, its pretty much rinse and repeat every mission and straying from that tactics will end the game as mentioned above.That's really not my understanding of a sand box strategy game and all the great graphics in the world dont change that.

By the same price you may purchase a game AAA-class. Its a shame developer is so greed for his dilettante product. The cost should be 5 dollars or less.			"

												Here's how Banished works: You take a few tries to get to a point where your people stop starving to death. Then you start to succeed. Your population expands. You stockpile food. You trade with merchants. You feel like you're getting somewhere.... then the game hits you with a tornado, kills 3/4 of your population, and wipes out your food storage so the rest die within a season.I love it.			"

												When I buy a game, I call  it 'good enough' if I can get $1 per hour of good play. I paid $20 for this game. I have 150+ hours on playing it, as of this review. I'd say it is definitely worth the money. This is quite possibly the most challenging, addicting and frustratingly fun sim game I've ever played, hands down. There are mods for it, if the player is interested, which make it even better and more addicting. My dislike? Dishes don't wash themselves, my laundry doesn't wash itself, dogs don't feed themselves and all of the above mentioned takes away time from gameplay!			"

												I've been following the development of this game since finding out about it in April of last year. I was immediately interested and had some questions so I emailed the developer. Let's clarify that, its one guy. ONE. I emailed and minutes later he replied. This guy isn't just a talented coder (READ HIS BLOG!) but also a great, all around dude. Also, this game is amazing. Actually scheduled the day off of work just to play it on release. Its ""sim city"" enough that my simulation needs are covered, introduces enough ""Sims""-like stats to make you actually care about the populace (something the Sim (tm) games never did well). And then it adds lots of new things. Its also quite pretty. TLDR? If you like simulation-type games, you'll love this. At this point its likely my favorite simulation game and it will definitely be geting many more hours of my time, and multiple copies purchased for family members. Way to go Shining Rock! :D			"

												Now that Banished has mod support and its first major free expansion mod made by the community (Colonial Charter) it is finally worth recommending to fans of builder strategy games like Anno or Simcity, and EASILY worth recommending at that. It went from ""meh"" to ""wow"" purely through the modding community. Before CC and the minimods that improve CC (Sawmill, 1 day is 1 day, CC Fountain mod, etc) Banished was a great idea and a great platform but without much game in it. Plus it had tons of bugs and AI problems. Now it's finally much more refined and the mod community has expanded and fixed the game up and made it worth playing, very similar to what they did with FTL. The future for Banished is now very bright, and I fully expect more and better mods in the coming year(s). It's easily worth a purchase now, especially when on sale, and I can only see it improving in the future. Buy it on GOG, not Steam, and support the DRM-free revolution. I did both, but only because I bought it on Steam before it was available on GOG.edit 6/4/2016: Now that CC:TFA awakens is out Banished is finally the game I always hoped it could be. Say byebye to free time!			"

												Simply awesome game. In this game, you must sustain and grow your population, either by waiting and breeding your original villagers, or by taking a risk of accepting outsiders to fuel your growing village (soon to be town.) You must assign your villagers a variety of jobs and tasks, such as farming, mining, and trading. However, you face the threat of starvation, disasters, and disease.Pros:-Long-Different difficulties-Logical (villagers must haul materials to build site, instead of magically building without visible materials)Cons:Mid-game, you most likely have already built all different kinds of buildings. The goal of the game is to expand and grow, but late-game it may become repetitive with the limited building options.Overall, I give this game a 9/10. I would like to grow to different ages, not just the Stone House age, but modern and possibly Age of the Future.			"

												Banished is one of those games that doesn't have a set plot.You are a group of people banished from their native homelands for reasons unknown to the player, so you can make up your own reasons why your citizens were banished.My surmise?They were too damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The music in this game is fitting, the graphics are fitting, the map generator is a bit weird most of the time and the maps feel very artificial.But the AI?♥♥♥♥ed up, most of the time it makes the game unplayable.Within the game you have to give commands, mostly to the builders and labourers. This is great, however what is not so great is that they seem to do stuff at random. They do whatever they feel like.Had a game where my resource stockpile and storage barns were filled to the max. I had given orders for new stockpiles and storage barns to be constructed.What did the builder do?Gather more resources.The artificial intelligence is the only dealbreaker here and is so much of a dealbreaker that I can not in good faith recommend this game. After 50+ hours I thought I'd have noticed some behavioural pattern I could make sense of and adapt my play style to, but alas no luck.Similarly the game gives you notifications, this is good. ""Your stockpile is almost depleted"", ""Your stockpile is almost full"", it is all useful it is all good.Except my last game it forgot to tell me when my citizens died. One moment I had 50+ citizens, ten minutes later they had ""wandered off"" one by one without any notification WHY they had disappeared.Did they forget how to breath?I do not know.What I do know is that this games has a very VERY rushed feel when it comes to the AI and is not finished in that regard and therefore can not be recommended in good faith.

												 After reading the reviews of previous owners... or  ... victims of this game.  I realized that food and even keeping your people warm was massively important. Later, as I learned about how important schools are...  I decided to be too smart for by pesty britches. Paused at start...  decided to do a layout of a city and ""pause"" the construction.Laid out the city with important buildings just a bit too far from the Storage barn...  result..  12 people froze before enough firewood could get chopped.Next try... Tried something a little similar...  only this time I failed to get the food buildings going fast enough to supply the houses I was making.  Result:  Not enough houses with either food or firewood in them. Compounded by each death made getting resources to buildings which initially had them. Starved and froze to death. Third try: Was doing better... had a gatherer's hut, hunter, fishing hut, second barn, school made...  then got into the rush to make houses before winter.  Somehow they survived it... Then the next winter hit...  one by one I watched my people freeze and a few starved (knew I shouldn't have sent them to that stone pile). Ended up with just a poor man named Joel with his wife Lucille and their four kids. Lucille died during child birth at age 39.... My farmer began to sing You picked a fine time to leave me Luuuucille...   four hungry children and a crop in the field....  Sigh....10/10 Would ""lay out"" my town again.			"

												My wife introduced me to this game, and I have to say it brings a soft spot to my heart. Very easy to pick up and play; and watching your community grow and thrive is rewarding. I can't help but wish that there were more threats besides natural disasters, however. I would happily pay for DLC's that added predators or other enemies. Some prevailing bugs and a lack of content are the only things keeping this one-man game from becoming a masterpiece. Still fun to play, though. Hopefully it will improve over time.			"

												The game was enjoyable the first few times I played it.At first it was a challenge to try and meet all the needs of the town through mining, servives, food and education. Unfortunately although the game throws up random weather events or disasters, the game becomes repetitive and the final outcome is a struggle to maintain a maximum population in the small sandbox map through starvation due to the impossible feat of feeding the citizens in perpetuity. As mentioned, I have enjoyed the game and each time I tried to different things - however the eventual outcome via sandbox is always the same. It would be great to see some expansions to the gameplay like interaction with external towns (not just traders), potential attacks from external parties or barbarians which need defending and the introduction of some forms of special unique structures. The game reminds me of an old classic 'Pharoah' which was quite enjoyable but after say 50 hours of gameplay becomes repetitive.Still highly recommend and quite enjoyable. For those seeking an extreme challenge, the hardest difficulty level is quite full on and only those whom have honed their skills on the game will be succeed (potentially)!ENJOY!			"

												Alright, so first and foremost, the game IS pretty interesting and has a great concept.It's basically a really neat city builder kind of game set in a pretty simple medieval-esque setting, no combat, no deeper overlaying faction mechanics, diplomacy, nada, just survival in the wilderness, and making your little halmet grow.And that's really cool and great and all -- when you have everything perfectly and tediously set up beforehand.See, the problem is, that as your town starts growing, your citizens AI begins to act haywire.Even getting them to their very best, ie issuing them warm coats, giving them proper education, making sure they are healthy and well fed, and clear stone paths to their general work areas, they will still get stuck in these asinine chain of actions that can ultimately kill your town or make simple instructions take up towards a while year.Like take a builder for example.You instruct your builders to build say, a fishing dock, relatively nearby the town, set that junk to be prioritized (which is a function that does virtually nothing).The builder will (not neccesarily in this order, and also sometimes several times until completion):1) Go pick up stones from the entirely opposite end of the village to store in the stockpile2) Go pick up food twice3) Walk to the construction site, store some building materials, and do something entirely different4) Go visit the herbalist 20 times5) Walk to the construction site, and then decide to walk all the way back home because he feels cold6) Walk to the construction site, build 1%, and then go do something else7) Go build 3 tiles of road somewhere else8) Go visit the herbalist, againAnd this sort of thing applies to any profession that has the citizen walking anywhere, so imagine what a sucker I felt like seeing my 15 laborers ignore cutting down the prioritized tree farm for a whole year and making my town freeze to death twice.Like damn man, I used to play Dwarf Fortress of all games, so I really do want to consider myself to be patient with strange AI behavior, but this game just gets absurd with that sometimes, to the point where it can be completely game breaking.A lot of people talk about how the game is hard too.And sure, it can be a bit of a challenge early on while you set everything up, but once you are starting to stabilize things you kinda start to get the impression that a large part of the ""difficulty"" is actually related to how terrible the AI can be at doing their tasks.So look, it's a pretty sweet game overall, so by all means do buy it and try it out.Just be prepared to savescum and get endlessly frustrated by your citizens AI a bunch.

												This is not a completed game. And before you think ""well, he's probably asking too much"" I want to point out that I don't mean in a 90% kind of way, but in a 30% kind of way... The first 30% of the game is there, I can't deny that. There is a genuine satisfaction in overcoming the first obstacles and trying to form your little village. Alloting the work so that there is no shortage of food, wood etc. Building the structures in such layout so that everything works in the best possible way. There is even the added effect of season change. You eventually reach the best part of the game where you can trade with other villages for otherwise inaccessible resources. Aaand that's where the game ends. The choice of buildings is meagre to say the least. 2 types of houses. If that's not the bare minimum then what is? 1 type? You can pretty much build all the available structures after 4-5 hours of playing.  The villagers could well have been simply dots on a map, lacking any kind of realism. They move around at random, deep inside the forest or hovering around buildings. There is no pattern to work around and no sense of recreation or resting. They follow a random program of their own, in the absence of a night/day cycle at times farmers will suddenly drop everything and return to their homes.  The units of resources make no sense. The balance if you manage to find it is extremely precarious, one small change (like a disaster that kills a small percentage of your population) can have irreversible effects leading to a close extinction simply because there are no factors that work to pull the system back together. 2 farmers die -> 100 units of food are missing -> the forester dies of starvation -> 20 logs missing -> the fisherman freezes to death ---> and the population spirals to almost half the original one. This is just another example of the decline of the game industry. More than a decade ago, a game like Evil Genius was released offering hundreds of hours of gameplay with numerous types of units with excellent AI. Minions that didnt wonder around aimlessly but started conversations with each other or seeked various types of recreation. The game had depth, with countless unlockable objects, new rooms, new quests, a change of island. And now we get Banished.. A game stuck eternally in Beta with no hope of improving. Graphics slightly (if at all) better than Evil Genius and that's about it. The developer probably left this game forever, cashed in with fake promises and spent a week in Barbados. I don't understand economics so I don't know what the best move for us the community is. If we buy it then we're accepting the bad quality of gaming. If we don't buy it then the city builder genre amongst many others that are not CoD related may simply die out. In any case this game is bad, unfinished.			"

												If you've been looking for a good looking ""graphical DF"" - Look no further. Banished is a deep and rewarding experience that can feel either zen-like, and at some times, extremely stressful. You will (try to) keep your citizens, well-fed, happy, healthy and live a productive life in general. Banished is actually one of the few ""civilization management"" games that i've actually felt attatched to the characters. They're born, go to school and work their lives away at trying to further their civilization only to end up dying in the end...BUT, their children and their childrens children will carry on and that's something that really strikes me with this game. Seriously though, it's an incredible experience, and it was all crafted at the fingertips of one man. This man deserves every penny he makes. 10/10 - A Must Buy			"

												My village, 20 years in, 4 hours of gameplay, just died out. Why? Because no one had sex. They were happy, they were healthy, there was space, but no child birth in 15 years. I watched the population dwindle, after it dipped below 10 I stopped them working in the mines and in the fields, I let them enjoy a life of relaxation. Did that make a difference? No. They just slowly died out. And when the last of them finally died, the game didn't even end, no ""you lose"", nothing. Everything else about this game was great and maybe, although I have googled what happened, I just did something wrong, but the fact that this happened made it very unenjoyable so I would recommend you avoid it.

												In short:As it is right now, I did enjoy ""Banished"" for a few hours but that's about it. It's very simplistic and unrealistic. The overall concept is great, but nothing new. It has full 3D graphics and you can rotate seamlessly the view 360 degree, though that's really not even necessary and in the end is more a gimmick. Same with tilting up / down and zooming in / out. Overall, Banished is beautiful, yet VERY simplistic in terms of game mechanics, AI and UI. Beautiful graphics (well, they're not mind-blowing) alone don't make a good product, that's what most devs forget. I rather have more simplistic graphics, but much more sophistication and complexity in a game (AKA ""Factorio"" or ""Prison Architect"").Because of that, in the end I just can't recommend to get it (unless it's on sale and you don't care about the things I point out below), I got it on sale for $5 and might hop into it at some point again for some casual entertainment, but for something challenging that I can really get into, I rather load up Factorio or Prison Architect.So, if you're interested, here are (some of) the issues I have with it:1.Not enough stats output (graphs) - for example, how efficient is someone at their work? Or at least, how efficient is a work-space? Is demand met with supply? It's common sense that you've got those graphs, to effectively manage people (whether that's in a business or colonists trying to establish a town or an established city).2. Too much micro-management due to ""flawed"" AI...2.a. For example, you have a storage barn with food in it. You build another one so you can relocate to another area (there's no way you can do that in the first year, you have to settle, even just temporarily, at that location!) and want to move everything from the previous one to the new one. So you give a demolish order to the old one so that everything is moved over to the new one as soon as that one's built (or even if you wait until it's built, doesn't matter). Yet, as soon as you give the demolish order, everything in it, food, tools, ... will become unavailable to those people. Until it's transferred to the new storage barn and put in there.  Which results in the people starving to the point of dying. Makes perfect sense, right?2.b. Those people don't seem like virtual versions of humans, but rather robots that look like and have the needs of humans. If I'd be starving, I'd refuse first of all to go long distances to some remote place, knowing that I'd starve on the way there or back; secondly, I'd eat at least a little bit, to the point that I won't starve; third of all, the devs obviously never heard of jerky / dried fruits and veggies!? Why aren't those people taking some food and water along. I mean, come on, that's common sense. 2.c. In RL nobody goes mining / hunting / exploring w/o even the smallest of a backpack. Or goes to work without taking food along (unless you have a cafeteria at your job), even if it's close-by - instead, in Banished, every time someone gets hungry, they walk all the way to their living quarters to eat. Do you know anyone who doesn't work from home and does that? That's very rare to happen, even in a settlement like that where people don't have a 8-5 job but sometimes have to work from 5 in the morning until 8 at night or whenever the sun goes down, to get as much work done during daylight (I know somewhat from personal experience, and I know people who have done that kind of work and told me about how rough it is and what they had to do).2.d. The ""wildlife"" (well, there's only one kind, which are deer)... where should I start... For once, they're running all over the place, through your settlement(s), eating right next to where you mine / build / ...; not to mention there's only one kind - the aforementioned deer. No rabbits or other smaller animals. There are also no predators (bears, wolves, ...) in Banished.3. I'm also not fond of (because it creates a disconnect from reality) how time has been implemented... basically, your settles have babies, raise their children, they become eventually old enough to work and then at some point they die due to old age (or before then, due to accidents). All good stuff.  Also, it implements seasons and each of the four are further divided by three (early, mid and late). However, your ""banished"" people age rapidly within a year. I haven't paid full attention but I think it takes about three in-game years for people to go through their full life cycle. I understand that you can't obviously play the game in real-time, but all this could've still been implemented much better.4. In connection to what I just mentioned in 3. regarding time, this also becomes very obvious when building structures or harvesting resources (actually that's another point but I'll just say it here - you have 3 resources for building, that's it: wood logs, stone and metal - not even different types of metals; and two types of fuel, which is fire wood from cut up wood logs, and coal)... it can take a whole month to build a wooden house (one part of a season), yet it takes about the same time to create a fully functional mine.5. The UI and font both do not scale with your screen resolution, same goes for the location placement of the windows. Also, they don't ""snap"" to each other's borders. Again, it's usable, but just the way everything is implemented, is just very simplistic.			"

(Before you scoff at my hours played let me tell you that the bulk of my time was spent playing the DRM free version. I was having troubles with my Steam copy crashing)I created a video review which you can watch by click this link ->Banished Video ReviewV--But if you're a fan of letters, then enjoy the written verson--VApparently you've been banished, I guess you refused to drink the Kool-Aid. Now you're in the middle of nowhere with a wagon and some potatoes...survive.That's the montra of Banished, a survival-based city-builder developed by one person. After selecting your level seed and difficulty you are left to your own devices. Either to create a sprawling town of trade and prosperity, or utterly fail attempting to recreate the Donner Party (unfortunately cannibalism is not in the game).As you clear land and begin building homes for your settlers you'll soon realize that you're about to run out of food. So you'll begin focusing on bringing in consumables by fishing and foraging only to see your supply of clothing is about to run out and winter is already here.If nothing else, Banished is a great reminder that electricity is awesome.You'll assign your settlers occupations and tell them what to build, but besides that you don't have direct control over them. A hard lesson I learned when the citizens of Bogustown decided a 13-year-old girl should be in charge of smithing tools for the entire settlement. She proceeded to bug out and sabotage the operation by stealing iron and placing it in random spots around town. The shortage of tools led to a starvation. Eight people died...including her.The small narratives that can be accidentally spun through gameplay are delightful, and I deeply wished for the ability to rename my citizens for added drama, but sadly you can't.Aside from the random bugs, the settlers are pretty intelligent. If they can't complete their current task due to a lack of resources they will assist in other jobs around town without you having to instruct them. The settlers truly feel like living people in a society. They work, stock their homes, and much to your dismay, even take breaks from work.But their autonomy takes some getting used to. I found myself overly managing their tasks on my first settlement, but once I understand that I didn't need to, the tedium was minimized.The games UI is customizable and unobtrusive, which keeps it from detracting from the game's simple beauty. As you play you'll find stats are hard to come by. Production is displayed on a per building basis and the overarching stats like population growth you'd expect in a city builder are unobtainable until an expensive city hall is constructed. Once built you'll have access to helpful growth and resource numbers to help you better plan and manage your settlement.Once your settlement gets to the point of farming, seeds and livestock become invaluable. Depending on the difficulty selected, you will begin with a select few or none at all. The only way to obtain new seeds and livestock is by trading with outsiders. This can only happen if you build a trading post and even then you must wait for a merchant to drop by, and then hope he's selling what you want.An interesting meta game is created as you divert resources away from your settlers and into your trading post in preparation for a merchant, only to then find out you don't have enough to buy what you want. This brilliant mechanic is diminished when you realize goods are always a certain price, allowing you to then prepare enough trade goods to buy your desired item.The game's achievements reward settlements that exist for over 100 years, but after passing the threshold of fighting for survival over to prosperity, the game has little more to offer you besides civilized buildings like the church or town hall. I found myself losing interest in my settlement after about 20 years, which equaled out to around 6-7 hours in real time for me.That's nothing to scoff at, but I would have preferred to remain engrossed in my existing settlement rather than starting fresh in search of a challenge.Besides disease and fire the only threat your settlers face is your own incompetence to fulfill their needs. As you get better at the game this threat begins to dissipate so it would have been nice to see non-environmental forces threatening you.The addition of hostile settlements would help to shake up the game, but the introduction of a combat mechanic would likely break the simple survival sim. I wished for a happy medium with something like hostile wildlife which would threaten your settlers in untouched parts of the map. This would help bridle rapid expansion into the wilderness and keep you on guard.After reaching resource stability and then the point excess, there are few things the game can do to challenge you. It lacks a large end-game goal to work towards beyond simple survival. But that's not so much a shortcoming, rather a sign that I want more. The game's budget price tag makes it a low risk purchase, and modding support is a planned release in the near future. So the thirst for more content may soon be quenched.If you're expecting the complexity of a SimCity then Banished probably won't be your jam. But the game has crafted a dense blend of survival and resource management that makes people like me squeal with delight.			"

												Unfortunately, this is the game that I will forever use as a standard for other city building games. Banished is marvelous, an absolute thrill to play. The in game economy is very complex and diverse and can quickly screw you if you aren't careful. The city building aspect is difficult, time consuming and very believable. In order to survive, you need only provide houses for population growth, diverse food stores for consumption, clothing to keep the cold off, firewood to warm houses and tools to work with. With each new house, 2-4 children are born that need to be fed, clothed and educated (potentially). Each new citizen requires a rethink of food stores, clothing and tool supplies. If you build too many houses at one time, your people will risk starvation or dying from exposure. These things happen before you can even begin to consider a solution. If your people start dying, you will lose much needed workers. If you don't have enough farmers, even more people starve. If you choose to make all your tool makers farm for a season, you will run out of tools, resulting in extremely slow crop production and people will starve. If this wasn't bad enough, you also have to provide your citizens with a variety of food products to maintain ultimate health. People can't live on cabbage alone, they also need grains, protein and fruits to remain healthy. This is by far my favorite city building game. It has unlimited replay-ability and will keep you entertained for hours, even if half of your time is spent screaming at the screen in an attempt to make your farmers work more quickly, or trying to figure out how one of your builders got stuck in an icy tundra in the middle of winter with no clear path home (I mean seriously how does this keep happening??)

												This game is awesome!My initial thought was that it had similarities to ""Black and White"" but without the pet and godly interactions and with more focus and details on the city management.The excellent tutorials gets you started then you'll spend the rest of the week, month or perhaps year to learn how to build a large town.I've read some complaints about bugs and instablities, with 120+ hrs spent to this day, without a single crash I'd say it's very stable and sure there are some bugs, but which game hasnt?I've been interested in this game for a while now, but forgot about it until one day I was given a coupon* for this game.And to be honest, I regret not buying it sooner!There are however some problems.This game is very unforgiving, make a mistake early and you'll regret it much later.This game is very addictive. It is about the same level as Civilization.""One more year""*As I token of forgivness from Steam I like to hope as I bought Rising Storm.			"

												So bannished is a interesting mixture of survival, town/settlement building and Tornadoes.So you start with 4 or 6 familys and you have to use the population you have to build a new life in the wilderness you need to gather materials and build what you need to survive and hopefully thrive, so far so good and as you build up your population increases so you need more houses,woodcutters and food production to feed you people and need enougth fire wood to survive the random winters some are nice and easy and other times its rather punishing to keep people alive.Once you get your first 100 people population is'nt a problem, if you don't manage to have a healthy and happy population they won't have kids and eventualy your people are too old to reproduce so the game is a proper balancing act of population and food production/stockpile to feed everyone.The game has a interesting approach to peoples behaviour as you can have big problems made by your own people such as hoarding and over population which can cause you allot of problems if people start hoarding food and firewood others won't have enougth food or fire wood and they will become unhappy or mostly die in a harsh winter from starvation or hypothermia? The fix you will need is markets as they make sure everyone gets what they need and it stops hoarding from happening so build a market and thats not a probem, or the oppposite problem you build to many houses or you have a mass die off and the younger generation move into the houses and  have kids before you know it you have 30 kids and you need more schools and they eat so much food and they won't help you gather or help produce more food until they adults and have been educated? I recommend schools as they work smarter and get more done with less accidents which is good!With houses keep them spread out and linked by markets and never build like 50 or 60 houses it'll come back to haunt you when you least expect it.Try to build multiple smaller settlements with 5 to 10 houses per place linked by a road with markets for supplies, as markets are awesome the vendors use wheel barrows and are super effient.The game is really good and well made, the only thing i find is a bit much is tornades they are random and can end your game really fast, the other disasters are easy to fix such as disease easy, crops failing easy theres probably more i have'nt had yet so i look forward to dealing when it happens to my peoples.Tornadoes are rediculous and they seem to become common when you have over 100 population and they seem to love wiping out schools and hospitals! or they plough throw you storage barns and markets and wipe out your food supplies, Here is the most common tornadoe effect for me in my games  they moves in a complete be line to built up housing area's and kills everyone except 2 people and a kid or 3 people and no kids survive, and if you have bad luck you will be stuck with 2 blokes or 2 women survivors and they won't reproduce = game over!I recomend this game its complicated in a deceptive way of looking easy to learn, and its lead to some some crazy stories for my people expecially when a tornadoe's killed everyone except a old man and young girl and they both died of old lol or when i had a orgy house of 4 people living there and they had 6 kids when i had 2 empty houses they could of lived in lol yet they preferred to live togther.Just turn off disasters and enjoy the game, when you have it mastered turn on disasters and prepare for a tornadoe wrecking you population or town.If you have any tornadoe survivor stories/strategies let me know.

												REVIEW BASED ON Ver. 1.0.4Banished is SURPRISINGLY good that I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I am usually the type that doesn't like city-building in general, but so far the hours of playing Banished has been certainly entertaining (WITH TONS OF FRUSTRATION AND REGRETS behind the scene). Got this game during sale and it is definitely, oh DEFINITELY better than average city-building games out there in steam.Some notable features include: Extremely hard and Challenging at start - you can help yourself by reading new players-friendly guides to avoid misery but couple bad end due to starvation, natural disasters, or simply awful management Tons of micro-management necessary to keep the town/city growing continuously!  Really not bad AI for villagers, at least they don't starve to death out of nowhere and can follow orders... just .. give them time and be patient Need for strategically plan your buildings ahead Different ways you can choose to specialize your town - can be designed to be production based with emphasis on trading, or be agricultural powerhouse with vast fields of crops, orchards etc Crazy random disaster features. One good tornado across your town, hitting and destroying most of your storages? Might as well start new...  Extremely punishing. Forgot to build school early on? Don't expect efficiency for next couple years. Forgot to build enough wells? RIP once fire is set on one of your core buildings. Forgot to check the firewood or food supply? See your population reduced to half when early winter comesHowever, there are some parts that left me feel something is lacking as well. Limited way to start in the beginning - after couple of trial and errors, the only (so far) effective method to start is via gathers to maintain food production Lack of more sophisticated ""order"" system. There is priority function in the game, but it is totally not enough to make micro-management smoother. This really hurts once your population reachs certain level and town grows into considerable size Not being able to control specific resources in detail. Same reasoning as above, later into game, it makes micro-management even harder - which is like half the point of this game. Lack of late game content. Once you know what you are doing and city has expanded to like most of the available plains on map, there is absence of motivation and contents to challenge the players. The only concern might be maintaing healthy population.Nonetheless, it is great game to devote hours of gameplay into and overcome learning curve if you really enjoy City building, Micro-management, or macro survival simulation. Just want to see more late game contents :)Would give 9/10!			"

												After 10 months of playing, I figured I should review the game. I know enough at this point to make an informed opinion, right?The first thing you should know is that there is no story, nor is there an ""end game"". I see so many people complaining about that in their reviews. This game follows the lives of your little group of settlers and all of their offspring. They are born, they get married, they breed, they die. Some of them go to school, some of them don't, some farm, some hunt-- ALL of them will, at some point, do something to infuriate you. But how can there be an ""end game"" in a city builder? It goes completely against the point of building, if you have to stop.This game is flawed, yes. There are bugs. People tend to freeze up when their houses catch fire, which is unfortunate. Playing on easy is usually more difficult than playing on hard. Traders only travel by water (slowly), but nomads only travel by land, and in groups that get larger and larger until you have to start turning them away. My favorite, though, is when people starve even though you have an enormous surplus of food. I've encountered this one a lot. All Messica has to do is go to the storage barn to get food, but noooooooooooo, she goes walking in the forest instead.Then dead.There are a lot of positives as well. Your AI is unpredictable, so even if you do the same thing over and over again, they won't. They graphics and sounds are beautiful. And it's true to life. Your mines and quarries will eventually dry out, deforestation causes not only a lack of trees, but a lack of food in that area, too. The maps themselves make you want to see just how big you can push your village, but there's such a delicate balance between growth and resources. It's incredibly hard to find it. I'm still learning how to do things better, even after the amount of time I've put in.Tl;dr- Sure, the game still has bugs, but it was made and is being maintained by one guy. AI is wonky, game can get repetitive, but, as far as city-builders go, Banished is one of the best ever made.			"

												A beautiful and well made town builder and management game.Banished can take a little practice to get the hang of with to start with but when you get going you can build up a really large town able to sustain itself.There's a good amount of resources to to collect and a wide variety food grow, gather and hunt.There's no progression in the sense that you unlock new buildings or features, everything is available for you from the start so you can build up how you wish.Your village can spiral out of control into disaster if you're not careful, especially near the beginning or if you're hit by a natural disaster. Such as lack of tools which bring all of your production down and makes even more chaos.One thing to watch out for is the colonists can get a little greedy and take all available food when there's only a small amount in stock, leaving none for others and letting them starve.The base game does lack buildings and you can soon feel as though you've built everything in a short time, there's plenty of mods to download but I would have liked to have seen more in the game.Biggest problem with the game is the frame-rate when reaching 1,000+ population, for me it became unplayable so you will need to keep that in mind when building a village across the whole map.Overall it's a great game and plenty of time can be spent, there's some nice achievements you can work towards if you like extra challenges/goals..Definitely worth a buy if you like builders and/or management games.

												May eat away at your life several hours at a time.    I like this game, but it takes a lot of micromanagement.   Specifically, food generation is both critical and labor intensive.  So producing enough food for your villege to make it through the year seems to take a good deal of your potential laborers for all of the spring, and summer.   When you have finally collected all the food, to repurpose a laborer, you must first quit them from the farm before you can assign them another role.  Still a fun way to slowly realize it is 2am and you have work in the morning.			"

												REVIEW BASED ON Ver. 1.0.4Banished is SURPRISINGLY good that I simply cannot recommend this game enough. I am usually the type that doesn't like city-building in general, but so far the hours of playing Banished has been certainly entertaining (WITH TONS OF FRUSTRATION AND REGRETS behind the scene). Got this game during sale and it is definitely, oh DEFINITELY better than average city-building games out there in steam.Some notable features include: Extremely hard and Challenging at start - you can help yourself by reading new players-friendly guides to avoid misery but couple bad end due to starvation, natural disasters, or simply awful management Tons of micro-management necessary to keep the town/city growing continuously!  Really not bad AI for villagers, at least they don't starve to death out of nowhere and can follow orders... just .. give them time and be patient Need for strategically plan your buildings ahead Different ways you can choose to specialize your town - can be designed to be production based with emphasis on trading, or be agricultural powerhouse with vast fields of crops, orchards etc Crazy random disaster features. One good tornado across your town, hitting and destroying most of your storages? Might as well start new...  Extremely punishing. Forgot to build school early on? Don't expect efficiency for next couple years. Forgot to build enough wells? RIP once fire is set on one of your core buildings. Forgot to check the firewood or food supply? See your population reduced to half when early winter comesHowever, there are some parts that left me feel something is lacking as well. Limited way to start in the beginning - after couple of trial and errors, the only (so far) effective method to start is via gathers to maintain food production Lack of more sophisticated ""order"" system. There is priority function in the game, but it is totally not enough to make micro-management smoother. This really hurts once your population reachs certain level and town grows into considerable size Not being able to control specific resources in detail. Same reasoning as above, later into game, it makes micro-management even harder - which is like half the point of this game. Lack of late game content. Once you know what you are doing and city has expanded to like most of the available plains on map, there is absence of motivation and contents to challenge the players. The only concern might be maintaing healthy population.Nonetheless, it is great game to devote hours of gameplay into and overcome learning curve if you really enjoy City building, Micro-management, or macro survival simulation. Just want to see more late game contents :)Would give 9/10!			"

												Back To Basics With BanishedBut don’t be fooled, it’s far from easy! If you like micro-management then this game is right up your street. You start with a small band of citizens in the middle of a randomly generated map, depending on the selected difficulty level you have a starting stock of resources and the aim of the game is to survive and prosper.The winters are harsh so you have to quickly build shelter, get the food rolling in, secure raw materials and find somewhere to store the surplus before the weather turns nasty. You decide what to build, but remember, you only number a few so choose wisely as limited hands means not all of the roles can be fulfilled.In order for your people to be happy, healthy and fertile you need to consider providing a varied diet, herbs and medicine, education, their spiritual needs, clothing, leisure. These requirements entail farming, mining, hunting and gathering, forest management, schools, taverns, blacksmiths, woodcutting and more.The basics of the game are covered in a number of tutorials that take about forty minutes to complete, the game interface is simplistic and all of the main functions are accessed from a single icon bar that has two levels. Everything is based around common sense decisions and as long as you apply a little thought and planning you will be up and running in no time.Although only written by one man (Luke Hodorowicz) there is a surprising attention to detail. The seasons change with deciduous trees losing their foliage in the winter months only to go through various shades of green into full leaf in the summer months as an example. House styles differ so that there is little visible repetition of game objects making it always pleasing to the eye. It even supports DX11 (though my monitor insists on switching to 50Hz which skews the display).I have played the “game proper” for a little over four very enjoyable hours, though I will admit to disabling natural disasters for the first play through, and can thoroughly recommend it. If you liked Sim-City I think you will like Banished.			"

			If you like it, like it! Leave a comment! Tell your friends! Tell Twitter! Tell strangers! Tell everybody! But be wary of the strangers. Especially if they're offering you sweets.		

If you are looking for a game which you will get up early to start playing and still be playing it at 1am, this is the one.A kind of mediaeval SimCity with resources management instead of finances, you are responsible for taking a small group of people and making them into a much larger group of people, preferably without killing any of them with fire, famine, freezing or flu.Sometimes this is easy. Sometimes it's a nightmare. Whichever it is, you caused it. For some reason the graphics and music are very satisfying and this is probably the only time I've felt genuinely psychologically addicted to a game, to the point of having to rip myself away from it at all hours of the night.The addition of Steam Workshop means that the relatively basic original game suddenly has a zillion options. If you buy it, good luck getting your life back.			"

												Wow! I have to say that I'm so pleasantly surprised at how well-thought out this game is. Aside from the details about the game, the developer clearly put a lot of love into this idea enough to create an engine for it. He took into consideration others' imagination to make sure modding is easy (for modders, a circle of people to which I do not belong). I have only been digging into this game 15 hrs more or less at the time of writing this and by no means am I proficient. I've killed off all my populations thus far, but I've played enough to motivate me to share my thoughts.As someone who is drawn to the outdoors, I've always been disappointed with the way the living world is depicted in games. Granted, you are still harvesting resources in this building game, but there room for success through many different means. Yes, you could build a large bustling town that depends on farming, animal husbandry, and orcharding and all fueled by industries of coal and iron mining. But you could also supply your population with staples of venison, forest tubers, mushrooms, and other wild edibles by maintaining deep forested areas. This flexibility is a first in my experience, and one I have been long awaiting.Controls are rather straightforward and the tutorial is succinct.Cycles of seasons alter priorities for a town, as do losses of skilled members of the community, and Banished places the gamer in an enjoyable predicament of balancing interests. Population booms may well lead to busts in several decades time, and slow-and-steady seems the safest strategy for the beginners.The graphical quality is appealing without being a load on older systems when zooming in and out of the map. Thanks to developers for keeping some great games accessible!The music is innocuous (a step up for the genre in my opinion) though not noticed for its greatness. This is expected for a nearly one-person project as sound isn't integral to the No tech trees to unlock, which affords all the more opportunities for alternative roads of development.Some games I happily buy full price, this is one of those few. If you are interested in town-city builders or like me and looking for a break from fast-paced games, this is the best I've come across by far. "

												This might not be a thorough review, but after 16 hours of playing this game, I do feel I have enough to share about Banished. If I wanted to describe ""Banished"" using a single phrase, I guess that phrase would be ""Colony Management"". All you do in this game, is manage your colony. You are responsible for the lives and the well-being of your colonists, sometimes very literally. For example, if during the summer you neglect an important aspect, such as producing food, your colonists will probably starve and not survive the cold winter. Or, for another example, you don't make sure your colonists have enough wood and the ability to use it to warm their houses during the winter, they'll just die of hypothermia. So far, the game's formula seems simple, yet deep and complex enough to make it interesting and carry the weight of an entertaining game. Visually, Banished looks really well. There's nothing too fancy about the game's graphics, as it seems the developers were smart enough to focus their efforts and resources on other aspects of the game, but they obviously did enough to make everything really polished and smooth. I really liked the weather effects, they really sell the seasonal theme of the game. I raised the game's settings to the maximum and it runs very smoothly. Up until now I haven't encountered any bugs or problems. No crashes, no slowdowns, nothing - pure gameplay experience! While I do have a decent computer (Quad-Core i7, 12GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), it seems like this game could handle itself well enough with much cheaper hardware.The only aspect I'm a litthe disappointed of, is the audio. There are important sounds effects, but the music is so insignificant, that after 15 minutes I decided to turn the game music off, so I could listen to popular music while playing.If you like colony management games, you should definitely try Banished. While it might not be an incredible AAA game or a pure city-builder, it's easily better than the broken and buggy Simcity and Cities XL.I promise to update this review if I learn anything more worthy of sharing.

												Oh my. So I just got this game. Played less than two hours so far, and most of that was going through the tutorials. I thought the tutorials were excellent. They don't cover every detail, but rather give a functional overview of the basics, and most people can sort out the rest from there, I'd think. So then I start. Building my first town, going along nicely, staying on top of food needs and such, and... and...Someone died.He froze to death. A man FROZE to death because he didn't have enough firewood! I felt awful. It... it actually hurt. So soon? So sad.WAIT! WHAT??? I have a woodcutter that should be handling that sort of thing. What the heck is my woodcutter doing over there???I click on the woodcutter. He's not working, he's idling. He's messing around while people are freezing to death! I started yelling at the computer. You lazy jerk! Get back to work! Are you insane????Yeah, I probably didn't build the woodcutter as early as I should have, but that's not the point. The point is that any game that can get me that involved, that invested, is doing something very right.			"

												Well, this game defininetly isn't for everyone and it takes a bit of time to get down how to be successful in the game. For me personally this game was worth it, but someone that doesn't like something that gets repetitive, and doesn't really want to strive to get to like say 900 citizens, or building more efficient cities this probably isn't the game for you then. Basically you'll have made every building available in the first few hours. But the real awesome part of this game is building the city you made more efficent, getting through natural disasters, preparing yourself for winter's worst, and just keeping everyone in your city happy and health is where the real fun is in this game. This game honestly can be played while watching a movie and kinda just monitoring your citizens every once and a while on x1 speed, or if you want to power through and built up your city and not have to wait as much for things to be built go ahead with the x10 speed.Hope this helps any of you that are skeptical about buying the game, and that it will sway you towards or away from buying it because we all want a fun enjoyable game to play through and this may be it for you.

												Do I recommend this game? YESDo I recommend this game at the actual price? NOThe first 3-4 gameplays are fine, building houses, cutting down trees, growing cattles and seeing your inbred citizens freeze to death. Watching your small village made of 2-3 dirty huts become a city with 100+ citizens is nice and pretty rewarding also.. the problem is that this game doesn't give you many things to do. No story (I know, it's a city building game, but at least you could have give me some minor quest to do), very few available buildings (there are like 20, it get reaaally monotonous after a while) every gameplay I did was a copypaste of the precedent.Don't get me wrong, Banished is a fun game. The graphic is neat, the music also (although a bit monotonous) and I really liked some minor details like the cycle of the seasons, or seeing the deers wandering through the map for example. But for 20€, I really expected something more.. this game feels like a very well done BETA version of a game, not like a complete game. I bought this game during a summer sale for 9,99€, and I think this is a more reasonable price for what Banished gave to me as a videogame			"

												I don't think I can recommend this game, as the mechanics that work behind the scenes aren't refined. I wish there was a priorities system, but unfortunately the main priority is always hauling things--even if the settlers aren't laborers. Builders tend to build when they want to and some houses will hoard 50 fish while the other house next to them is starving to death. What sh*tty neighbors. :DI really like the concept of the game, but I can't seem to last more than a few years before things get stagnant. Also children are freeloading jerks--they don't even haul anything. They just f**k off and walk around. But at least they become adults at age 10.			"

												Banished is a city-builder game which is mostly about survival. While it may seem that there is not that much content (types of buildings etc.) you won't notice since the game plays relatively slowly and it takes a time to build a solid town. You will find yourself struggling mainly in the early years as the firs few winters tend to be the hardest, yet you musn't let your guard down even in later years as the careful planning is crucial and key to be succesful in this game. Me for example I was able to build a city of some 600 people and I was doing great, but since I had bad infrastracture and didn't place the buildings in efficient manner, the whole system collapsed on itself... population dropped by roughly 400 individuals due to starvation and my town became a ghost towm... The game is challenging and quite addictive despite being relatively simplistic, I'd say there is a steep learning curve, as beginners will probably struggle for first two or three games but once you pick up basics (and there isn't really much to pick up) it is relatively easy. Despite the game being fun you will find it a little bare and with low content once you master it, but until you do, it should be fun. Definetely grab it if it's on sale!    7/10			"

												Really cool game, really challenging. When I first played I thought it was a bit simple and boring and I stopped playing for a long time. Then I felt like this sort of game again and I looked at some of the mods asnd the Colonial Charter mod makes it a lot better, with all the additional seeds and buildings and professions. But I stopped playing the CC mod because I wanted to get some achievements and the mods doesn't allow you to unlock any.I deleted the mod and played original Banished again, and now that I knew a bit more about the game I thought it would be easier. Little did I know, it was still tough, I did the mountain men challeng and it was going well until my people stopped having babies and my population dropped fast. (The goal is to maintain a population of 50 on a small mountainous terrian in harsh climate for 20 years.) Sounds easy? If you play on hard starting conditoins, you dont start with any crops or orchads or livestock. ANd the map is small so there not a lot of stone and iron lying around. Anyway. I was fun until a certain point. Once I had enough food stored and but homes and had a population of around 120, it was pretty boring. I just had to wait for the last 10 years. I had built all the buildings and just had to sit and watch the years tick by. (Did it in 86 years)Its a great game. I like the weather effects, the diseases that pop up, the graphics are good and smooth. It just lacks a bit of life. Some house variations, more buildings, maybe the colours could be a bit brighter, like make the pigs easier to see and the people. Whatever 9/10 its a great game.			"

												This is the first Steam review I've written where I feel conflicted about giving a thumbs down. Let me explain why I don't recommend this game.My first 50 hours in this game were okay--it was somewhat challenging and I sorta enjoyed it but, the game lacks depth. Once you figure out how to minimize disaster (diseased crops/livestock, sick citizens, etc.) there isn't much left to do. I moved on to using mods for the remaining hours I played. I tried all of the mods and many had neat additions but, they all failed to add real depth to the game-play. Additional types of crops and livestock don't add depth all they do is make it easier for me to keep the citizens happy.On top of the game lacking depth (its #1 problem) it also has some very glitchy mechanics. I've had a newborn child end up living alone in a house (and somehow survived). Greedy citizens will steal all the resources they can and horde those resources (food/fuel) in their homes at the expense of neighbors who will starve and/or freeze to death. Resources can randomly teleport across the map which, can cause your workers to starve or freeze to death during the long journey to pick up that gliched out resource (in my case a piece of meat) from across the map.The final nail in the coffin for this game is the horrible FPS drops it suffers when you build up a large population. People who are really into this game play it on pause because once you have a large population, if you try to play at 5x or 10x, you'll get 1-5 FPS/sec even with the best possible hardware.In the end there was nothing that made me want to come back and play this game. I love City Builders but, this game pales in comparison to games like Anno 2070 and Cities: Skylines. I like the general idea of this game but, aside from building up an ever-larger population (which isn't even much of an option because of the game's♥♥♥♥♥♥optimization), there's really nothing to do after about the first 20 hours of game-play. This game doesn't have war/fighting, the trading is limited/lackluster and the random glitches/FPS drops can be infuriating. If you're looking for a City Builder with real depth check out Anno 2070 or Cities: Skylines.Edit: 06/12/2016Still at 55% helpful on this review despite all the fanboys coming here to make arguments like ""You played 50+ hours be happy with your purchase."" Or the other which is, ""I've never had a 1000+ population town but, I know that the low fps you have isn't from the game."" Both are worthless fanboy arguments. The devs who made this game are LAZY. they released a partial game and left it for the community to finish. The game is such UNOPTIMIZED TRASH that your FPS will drop like a rock (1-5fps on max game speed) when you have a large population. This game is junk. I tried to like it but, its ABSOLUTE JUNK! Don't let the comments from these fanboys trick you into wasting $20. If you want to buy this game wait for a 90% off sale (even then its still overpriced).			"

Posted: January 29, 2015
												Okay everyone, I'm just doing a quick review of Banished to give you a general idea of whether or not you might like this game. I'm not going into deep strategies here, but I'll try to give some pro tips. Thanks for reading.Banished is about a group of people who have been banished from their homeland and must re-establish themselves in their new land while trying to survive exposure and deprivation. It's essentially a city-builder where your enemies are time, weather, starvation, sickness, and poor planning. You start the game by setting a few basic conditions that will determine much of your fate before you even begin. In my experience, even on the easiest settings, I rarely have a group last more than 20 years. I haven't studied any strategy guides or gone into the forums much, so I'm sharing just what I've learned through the school of hard knocks. Banished can be an unforgiving game. If you frustrate easily, you may want to give it a pass. Let me add, however, that when your strategy works, there is a sense of an actual accomplishment that many far less challenging games fail to deliver.  And you're going to need some type of strategy and some luck to survive more than 7 years in many instances.After you've made your starting choices, you hit the ground running. You can let the clock tick along fairly slowly, but where's the fun in that? Pause the game, have a quick look around, open your most critical reports and let them hang on the edge of your vision, assign initial tasks to villagers, and pump the clock up to 10x speed (if you get bored easily like me--otherwise, just let it go). You may feel an inclination to go big, but I judge that would be a mistake. Don't clear huge areas of land or build the largest farms you can in the hopes that you will survive the first winter--you probably will regardless of what you do.. but that second winter might be your end-game even so. There will be time for going big later after you've learned the basics.Go moderate, but go quickly. Consider these as your first tasks (not necessarily in this order, but order can matter a great deal while you're learning... and even after that). Assign a few builders from among the general laborers. Clear some land. Plant some modest farms and an orchard or two. Build a place for the firewood provider to do his job.  Bump up your resource limits for food and fuel. Keep the list of future tasks assigned fairly short so you can change strategies easily when you're first starting out. You'll need more storage space. You'll need more tools. You'll need more iron, stone, wood. You'll need more fuel and food. You'll need medicines, too. The list of tasks keeps rapidly expanding, but choose wisely and try for some moderation. Don't be afraid to switch people around to whatever job is most needed at the moment. Keep in mind, too, that if things get moving along in a good way, you may be faced with a population explosion that might rapidly deplete one or more essentials. If you run out of fuel or food and someone dies of old age or starvation, you may have consigned your settlement to a slow withering death, or a quick one depending upon your skill and luck. Never give up. You may find yourself down to three people, but if they are hunting, fishing, or engaged in some other food production activity, and if they have enough fuel and other necessary items, you can bring them back from the brink. Just be careful. An abundance of good things combined with a population explosion may leave you without the resources to keep from going over the other direction--then you run out of food, your older workers die from some cause and your children are left to starve or freeze to death. Did I mention the game can be unforgiving? Or perhaps the younger ones already died, and there's nobody but the old and infirm to keep things going just a little longer. Okay, this is getting a little repetitive, but the game can be just that at times.Banished currently has an active modding community, though the mods seem pretty much limited to tweaks: a new type of building, an improved harvest rate, better schools. Consider adding some. Using the right mods, you can change some important aspects of the game that can give you enough of an advantage that you find yourself lasting longer. However, in my experience, having a few mods does not necessarily guarantee a stroll through the park on Sunday afternoon. A few dumb mistakes could leave you without the things or people you will have to have to survive your first 5 years. Who knows? You may even decide to mod it yourself and make it just the way you'd like to play it. Or not. The choice is yours. If you need a big pay-off, I don't think there is one. Nothing in the game gives me any sense that there is anything more to hope for than to survive and grow as a community for one more year. Also, watch out for the time dilation effects. hahaha... No, but you must seriously pay attention to the passage of time in the game because it looks like the seasons pass and only a year has gone by, but your people seem to age far more rapidly than they should. And death is always waiting for your people. Watching and waiting. It's all a delicate balance that you must maintain. Fortunately, there are tweaks for these things as well if you desire to change them.I think that's enough to give you the general sense of how it plays and what it is. I hope that helps. Thanks again for reading. The game isn't for everyone, but it is worth playing. If you played it before, consider trying it again because, even without mods, it seems a bit easier than it did when I first purchased it--I think the developer may have taken some of the community feedback to heart, in other words.Peace.

												Very good and difficult build-up game in a non-technolegy style, which felt/feels very fresh. I like this game, even though there are some moments, which are so frustrating, I am sure, because of me, 'cause I suck, but why do my farmers die, while they are harvesting? An unsolved mysterium to this day. However, if you are a skilled player in this genre, you will have a lot of fun. I would not recommend this for beginner. Medicore players (like myself) still enjoy it's style and can have a nice session, which will last long enough, before it gets boring.			"

												Banished is a very interactive and challenging game. Not challenging like in other games where you have to hide or get shot by AI or other people, but challenging in the fact that you have to have a careful balance between buildings and people in order for them to live but not so much that they run out of lets say: logs so they cant get any firewood (for which you need a forester.) In many of My playthroughs my people die of some wierd and wonderful diseases like ""influenza"" or ""the mumps"" because i hadnt built a hospital or a herbalist soon enough and my health bar (for the whole village) has declined. Banished is a very detailed game with so much to offer and so much potential i just cant believe it has been made by a single developer! (who i cannot find the name of....) So im definatly recommending it to all my friends (and family...) because it is such a amazing game!8.5/10 TheCatWithTheHat			"

												Banished is a good concept, and I got some enjoyment out of it, but it's a one-trick-poney, and the trick doesn't go that far. It's a city builder with very little in the way of progression. Only a couple buildings can be upgraded (from wood to stone). The AI is occasionally frustrating. The game is rock hard at the beginning, but if you can survive long enough to get your population under control.... that's it. You expand at a snail's pace, till you're out of room. There's no tech tree, no missions, no customization (beyond where you decide to place the limited number of building types in the game), no unit variety, and no depth. Walk the tightrope between gathering food and building houses.... and you've beaten the game. There's nothing to reach toward beyond survival, and survival is only difficult at the beginning.It's a city-builder, where the city-building isn't the fun part. I reccomend you wait, and see if there's a content patch or something. There just isn't enough here, to justify a game that's twice the price of Terraria.			"

												It's a great city builder but I feel like it could have more content such as more resource types and industries, other than basic needs. My village remained small and eventually shrank to a tiny size because I didn't build enough houses and had bouts of famine taking a toll on the young. The population that survived was mainly too old to have children so I had a severe labour shortage. After about ten years my population started to recover as I built many extra houses. Now I have a small village of 40 people that primarily produces food via foraging, fishing, a little farming and pastures.The interface would be confusing for newcomers to videogames, it's primarily button symbols with no writing but is controlled using the function keys to access sub menus. The sub menu of food production for example, would then be controlled by using the number keys 1-6 to access the different buildings. This is comfortable, quick to use and looks minimalist which fits with the 'bare survival' theme of the game.Visually the game is very enjoyable and the animations are of a quality I'd expect. I do have some criticisms, the pilot of the trade boat's model looks blocky and low quality at odds with the rest of the game. Also I feel like the tree chopping and falling animations could have been improving with an element of physics or ragdolling. Sometimes the trade boat passes through the fishing dock's model, this is very irritating.The tutorial explains the basic use and controls well enough without spoiling the challenge of the game. It's a great, polished game but I hope that Shining Rock Software take the time to add more content around the 40-year mark. Such as new buildings for new industries and such. It may be possible however that I simply didn't grow my town to a large enough population to unlock stuff that may already be in the game. The occurence of disasters is very low, I had one house fire in a 35 year period, though all my houses were made of stone and one walnut orchard disease. I would also suggest that traders visit more often, or there are other methods to acquire livestock as I had extreme difficulty buying any animals for my pasture which sat empty for nearly 25 years. I did however especially like how the farming seasons work. I would like to see more crops that can be grown at different times of the year such as winter grains.I can definitely recommend this excellent game to anyone who loves the idea of shaping a large town over long periods or failing horribly in the process. It may seem expensive for an indie game but the quality and effort put into creating this, compared to some other games, make it worth the price in my opinion.			"

												A beautiful gem of a game. On the surface its another town builder, but from the moment you start playing you realise just how different it is. That idyllic little patch of land you've got may look bountiful, but unless you get your act together those four lonesome families are going to be starving and freezing come winter. Even when you get on your feet there is the ever present worry in your head - ""Will the harvest be good?"" In this game there are only two enemies: nature and your own incompetence. Get it right and its immensly satisfying. Get it wrong and its stomach turning. The only drive you have is making your villager's lives better, improving their homes, their variety of food, their working standards; this means expanding, and with expansion comes the potential for upsetting the delicate balance you've spent hours tinkering to achieve. If this game had came out of a big developer well versed in this genre (Paradox, Maxis, etc) I would be impressed at their return to basics, discarding all multiplayer, all add-ons, all DLC, all glitz and glamour. This game is polished and complete at launch - how common is that these days? But this has not come from a giant dev, it's come from one man. ONE. This one developer shows what you can do with commitment and ideas. It shows in his game, where perserverence and determination will reward you and hasty decisions will punish.Play this game. It will remind you what good, honest video games can and should be.			"

So I built a brewery with the last remaining resources we had.

												This game is incredibily frustrating. I telll my colony to build food sources, and harvest resources. They decide, they should get firewood from the resverves and pick up food from the storage shed. I tell them to build a forester lodge and a well, We run out of resources and they decide, they are cold and hungry and need to go home, instead of gathering wood and stone. Then 16hrs later a building catches fire or a tornado blows through and everything Ive tried so hard to do, is lost!Its a good game, its not Simcity or Tropico, where you build it and it happens. As Ive said the sims have lives which keeps me bonded with my/their struggle and keeps pulling me back to this somewhat bare bones and incredibly frustrating simulator. I havent tried any of the mods from Workshop, but Im getting there. 8.2/10 Would grind my teeth again			"

												I was somewhat underwhelmed by my first hour or so, having finally picked it up months after a strong release to good reviews. I had expected a bit more challenge with a different degree of pacing in order to setup your economy. Instead, it seems to be more of an exercise in tedium and micromanagement of resources and workers. There is a lack of endgame tech/production content or complexity. Ultimately, the game becomes incredibly simplistic once you solve the equation of survivability. Meanwhile, simply scaling up your town and population just doesn't seem to have the right feeling of satisfaction compared to other simulator/builder games.			"

												This game is really fun... the first time you play it.I really want to recommend this game, but I cant. It has very little replay value, and you get bored quite quickly once your town starts surviving on its own. The first couple of hours are fun and challenging. Your citizens keep dying of numerous things like hunger and cold, but once you have a steady supply of wood, medicine and food you get bored. It doesnt take very long to build every single building and it just isnt fun to see how high you can push your population.This game also has a few issues that require mods to fix as well. The worst offenders are probably the balancing and AI.If you can buy this game on a good sale, expect about 10 hours of fun. Maybe a few mods can extend its lifetime.			"

												Banished is a sort of city-building game that focuses on a few families creating a town together, facing not zombies, monsters, or even aliens, but common problems associated with building a new town without any outside force helping (other than traders which only come randomly after you create a trading post and charge very high prices for chickens). This game is not for the faint of heart; if you screw something which may seem minor up, many of your citizens could starve, freeze, or become sick; even when things are going well, something happens which completely blows you off course, such as tornados, crop pests, or just one's own ignorance.I like this game because it is unforgiving, which may sound strange, but it is because I like knowing I messed something up and there is a large penalty for it: Death of citizens, which in turn, results in more death.

With more content and development this could become a great game, but sadly that will likely never happen.			"

												Banished is basically a city builder that requires you to start from scratch. Before recommending it to anyone, you have to ask yourself what type of city builder are you searching for? Below I will mention what Banished provides from a unmodded perspective.A. Challenge - In the beginning of gameplay you will be challenged on how to keep your population alive at times. Once you learned the ropes and strategies, the challenge to keep your population alive is not that difficult. But then again I've played this game quite a bit.B. Buildings - Banished in the unmodded format provides limited buildings. If you build a stone house, then that is all it will be, a stone house. Buildings don't evolve like in a civilization style game which means the buildings stratisfy evolving into more efficiency or the graphics change with the next generation. Banished buildings stay the same unless you use mods.C. Sandbox - Banished can provide hundreds of maps you want to start from. The map seeds are practically limitless. This allows you to construct a new village/town facing various dynamics of land types, weather, and bodies of water.D. Micromanagement - One aspect to this game is you micromanage jobs, resources, crops etc etc. If you don't like micromanaging how many people are working as a farmer vs miner, then I suggest you pass this game up. A large part of this game is micromanagement.E. Modding - The game was designed to be modded. There are numerous mods out there that allow new buildings, crops, jobs, etc. etc. The only downside to modding is many mods disable the achievements. There are some downsides to this game but it depends on your tolerance level.A. AI - The computer AI sometimes get very annoying after a bit. The computer AI is the citizens. Citizens go idle once in a while, which results in them being non-productive. An example is you are building a house, the builder almost finishes the project but then he/she goes idle and stops working. The only way to get them out of the idle phase was reload the game.B. Timesink - Expanding your village and creating a higher population takes lots of time. If you don't mind playing this game passionately for an extended period of time then no issue. On the other hand if you have limited time to dedicate to building a village up into a town, then I would think twice.Overall, the game is fun for a while but over time, once you played it over and over, it gets kind of boring. When it is on sale I recommend buying it cheap. At full price I would say it is not worth. If you have lots of time, enjoy micromanaging a village, and understand the aspects of keeping a population alive that was banished to a land, then by all means I would recommend.			"

But if all goes well, and you manage to juggle, plan and manage properly, your people will thrive, and it's one hell of a feeling of achievement.

												I decided to delete my old review and post a new one because I've had some time to reconsider what I have to say about this game.First off, it is still a fantastic game. There's a lot of challenge, there's a lot of ways that you can go about building your settlements, and there's always a unique game to be had since every map and every starting location on said maps is always different. In other words, it's as unique and interesting as a game like this can be in terms of gameplay (and it is pretty damn unique and interesting).The mechanics are great. They also force you to consider everything (public health and happiness, firewood, food, etc etc) from day one and keep track of all of it all the time. This is a big part of what makes this game challenging and fun - it forces you to build a city, not just constructing buildings.The trade is also surprisingly important. Yes, you can get by without it, but it does help a lot as well as opening up things that would otherwise be closed to you (livestock, increased variety of food, etc).I could go on, but without you (the reader) playing this game, it would be terribly dull.Overall, it's a very solid game and I would highly recommend it. As others have mentioned, there is a lack of content such as Single Player Missions (e.g. working towards a specific goal, or doing something like what Ceaser III of Pharoah did), but this will not stop you from enjoying dozens of hours of solid, fun gameplay.

Below I will mention what Banished provides from a unmodded perspective.A. Challenge - In the beginning of gameplay you will be challenged on how to keep your population alive at times. Once you learned the ropes and strategies, the challenge to keep your population alive is not that difficult. But then again I've played this game quite a bit.B. Buildings - Banished in the unmodded format provides limited buildings. If you build a stone house, then that is all it will be, a stone house. Buildings don't evolve like in a civilization style game which means the buildings stratisfy evolving into more efficiency or the graphics change with the next generation. Banished buildings stay the same unless you use mods.C. Sandbox - Banished can provide hundreds of maps you want to start from. The map seeds are practically limitless. This allows you to construct a new village/town facing various dynamics of land types, weather, and bodies of water.D. Micromanagement - One aspect to this game is you micromanage jobs, resources, crops etc etc. If you don't like micromanaging how many people are working as a farmer vs miner, then I suggest you pass this game up. A large part of this game is micromanagement.E. Modding - The game was designed to be modded. There are numerous mods out there that allow new buildings, crops, jobs, etc. etc. The only downside to modding is many mods disable the achievements. There are some downsides to this game but it depends on your tolerance level.A. AI - The computer AI sometimes get very annoying after a bit. The computer AI is the citizens. Citizens go idle once in a while, which results in them being non-productive. An example is you are building a house, the builder almost finishes the project but then he/she goes idle and stops working. The only way to get them out of the idle phase was reload the game.B. Timesink - Expanding your village and creating a higher population takes lots of time. If you don't mind playing this game passionately for an extended period of time then no issue. On the other hand if you have limited time to dedicate to building a village up into a town, then I would think twice.Overall, the game is fun for a while but over time, once you played it over and over, it gets kind of boring. When it is on sale I recommend buying it cheap. At full price I would say it is not worth. If you have lots of time, enjoy micromanaging a village, and understand the aspects of keeping a population alive that was banished to a land, then by all means I would recommend.			"

												This is one of my favorite games.  I like slow-paced, intricate simulation-type games (SimCity, Patrician, Farming Giant, etc), so if you are looking for action and excitement, stay away.  If you are looking to really immerse yourself into a survival and city-building sim with a handful of people starting out with a wagon and some tools, then this will appeal.  You feel every birth and death as if you were the village leader shepherding his people toward a brighter future, and, at least early in the game, every decision seems essential.  I like that.  As others have commented, the mods really make this game.  The base game was built by one guy in his spare time, and he did a great job considering.  The mods take it to the next level, and although it seems like every version of mod left some bug unfixed, and it isn't likely the creator will go back and fix them, all in all its a very satisfying experience.  The weakest part of the game is late in the gameplay, where there just isn't much to do after survival is assured and your handful of villagers is in the 1000's, and the game can lag a bit on some systems.  But it is always fun starting over again in different climates (the frosty harsh climate, the arid desert climate), which brings a whole different feel to the game, and in the mods, new opportunities for different crops and growing seasons.  There are too few games like this for those of us who like this kind of detailed, down-in-the-weeds, slow-paced simulation style games.  Highly recommend.			"

												After playing well over 1000 hours of this game offline when I had no internet access and trying out a couple different mods I can say it will be one of those games I always go back to, just like Minecraft and The Sims. Sometimes I'll think ""Just an hour of game time before bed"" and suddenly I have a population of 500 and the sun is rising outside. The randomly generated names are a double edged sword. So many times I've thought ""What a great name!"" only to see another newborn girl called Fred born shortly after. The walkthroughs are great for starting out, and anything can be found online. Note: if you put all of your animals in the same area, don't be upset if a hurricane wipes them all out. (Spread herds all over the map and always have multiples!)			"

												     I purchased Banished during the Steam Summer Sale due to the fact that I love simulation games and the price was right. This game is the most challenging simulation game that I have ever played. The only thing it might be missing for other who enjoy a good simulation game would be the advancement over the years of moving into technology. The other would be others either real or computer generated that you would battle against. I myself do not miss those two factors.     That being said what I do like about this game is it’s challenging factor. You have to balance your focus on many things at once and make smart decisions on where and when to build and or expand your city. Just one minor wrong decision could make the difference between having plenty of supplies or running out and having half to three quarters of your cities population starve or freeze to death.     Another great factor of the game is the pairing of people. If you building the community shelter not a lot of “Breeding” will go on and your cities population will not expand. You must build houses at the correct time and the correct amount in order for your citizens to move in and create children.     The graphics are acceptable and the terrain maps are okay but it is the game play that makes me spend so many hours trying and trying to build a huge city. My maximum population that I have achieved in my 50+ hours of game play is 149. I know and realize that I am doing something incorrect for any possible expansion.     I intend to play this game as long as it take in order to create a thriving city that is well balanced and expanding. I am glad that I purchased the game and I give it a 7 out 10. Thank you. "

												Although I have only played about 8 hours so far, this is by far my favorite game in my collection at the moment. It is very addictive and extremely fun. It's the kind of game you want to have when you're sick of getting shot at or dismembered. This is one of the few games I have enjoyed with no story, no stunning graphics, no main characters. You yourself are the protagonist and antagonist. It is up to you to help or hurt this makeshift society. Pros +- Fun and engaging gameplay that anyone from 5-105 would enjoy.- A nice getaway from games like Skyrim or Battlefield. - It doesn't pull any punches. What I mean is that if you make a few bad decisions, your citizens will die. As Eddard Stark so wonderfully puts it, ""Winter is coming.""- Better graphics than expected, this is the first game I've played on Steam that I can with out a doubt say that the pictures don't do the game justice.- Worth the price. Right now $19.99 USD, worth it, although I got it for $10 in a Humble Bundle Sale.Cons -- Still needs work, the game is not perfect. The AI is a little buggy, and the timing on the weather is very predictable. Sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain, sunshine, snow, sunshine, snow, sunshine, rain, sunshine, rain,  and so on...- Not exactly a CON, but the dev is one person from my understanding. Great game designed by one person, but it could be even better if designed by 2+.- Very hard to play now that Borderlands 2 is $9.99, but that's a personal problem.All in all, I give this 4 out of 5 stars. To put in prospective, I give Sims 4, a LOOSLY similar game, a 2 out of 5. Unfortunatly I can't compare it to another City Builder game, as I have none. Hope some people get something out of my  very first review, thanks for reading!			"

												Banished is an excellent game, however not for everyone. If you're looking for a citybuilder that is similar to Sim City, then this game may not be for you. However if you are looking for a City Builder with survival elements, akin to Anno then continue listening!What is banished?I've come to call Banished a Town builder instead of a city builder, even then you'll be luck to get more than a large village in your first few games. At first you will begin with a small hamlet, then you'll become ambitious and want to expand so you can add mines, quarries, town halls, schools, churches and more to your town. This is when the real fun in in Banished begins, as suddenly it becomes a game of balancing people's job. In the winter you will want to change certain citizens roles, such as farmers, as they are useless in the winter and vice versa when it comes to spring time.The catch of the survival is when something goes wrong, it really can go wrong. Lets take my most succesful town (at time of writing) as an example. I was expanding to quickly, i had a mine, blacksmith and a quarry, all i needed to support growth I thought. However I forgot to take into account that some building use iron and tools, made in the blacksmith use iron, my income of iron wasn't exactly flowing. I had hit around 60 population at the time and everyone had a job. Suddenly the entire village ran out of tools, now everything took far longer to do; farming, mining, foresting, woodcutting. I had no tools to mine the iron fast enough to make tools.And there, is what Banished truly is, a balancing act, in which things can go drastically wrong with a single mistake "

												A long but descriptive review:  This review should give enough detail for you to decide if it's the right game for you without telling you exactly how to play or making generalizations (""If you like X or Y this is the game for you!""), though I do make comparisons to Anno games in places because it's the easiest comparison to make.Banished is less city builder and more town/village builder/management sim.  This is a good thing in my opinion.  There are no lofty tech trees to chase and no taxes to levy or money to manage.  There are no nobles to appease for fear of them burning down your city.  This is a game where your citizens are simultaenously your biggest problem and your most precious resource.  If you're looking for combat, you won't find it here.  This is survival against nature.Learning curve:The basic operation and interface of the game is very intuitive, but the learning curve on balancing people and resources can be surprisingly brutal.  You do have to be forward thinking with respect to resource management and population management (more on that below in relevant sections).  Even if you are a city builder/management sim pro, you can still expect to have at least one major failure before you get it all figured out.  I personally started a few towns with the intention of determining limits and understanding population growth before making a town I was really invested in.Building:Much like the Anno series, you place roads and buildings where you see fit.  Unlike Anno, there are no hard coded limitations on where you place buildings in relation to each other (no ""sorry, but you can't finish your road because the corner is outside the influence radius), but citizen travel times are factored in and distance of a home to a work area affects the ability of a worker to complete their tasks.  Roads are important for reducing these travel times.  Layouts that would work well in real life can work in this game.  Storage and stockpile buildings, farms, etc. all share the need for reasonable proximity to each other.  Building speed and collection of materials all seem fairly balanced.  There are no tech trees and all buildings are available to build so long as you have the materials to build them.  Luckily, unless you assign workers to a building you don't need, constructing something too early is just a waste of construction resources and time builders could have been doing something else.  There are far worse mistakes you can make.  The only downside to building I've found in this game relates to lack of any terraforming.  Hills are in the way and will prevent building placement even if it's just one square on a corner that's on ""hill"" terrain.  Real people would just dig out a little for that corner.  You can construct tunnels to pass roads through hills but it takes a while and uses a lot of stone, which is an abundant but non-renewable resource (more on that in the resources section).Citizen Management:You manage your citizens by assigning X number of laborers (the default/idle job) to various other jobs such as builder, farmer, woodcutter, etc.  Your citizens will determine for themselves which laborer picks up that job based on their home's proximity to the building/resource being worked.  This distance factor appears to update only when unassigning or reassigning jobs.  Citizens are divided into families which will occupy one house each.  A family starts as two adults and any children they already have if it's a starter family or nomads.  As children reach an age to make families of their own, you have to provide housing for them to expand (unlike real life, young couples won't move in and breed in mom and dad's basement).  This is the primary method of controlling growth and has to be balanced with aging.  If your people get too old before you make extra houses, they'll never get a chance to have kids and your population will stagnate, ultimately dying off.  If you build too many houses your population may outpace your ability to gather food and resources.  Schools are necessary for fully efficient workers.  Health and happiness are factors controlled mostly through resource management.  With the right building, you can receive nomads from time to time which helps with recovery from stagnation, disease, or other population reductions, but they also have the potential to bring disease with them.  Populations can get to decent sizes with a LOT of work.  Early on you can expect to reach a hundred or so before you start losing balance.  With experience and careful planning, people have reached into the low thousands.Resource management:This game has nowhere near as many resources to manage as an Anno game but it does cover all of the basics.  Logs, stone, and iron are your construction resources, all of which can be gathered by laborers under manual direction.  Logs can be sustainably gathered by forresters who will cut and replant in an area around their building.  This is important because logs also become firewood to keep your population warm and will need constant replenishment.  Stone and Iron can be quarried and mined if there's not enough on the surface, but they require significant labor, are dangerous for worker and will eventually deplete.  Often, trading for stone and iron is a more sustainable approach.  There are a wide variety of food sources (farming, gathering, hunting, etc.) and having a variety is important for the health of your citizens (living on potatoes alone isn't healthy).  Some are more efficient early, some more efficient later, but all very good to have.  As you might expect, food is the most important factor in balancing your population, followed closely by firewood (or coal) and clothing.  There is also an herb resource that contributes to the health of your citizens.Final opinions and replayability:This is a sandbox game, not a game with quests and goals.  The goals are whatever you set for yourself, be it steam achievements, X population, stabilized population, challenges, etc.  This makes the game as replayable as your personal interests and imagination allow.  The variety of buildings and resources are reasonable but don't make for significant replayability on their own (like trying to build superprojects in Anno).  If you are a very content driven gamer, you will probably be able to see everything this game has to offer in 5-10 hours of gameplay.  Personally, I love the challenge of growth balance and the long game so I'm going to get a LOT of hours out of it.  This game is complete, not early access, and the finish is solid.  I haven't encountered any bugs myself.  The creator is presently working on making it modable which could lead to significant community expansion.  The music is pleasantly ambient and the sound effects are good.  The graphics are surprisingly good for a one-man project, which I think is partially due to use of great textures.  It's a lightweight game and plays just fine on my i5 laptop with Intel HD4000 graphics.  I hope this review was helpful.			"

												Okay okay, i have been seeing many comments about do not add multiplayer or a combat system in the game. Where I do agree with everyone saying do not add combat, I must say honestly i would love multiplayer added in. Not a multiplayer system that involves competition play, but a co-op feature so I may play with a friend. Co-op (not an AI co-op) would seem to benefit this game, I see no valid argument as to disclaim my personal opinion. Think about it, Banished having two people in it, one player starts on one side of the map, and the other person starts on the other. Both players build how they wish and neither of them may mess with the other persons buildings, roads, or civilians. Endless fun of playing with a friend, again, in a non-competitive and non-combat way.With that being said, I still love this game! It is hard, addicting, and very fun! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME BEFORE GOING TO BED! You will become obsessed and you will not be able to stop, you have been forewarned future Banished players!			"

												While playing Banished I came to a realization.  That it has been the first middle ground of city based management in a long time.  At the Tripple A side we have EA charging DLC for things that should have been apart of the main game, and on the indie side most indie managment games are either way to easy, or you need a calculator and a degree in mathmatics to enjoy it, and the community snubs you if you don't 'get it'.Banished is the perfect balance, it is a compleate game, it doesn't take much to learn, the tutorials are very helpful and quick and it is as easy or as hard as you wish to make it from there.  The graphics are very nice for a one man team and gets across everything it needs to, there is little to no confusion on what is needed, everything is pretty straight foward and its a nice game.If you enjoy management games, god games or building games, I highly recomend this one regardless of the price.  It is worth it any time and any price for you.Although if you are an achivement hunter I highly recomend staying clear of this one, the achivements are earned and not given away so freely, even after plugging six hours into the game at the time of writing I have yet to achive anything.  Not a complaint in the least but, the game really isn't kind to achivement hunters.			"

												Great city building games are few and far.  Banished is a very fresh take on the genre, and takes it a few steps futher than others.  This is an outstanding game, and any who are into builders should play it.PROSEasy to pick up the basics (the tutorials don't kill the mood and weigh the fun down), just the right amount of difficulty.  Once you understand what it takes to make it through the first winter or two, you get a great feeling of accomplishment.  That's when things start going wrong.  The game really makes you analyze what you did try different methods.  Never once was I disappointed when a town died out.  Introduced the idea of sustainability to a city building game.  Most games like this have either a single resource (money), or several that are used to build stuff.  Banished makes it much more real by consuming your resources the way they should be.  It's your job to make sure you don't expand too quickly, or remain stagnant and your villagers die of old age before a new generation comes in.Many city builders are plagued by annoying micromanagement and not enough of the right kind of customization.  The way they designed how you can assigned different types or workers and change them on the fly is awesome.  Also, the idea of being able to limit your resources and how they are used adds a great layer to the game. You'll quickly learn that maybe it wasn't such a great idea to make a crapload of tools for your town.CONSThe only thing I can really think of is some people may want more options of buildings, jobs, crops, tools, etc... While I think they did a good job, some may want a bigger variety.  I can understand some of the negative reviews about how it doesn't have a lot of content, but I believe the gameplay is good enough to play a long time.			"

												This is a great little title - brutal and zen-like all at the same time. Definitely creates that atmosphere of ""five more mintues"" until 3AM. While there is a relatively small amount of buildings to construct, they all work well together to balance how you slowly expand across the map. With the incoming modding support hopefully adding more and more variety, this is a steal of a game and worth immediate pick-up.			"

												Game seems comfy and easy going, when in fact it's macromanaging hell. Don't let that falter you though, the constant effort of expanding the village and keeping your population growing is a real treat to play. Draws upon elements from the Anno series (city building with various resources to produce and manage), to Dwarf Fortress (various professions for citizens and the need to strategize so that your entire population doesn't get wiped out due to one shortcoming). Ridiculously addictive fun, you'll wonder where the time went.			"

												I adore this game. It's difficult and relaxing all at once. It's amazing to think that this beautiful game was made by one person! All the programming, graphics, art, GUI, sound and design! I read that he had help with the music, but was more than prepared to do it himself. The game is about surviving and thriving. You have to manage your resources carefully or you'll find your little people start to grumble and drop dead. It's fun to take small steps and in no time at all you are ruling a sprawling town. There are a few hiccups. In my experience at least, there have been numerous graphical issues like animations happening too fast, water showing through the trade boat and certain buildings. The herbalist also makes no sense to me. Nobody ever uses herbs, and my health has never dropped below 4.5 hearts.I heartily suggest this quaint little game. Support good devs in a gaming climate filled with incomplete games and DLC greedy publishers.			"

The glitches are random and normally happen at the start of a new game. The mods suck for the most part except a few that add more things to do like clay and beekeeping.

												I really tried to like this game, but in the end, even after tying to fix it up to my liking with mods, I just feel ""meh"" about it.I think my problem with it was the lack of meaningful goals. After I got the lemmings to survive and maintain a supply of resources and happiness, there was really nothing else to do but continue to micromanage. I set my own goal of trying to spread out and cover an entire huge map, but it started to get unbearbly laggy before I had covered a quarter of the map.And speaking of micromanagement, I found that part really tedious. The ai of the citizens is pretty awful and in a lot of respects there's nothing you can really do about it, you just have to work around them being stupid. The game ui leaves a lot to be desired in terms of maximizing efficiency, to the point that anything beyond a tiny city becomes a nightmare to manage.Even if you really like city builder games, I'd wait till a sale to try this one out.

												I like this game a lot. Start with four families and a cart; attempt to carve a new life for your people out of the (not really very howling) wilderness. See the screenshots and videos for how it looks; I find it quite evocative.The game is very tight, very elegant; I like how all the pieces/parts fit together. There are a couple of places the UI could use some tweaking (larger fonts, resizable windows, and perhaps the Trade screen), but otherwise it's intuitive and appealing. I love the look of the game, and I love the attention to detail the developer (singular) paid to the graphics. The AI is one of the better ones I've seen - your populace will occasionally appear to be doing something insane, but for me there has always turned out to be a reason for the insanity (usually something braindead I have done). In fact, the agent-AI is a lot like what EA said was going to be in SCnewest, and then horribly failed to deliver.The game changes with the seasons. Rain falls in spring, trees get their leaves, your people move back into the fields.  Crops grow in summer, your foresters continue to plant, your orchards grow full. The fields empty in autumn, little stacks of resources pile up as your laborers try to get all the crops in before the snows of winter fall.  And around we go again. Every person in your village has a house, that needs to be near where they work, and needs to be near to some place to gather food, and tools, and clothing, and firewood; you can follow individuals around as they go through their day. People age at (I think) four times a village's year - so you quickly find yourself dealing with generations, and watching the elderly die as the young are born. (Or not, if you aren't paying attention)If you like city-builders, if you go through the tutorials, and if you adjust well to the idea that ""slow and steady wins the race,"" then the complaints/issues of it being ""too easy"" and ""too shallow"" have a certain amount of validity. My first village, for example, is in year 58, I have ~375 people, on a small map, and things are pretty much bopping along needing only marginal help from me.If you ignore the tutorials, and common sense, and run the game at 10x speed, and ask regularly ""when does the combat start"" in various fora - You're Going To Have A Bad Time. It is amazingly easy, even when things are going well, to trip into a domino-effect of Suck that will see half your pop starve or freeze to death before you fix the problem.There are achievements, and most of them actually mean something (as opposed to the ""Grats! You Started A Game!"" style) Also, there's no way to get all them with one village, because some of them require mutually-contradictory playstyles.Sometimes I zoom in as far as I can, pitch the camera as low as I can, and zoom along 20 feet about the streets of my little village, just watching my people go about their day.  Yes, I am a geek :)I was in the last round of beta testing, so I've got about 40 hours in the game, fwiw.			"

I feel there is not a large amount of things to build or have interact. But it is still a real challenge to try and grow/expand.Stonghold two has better city simulaton/castle building.  but this game has a harder/more realistic resource usage.For me, the game was fun, but not much that keeps me involved or wanting to come back.

												This game is hard. Firstly I expected what you probably expect as you read this, ""Banished is SimCity in the middle ages"". This game is actually more about survival than building up the ""city"" of your dreams. To build a village, like one of those you see in the screenshots, you'll need ~3h.But to be honest, you'll kill your settlers on the first try anyway: - Not enough wood to keep them warm in the winter? - Not enough food stored for the winter? - Your villagers are ill but you have no medicine? - Did you overuse your fields and the last harvest was complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Did the bad weather destroy everything on your fields?You don't have thousands of sims running around. Your village includes 20-100 people. You even recognize some of them by name because you were so happy when you realized that a new baby was born. Then you see him becoming a student, then a worker...until he freezes to death because you didn't provide enough clothing. ♥♥♥♥!This game was developed by one guy, you can mod the game and the performance is great. If you want a city building game and want to achieve something - this is for you. And once some mods are out, I'm sure everyone will find a mod that fits his/her playstyle.Recommended!			"

												You start with just a handful of settlers, banished from their homeland. And perhaps a cow or two, depending on difficulty settings. Winter is approaching fast. Clear an area, build some houses, get some food production going in the form of a farm or fishery. Will you have enough lumber for firewood during the harsh cold of winter? Will your food stores last long enough until the next harvest? Or will a sudden disease, fire, or natural disaster wipe out your colony.Banished is a pure sandbox colony builder. The only goal, aside from chasing a few achievements which can act as “missions” if you interpret them so, is to see how far you can get. Expand your colony too fast, and you might not have the food production to meet demand. This leads to starvation and a huge chunk of your population dying off. If your birth rate is too low (limited by population mood and available housing), there may not be enough future laborers to take the place of those that die of old age. A sudden cold snap, when you don’t have enough warm clothing to go around, causes people to freeze to death in their homes.There is so much that could go wrong at any time in the randomly-generated wilderness, that simple survival has it’s own zen-like reward. When all the plates are spinning nice and balanced, somehow, and everything seems to be going well, the colony acts like a well oiled machine. One you built yourself, through trial and error. It takes a bit of time to learn how things work, like the interplay between the various types of resource generating buildings you can make, how close or far apart you should place things, when should expand, and so on. But each catastrophic failure becomes an important lesson learned to apply to your next attempt. The way Banished works, how its colony ecology functions, is very clear visually. Unlike, for example, SimCity where much happens in “abstraction” as numbers and the movements of the city’s inhabitants are visual fakery, Banished leans closer towards the likes of Theme Park or Theme Hospital. Every colonist matters. You can follow an individual, track their mood and thoughts, and watch them from birth until death.There is so much quality in both the design and execution of Banished. The user interface in particular stands out as clear, functional and powerful without being overwhelming. It’s hard to believe it was all made by just one person. All the software development, artwork and audio is the result of one Luke Hodorowicz, whose debut effort outshines most of the recent city planning simulators by far bigger studios.			"

												This review is based on a single 6 hour play at medium difficulty.Graphics & UI:The game correctly detected my settings and ran at 2560x1440 (something most AAA titles have a problem with). The graphics are well done, detailed and suit the game. The UI has a scaling feature but even at the highest setting some buttons are under 2mm wide. Some UI elements look scaled and blurry.Sound: No problems here except trade ship arrival, a death and low stocks all use the same quiet alert sound. Can't comment on music as its usually the first thing I disable in a game.Bugs & Issues: No crashes or freezes of any kind. On a few occasions builders stopped working but reloading fixed this. The game ran smoothly with no slowdown or lag even running at x10 speed.Gameplay:Banished is mostly a typical city builder game but tries a few things that mostly work well. Lack of an in-game currency is a nice change and trading for new crops and livestock is a nice idea although after a while it felt like any other 'random event'. It doesn't have the extreme manpower shortage that most games of this genre use as as a 'feature' and the way resources are featured is well done. The in-game character A.I. & scripting isn't the best but isn't bad and is much better than a game like Towns. It also lacks a way to prioritize some jobs over others which makes managing supply chains more difficult. The one thing most builder games suffer from is a weak link in resource supply chains and this game is no different, the problem being tools. Once you run out of tools everyone slows down so much that its only a matter of time until your people slowly starve or freeze to death. At 6 hours long it was a fairly quick game but the map felt big enough and while there were more obstacles to building than I like, I never once felt that I was running out of space to expand. In fact I'd say that Banished works better than most city-builder games with smaller segregated clumps of development. The one thing I did feel while playing was that at no point did difficulty ramp up in any way.  Managing 120 people feels no different to managing 20 and there was little incentive to diversify foods when health & happiness barely dropped. Despite a few issues that can be easily fixed (or overcome with mods if the feature is added), the game is fun and worth a buy if you like the genre.Summary: A well made fun entry into the city-builder genre. While it suffers from a few of the common problems with this type of game its worth a buy. "

												This is not Sim City.  This is not Age of Empires.  This is not simply a city-building game.  This game is about survival of a city you are building.  The graphics are perfectly fine for the gameplay that is offered.  The gameplay is relaxing, fun, and can be BRUTAL.  This game loves to let you feel like you are building a thriving city then all of a sudden you are hit with a tornado that starts a fire, food shortage, and to top it all off the game gives your people AIDs and they all die.  This is a survival city building game.  Your next building decision could literally decide the fate of your entire city.  You have to use your intelligence to balance all the needs of your people.  If you allow that balance to go out of whack for one second, you will be starting a new game.This will be the best $19.99 you spend on video games all year!			"

												Luke Hodorowicz has created a masterpiece of indie video games. This game - created over three years by one man and his brother (music and testing) - is a challenging and enticing survival sandbox game in which your primary goal is to build a town that can survive the harshness of the elements. Although probably not for everybody (as this game is HARD), it provides a real challenge to gamers that makes you want to have another try to crack that perfect formula. The negative reviews on Steam stand testament, with the majority only being negative due to the fact it is hard to crack in an age where games seem to be getting more and more dumbed down. It is so easy to lose yourself in Banished, with one game turning into a full day long marathon with only the approach of night being a warning sign of how long you have been playing. My recommendation? If you like strategy games, love being challenged and appreciate a damn fine game, the price tag is more than worth the investment. It still needs a tiny bit of tweaking (mines/quarries/fields being a little on the underpowered side with firefood being overpowered), but nothing that cannot be fixed in patches or mods. Never seen any bugs.9/10.			"

												I managed to put over 30 hours into this game in a barely 72 hour time spam. Very addictive and highly recommend it for someone who's looking for a great simulation game. Actually, it's more like a survival/simulation game imo. But, you want everything in this game to be perfect. It can get pretty intense when your people start starving if you don't have enough food or a sickness breaks out and you don't have a herbalist and a physician. One of the things I absolutely love about this game is that when you want to start over, it doesn't feel like a boring rut or anything like that. You just become so focused on getting crap right this time. The maps are also randomized as well. One time, everything was going perfect for once. There was enough food, tools, clothing, firewood, etc. And the next thing I know, a tornado comes ripping through my village. Killed some villagers. Destroyed my town hall building, houses, fisheries. Mother nature is cold. And you will never ever be prepared for it. Banished is also all about balance, such is life. You have to make sure your people are feed, happy, and healthy. As well as make sure you keep building enough houses for them to reproduce. The townsfolk also love their booze, it makes them happy. Do not have a village without a tavern for the love of god. The villagers also have a mind of their own. At one point, my village was running low on food because I screwed up. And I go around clicking on houses, checking inventory. And this 16 year old woman was living all by herself and she was hoarding food. ""On this episode of Hoarders...."" She literally had over 200 servings of corn, 150 fish, 300 venison, etc. Are you freakin' kidding me? So you know what I did? Ordered to have her house tore down and then build a small cemetery out of the materials from her home. She became homeless. Thus she had no inventory. And died. Her grave being in that cemetery. Overall, if you want a game that's addictive and repeatedly punishes you, get this. Pros.-Addictive. (I know, I know. I keep saying it. But I don't think you guys understand). -Challenges you.-The villagers will annoy you and will find ways to extract revenge. You are the god now. -The soundtrack is really amazing. Love it. -Different maps, map sizes, local seeds for corps, livestock, and can also name your village.Cons.-Villagers can be assh0les. -Nothing is truly in your control.-Addictive.			"

No barbarians screaming at the gates, not a zombie in sight, just good solid building with intelligent villagers, clever mechanics, and thoughtful details. It's easy, it's relaxing, it's soothing. Until the realities of colony life bite you in the backside! Banished is addictive. ""

												Banished is the best sandbox town builder! Similar to Age of Empires and Settlers games except without the threat of war. There is no need to produce soldiers or defence/offence items/people, its just a pure town building simulation, where the only threat is mother nature. Be warned, Banished is addictive and while playing, hours can go by in a snap!			"

												This is a very simplistic game. There are about 20 buildings, from houses to farms, orchards, markets, etc. At the start it can be challenging because you have little margin for error. If you run out of food, everyone starves. However, once you master that challenge, there's basically nothing else to do other than make the city bigger. There are no advanced supply chains or goals, it's just rebuilding the same 20 buildings over and over. And about 8 of these buildings are to make food. I bought this for the good reviews, but this game will entertain you for about four hours. After that, there's just nothing to keep your attention, unless you just want to make the biggest city you can.			"

												I must say its a great game. But it has some issues that decrease its replay value and make you depend on mods (which locks all the achievements.) And there's no patches or updates that fixes these issues, just mods. Mining is too hard, your civilians cant move their asses etc. Its not exactly a city builder, its a survival game and you'll go crazy how much your folks eat and cant MINE. You can cut trees and produce firewood or use coal in order to stay warm. If you use trees either you wont be able to move your town towards forests or you will make the map a desert.  I've been cutting trees like Isengard and it wasnt enough. So you'll want to go with coal mines, right? 30 workers in a coal mine makes 7000 coal at max which is not enough. And each person eats 100 food per year so in big picture you exchange 30.000 food for 7.000 coal. And that's a lot of food.This issue made me crazy so thats why i stopped playing. It should be fixed by the developer for more fun and in order to try achievements. As i said its a great game, but it needs fixes. And without those fixes it doesnt worth its money.			"

												I love this game, but I also HATE this game. I love the idea, the setting, the goal ... everything. But, the mechanics are downright frustrating. Typically, at Year 15, I have 20,000 or more food and around 60 residents. But, around that time, regardless of all the population-building strategies I've built, people start dying ... and the game doesn't tell you that people are dying or why. And, strangely, their homes still use firewood, and they keep eating. In fact, the decreased population eats more and faster than the increased population. So, by Year, 20, I'm down to 30 residents, but I'm still burning as much wood as 60 residents, and my food stores are down to starvation level. After 140 hours, what's the lesson to be learned? Don't play this game. All it does is become an obsession to try to figure out why it works this way, but for this game, there is no answer. Anymore, I just play the first 10 years, because they usually make sense. Banished is the only game I've seen where the better-off your city is, the more people die for unexplained reasons.			"

												1-sentence review : it's not a bad game and it clearly has some strong appeal in if you're into casual building games, with no goal nor real challenge, as there's nothing to aim for except keep on on extending your population till you bore, which for me happened after less than a dozen hours, and thus makes the game too expensive at the $20 price point ; you might want to get it on a sale though.Pros :- nice ambiance- seeing growing your village- interesting to set up the economic chaining for the 1st timeCons :- no difficulty except for 2 things (see following points)- keeping your population size requires to create new houses ; apparently, grown up adults would rather die childless than having sex in their parent homes, even if it's 60% empty ; this is problematic because in the long run, the extra houses will lead to extra population, and not creating new house means your village will wipe (they might be Mormon), so it's not really possible to keep a constant population without doing a lot of extra stuff (ie: manually destroying houses at some point)- the only economic challenge is to know that you need to have a Storage Barn near your production zones, while the description of the market made me feel it'd replace the barn ; this lead to a massive starvation death rate in my village ;-)- once you reach a population of 100, you'd do the same things other and other again- the different vegetables & fruits don't seem to have any relevance except a little bit for trading- a lot of information is hard to get ; eg: I have no idea how much food my population needs per year, so I just looked the available food in the inventory and when it went down too much, I built more field (game is already way too easy so extra information would make it a total ride in a park, I guess)			"

												A friend of mine recently asked me to write him a review of Banished after he saw me playing the game on Steam. I agreed and then promptly forgot, although in my defence forgetting involved playing a further 50 hours of Banished.The most commonly asked question I see from people on the community hub goes along the lines of ""is this game worth it?"" and I believe firmly that the answer is yes, but of course with caveats.Banished is a City builder genre game albeit. It is not a slur though when I say it is more of a Village builder game. It lacks the large complexities of the Sim City style games and has a very small technology tree, the types of map you can choose vary between Valleys and Mountains and the only real difference seems to be the number of hills in the way. The entire range of buildings is available from the start and the real trick seems to be finding a map that will work for you. Often you will start a map to find that the best resources are too far away to be of much use early  on or across a river that you cannot afford to bridge quickly enough.Find a map that has enough flat space to work with and you are then left with the challenge of keeping your people alive. Build some houses, gather some firewood, make a few coats and harvest some food, have some babies and rinse and repeat. Sounds fairly simple and generally the game is. It is one of those rare games that barring disaster if you get a good start it is hard to mess it up. You expand out and evolve your economy which is usually heavily based around selling firewood for stone, metal, livestock and plant seeds.The game suffers from what I perceive to be a few irritating flaws; that stock management is basic at best and your villages will often suffer from hoarding problems i.e. 250 food in one house with neighbour starving and secondly you will often see people living in a house miles from their job with no way to move them so they waste large volumes of time walking rather than working. In the extreme cases I have had villagers starve going to / returning from work. It is a bit much though to watch a house burn down whilst 15 people run past the well next to it without picking a bucket of water up.What I am a little excited about is the modding opportunities the game presents. There is an active community and already people are looking to expand the game with additional resources such as apiaries and windmills and bakers etc.Overall the game is generally slow paced, can present a significant challenge when played on hard or when you enable natural disasters. The artwork is very well done for a solo developer project and the game works well. There are a few niggles as mentioned above but for just £15 Banished presents great value for money if you do play it and get more than 20 hours from it. If you like city games and want another to expand your property portfolio then Banished could be one for you. "

												Sim city with more micro managing and less action.You build the city up from a couple families up to a bunch of families, but after 5 hours in I have built almost every building possible. the only remaining options were variations of the same ones (chestnuts instead of walnuts, for example). It just kinda becomes monotonous, but maybe I'm just used to more complicated games.			"

The nice thing about this is you do not have hordes of barbarian coming to kill your women and have suprise sex with your horses.

												If you like pure city management this game is a must buy. There will be no knights in shiny armor knocking on the door instead the only thing that can bring your village down are disasters of natural cause. And well, your own stupidity as well. Expect to have a hard time when you first play the game but stick with it and you'll have an amazing experience in a bug free game. You'll be managing everything you can think of, food (wide variety), builing materials (stone, logs, iron), medicines, education, trading and so much more!You'll be proud if your people are healthy, happy and expanding, scared when a tornado appears on the map and devestaded when they just couldn't stop the fire fast enough. Mixed emotions for a guaranteed amazing experience and remember you can pretty much always rebuild with the remaining population: a big challenge!			"

												Definitely one of my favourite city builder games of all time, and I've been playing them for 20 years!  Incredible that this masterpiece is the work of one man.  Not to mention that, apart from an AI bug I actually prefer to keep (animals walk under water when they travel!), the game appears to be completely bug free.I do, however, have to warn you that this is also one of the hardest in the genre.  Expand too slowly and you'll be stifled by old age; expand too soon and your town will starve to death.  The resource management is key, and is incredibly sensitive to fluctuation.  Find yourself on a downward spiral, running out of resources?  You're probably already doomed.  Managed to harvest in excess?  Store it up so you have a buffer zone.  Not enough workers?  Accept some nomads, or help your population to breed.The game might appear to be a little shallow - once you've built all that appears in the menu, that's it - but I promise you, there's so much to this game if you're interested in making a successful, expansionist town, especially if you're after the achievements.It's not a quickfire game either - you need lots and lots of patience to survive, and even more to master it.  Before you know it, you'll have spent hours on this game without achieving much, but having grand goals for your town in mind.Very hard to put this game down!			"

												Great game! Picked it up the other night and have to say I was a little surprised on how it plays. After installing and quickly clicking through the in-game tutorials I thought I was in for another city-building strategy game. This game isn't really a city builder as it is a survival game. There is no invading bandits or any military tech. Micro managing your town to protect your people from the elements, disease and starvation while expanding the population and maintaining the workforce all at once is plenty enough. There is no money in this game, more of a barter system once you set up your trader on the river. Trading resources your town has stockpiles of for new crop seeds, live stock and other supplies is the only way to bring diversity to your towns diet and obtain resources you otherwise couldn't produce. Finding the balance in your town is key which can be tricky, as every map is randomly generated and can differ with resources and geographics. Not one plan will work for every town which will bring replayability.There is no winning in Banished, you either get it right and flourish or your people starve to death over the next cold winter.

												This game is an enigma to figure out. I highly reccomend trying to explore the game yourself, and not looking guides/asking for help. It took me many tries to even get started, and once I thought I was going just fine, something would happen and I'd have to start all over again.This game is a test of patience. There hasn't been any updates to the game, but there is a belief that development is there. The game is small content wise, there isn't a whole lot of variation in what you can do, but honestly it's currently enough. This game is difficult and really fun. It's kind of the perfect mix of casual gaming with competitive, intense gaming.			"

My Pet Medieval TownOr how Banished turned me into a complete monsterFinally, a city building game without incomprehensible statistic screens and no invading armies to worry about. Just me and my people against nature.I started Banished all hopeful and tried to nurture my first brave band of exiles into a happy, healthy community. After they all starved to death I tried again, paying more attention to quick food access this time. When they froze to death with the onset of winter, I took a third stab at it, balancing food, fuel and housing more successfully - and thus began my slow but sure conversion into a medieval despot.Now I'm ruling over a small town ordering ten year olds down mines or sending them out into snowstorms to break rocks. A couple of very old men who have worked for my town their whole lives, sired many children and tragically lost their wives to old age - these men still work, but I want them dead, because I can't evict them and they're taking up a whole house by themselves and I want a younger 'breeding pair' in the house. When the old widows and widowers die, I let out a happy little 'Yay! Finally!'The only reason I even have a graveyard to shovel these spent workhorses into, is because productivity suffers when the dead go unburied.I began the game a nurturing benefactor - now a mere 24 hours in, I'm an iron-hearted tyrant. You have been warned.			"

												The game falls in the resource city building simulator category, similar to Sim City games, where you have to build a town and make it grow managing it's resources.

												In many ways a more micromanagement based Tropico like game set in the medieval times. This game is a unique city builder offering up the challenge of survival as the greatest goal in the game. That challenge is actually quite intense as you must watch over your fledgling village grow, expand, and take on new challenges.This game is not for those who want a particular scenerio with the clear start and finish goal. In many ways this is more akin to Sim City, as the goals are made by your own whims and imagination.Suffice it so say, if you are a fan of city builders, this is a gem.			"

												For a one-man project, this game is amazing.  It's a solid city builder in a pseudo-medieval setting with a population scale that makes sense for the sort of structures you're building.  There are a few serious issues that pop up after a while—notably the ""march of death"" wherein your laborers will starve themselves on the way to a job across town, and a single optimal strategy that allows for far faster expansion than any other—but for a few dozen hours it's a lot of fun.

												I have sunk so much of my life into this game. It's a happy medium between creativity and strategy. You have to allocate your resources properly so you can build your dream fantasy settlement while also meeting the demands of an ever-growing town. The game will also turn the tables on you from time to time, so even in ideal conditions you have to be ready for anything. For instance, natural disasters like fires and tornadoes won't do much to a small, young town because there isn't much to there be destroyed, but they can level entire cities and wipe out your stocked resources. The most interesting part to me is watching the town evolve over time from a few shacks in a vast forest to sprawing farmlands and urban centers. The Banished workshop also offers some incredible mods that add all kinds of producation chains, terrain options, decorations and more. I never get bored! Definitely recommend.			"

												Not often do you get such an in depth and complicated game that is as easy to play as Banished. Banished is a game about trying to create a small town while battling the hardships of cold and hunger. You will have many towns that die due to fire or lack of food, but this can all be prevented with a little forward thinking and planning. The user interface for this game is excellent and provides ease of access to any aspect of your town that you want to control. The game also looks pretty; aside from the reoccurring rain, it's a joy to be able to look at the little town that you have built from scratch. The easy controls, rewarding play, and good graphics make Banished a great game that's worth picking up!			"

												A village simulation game. There are no ancillary objects other than succeeding challenges of growth, fire and winter. You start out with a handful of homeless villagers and a stockpile of food and tools. You can build houses, roads, farms, fishing piers, wells, mines, etc. There are no skill trees. However, there are resource walls. Don't plan on raising cattle without trade as cattle can only be acquired through trade. That's not to say successful towns require anything other than your creativity in resource management. Successful towns are often built around diversity and quantity of food and resources.The game reminds me of Black & White but without the godlike abilities, opposing town, or civil strife. Essentially, Sim: Village. Just needs a few aliens spaceships to go with the occasional tornado.I recommend this game to those who enjoy the genre of simulation; specifically, city-building, without the city. If your looking for conflict other than watching your villagers fight off winter, famine, and fires, then this might not be the game for you.			"

												Definitely one of my favourite city builder games of all time, and I've been playing them for 20 years!  Incredible that this masterpiece is the work of one man.  Not to mention that, apart from an AI bug I actually prefer to keep (animals walk under water when they travel!), the game appears to be completely bug free.I do, however, have to warn you that this is also one of the hardest in the genre.  Expand too slowly and you'll be stifled by old age; expand too soon and your town will starve to death.  The resource management is key, and is incredibly sensitive to fluctuation.  Find yourself on a downward spiral, running out of resources?  You're probably already doomed.  Managed to harvest in excess?  Store it up so you have a buffer zone.  Not enough workers?  Accept some nomads, or help your population to breed.The game might appear to be a little shallow - once you've built all that appears in the menu, that's it - but I promise you, there's so much to this game if you're interested in making a successful, expansionist town, especially if you're after the achievements.It's not a quickfire game either - you need lots and lots of patience to survive, and even more to master it.  Before you know it, you'll have spent hours on this game without achieving much, but having grand goals for your town in mind.Very hard to put this game down!			"

												Banished is a great little town builder. You don't have to worry about warriors, or monsters. Just Winter and starvation. Sometimes a fire or a tornado. Today I was doing well. I built my small village of 20 people up to 50! We built up from having nothing left when winter ended to food stocks of 5000+ pounds. We were trading with nearby towns for new seeds and livestock. We built a town hall... then a disease hit my cows... it wiped out the lot. I tried to quickly re-focus the town's work into other food options, but it was too late. One by one, then house by house people began to die of starvation. The town had to focus. No more blacksmiths or tailors. Stop mining for stone and iron. All hands to the farms. Down to just 15 people the village dropped. Then.... food stocks returned! We saved it. Sure... its a ghost town now... but at least its still a town. We'll rebuild. It'll be fine. [I love this game.]			"

												Recommended with reservations.-----------------------------------This is a fine city building game that offers some challenge initially and  is spurred on later in the game by population influxes that will tax your available infastructure but eventually when (if) you learn how to play the game it becomes little more than an endless waltz between stability and the urgent need to accomodate growth. You basically end up building farms to feed your people, building houses to have the population to staff farms, and then needing more farms to feed the increased population, all while popping down houses so that the little families you've been watching over for generations have a place to send their decendants once they marry an uneducated migrant farm worker and pop out a few new, properly educated citizens (who will need places to move into when they get married) --annnnd repeat.I enjoyed my time with it though and building your own fantasy town around the available geography is a treat. It is truly a sandbox game, which is oddly an issue I had with it. There is no real objective or goal or endgame other than whatever you decide to do. There are no antagonists other than bitter hunger and the unforgiving winter. I see people complaining about housing and illness, so I will try to give some tips to players having issues with the game which may also highlight problems you might have playing this game (which is not a great sentence in a review):-The solution to not enough housing is to build more houses (this is a game remember?) or to build a boarding house (families will not expand in boarding houses) as temporary housing. -As far as illness goes people who are properly housed and fed with a good variety of foods will not get ill, especially with an adequate supply of medicinal herbs on hand. I had hospitals in each of my civic centers and they went largely unused, the doctors spent their days writing up theorums on phlogestin in the humors and whistfully hoping they might some day see a cold.-Food will be your biggest challenge at the start of the game followed by the collection of wood and having enough builders to actually build anything in time. Late in the game your problem becomes having enough laborers to haul things around and help farmers with the harvest before crops spoil. I recommend getting your hunting and fishing on early and transitioning into farming as soon as your population can support a few extra guys doing that. It will eventually become the best way to gather food. Start the game by clearing an area you intend to use as your town center and use that wood to build enough homes for your initial settlers.-Keep wild areas preserved for the collection of game, herbs, gathered food, managed forrestry services and the like. To quote Teddy Roosevelt, ""we are not building this country not for a day"". Be mindful of locations where you might place quarries and mines when building your town and avoid building into land that could have been used for an exploitable resource.-I have seen people complain about production, I do not doubt they are running into inconsistencies however something to keep in mind is that production is determined by a number of factors, the most important being space and worker skill level (and education). A skilled worker can buld in a fraction of the time an unskilled worker will take and an educated worker works faster still (they must use whips in the Ivy League).-Mind your space certain industries require workable territory to function and piling in too many industries into the same area results in decreased  efficientcy. Putting too much housing and city structures together starts making it hard to get basic resources to people (the purpose of marketplaces) and get them out to work  (they start to get confused), so it's best to build several self sufficient civic areas interconnected by bridges and roads. with dedicated wild space for each.-Saving and reloading can save the life of someone who dies of a random event, but sometimes that 88 year old woodcutter is going to die no matter what you do (must be Groundhogs Day).-Play the tutorial. I fell asleep midway through the tutorial the first time (such fun) but it's really the best way to grasp the concepts of the game and get a feeling for the basics of survival.It's a fun game that doesn't really go anywhere (could say it lacks an endgame), but building a successful and bustling city out of nothing sure can be satisfying. Should you choose to buy it (it's well worth snagging on a sale) I hope you have fun with it and either way, best of luck to you.			"

												I now am busy with village number 4 after dying of twice from hunger and once from cold.Yes there is no war but there are PLENTY of other things that can kill your village: Hunger, Cold, Disease, Animal Attacks, Childbirth(yes, I kid you not!), Old age(trust me, when  you don;''t have enough kids, age kills you off!)Yes the game is zen as their is no war, but if you don't watch out you'll run out of supplies before you know it!Start slowly, don't build to many houses... come to think of it, don't build to much at once, you don't want them finishing the cemetary while everyone is waiting for the new farm to finish and give them the much needed food supplies.Building a small harbor(trade outpost) gives you access to livestock, seeds and all kinds of nice stuff. downside... you need to trade! there is NO money in the game, you want something then you better have something to trade.You never like UI in games? Well in Banished you get to choose waht you want to see, simply choose the info you want and drag it to where you want. Love the custimisation!Options: Well it supports DX11 (and 9c) and has a lot of graphic options, music ingame is amazing and of course lots of settings for audio tweaking as well. Oh and don't forget that all the hotkeys are custimizable! :DIf you like games like the anno series , simcity and sorts. Then it's a must buy.If you like indie devs, then it's a must buy: 1 dev gave us this great title, reward him by enjoying his game ;)If you hate the wave of bad games recently and lost all faith in game devs, then this is a must buy!Conclusion, This dev(yes, 1 guy!) has thought of so many details that this game kicks major AAA games buttuck.Look at all the pics, vids and other reviews and decide for yourself.After a LONG LONG time I can truly say that this game will keep me busy for a long time!

												Balance seems to be the most important thing in this highly enjoyable sim. You have a small band of refugees under your care that need everything from shelter to food. You are given the task to make sure they get the right resources from the right spots.And this can get really frutrating sometimes, because you never seem to have enough people for all the jobs that need to be done and never enough resources to get all the items you need.And then winter comes and your people start dying from the cold or from starvation... Or you didn't build enough homes and your village is slowly dying because not enough babies are born.But once you get some balance... it is just  worth it to see the seasons pass and to see your village grow.Absolute favorite 9/10			"

												Banished is a simple 'settlement-builder' game which, I imagine, will continue to take up many hours of my gaming-time. If you jump straight into the game without tutorials then you won't last long, but if you take the time to learn the basics then you will be set for building your cute little villages.Here, though, is the darker side – if you make a mistake in your planning, you can accidentally lead to mass deaths. Unlike games such as SimCity, there are serious consequences for your actions. For instance: in trying to build a Town Hall I soaked up all my iron resources, meaning tool production stopped, meaning my food supply plummeted, meaning a serious famine. A great game that every gamer should try, even those not used to the genre.  All I would ask for is OS X support.			"

												Really enjoying this game based on my experience so far. Intricate and relaxing game of micro-managing people and resources to slowly build a thriving settlement. Similar enough to games like Dwarf Fortress or UnReal World that simulation/management genre fans should be able to pick up and play, but originally styled enough to feel like a fresh experience.I have built up a small self-sufficient community, and am embarking on educating the children that are soon to be young adults. Compelling just watching the settlement grow through the seasons. The major part of the gameplay involves the balancing act of providing buildings and specialised jobs for labourers, thus increasing your production output, whilst ensuring enough resource production for the immediate winter - and for a growing population.I believe that the test of the gameplay in the future will be how luck factors designed to introduce challenges (such as disease and famine) are manageable with forethought and planning. If it's always doom and gloom with little way to mitigate failure, it may be that there's not enough longevity in the game. But I have no reason to suspect that at this point. It's been fun (and worryingly smooth sailing).I want to mention that the movable, informative (and yet unobtrusive) UI is fantastic and should be something of a benchmark for future games.			"

												Banished is a great and enjoyable game! However this game got me addicted and played it nonstop, when I looked at the time it was 6pm then next it was 3am! When I first started the game I was amazed with the amount of detail that the developers have put into the game. I got myself into the tutorials to get my elf a head start so I know what I was doing and get used to that basics, but that wasn’t enough! The game can be hard for some to get the grasp off so I do recommended reading some guides but others may find it easy and can play the game with no struggle.The sound quality is awesome!The Animation is awesome!The Graphics is awesome!Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the survival and to build they own town.

												This game might seem boring at first, but it's surprisingly addictive! :D I tried it on my hubby's computer once and I just had to buy it for myself.This game is fun, beautiful and challenging. It even runs on my laptop, yay! :P Every time I think my city has everything under control, something comes up (a natural disaster, disease outbreak, crop infestations...), so there's always something left to do. And if you ever do get bored, just take a look at the mods and a whole new world opens... :PIf you're into city-building games, this game is definitely for you! ⋆⋆⋆⋆⋆			"

												Balance seems to be the most important thing in this highly enjoyable sim. You have a small band of refugees under your care that need everything from shelter to food. You are given the task to make sure they get the right resources from the right spots.And this can get really frutrating sometimes, because you never seem to have enough people for all the jobs that need to be done and never enough resources to get all the items you need.And then winter comes and your people start dying from the cold or from starvation... Or you didn't build enough homes and your village is slowly dying because not enough babies are born.But once you get some balance... it is just  worth it to see the seasons pass and to see your village grow.Absolute favorite 9/10			"

												Banished is a simple 'settlement-builder' game which, I imagine, will continue to take up many hours of my gaming-time. If you jump straight into the game without tutorials then you won't last long, but if you take the time to learn the basics then you will be set for building your cute little villages.Here, though, is the darker side – if you make a mistake in your planning, you can accidentally lead to mass deaths. Unlike games such as SimCity, there are serious consequences for your actions. For instance: in trying to build a Town Hall I soaked up all my iron resources, meaning tool production stopped, meaning my food supply plummeted, meaning a serious famine. A great game that every gamer should try, even those not used to the genre.  All I would ask for is OS X support.			"

												Pros:-Sexy user interface-Balanced strategy, so you can build up your city multiple ways, with all of them being challenging but plausibleCons:-Gets repetitive once you figure out the best ways to get a city running. If you figure out the tricks to this game, you master it quick and it becomes kind've boring.-Limited late-game challenges. Your city can only improve so much, it quickly just becomes a task of making it larger/self-sustaining.-Natural disasters are whacky, some are just ridiculously easy to avoid, while others are so powerful you'd rather just start a new city than deal with recovering from one.

												This is one of the most incredible games I have ever played. Granted that I am new to the ""town builder"" surviver type game, but this game is SO good. The game looks good and has a good bit of depth. In fact, if you didn't do any study or watch any videos or read the Banished forums before you played, my guess is you would kill off your population several times before you figured it out. It's true that once you have a system in place, the game falls into place, but throw in a nasty tornado right when your town is finally stable? Things get very interesting. Buy it! Awesome game!			"

They look for food, go to work, and look to create new families in emtpy houses you need to provide.A lot of gamers seem to be looking for this kind of game as the steam charts show. Banished was made by one person. 3 years development.I can only dream of what this guy would do if he had a 40 man team in his back. Cause that's where the problem lies:After 4hours there is no new content. You can still expand your settlement, though it is just repetition of the same tasks.It is fun for some days though.If you like micro managing a settlement, give it a try.			"

Every now and again the fishing ports decide that fishing just aint for them and the herdsman decide that despite the full pen of chickens that they could harvest, they suddenly decide that they don't have a job and just stand around with thier thumbs up thier own♥♥♥♥♥ But hands down the worst part of Banished is the fact i can't stop playing it!!! Also people just have loads of kids and then they eat all your food and don't work, even though there are tons of chimneys to sweep (Historical joke.) Alternatively, nobody has babies and everybody just dies out. I hope they fix it because if they do it could be a great game.			"

												This game is inexplicably hard.  The strategies and pathfinding lack any form of reasoning.  For example, gatherer's huts, hunter's lodges, and fishing huts all produce more food per person than farm fields.  If that were in any way realistic, humans would never have moved towards agriculture.  The game boasts scenic, procedurally generated environments.  But, that is the extent of this game's shining points.  Resource gathering is as a whole is a painful and dreary process.  Moreso, however, maintaining reasonable levels of harvestable resources is nigh impossible.  Not to mention that once your town reaches a respectable size, citizens prefer to starve rather than path to the nearest storage barn.  Overall I would give this game a 3/10.  If you're looking for a challenging civilization builder, download Dwarf Fortress, it feels more complete than this game.			"

												Despite my thumbdown on this title, the game is good and has potential, the thumbdown is due to a few things that makes the game more or less unplayable.Its not crammed with tons of features, but it holds a few good ones which makes it possible not to lose the overview of things.However, the gameplay is completely ruined by the starvation bug where ppl suddenly start starving to death and theres nothing you can do about it.I have approx. 56 fishermen and 44 gatherers in a population of 250, then I also have some livestock, so basically, almost half the population is producing food, but still they all die from starvation.I was running the town with lots of foods and the stock continuously climbing and with no increase in population, but then suddenly ppl started to starve to death.I added in xtra gathers huts and a couple of fishing stations, took ppl out of the mines and quarry and put them into the food production units I just created and as those who already died didn't need to be fed, I was actually producing more food for even fewer ppl, still the stock of food were tumbling up and down between 500 and 1200 and ppl kept dropping like flies.Hopefully the game will become playable beyond a few hrs of progress some day, but until it does, its not worth investing too much time (or money) in as ur town will be doomed the minute u found it, its all a matter of how many hrs before the starvation bug kicks in.Theres also plenty of room for expanding the AI code to a level where villagers wont make stupid decisions, like one villager I watched, who were grabbing and dropping the same batch of iron in the same spot for 1/4 of an ingame year and when he stopped, he ran out and came back and started over again. :sigh:Also like some villagers might get stuck between buildings where they walk in to, but for some reason cant find their way out of again.Villagers will also vanish into the thin air from time to time with no warnings at all.You wont find out until some production drops massively or is completely halted, due to the fact that whoever worked the given productionunit, has simply vanished.It means that u have to actively monitor all productionunits by clicking each type continuously (one after another) in order to make sure they are up and running 100% and that part soon becomes VERY annoying, especially as u have to dig up replacement workers all the time.Implementing some feature that allows u to set automatic job assignments for the villagers by priority, would be a huge advantage here.Like if u want to have foodproduction set with top priority, so that when a worker within a foodproduction unit vanish, he will automatically be replaced by a worker from a lower priority productionunit e.g. coal mine, stone quarry or whatever u like.Then add in a notification when it happens, so that u are aware that a worker went from ""Mining"" to ""Fishing"".Combined or made with something like ""Automated job assignment"" where u can set the minimum and maximum amount of workers u want in any given line of trait, either so u assign a fixed number of workers or by percentage of the population.The feature shd be free of choice whether to use or not, as some ppl may actually like the micromamangement aspect in clicking single workers and giving them individual assignments.But if u want to try and grow a village to a more massive scale, that micromanagement may just become too tedious and even overwhelming and in that case, automation shd be a possible choice.

												A true city builder in that Banished is all about planning & efficiency. You could say playing Banished is ""Zen-like"" because there is no overbearing external pressures - you are merely massaging your production systems for optimal output. But don't rest on your laurels - there is the ever present slow burning drain on your resources - you consume resources to live and build. If you fail to plan ahead your town will wither away: because you didn't store enough food, tools, or materials. The first 100 citizens is an engaging challenge, but then it becomes repetitive - until you hit 300+ citizens when you start to struggle against the natural limits of expanding your large town. Banished was developed by one man, and while I praise his talent, I can't ignore the following issues. The trading mechanic is very basic, but that is 'ok'. There is no stupid combat mechanic like in the Anno series, which is 'great'; The variety of external threats is still pretty good. The production & building requirements are simple - which is bad, ok, or good depending on your love of complex systems (but this is a city builder game you are playing). In comparison to the Anno series, Banished is very basic in many ways. Banished doesn't have the huge variety like in the Anno series (crop variety is not real variety). In Anno 2070 there are many ways to optimise your production because of the intricate production networks you create - but this is not possible in Banished (because it is all AI determined) - but this may be a good thing you prefer your city to be easily understandable.I highly recommend Banished as a good introduction to city builders because of its almost elegant simplicity. When you get bored, which you may not, then try Anno 2070. "

												Banished is an amazingly built indie simulation game.  I say indie because it is built by Shining Rock Software which consists of one person.  He does everything from the art to the programming.  It is amazing what one person can accomplish.  Like it says on Banished’s own website the game is a throwback to the games that were played in the 90’s.  I am barely old enough to qualify to talk about those games, seeing as I was born in 1989, but even I can remember playing those early simulations games and loving them.  This game for me brings me back to those days when a Sim game of any sort could just waste away whole weeks of your time.  Whether it be Sim City or Sim Farm, those games were just the best.  And it wasn’t about the graphics or the immersion or anything that we usually talk about in games today, but it was about the fun factor.  The exploration and building of a little world that you created.Banished is also a neat little game that you can’t win, but only survive.  And because of that I think most people will find the game boring because there isn’t really much that happens.  You plan and build a little settlement into a town.  Hours upon hours go by if you are doing it right as your town grows.  Eventually you just run out of resources and your little ecosystem comes crashing down all around you.  The game however is actually very hard because if you “overexpand” the same thing can happen and lives will be lost so it is important to plan ahead.  All in all I can wholeheartedly suggest that everyone should try Banished.  With my current disappointment in Sim City, Banished fills that gaming whole for me and then some.  It is a great game to pick up and play between gaming sessions and on those “raining” days where you just want to sit around and play a fun simple game.			"

												This is a hard to master/high reward type of game. The goal is to keep your settlement alive, which is a lot harder than it looks. Keeping an eye on food, clothes, firewood, medicin, laborers, health and much more without failing is a real challenge, that's why I love the game.Unlike many other city builder games you have to keep track of everything that your city produces, and make sure the population has access to it. A single missing resource could create chaos or in worst case, kill off the entire village.When you have learned the basics of keeping your population alive, it's an amazing sight to see the villagers slowly build up the village into a huge city, if you can keep them alive...Pro:- A challenging & rewarding experience- Decent graphics & music- Tons of mods & new stuff with the steam workshopCon:- A bit repetitive after a while - Hard to learn and VERY punishing for mistakes- Bit lacking in vanilla content (workshop makes up for it though)			"

												This game gave me simple pleasure, the pleasant music and alluring nature of the environment lured me in from the get go. Then I experienced my first famine and from then on the game became a battle and it wasn't a battle for epic or for even moderate it was a battle just to be mundane and survive and I loved it!!Nothing was more satisfying than getting a town to survive long enough to have 200 inhabitants. However even then even when I had lots of food, plenty of clothes, abundant tools it can all go to hell in that precious few moments. 2 Bad winters and my people started to starve, you are never safe and this game requires 100% attention and 100% dedication but it is by no means boring.A game I proudly own.

												Jaide was the first baby born during the population crisis, a new hope to the town. After a couple years more children were brought into the world by the citizens and a new generation was secured. I accompanied Jaide's life closely, often checking on her in her parent's house near the gatherer's hut admist the forest.The girl became the first attendant to the village's school, a village where half the population was illiterate, years before any other child would come to attend. Graduated at 18, I was proud to see her become an efficient educated worker and help the others in their struggle to survive. One summer I was surprised to see that Jaide was no longer living with her parents, she had moved in with Dicki, a 16 year old still in school; they had a daughter of their own in that very season.The town hit it's lowest population of all time while Jaide was an adult, as the older folk were quickly dying of old age, but Dicki and his wife had 5 kids, all parts of the silver lining above the food shortage and low workforce. Years later another generation was finally reaching adulthood and the people started seeing better days.Jaide died in the autumn of '20 of old age. When the message announcing her death popped up my eyes shed a single tear.10/10			"

I think the price is spot on too - for what you're getting, it's worth the $20 (unless you got it on sale of course). There's a lot of replay value, and it does provide enough of a challenge without being too terribly overwhelming. So, yes, I definitely suggest getting this game if it's up your alley!			"

												Banished is a citybuilding game where you take a small group of people who were banished, and get them to make their own city. Key aspects of this are finding enough food to prevent starvation and not freezing in winter, as well as ensuring there are enough houses and resources to continue daily life. After that, it becomes mostly about growing effectively.It's a fairly simple game, with the graphics being one of the biggest positives. A simple hamlet with farms around it, serene and calm. Your village in winter with snow covering the roofs, and a bridge over the river occasionally used by a villager to get to the other sideBut you can find graphics at any screenshot. Lets talk gameplay - It is very simple for a citybuilding game, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing. You build houses to house a family, and they bring food and firewood there to not starve or freeze. You build workstations for them to work at, farms, smithies, gatherer's huts and many more. The few things such as huts are often bigger than their homes, but they can not live there. Everyone lives in a house, and you will be able to make roads to speed up their travel time to and from where they need to be. They all need a coat to keep warm, and a tool to keep their working efficiency up, and the children will need a school to get educated.Once you have your basics set up, you will find the trade depot to be expensive, and it will probably take you a long time to build. Along with needing to be on a river, so potentially quite far from your settlement depending on the randomly generated map. Once it is build, it will take a while for a happy merchant to arrive at your trade post as well, and when they do they may not sell what you need, or have an interest in what you're selling. Every merchant has their own list of things they buy and sell.The citizen AI is basic, but functional. And it uses a few tricks to make sure it doesn't get stuck in the absolute least efficient patterns. For details on how it works you can find the creator's blog and see how he made them move, and how he made them. Citizens move jobs and houses every now and then to cut down on travel times, and while this is helpful and possibly essential to keep the town as a whole running, it makes it so that every citizen is a jack of all trades. Your citizens are shallow, they do not have personalities or skills, they just do what you want them to do. They are just there to make sure things keep working. Sadly this makes it much less enjoyable to watch the citizens and think about how they would live, but it is neccesary to prevent a village from being an inefficient mess after a few years ingame.This is further compounded by the fact that villagers age several years in one game year, thus ensuring that you always have a steady stream of new children growing up and old adults dying of old age. It becomes difficult to find any attachment to your citizens.In the end, the one thing I realised about Banished is that all of this adds up to a lack of interactivity. Key in this was when a friend told me he accidently fast forewarded through an entire year in game, and nothing changed in his city. The main thing you can do in Banished is look at your city being developped, with only occasionally having to actually make a trade or designate new building sites. As limited as the game is, with workshop support it can be modified and you can add or change things in it. I would say this makes the game go from just alright to good, as this support means you will be able to fix whatever you don't like, add new buildings, and overhaul the game to be more to your tastes.If you mainly want to relax, enjoy a quiet hamlet with some beautiful scenes. This is the game for you, it looks great, and once you get past the first few winters there is little pressure and a lot of potential to do whatever you feel like. But if you're looking for an in-depth game where villagers have their own lives and skills within your town, or you want to be actively building and changing things while you play, you may want to skip it. It's a game to relax with, not a game to stress over whether or not the blacksmith you grew attached to gets enough firewood to survive the winter.			"

												This game utterly hates me.I've attempted at least 5 times to achieve a town population of 300+ (without building schools), and seemingly every time, it finds a way to screw me over near the 200 mark. Even with several mods making things easier. 1800 wood, 6 woodcutters spread across the map. I try to raise the limit of max firewood, and the production drops to little or nothing. Why? Who the hell knows. Everyone decides to begin dying of disasters at the same time. Child birth, rock crushing, etc.A fire breaks out, glitching my game, to where none of the towns folk move, at all. Standing still while their homes burn to the ground around them, rather than attempting to put it out. (Yes, this really happened.)The biggest success I've had so far was making a bridge so long that people began freezing before they made it across.And thus, I continue trying. -Sigh-Herpes/10 would fail of unknown reasons again			"

												Man this village I made is GREAT, it's self sustaining and has an average population and... wait... wait NO!!!!.....Well 2/3rds of my population is now dead thanks to a tornado.... awesome...For those who actually care about a review:Skipping all the bland details that every other review states I will simply skip to the most important part of my oppinion on Banished...The reason I decided that Banished was not worth a positive recommendation is simply put:After nearly 2 years of this games release, there have been very minor updates (Mind you ones that should have already been fixed before the game was even realised!); bug fixes (Holy jesus a lot!), gramitical errors, and crashes(a lot)...(I did my research)... And this thing called the ""mod kit"" got realsed and the dev kinda... poofed. Went from 5 updates a year to 1Lets face it, the dev kinda dropped this project and left it to the fans to finish for him... and unfortunatly unlike minecraft and other heavily fan influenced games, there was no major fan based game saving mods created. Banished has died. :(With such little replay value, as anybody who has gotten past the initial hurdle of surviving has discovered in this rediculiously tedious and challenging game. There needs to be more content for this game to be considered good by my standards.That is all.			"

IntroThe game type is not only sandbox, but a full sandbox game: indeed it lacks any type (really any type) of goal. The game genre is a strategic medieval city management with stunning graphics and it has (maybe) the better season system I've ever seen.Pros- 3D graphic and visuals are wonderful;- music is good also if there are just three or four songs and that's it;- season system is really realistic and well represented into the game;- in the first game the morale will be destroyed by death of a family member and the cemetery is used also to replenish it: it's totally realistic;- trade is another realistic thing: to me is ok but for someone could be too much 'real'.Cons- total lacking of plot and goals: just survive in a random generated land;- it gets repetitive: any scenario will force you to find the same configuration of buildings to survive (i.e.: forester+gatherer will be the first of your problems in any scenario also with food buildings). The total absence of research and progression in time will render the game just more repetitive: it's merely the same building after one hour of play and the same after twenty;- no campaign and no friend or enemies to interact with anyway no interaction at all with anyone;- after you've decided a scenario is done (because resource is limited or because you're satisfied or because simply you've no more building space) the only strong reason to play another one is a passion for the Steam achievements.ConclusionBanished with some more attention and variety could've reached the Olympus of the strategy games. Unfortunately the game is really survive and that's all. Apart from that this game reminds me the first in The Settlers serie: ok in 1993 graphics are not like that :) but the concept is the same. I abandoned The Settlers at the sixth level because I found it repetitive: any new scenario brought more or less the same challenges but at least they are masked with some interaction with enemies and a progression in difficulty. In Banished I felt the same sensation... at the first scenario: for me it's inconceivable to have the same let's say configuration at the first hour and at the tenth. Nothing evolves in Banished.So to appreciate or not this game depends on the type of player you're: I have limited time to play, I love plot, character/condition evolution, research, development and of course strategy. If you're like me, then you could find this game frustrating and maybe found something better to invest the limited time in.If you have plenty of time to invest in playing and you cannot sleep until you've obtained every Steam achievement in the universe, then definitely Banished it's for ya ;)			"

												This game is a waste of time. After 7 hours of gameplay, I have pretty much done everything with a population of 50. From here on. I'm supposed to build the same buildings over and over and over and over and over and over until the population becomes unstable? Sorry. I'm not into farmville. The trade system stinks too. I have more resources than ever necessary with multiple barns, a marketplace, and my trading dock is almost full with thousands upon thousands of inventoried items. When a trade ship comes, it brings nothing I ordered. I trade with them for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles cause they bring nothing, offer nothing, and nothing happens over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.Bah!			"

There is tragedy and hardship, but also, a kind of rugged, pastoral beauty.At the end of the day, it's just a wonderfully pure gaming experience.  A rare thing, these days.  For the price, it's more than worth it.  My hours played should speak for themselves.			"

IntroThe game type is not only sandbox, but a full sandbox game: indeed it lacks any type (really any type) of goal. The game genre is a strategic medieval city management with stunning graphics and it has (maybe) the better season system I've ever seen.Pros- 3D graphic and visuals are wonderful;- music is good also if there are just three or four songs and that's it;- season system is really realistic and well represented into the game;- in the first game the morale will be destroyed by death of a family member and the cemetery is used also to replenish it: it's totally realistic;- trade is another realistic thing: to me is ok but for someone could be too much 'real'.Cons- total lacking of plot and goals: just survive in a random generated land;- it gets repetitive: any scenario will force you to find the same configuration of buildings to survive (i.e.: forester+gatherer will be the first of your problems in any scenario also with food buildings). The total absence of research and progression in time will render the game just more repetitive: it's merely the same building after one hour of play and the same after twenty;- no campaign and no friend or enemies to interact with anyway no interaction at all with anyone;- after you've decided a scenario is done (because resource is limited or because you're satisfied or because simply you've no more building space) the only strong reason to play another one is a passion for the Steam achievements.ConclusionBanished with some more attention and variety could've reached the Olympus of the strategy games. Unfortunately the game is really survive and that's all. Apart from that this game reminds me the first in The Settlers serie: ok in 1993 graphics are not like that :) but the concept is the same. I abandoned The Settlers at the sixth level because I found it repetitive: any new scenario brought more or less the same challenges but at least they are masked with some interaction with enemies and a progression in difficulty. In Banished I felt the same sensation... at the first scenario: for me it's inconceivable to have the same let's say configuration at the first hour and at the tenth. Nothing evolves in Banished.So to appreciate or not this game depends on the type of player you're: I have limited time to play, I love plot, character/condition evolution, research, development and of course strategy. If you're like me, then you could find this game frustrating and maybe found something better to invest the limited time in.If you have plenty of time to invest in playing and you cannot sleep until you've obtained every Steam achievement in the universe, then definitely Banished it's for ya ;)			"

												Banished is a citybuilding game where you take a small group of people who were banished, and get them to make their own city. Key aspects of this are finding enough food to prevent starvation and not freezing in winter, as well as ensuring there are enough houses and resources to continue daily life. After that, it becomes mostly about growing effectively.It's a fairly simple game, with the graphics being one of the biggest positives. A simple hamlet with farms around it, serene and calm. Your village in winter with snow covering the roofs, and a bridge over the river occasionally used by a villager to get to the other sideBut you can find graphics at any screenshot. Lets talk gameplay - It is very simple for a citybuilding game, but that is not neccesarily a bad thing. You build houses to house a family, and they bring food and firewood there to not starve or freeze. You build workstations for them to work at, farms, smithies, gatherer's huts and many more. The few things such as huts are often bigger than their homes, but they can not live there. Everyone lives in a house, and you will be able to make roads to speed up their travel time to and from where they need to be. They all need a coat to keep warm, and a tool to keep their working efficiency up, and the children will need a school to get educated.Once you have your basics set up, you will find the trade depot to be expensive, and it will probably take you a long time to build. Along with needing to be on a river, so potentially quite far from your settlement depending on the randomly generated map. Once it is build, it will take a while for a happy merchant to arrive at your trade post as well, and when they do they may not sell what you need, or have an interest in what you're selling. Every merchant has their own list of things they buy and sell.The citizen AI is basic, but functional. And it uses a few tricks to make sure it doesn't get stuck in the absolute least efficient patterns. For details on how it works you can find the creator's blog and see how he made them move, and how he made them. Citizens move jobs and houses every now and then to cut down on travel times, and while this is helpful and possibly essential to keep the town as a whole running, it makes it so that every citizen is a jack of all trades. Your citizens are shallow, they do not have personalities or skills, they just do what you want them to do. They are just there to make sure things keep working. Sadly this makes it much less enjoyable to watch the citizens and think about how they would live, but it is neccesary to prevent a village from being an inefficient mess after a few years ingame.This is further compounded by the fact that villagers age several years in one game year, thus ensuring that you always have a steady stream of new children growing up and old adults dying of old age. It becomes difficult to find any attachment to your citizens.In the end, the one thing I realised about Banished is that all of this adds up to a lack of interactivity. Key in this was when a friend told me he accidently fast forewarded through an entire year in game, and nothing changed in his city. The main thing you can do in Banished is look at your city being developped, with only occasionally having to actually make a trade or designate new building sites. As limited as the game is, with workshop support it can be modified and you can add or change things in it. I would say this makes the game go from just alright to good, as this support means you will be able to fix whatever you don't like, add new buildings, and overhaul the game to be more to your tastes.If you mainly want to relax, enjoy a quiet hamlet with some beautiful scenes. This is the game for you, it looks great, and once you get past the first few winters there is little pressure and a lot of potential to do whatever you feel like. But if you're looking for an in-depth game where villagers have their own lives and skills within your town, or you want to be actively building and changing things while you play, you may want to skip it. It's a game to relax with, not a game to stress over whether or not the blacksmith you grew attached to gets enough firewood to survive the winter.			"

												This game is a waste of time. After 7 hours of gameplay, I have pretty much done everything with a population of 50. From here on. I'm supposed to build the same buildings over and over and over and over and over and over until the population becomes unstable? Sorry. I'm not into farmville. The trade system stinks too. I have more resources than ever necessary with multiple barns, a marketplace, and my trading dock is almost full with thousands upon thousands of inventoried items. When a trade ship comes, it brings nothing I ordered. I trade with them for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles cause they bring nothing, offer nothing, and nothing happens over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.Bah!			"

												Banished, a city building game that not only makes you want to build a city and have it self-sufficient, but to push the boundaries with labourers. This game tests your managing skills and your ability to work out what you need and when you need it, to keep the city going. Banished is based in an era where technology is not around, so farming, tree cutting, tool making and other similar jobs are done by hand/humans. This make the game simple by there being no upgrades, however for your city to grow, you need to build more houses so the people of your town can reproduce growing your adults population which in turn creates labourers which you can use to set a direct task i.e. farmer or blacksmith, or simply leaving him/her as a labourer to collect stock from the areas around your town coal/iron etc. By evolving and building up your town, you need to make sure that it has sufficient food wood/coal to survive the winter. This game is based on seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter, Spring) which is broken up into 3 sections early middle late. Surviving before during and after winter is one thing, but to survive with enough food for your town during all seasons, or being able to help the sick, or even put out fires is a constant battle. This game make take an hour or two to understand, and you may wipe out a town in a process. But this is the Banished experience. Every person play this game differently, and it is great to see how people setup their towns if you buy the game as it is only $20 and play a few hours you too will enjoy this game.			"

												It's simple. It's no Dwarf Fortress, maybe more of a cross between Sim City and the Anno series, just without the complex spreadsheet-based gameplay of either. There isn't a lot of variety in the gameplay, even the maps are simply ""How much does it rain/snow? How much impassable mountains are there?"" and with both the inability to pick where you spawn and how fast you kick the bucket if you don't set up immediately means you're just stuck with whatever the game starts you out on. Once you do get started, though, it's mostly twiddling your thumbs and trying to set up constant resources while hoping you actually get people.But, despite all that, it really isn't a bad game. This review was made when it was first released and it's being actively developed, so circumstances could change. If it's on sale or you have a itch for this sort of game you can do much worse.			"

												The game is completely ruined for me by utterly abysmal AI. I just can't handle the stupidity of the townsfolk. It makes the game very difficult to manage but for the completely wrong reasons... For example:- Out of four houses in my town, two houses would be starving and the other two would have way too much food than they needed. This was purely because certain townsfolk would get to the food first and take it all for themselves. Even though the two houses that were starving were actually closer to the food source. - People would completely ignore that fact that they were starving and let themselves die. Going to work when they should prioritise feeding themselves. And even leaving their starving new borns at home to die. These problems quickly resulted in a downward spiral of death and labour shortage. Further resulting in a completely dysfunctional town. I tried to play three times. This happend everytime and I gave up in total boredom. Yes I haven't played for very long but regardless of time played the AI would not change it's behavior.			"

												Try as I might to actually like this game it is far too unbalanced to be what it claims. Love the graphics and most of the relaxing feel when everyone is working, but with the sudden swing that comes when some of the eldely die and housing becomes available away from a person's actual job it eventually screws you... With no way to designate one service as a higher priority it is beyond frustrating to have everyone starve in no time because the citizens decide to travel to the furthest location available for the same job.

You'll fail a few villages at first but after a couple of hours, once you've learned how to balance food production with population, you'll have built every building and from then on its a simple case of building more homes and more farms to support your booming population.If you're expecting a simplified graphical Dwarf Fortress this isn't it.Wait until it gets a big discount sale.

												Hillbilly Sim 2014 should be the title. Seeing as there is no influx of population from any outside source other than a set of 4 families, inbreeding is bound to be a foreseeable problem at later years in this game. Genetic malformations, learning disabilities, and at some point, everyone's bound to be each other's cousin. I suppose it's all fine and dandy if you don't think about it. Anyways, down to the review. This is an amusingly solid game for its ""Beta"" stages. You can go about playing it several different ways. From watching your young group of settlers survive the harshest winters and storms, to seeing as your decisions have made them thrive as they prepare to fight off the Red Coats after throwing their tea into the harbor, or gaze in awe as every single last one of them dies from starvation, child birth, cold, and a number of random events, and know that this massive loss of life was due simply to your own incompetence. If you would like to commit mass genocide of a people by depriving them from the food they have harvested, and the wood they have chopped. Watch as their frozen malnutritioned corpses drop! The possibilities are endless!Content: 7/10Despite it having many choices, the lack of Native Americans raiding my village was rather disapointing. User Interface: 10/10 You can be a minimalist, or clutter the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your screen with stuff. Visuals: 6/10Well polished, but not enough detail when your favorite townie dies at child birth.

You have to run your whole colony, from setting up the first houses and letting the couples mate to planting your first crops and butchering your first animals. there is wood to chop, waters to fish and lodging to build. Later nomads will come to your city looking for shelter. Beware they carry disease sometimes. I was accepting them all the time and then got a sick batch that killed my whole village. All in all it's a fun challanging game, definately a time eater as I easily lost track of time and spent hours on my little peeps.			"

												If you like city building games i can highly recommend Banished. Its lots of fun and a real challenge to keep your villagers happy en well fed over a period of time.You start out with a few family’s gathering resources and building your homes, but be prepared winter is coming and she isn’t going to be mild, so make sure you have warm clothes and enough food in your barn. Also as a player make sure you are warm and well fed because Banished is going to claim allot of your spare time making the best community for your people and I am sure you will enjoy every minute of it. This is one of the best city builders I played in a long time!			"

												there are two main things I must say about this game that sway my decision of this review, but there is one bad thing that really must be addressed when it comes to the AI in this game. We will start with the good things. :)1. Great Time Waster (In a good way) - I have spent a few good hours of my life playing this game and to be honest if someone asked me if they should buy it, I would grab them by the collar of their shirt and ask really loudly, ""WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?!?"" before quickly dragging them to their computer to buy the game. Mainly I remember sitting at home waiting for my friends to show up which wasn't for another three hours, so I decided I would play Banished until they got there, not four hours later I finally noticed my friends had been sitting in my living room downstairs for an hour waiting for me. So yes if you need to pass time quickly get this game, just be sure to set and alarm if your like me and lose track of time.2. A Glorious Challenge - I can't stress how much of a challenge this game can be even on easy if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ seed you will have your hands full trying to keep all your settlers from dying of starvation, hypothermia, or just plain sadness. But starvation leads me to the one issue I have with this game.THE ONLY CON IN MY OPINION IS THAT THE AI ARE A BUNCH OF RESOURCE HOARDING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!I have had multiple games fail due to one family of settlers taking 75% of all the food I had for themselves leaving the other 85% of my population to fight over the reamaining 25%. Frankly this has stopped me from playing this great game and it really peeves me that this one thing with the AI is what kills the game for me. If I had the time or capacity to mod this game, it would be a rationing mod so I can set up what people take from the barns I would honestly have no bad things to say about this game.I hope this helps those of you looking to get this game and if you do get it, holy hell best of luck.

												This is not one of those city building games where new houses generate citizens or instantly trade goods for food and keep your city survive, no sir.It starts boring. Small group of people in need for survival. There are no villas, condominiums or luxury houses, just wooden and stone houses.No epic research projects and buidlings to make. School, church, hospital, tavern, townhouse, that's all you have. You need forester and woodcuter for logs and firewood. Hunters, gatherers and farmers try hard to provide you food, fighting with harsh weather.Later you start with making some tools for better work quality.You rarely find someone to trade with you, and you trade only the neccessities.Hours are passing (of course, you speed up time max), you somehow reached population of 100 citizens. Everyone is happy, well fed and not cold. You even accept nomads so they can fill up empty work places.Man, this is so easy and too boring!You build more, just for fun. Yes, you've played too many city building games and you know every tactic, nothing can gone wrong.Twenty minutes later, you are screaming like Homer Simpson...endlessly. WHY ARE MY CITIZENS STARVING, I HAD MORE THEN ENOUGH FOODS A FEW MOMENTS AGO! STOP DYING PEOPLE, I COMMAND YOU, NO NO! WHAT DISEASES, I HAVE HOSPITALS! YOU ARE COLD, WHERE ARE YOUR PANTS YOU TOOK FROM TAILOR'S!? DON'T YOU DIE ON ME! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!The liveliest part of your carefully created town...is now a graveyard.And you press New game...again. "

												The game is very much a balancing act where your most important resource is your citizens. The citizens have their own names, houses, families, and places of work. They have children who grow up, go to school, then join the workforce. They grow old and die unless something else catches them first. There are many ways to lose citizens and that's where you come in. They need food, they need shelter, they need clothing and firewood for warmth; they need medicines and balanced diets for health. All of these needs are met by industries set up by you, the player, and you must manage your workforce effectively. You may build a dock and conduct trade for the things you need. There is no currency, you trade items you need for items you have in surplus of equal value. Natural disasters are in the game if you so choose. Tornadoes, fire, disease, crop infestations, early frost, among others.If you like the idea of micromanaging on a small scale that eventually becomes a large fine tuned machine, or a chaotic train wreck of despair then this game is certainly something to pick up. There's plenty to discover and tweak just right to keep you trying new things.			"

												This is certianly just as much a survival game as it is a city builder, don't expect for the city to run itself ~ your population will constantly be in flux and so will their needs. I highly recomend this game and find it alot of fun managing a growing town and trying to keep it stable. Number one tip is: keep building houses early game! Children wont move out unless there is a new house for them to start a family. Number two tip is: concentrate on stable year round food sources first (fishing, gathering, hunting) and don't overlap two of the same (two fishing, two gathering etc) circles! or they'll produce less.

												Banished is a fun and interesting city builder once you get the hang of it. Despite the riveting negative commentary that nearly persuaded me to give this game a pass I am certain I'll be playing this for quite some time. Comments about the game lacking content are completely unfounded in my opinion (besides, pong and asteroids didn't need content to be fun.)The overall command system is fairly easy to master, and the ""micro-management"" referred to by many is actually just assigning jobs to citizens (some of the comments made it sound like they had almost no autonomy) and ensuring you have everything they need to survive and thrive. Yes, your townsfolk will starve if you neglect to plan ahead, but I was able to keep my food stores full on my first try just by anticipating the worst. Think sustainability, and don't grow too quickly, and you'll be in for a great gaming experience.			"

												Banished is a game about managing HUMAN RESOURCES.Just because you have farms doesn't necessarily mean that the farmers are working every day of the year.  This means micromanaging your farms so that all your farmers are productive farmers from spring through autumn and firing them all to abuse them as extra labor for other more pressing needs like construction projects and basic laborers or even having them work the quarries and mines.At some point, you can forgo the micromanagement and focus on the more pressing matters such as how your city is laid out.  Designing a city with good layout is very difficult in this game owing to the geography but getting to a population of 500+ is entirely possible.Planning expansions is also important to the survival and welfare of your city because if your expansion is one fully zoomed out screen away from the nearest point of civilization, your citizens will DIE from starvation or the cold.  Timing your expansion is also important.I wish my citizens were smarter about getting food from the marketplace right next to them instead of running two fully-zoomed out horizontal screens from one end of the map to the other only to die from starvation... despite my having 40k food stocked in multiple barns and marketplaces spread all over the city.Oddly enough, these issues really haven't distracted me from the game.  That said, I still consider this game to be far superior to last year's DRM City.			"

												First up - I am growing to hate this game! It is strangely, one of the most frustratingly fun/addictive games I have played in a long time. I hate it, because substantial hours of my life are going to be devoted to playing it! The premise is this - you start off with 4-6 exiled/wandering families (from where we don't know/care) and it's your job to help guide them into starting their new life together. There's no specific time periiod given (to my knowledge) but it's when people used wells to put out fires so it's a few years back in history! You have to build the town from scratch, while at all times making sure your villagers have enough shelter, and food (and not just one food either; this isn't one of those games where everyone can live off fish for eternity, you gotta mix your meat with your fruit and veg to maintain health in the long term). This is where the problems start!  There is no researching buildings. You can build whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want, as long as you have the materials to do so. However, you have to use some advance planning in your head because while you're trying to figure out the precise place to put your town hall, one of your families may be starving or freezing to death because you haven't built a house or assigned enough fishermen/gatherers to maintain your food stocks. You also have to be careful with your raw materials because once those trees are gone, it's going to take a few years to grow new ones. Sometimes, your fatal flaw is just bad luck when a tornado comes through and tears through your cattle farm - now you have to plan for a harsh winter without the meat you were counting on! Banished is the game every other city-building sim wants (and should aspire) to be in my humble opinion. It is not an exciting game by any means - you won't be set upon by wolves or Orcs and there is no set objective, except to help your villagers live a long and prosperous life, but once you get a good township going, he sense of achievement speaks for itself! It is city building in it's purest form!			"

												This survival game is awesome if you havent picked it up then i suggest you do as this is a must have for your steam library you start the game off with a small population of villagers and you have to help that population grow by keeping them alive and fed. In Banished you will find that to keep your villagers alive you will need to make sure they are well fed by growing crops, fishing and even hunting but when it turns winter then everything changes as your crops stop growing so you need to find another way of grabbing food not just that but you will need to keep the villages happy and alive by keeping them warm aswel so alot of firewood is needed. This game can start off hard at first but it does seem to get easier as time goes on if your a fan of suvival / city builder type of game then this is straight down ur street..Pros+ Survival+ Graphics+ Hours of Fun+ ChallengesCons- Bit BuggyOverall Score: 8 / 10			"

												A charming, simple little game that will keep you busy for ages. It's pretty tough, and can be quite unforgiving but having a village/town that you've grown from the ground up, even getting to know your villagers a little, is really rewarding. It's a village management game that isn't afraid to throw you some horrible decisions (Should I keep my villagers warm or feed them?) and can certainly pain a pretty bleak picture if you throw yourself into it hard and fast - but if you take your time, cultivate your village with care, and treat it like the fight for survival it is, then I think you'll enjoy it.TL;DR - tough as nails, survival-heavy, highly rewarding. Save often.			"

												An excellent game. For those who have enjoyed games like SimCity, this is the game for you. Dont expect to survive for too long though. And keep 2/3rds of your entire population collecting food for the winter. And then make sure you have a woodcutter and logs to chop ready for winter. And then make sure everyone is housed. And then make sure there isnt too few children (otherwise you lose workers as they oldies die) or too many children (or everyone starves). If youve got all that, and youve managed to get on top of every other little thing that stands in your way then something else will ensure your downfall. Still either you win or try again.			"

												This game could be a FANTASTIC game if they would fix the system where every villager takes as much food as possible and shoves it in their mouth to where eventually this leads to rapid death and starvation. For example I had a town and after trying everything possible I just made a bunch of fishing huts and two farms. When I looked at the inventory of a house I saw that they hade every ♥♥♥♥ing peice of fish in the game. They had over 400 pieces of fish! I looked and saw this was the same case throughout all the houses. In the end everyone died of starvation. I don't like that if you are short on one material that it leads to your ultimate demise. So maybe the creator could make it so villagers did not take so much food. Or maybe you get more materials so you don't die. Right now I give this game a 7 out of 10. But if they fixed it I would make it a 9 out of 10.So after playing this game once again after an update or two I thought they would change the AI so they didn't take the world's population of food and ♥♥♥♥ themselves in the♥♥♥♥♥by having a Thanksgiving feast in every home every night so they don't have♥♥♥♥♥♥for food two days later. I noticed it was slightly better but not much instead the population of my town caught autism while looking for a settlement. When you want♥♥♥♥♥♥built where there are trees the builders 40% of the time will stick their tumbs in their asses and walk around staring into the sun and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves instead of do their ♥♥♥♥ing jobs. Leading to an exhausting effort to get these♥♥♥♥♥♥heads to move their asses. Many seasons later the ♥♥♥♥ing structure is built but it is too late because 75% of your population has died in that time. #♥♥♥♥YOUBUILDERS. I wish the builders would build the structures in the order I ordered them to be built in instead of doing the one that is closest. Who am I kiding I just want a guarentee that they will build at all. Also I would think that a fishing hut would produce as or as close to as mush as a hunters hut. No that would make too much sense, if a hunter kills one ♥♥♥♥ing deer it is given 100 but if I have 4 fishermen fishing they get around 40. In what ♥♥♥♥ing universe does a deer give anywhere close to 100 meat. I should expect that considering every household eats 3000 potatos. The pathing also sucks. If I build a road I expect the people to use the road. Instead they waltz through the grass when there is a road right beside them. The name of this game should be ""Autismville"" and the description should be ""If a group of Autist engore themselves stand idle and die"". I swear ants function better than these ♥♥♥♥ers. This game needs an AI fix and balanced. I played the game exactly like the tutorial and still failed. I wish I could successfully play this game once in my lifetime. I am changing my rating to an ""OW I AM DYING OF STARVATION"" out of ""WAIT I AM SUPPOSED TO BUILD♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.			"

												I absolutely love this game. The music is awesome, and the visuals are satisfying :) If you're a citybuilder/maintenence lover like me you're going to enjoy this game. If you never really enjoyed sim-style games like this you might be a bit disappointed.  However there are a lot of cool mods you can install and try as well that give the more experienced player a challenge. The developer updates every month or so, and last I heard he made the entire game himself! Which speaks volumes to his dedication to the players and the game.			"

												This game is one of the few games I can fully recommend. For being a game developed by one man, Banished is amazingly polished. All mechanics work pretty gosh darn well. The soundtrack is beautiful. The only thing I could wish for is for the job assignment could have more depth. I like this game because it doesn't try to be another game. Banished is totally its own thing, no zombies, no shooty shooty bang bang, just a nice medival city sim that is worth every penny I paid to play it. 10/10			"

												It's been favourably compared to dwarf fortress. It does have the same issue of being a bit dull if things are going well. The long term gameplay becomes dependant on the map gen screwing you just enough that you're always trying to beat some supply shortage to stop your villagers from expiring hilariously through starvation or exposure.

												Banished is a fun and interesting city builder once you get the hang of it. Despite the riveting negative commentary that nearly persuaded me to give this game a pass I am certain I'll be playing this for quite some time. Comments about the game lacking content are completely unfounded in my opinion (besides, pong and asteroids didn't need content to be fun.)The overall command system is fairly easy to master, and the ""micro-management"" referred to by many is actually just assigning jobs to citizens (some of the comments made it sound like they had almost no autonomy) and ensuring you have everything they need to survive and thrive. Yes, your townsfolk will starve if you neglect to plan ahead, but I was able to keep my food stores full on my first try just by anticipating the worst. Think sustainability, and don't grow too quickly, and you'll be in for a great gaming experience.			"

												Summary: Lots of fun for a city-builder, definitely worth 20 USD.  Took me 50 hours of playtime to get all achievements.Long Version: You remember the rabbit in Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a lot like that.  You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.Banished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.My laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.  And yet, humanity persevered and thrived.It's a game filled with subtleties and harsh lessons, but definitely worth playing!			"

												What is there to say about Banished that has probably not been said already?First, and foremost, Banished is a City Builder based upon the premise that you are in charge of the survival of the people. You tell them where to harvest resources and place buildings. What buildings to build and what jobs they must fulfill. This is not a necessarily easy game as it relies upon someone being able to predict the effects that the seasons will have upon your food as well as how many workers will you lose much less gain.Banished is, for the most part, one of the most realistic city builders that I have seen but I am also the worst to ask about city builders. I've only ever played SimCity, the old ones, and never really took the time to play the newer SimCities [I have a strong dislike for EA]. It touches a part of me that favors the more Medieval period of our history and plays true, for the most part, to how people would live during that time period. This, of course, means you have to handle diseases that would come from the risk of trading with other civilizations or groups. Realism is also pressed farther by the chance that you might hunt deer to extinction or fish the rivers clean. Crops require rotation to keep the soil going and the list goes on.....The good parts of this game are also, perhaps, the parts I dislike the most however. When my village [As just happened while typing this review] decides to begin starving to death because I never took them to school there is no stopping the constant downward trend. I can place almost every villager I have upon food gathering but it doesn't make a lick of a difference until my once 80 people population turns into 26.  Those 26 also never seem to recover but I'm going to let them continue as my village also just caught fire because of someone apparently attempting to roast a roach [That is my guess, not part of the game].Should you buy this game? Yes. If only to support the one man team that put work into deveolping a realistic city builder that will create just as much joy, and pain, as it does for me.			"

												This game is hard , very hard but that is where it shines. Even on easy it's hard. It challenges you to keep trying , keep trying again and most likly you will fail but it makes you play it again , to try again and learn and it rewards you .  This isnt SimCity and dont treat it like it or the game will not be nice to you .            The indie dev team deserve a lot of credit for this . The graphics are good and the soundtrack is excellent . Now with the addition of the steam workshop the mods available makes the game even better, while not needed , they add dept to an allready great game . In conclusion   if you like city builders this is a great game which needs a bit of thinking for every little action you take . Never expand too quickly or you will die . Thats my golden rule when playing this game .			"

												First of all, if anyone tells you that this a nice relaxing building game, they are wrong. This game can be extremely hard (even on easy difficulties) especially to begin with but once you get the ball rolling and have a nice, stable town… my God… it’s so satisfying.Although this game is hard I still think that this is one of the best games that I own and I am so glad that I bought it. It’s extremely addicting and I find it really hard to put down.Pros:-	Easy to control the camera-	Easy to understand-	Complete control as to what you build-	The families grow by themselves-	Fun to laugh at some of the stupid names this game has for these people-	Lots of control with the difficulty settings (disasters etc.)-	FEEL LIKE A GOD!!!!Cons:-	You might find yourself yelling at you screen going “HURRY UP AND MAKE BABIES YOU FU**S!” like I do…..-	Can be really hard-	Not good for people who can’t be very patient-	Once you do get a lot of food etc. people die of old age :( "

												This is a good game. Now it's not for everyone but I liked my time playing it and it's low spec requirements make it a nice laptop game though it is a mouse heavy game so i would not use the mouse pad for this one.It feels polished and thought through. The mechanics are clear but simple to understand. It's not hard to grasp and get into. My first game went really well. The wiki and other sources are a must to master this game but anyone can pick up this game. It is a micromanagement game and you're always setting yourself short term, medium term and long term goals and that's what brings you back. It's a puzzle unfinished that is waiting for you to solve it. It is a shame that there isn't more trade because i would have liked to farm alot and trade for leather, stone, coal and iron. In the game traders come too little and carry to little for a town to be held up by trading and because you could trade 1:1 for most things it didn't feel like you were part of a larger economy but that trading was a mechanic to prop up some aspects of the game. That said i'm sure i just need to find a mod that addresses this issue.The moding comunity is cleaver and thriving in this game so if you get bored with the vanila like game then you should look for a mod to add new mechanics goals, end game towns and challanges.

												This is certianly just as much a survival game as it is a city builder, don't expect for the city to run itself ~ your population will constantly be in flux and so will their needs. I highly recomend this game and find it alot of fun managing a growing town and trying to keep it stable. Number one tip is: keep building houses early game! Children wont move out unless there is a new house for them to start a family. Number two tip is: concentrate on stable year round food sources first (fishing, gathering, hunting) and don't overlap two of the same (two fishing, two gathering etc) circles! or they'll produce less.

												I have found inner peace with Banished. This is the city-building simulator I have been dreaming of. Yes, there aren't as many options as I would like, and yes, it still needs some patching, but it is completely worth the price. This one man has managed to create a better product than sim city and release it at a near-bugless state.The game isn't very difficult for me, and the lack of difficulty may be a turn off for people. This is more a sandbox city builder. You are always trying to improve something, however, whether it is building placement, food and resource management, or population growth. It is worth it to build a big beautiful town and watch it go to work			"

												Hillbilly Sim 2014 should be the title. Seeing as there is no influx of population from any outside source other than a set of 4 families, inbreeding is bound to be a foreseeable problem at later years in this game. Genetic malformations, learning disabilities, and at some point, everyone's bound to be each other's cousin. I suppose it's all fine and dandy if you don't think about it. Anyways, down to the review. This is an amusingly solid game for its ""Beta"" stages. You can go about playing it several different ways. From watching your young group of settlers survive the harshest winters and storms, to seeing as your decisions have made them thrive as they prepare to fight off the Red Coats after throwing their tea into the harbor, or gaze in awe as every single last one of them dies from starvation, child birth, cold, and a number of random events, and know that this massive loss of life was due simply to your own incompetence. If you would like to commit mass genocide of a people by depriving them from the food they have harvested, and the wood they have chopped. Watch as their frozen malnutritioned corpses drop! The possibilities are endless!Content: 7/10Despite it having many choices, the lack of Native Americans raiding my village was rather disapointing. User Interface: 10/10 You can be a minimalist, or clutter the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your screen with stuff. Visuals: 6/10Well polished, but not enough detail when your favorite townie dies at child birth. Overall Score: 8/10 I give this game my blessing. Do give this dev your money.			"

Haven't enjoyed a game that much for ages.Compared to other games like Tropico4, SimCity or CitiesXL, this is the only game in which yourvillagers are significant. They aren't just a funny gimmik, or implemented just for fun -a child dieing of starvation is like a butterfly effect. The game doesn't need Tornados or Vulcanosto get you into panic-mode. The chaos is omnipresent, but silent. You will start to think like""meh... damn..(10 minutes later).. OH...DAMN!"" You don't make a mistake and get a popup-message a nanosecond later.If a guy gets crushed by a rock, he's dead. And you will notice that.I have to admit that I would love to have a multiplayer, too, but, to be fair, I can see why there isn't one.

												The premier medieval city administration simulator. I think that says it all. This is not really a standard city builder. You basically spend most of your time manageing your citizens and making sure that they survive. There is no porgression or tech, you just start out with 20 some odd buildings and a virgin land to settle in. The fun of the game is really in figuring out how produce enough food/tools/clothes/medicine/etc to prevent everyone from dying. After that initial phase it is then about seeing how large you can get your city. There aren't any massive building projects and the game really lacks on aesthetics. You spend most of your time carefully placing buildinds, watching your supplies, and managing how many people are in each profession. If that sounds interesting then it's deffinately worth the buy.

												Of all the city building games, this one may be one of the more basic games out there. It was a low budget indie game, but it does a ton of things right. As you play through the game and build your town up, you're faced with a ton of problems. The world is harsh, and food is scarce. As your population grows, so too does threats of diseases and harsh winters. There are various resources that must be constantly harvested, hunted, or gathered year round. The changing seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall affect the way your crops grow, and if you are too slow with planting and harvesting, you may find your town collapse.One of my favorite games from 2014.

												I thought it was just a simple sim management game with adorable tiny structures and people. I was really wrong.My first playthrough was full of rage quits and depression from disasters and unfortunate events that kills your village growth.But then I realised that it is how to recover from each disaster is what make the game special. If the village is totally hopeless, I'll start a new one and learn from previous mistakes. Then I started to try to achieve the achievements one at a time and it was a very rewarding gaming experience. I totally recommend this game if you have the patience.			"

												This is an interesting sort of game that at first glance might seem like another city builder. It's rather a simulation of the struggle to survive.There's a couple ways to play the game and one is to read a guide and spoil the entire process or simply endure a lot of failure so that you better understand it. Given that I rather enjoy games that thrive on the later, I've been quite content with the purchase of this game. I saw a lot of complaints from people that suggest they ""figure it out"" and then become bored, but now I realize that realistically that would require them to reroll the map to get better conditions for themselves and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. I've failed a half dozen times , learned from my mistakes and adjusted only to realize my strategy was being formed around being able to place fish immediatly or some similar ""best way to start"" scenario which I suppose is a possibility towards a better way to ease you into learning, but for a long term solution on playing the game as it's presented to you, not so much.I've noticed a few issues with roads and pathfinding (they will ignore roads and take a straight path in a lot of cases), but it's intended to fixed in a later patch. Also was  times where I feel like I had to be a bit too explicit with commands and often people still might not do exactly as I tell them, but once I learned how the game wanted you to go about this, it became less stressful. That's kind of the point of this game though. You have a lot of control and freedom, but it's very evident this game knows what it wants from the player and you will have to give it that attention. It also takes a ton of preimpetive planning and not understanding the result of what you just set in place may bring the learning curve up a bit until it all sinks in. I welcome that kind of thing though.Given most building games are meant to be some kind of peaceful endevour where you stack blocks and watch plants grow, it's nice to finally see one that embraces a bit of a harder-edged attitude. It's slightly rough around the edges in a few areas, and I feel like the UI is working against certain aspects, but for it's price and considering ONE person developed this, it's a solid recommendation from me if you are looking for a builder game that has a bit of roguelike curve to it.

												It´s authentic and hardcore. I like it.Ever thought Anno was to easy? Well then try out Banished, seriously, on normal settings it´s even hard to keep your people alive and away from starvation, which is not your only enemy. This is really hardcore and there are enough variables to make it hard enough. This game punches you in the face when you think you´re finally achieved a structure. I really enjoy it but just recommend it to people who are searching something like a hardcore expierence which can be much more challengin than Anno. Otherwise you will get frustraded all the time, because this game easily wipes out your hole town in minutes. That means you got to retry a lot.But I still enjoy it, it´s the experience i was searching for.			"

												Banished is a wonderful take on the classic ""civilization building"" game that creates a beautiful mix of survival and expansion that isn't seen much in modern games!I would recommend this game to my own grandmother, as it is that fun. If you like Sim City, Tropico, or any other ""build your own town"" game, then you will love this!One problem I've always had with this genre of games is the obnoxious problem of budgeting expenses, as I would always end up in debt somehow. Banished takes the time period of the piece (ranges from rennissance town to early American settlement, your choice) and only asks that you use natural resources to live. No fumbling money, no need to trade (if you're good), and no worrying about debt.The game boasts beautiful graphics, simple yet challenging gameplay, and an infinite amount of possibilites.Heres a little rundown of the game: -- You start by creating a town, and there are map seeds in case you like a certain area you've played before. You can choose a difficulty which will dictate how much stuff you start with. Weather/climate, disasters, and other changeable aspects  are all modified before entering the game. When all of that is done, you're entered in, and depeding on what difficulty you've chosen, you must start building certain buildings. Simply cut tree's and stones to gather resources, assign villagers to certain jobs and balance out what is important until your population begins to expand. There is an automatic birth/death cycle constantly going on, so your population will eventually increase. Eventually, you can designate hunting areas, farming areas, and much more (trading, fishing, herbalists, woodcutting, tailors, blacksmiths, teachers, etc.) Keep building until your town suits your style, and is sustainable!The game is great! I would recommend you buy it when you get the funds (as 19.99 is a great price for the content you get).Here, have some pros/cons:PROS--Great simulation with climate, seasons, weather, disasters, health, and much more needed to be watched over to ensure survival-infinite amount of ways to go (you can literally build many different towns on the same map)-A+ Graphics-Simple yet challenging-Awesome tutorials that make it easy to get in and go-Large amount of content-No money to deal with! Trading is done through material bartering-Good time period for this kind of simulator-Overall: A+ Fun, Great concept, infinite replayablilty, and always changing gameplayCons:- As of right now I have not found any at allFinal Rating:10/10Beautiful game with an awesome concept and great execution! I would like to see some DLC in the future to expand on the concept!  "

												Banished is a willage building sandbox simulation set in medieval era. Feels like a mix of Cultures, Stronghold and ANNO series, except there is no combat involved. But soon, you will realize that there are more dangerous things than armed enemy approaching your carefully designed willage. Things like aging of your citizens, whom after death have to be replaced, otherwise there will be no production and most of your people will die. Vicious and unreliable weather which WILL now and then freeze the soil and prevent your farmers from planting new crops in early spring. Yes, and the same weather which will insidiously freeze your crops in autumm, thus preventing the farmers from harvesting those few left shrunken potatoes. The potatoes that you were praying for all summer to be last chance of feeding your starving population. Logically there is no escape from starving so most of your people will die. What's next ?. Yes..Does your food production relie on those lazy hunters ? Bad luck ! deers have moved on the other side of the map so there is a slight possibility that your people will die. Nice ! a merchant has arrived to the city ! He sells sheep and chicken ! Quiclky bulid some space for them to multiply ! Now there is a nice herd and is succesfully reproducing itself and providing your population with some meat resource... But look ! what's that green cloud over there ?! Is it a death cloud from Baldur's Gate ? Yes it IS !!! Now in Baldur's Gate it could kill a Boss Dragon.. so.. yeah,, you get the picture... Banished is good and addicive game. It has quite simple logic : you just have to let your people multiply and keep them alive, that means happy and healthy. The circumstances that cause your people to die are well balanced. In a while you will be able to guess the chance of your stonemasons to be killed by a falling rock, or your other citizens to freeze to death because of lack of a firewood. Yes you did't cut enough trees to survive the winter ! But don't worry you can always train some foresters so there is someone taking care of planting new trees. If you like detailed and production systems you will be in heaven when seeing your chicken farms producing not only eggs but also fresh meat from chicken above limit. Yes, you can easily set a number of chicken allowed in the pasture by draging your mouse on the scrollbar. All other chicken gets slaughtered generating a meat income. Also sheep are fun, and aditionally they produce wool for making warm clothes. Really nice is the possibility to combine resources to make more valuable and more durable versions of a standard products like clothes and tools, and if your barns are overflowing with equippment you can always sell it to a merchant and buy for example new seeds or animals. Just bear in mind that there is lots of events that will randomly change your resource flow, one year making you rich of food because of a good harvest and the other year losing third of your population just because yo have sold your food to a merchant expecting the weather and harvest to be as good as the last year.I would recommend this game to players with adiction to simcity, anno, cultures and stronghold games. Just don't expect it to be a walk in the park.			"

												This game is utterly amazing. To think that just ONE guy could create such a complex and amazing game ALL BY HIMSELF just blows my mind. I was so excited for this to come out, tracking it's progress and feeding my addiction of loving this game with YouTube lets plays. This is by far the best choice if you're looking for a game where you just build. There are wars or zombies. Be warned though, this game is no walk in the park. You constantly battle the weather, your population fluxuating, and random disasters. All in all, this is a game worth at least checking out. It's $20 and already better than games that are $60 and took a team of 20+ to produce. Definitely recommend!			"

												I am having a lot of fun with this, trying to build my civilization and keep them alive and prosperous. Be careful one plague can wipe you out. I the fartherest I have made it is year 245 before plague took me down. You have to run your whole colony, from setting up the first houses and letting the couples mate to planting your first crops and butchering your first animals. there is wood to chop, waters to fish and lodging to build. Later nomads will come to your city looking for shelter. Beware they carry disease sometimes. I was accepting them all the time and then got a sick batch that killed my whole village. All in all it's a fun challanging game, definately a time eater as I easily lost track of time and spent hours on my little peeps.			"

												there are two main things I must say about this game that sway my decision of this review, but there is one bad thing that really must be addressed when it comes to the AI in this game. We will start with the good things. :)1. Great Time Waster (In a good way) - I have spent a few good hours of my life playing this game and to be honest if someone asked me if they should buy it, I would grab them by the collar of their shirt and ask really loudly, ""WHY THE HELL HAVEN'T YOU BOUGHT THIS YET?!?"" before quickly dragging them to their computer to buy the game. Mainly I remember sitting at home waiting for my friends to show up which wasn't for another three hours, so I decided I would play Banished until they got there, not four hours later I finally noticed my friends had been sitting in my living room downstairs for an hour waiting for me. So yes if you need to pass time quickly get this game, just be sure to set and alarm if your like me and lose track of time.2. A Glorious Challenge - I can't stress how much of a challenge this game can be even on easy if you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ seed you will have your hands full trying to keep all your settlers from dying of starvation, hypothermia, or just plain sadness. But starvation leads me to the one issue I have with this game.THE ONLY CON IN MY OPINION IS THAT THE AI ARE A BUNCH OF RESOURCE HOARDING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!I have had multiple games fail due to one family of settlers taking 75% of all the food I had for themselves leaving the other 85% of my population to fight over the reamaining 25%. Frankly this has stopped me from playing this great game and it really peeves me that this one thing with the AI is what kills the game for me. If I had the time or capacity to mod this game, it would be a rationing mod so I can set up what people take from the barns I would honestly have no bad things to say about this game.I hope this helps those of you looking to get this game and if you do get it, holy hell best of luck.

												One of the rarer marks of a quality game is that it will always draw you back. And this has drawn me back many dozens of times.While difficult to master it's rewarding when you step back form your multi-hundred populated town, remembering the first few shivering families who just about made it through their first winters.Check out the workshop too! With many content mods there's many new buildings and professions to bulk out your town, and those are beautifully modeled and fit in perfectly			"

Should you start with seeds and a heard of animals to help feed your banished brotherin? or are you going to face the unknown with nothing but a few hunters and gatherers?And how harsh will the winters be?

Every little detail about the game is interlinked; for example - you can welcome Nomads to boost your towns population and workforce, however; if you do not have enough food stocked up the instant increase in population will deplete your food limit and people will start to die of starvation. I would definitely reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys world-building games but I also find it is an accessible game to those who aren't so familiar with similar games. Definitely reccoment.

												Banished is a fantastic indie city simulator, or maybe town simulator. The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign. That said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant. But until new content shows up, you can always just start a new city and deal with a whole new set of challenges.8/10			"

												So I have put 100 hours into the game so far and I'd have to recommend it if you are looking for a RELAXING game.  It may start hectic at first, but eventually you learn that speed multiplier is your long-time friend.  A bit of a learning curve for settlement management, but trial and error is a wonderful instructor.  If you have trouble here's a few hints:PAUSE the game early on while you place your initial layout, editing as you go along, and pause each build.  You can then activate each one 1-2 at a time when you restart the game.TRACK all your core resources closely (iron, stone, logs, firewood, and food). Lack of firewood or food WILL kill you.BUILD at a pace.  Do NOT have multiple open build projects active at once.  Prioritize and only have 2-3 at a time going.TOWN HALL will bring in nomads, if your health/happiness is above ~50% TEACH your people ASAP with a school.ALE and religion will raise happiness, CEMETERY will keep it steady.DEVELOP a variety of food sources, and learn how to use them for secondary benefit (wool, leather, ale, TRADE)RELAX... get comfortable and take an interest in thoughtful development.ROADS are an utter waste of time while active builds are going.  They may also divert your builders from more important work.PLAN your settlement out in advance.  You can designate buildings and FREEZE their resource demands and builds for later on (mines, quarry, bridges, tunnels, markets, trader, town hall, etc).EXPLOIT your terrain.  Plant trees in open areas, and place associated resource gatherers within the AoE. (hunter, herbalist, gatherer, maybe even a woodcutter and small stockpile).SEND me a message, or a question, and I'll do my best to help you out.  I give this game a 9/10.  -1 for unminimizeable windows, an apparent non-exponential population growth to population ratio, and use of text in game that borders on beyond too small)			"

Despite the limited nature of this type of game... the strategy is brutal and unforgiving.There is a lot of replayability as long as you don't rage easily when 8+ hours of gameplay get ruined by poor early planning.If you like city builders, and are open for some lovely gameplay and new strategies... give it a shot.

It challenges you to keep trying , keep trying again and most likly you will fail but it makes you play it again , to try again and learn and it rewards you .  This isnt SimCity and dont treat it like it or the game will not be nice to you .            The indie dev team deserve a lot of credit for this . The graphics are good and the soundtrack is excellent . Now with the addition of the steam workshop the mods available makes the game even better, while not needed , they add dept to an allready great game . In conclusion   if you like city builders this is a great game which needs a bit of thinking for every little action you take . Never expand too quickly or you will die . Thats my golden rule when playing this game .			"

												This is a peaceful, relaxing game.  No combat, no soldiers, no defenses, no conquering what-so-ever.  The game primarily focuses on resource management, especially food management.  You grow your city at your own pace, fast or slow, doesn't matter.  The traders come very rarely at first which is a bit of a milestone.  From them you can purchase seeds, livestock, food, etc. in exchange for your own goods.  Not all traders have the same thing.  One might have peach seeds while the next 5 might have coats and leather.  I've played games that take years before I get livestock.The visuals, ambient music and sound effects, are all pretty good.			"

												First of all, if anyone tells you that this a nice relaxing building game, they are wrong. This game can be extremely hard (even on easy difficulties) especially to begin with but once you get the ball rolling and have a nice, stable town… my God… it’s so satisfying.Although this game is hard I still think that this is one of the best games that I own and I am so glad that I bought it. It’s extremely addicting and I find it really hard to put down.Pros:-	Easy to control the camera-	Easy to understand-	Complete control as to what you build-	The families grow by themselves-	Fun to laugh at some of the stupid names this game has for these people-	Lots of control with the difficulty settings (disasters etc.)-	FEEL LIKE A GOD!!!!Cons:-	You might find yourself yelling at you screen going “HURRY UP AND MAKE BABIES YOU FU**S!” like I do…..-	Can be really hard-	Not good for people who can’t be very patient-	Once you do get a lot of food etc. people die of old age :( "

												This is a good game. Now it's not for everyone but I liked my time playing it and it's low spec requirements make it a nice laptop game though it is a mouse heavy game so i would not use the mouse pad for this one.It feels polished and thought through. The mechanics are clear but simple to understand. It's not hard to grasp and get into. My first game went really well. The wiki and other sources are a must to master this game but anyone can pick up this game. It is a micromanagement game and you're always setting yourself short term, medium term and long term goals and that's what brings you back. It's a puzzle unfinished that is waiting for you to solve it. It is a shame that there isn't more trade because i would have liked to farm alot and trade for leather, stone, coal and iron. In the game traders come too little and carry to little for a town to be held up by trading and because you could trade 1:1 for most things it didn't feel like you were part of a larger economy but that trading was a mechanic to prop up some aspects of the game. That said i'm sure i just need to find a mod that addresses this issue.The moding comunity is cleaver and thriving in this game so if you get bored with the vanila like game then you should look for a mod to add new mechanics goals, end game towns and challanges.

												The most addicting game I've played in a long time. It's a really simple concept, but it has so many intricacies that tie you into the game. No enemy factions of any kind to threaten your survival, just you and your villagers. After having all of my villagers get to age 80 with no reproduction to be had, some old couple managed to pop a couple babies out and keep the dream alive. Unfortunately, the 10 new babies that managed to make it into adulthood all died the same fate at the haunted woodcutters lodge. Everyone died to trees crushing them. The village was doomed. 10/10			"

												An unexpected gem! For some reason the post game-session steam advert grabbed me, my first reaction was 'ooh, that looks nice.' Not being a real city builder fan I had my reservations about making a purchase. I usually enjoy big AAA action blockbusters (and KSP) and with big AAA let downs of this genre like Sim City, I was thinking what could ONE guy do to better that. I was so, so wrong. There's no enemys and once you get through your first few winters, an established, working town can thrive pretty easily even on hard difficulty but there's a simple beauty to this game that grabs you straight away, from the music to the brilliant aesthetics. It's hard to comprehend how one man found such a perfect balance. Granted the pace is slow but it's extremely addictive. You develop an attachment with your citizens and township which is great. I'm expecting big, big things from this game when the mod kit is released.			"

												I've been having a fantastic time with this. It's a nice break from other city building games, but you have to adhere to a careful balance of food and production versus population-- take in a group of 20 nomads and before you know it half your town has died of starvation from a downward spiral composed of a tool shortage, farmers dying off before anyone else and leaving your crops to rot in the fields, thus more starvation and less food production. Commerce is a little shallow, but there's room to grow.			"

Took me 50 hours of playtime to get all achievements.Long Version: You remember the rabbit in Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a lot like that.  You start off with this cute little bunny of a village, then all at once, it lunges for your throat and leaves you bloody and beaten.Banished is full of ripple effects:  Everything's running smoothly and you feel confident in building another house?  20 years later, because of that extra house, everyone is dying of starvation, freezing to death or dying of diptheria.My laborious little laborers have been trampled, stabbed, plagued, frozen, crushed, drowned, burnt, swept away, and one lucky teacher went batshit crazy.  And yet, humanity persevered and thrived.It's a game filled with subtleties and harsh lessons, but definitely worth playing!			"

												Banished is a fun and interesting city builder once you get the hang of it. Despite the riveting negative commentary that nearly persuaded me to give this game a pass I am certain I'll be playing this for quite some time. Comments about the game lacking content are completely unfounded in my opinion (besides, pong and asteroids didn't need content to be fun.)The overall command system is fairly easy to master, and the ""micro-management"" referred to by many is actually just assigning jobs to citizens (some of the comments made it sound like they had almost no autonomy) and ensuring you have everything they need to survive and thrive. Yes, your townsfolk will starve if you neglect to plan ahead, but I was able to keep my food stores full on my first try just by anticipating the worst. Think sustainability, and don't grow too quickly, and you'll be in for a great gaming experience.			"

												Banished is a fantastic indie city simulator, or maybe town simulator. The game is challenging, it doesn't hold your hand through every step, so you get a sense of accomplishment as your city grows. There's no advisors or missions telling you what to do next, which is a refreshing change. Balance plays a critical role as you decide what to build and try to keep your growing population warm and fed. Grow too fast and there won't be enough food for everyone, chop down all the trees and you won't have resources for the future. Every decision is important as you weigh the cost of the resources you use up and the workers you'll have to assign. That said, there is a point in the game where you have done most of the things available to you and gameplay can get stagnant. But until new content shows up, you can always just start a new city and deal with a whole new set of challenges.8/10			"

												When I first played Banished, I greatly underestimated the numbers involved. Its not like a traditional simbuilder where you just keep an eye on income, but you have to keep an eye on literally everything your villagers do. It has a decent learning curve though and it is a very good example of ""trial by error"". It takes a few attempts to get a good village going, but you shouldn't let that stop you from trying again and again. It's very rewarding to notice you keep doing better and better at the game.One final important piece to notice though is that this game will start to lag the larger your town becomes. Some people with bad computers will notice a slowdown after 500 inhabitants, I noticed a huge lag/slowdown at 1000 inhabitants. I recommend just playing on a medium map.Dont expect a thrilling story or objectives and goals. This game only has two goals: expand and survive. It's a great game ""to pass time"".			"

												My thoughts on Banished...This game has been produced by a single person, so first off congratulations on such a tough task!Banished is a city/town building game which combines survival elements found in many recent games. It has a vast array of building types, jobs for citizens and can be extremely engrossing.Graphically this game looks wonderful, small details here and there offer the world a lot more depth. Colours looks fantastic as seasons come and go, caking the landscape in snow or lush green hills.The tutorial lays everything out for a newcomer to the series, though making sure you complete every single one provided is key to success. Lastly this game includes mod support and some mods that the community has cooked up are really interesting but NOT required to enjoy this game since the vanilla version is extremely well done.Props to the developer and i look forward to future DLCs for games you release.10/10			"

												Of all the city building games, this one may be one of the more basic games out there. It was a low budget indie game, but it does a ton of things right. As you play through the game and build your town up, you're faced with a ton of problems. The world is harsh, and food is scarce. As your population grows, so too does threats of diseases and harsh winters. There are various resources that must be constantly harvested, hunted, or gathered year round. The changing seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall affect the way your crops grow, and if you are too slow with planting and harvesting, you may find your town collapse.One of my favorite games from 2014.

												This is an interesting sort of game that at first glance might seem like another city builder. It's rather a simulation of the struggle to survive.There's a couple ways to play the game and one is to read a guide and spoil the entire process or simply endure a lot of failure so that you better understand it. Given that I rather enjoy games that thrive on the later, I've been quite content with the purchase of this game. I saw a lot of complaints from people that suggest they ""figure it out"" and then become bored, but now I realize that realistically that would require them to reroll the map to get better conditions for themselves and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. I've failed a half dozen times , learned from my mistakes and adjusted only to realize my strategy was being formed around being able to place fish immediatly or some similar ""best way to start"" scenario which I suppose is a possibility towards a better way to ease you into learning, but for a long term solution on playing the game as it's presented to you, not so much.I've noticed a few issues with roads and pathfinding (they will ignore roads and take a straight path in a lot of cases), but it's intended to fixed in a later patch. Also was  times where I feel like I had to be a bit too explicit with commands and often people still might not do exactly as I tell them, but once I learned how the game wanted you to go about this, it became less stressful. That's kind of the point of this game though. You have a lot of control and freedom, but it's very evident this game knows what it wants from the player and you will have to give it that attention. It also takes a ton of preimpetive planning and not understanding the result of what you just set in place may bring the learning curve up a bit until it all sinks in. I welcome that kind of thing though.Given most building games are meant to be some kind of peaceful endevour where you stack blocks and watch plants grow, it's nice to finally see one that embraces a bit of a harder-edged attitude. It's slightly rough around the edges in a few areas, and I feel like the UI is working against certain aspects, but for it's price and considering ONE person developed this, it's a solid recommendation from me if you are looking for a builder game that has a bit of roguelike curve to it.

												This is not one of those city building games where new houses generate citizens or instantly trade goods for food and keep your city survive, no sir.It starts boring. Small group of people in need for survival. There are no villas, condominiums or luxury houses, just wooden and stone houses.No epic research projects and buidlings to make. School, church, hospital, tavern, townhouse, that's all you have. You need forester and woodcuter for logs and firewood. Hunters, gatherers and farmers try hard to provide you food, fighting with harsh weather.Later you start with making some tools for better work quality.You rarely find someone to trade with you, and you trade only the neccessities.Hours are passing (of course, you speed up time max), you somehow reached population of 100 citizens. Everyone is happy, well fed and not cold. You even accept nomads so they can fill up empty work places.Man, this is so easy and too boring!You build more, just for fun. Yes, you've played too many city building games and you know every tactic, nothing can gone wrong.Twenty minutes later, you are screaming like Homer Simpson...endlessly. WHY ARE MY CITIZENS STARVING, I HAD MORE THEN ENOUGH FOODS A FEW MOMENTS AGO! STOP DYING PEOPLE, I COMMAND YOU, NO NO! WHAT DISEASES, I HAVE HOSPITALS!

												It is a pretty nice game. It seems to be difficult at begin but after few hours you get the tricks and can have a got start then, even on hard conditions. The interface is easy to operate so you don't have to search for anything too long. At some point you will make your actions automaticly.In some aspects, this game is unbalanced (e.g. amount houses needed for population to grow with population that exceeds 300 citizens or getting enough firewood for that population). I am not going to say that those are bad, becuase I couldn't handle it. I suppose in reality it could be the same. You have to think in order to let the town grow smoothly and if you are too lazy to think, just try again :PThe disasters which can destroy your town are awesome. I had a town with about 350-400 citizens and tornado had struck it. As you can predict almost everything have been destroyed. I have lost about 80% of population citizens left so I had to build everything again. I haven't done that but I loaded the previous saved game in order to avoid waisting additional time.			"

												The game is very much a balancing act where your most important resource is your citizens. The citizens have their own names, houses, families, and places of work. They have children who grow up, go to school, then join the workforce. They grow old and die unless something else catches them first. There are many ways to lose citizens and that's where you come in. They need food, they need shelter, they need clothing and firewood for warmth; they need medicines and balanced diets for health. All of these needs are met by industries set up by you, the player, and you must manage your workforce effectively. You may build a dock and conduct trade for the things you need. There is no currency, you trade items you need for items you have in surplus of equal value. Natural disasters are in the game if you so choose. Tornadoes, fire, disease, crop infestations, early frost, among others.If you like the idea of micromanaging on a small scale that eventually becomes a large fine tuned machine, or a chaotic train wreck of despair then this game is certainly something to pick up. There's plenty to discover and tweak just right to keep you trying new things.			"

												Extremely well done peaceful survival/city-builder simulator.Few words of warning: It is paradoxically better to start with harder starting conditions, otherwise you can easily overspend/overexpand your initial stock and then end up with broken economy.Great, clear and aesthetically pleasing graphics, nicely connected and thought-out industries, good artiffical intelligence, working trade system, and MOD support!

												I've been following this game for a while and it hasn't let me down!  This is a village/town builder.  There are no monsters to worry about however you face starvation, inclimate weather, disease, and a variety of accidents.  I started my first game and got pretty far before everybody died from a tornado.  I've tried to start a few other settlements and starvation killed people too early.  I'm going to have to try another approach.  If you like city builders, definitely check this out!UPDATE 2/25/14:After playing a few hours longer I'm finally getting my population up and I have a large store of food.  I'm building more houses to encourage population growth.  I'm on year 38 I think right now and I'm spreading out my town a bit more.  This game keeps getting better and better!			"

												This game is utterly amazing. To think that just ONE guy could create such a complex and amazing game ALL BY HIMSELF just blows my mind. I was so excited for this to come out, tracking it's progress and feeding my addiction of loving this game with YouTube lets plays. This is by far the best choice if you're looking for a game where you just build. There are wars or zombies. Be warned though, this game is no walk in the park. You constantly battle the weather, your population fluxuating, and random disasters. All in all, this is a game worth at least checking out. It's $20 and already better than games that are $60 and took a team of 20+ to produce. Definitely recommend!			"

												Pretty solid city building game. There are still some bugs tho as many reviewers pointed out which is sad given that this isn't one of the billion ""early access' [read: paid beta] games that seem to be overtaking Steam these days. Yes I had some crashes, some really odd villager behavior, etc but overall it is still a solid game. The only real problem I have with it [aside from the bugs which I'm sure will get fixed with time] is that having a ""flat"" tech tree with all buildings open at once... really gives you not a lot to strive for. There also sadly are no building upgrades aside from upgrading a wood house to a stone house which seems like a missed opportunity given the detail and thought put into this game and its systems.

												This game was made by just one guy, but the immersive gameplay and great graphics are qualities you could expect from a full dev team. If you are looking for a casual city builder, where you can build monuments to proclaim your glory, then don't play this game. Your citizens are locked in a gritty struggle against the elements, feverishly trying to produce as much food as they can before the harsh winter sets in. If you neglect a single aspect of your town, starvation sets in and the death toll climbs. There is no such thing as taking a break in this game. Neither is there any taking a break FROM this game. I bought it the day it came out, and I haven't been able to stop playing since. This is truly one of the most addictive games I've ever played. To see my storage barn full of enough food to last the winter is the greatest feeling in the world. So too is seeing my citizens survive more than one winter.			"

Now i am going to put some idea's in here i think the game could improve with.Butchers to process meat into sausages etc, A Mill to proceed wheat and corn to flour,Baker to proceed flour to bread, some new animals - Pigs, Horses, Bulls, Wolves, Bears.hunters could kill these animals with Bows,Carts would be a great idea for use when moving more Materials.this game doesnt need combat the challenge is in the elements.this is a great game though and i will be happy to be part of the game for years to come.Carpenter would be a great idea also			"

												This survival game is awesome if you havent picked it up then i suggest you do as this is a must have for your steam library you start the game off with a small population of villagers and you have to help that population grow by keeping them alive and fed. In Banished you will find that to keep your villagers alive you will need to make sure they are well fed by growing crops, fishing and even hunting but when it turns winter then everything changes as your crops stop growing so you need to find another way of grabbing food not just that but you will need to keep the villages happy and alive by keeping them warm aswel so alot of firewood is needed. This game can start off hard at first but it does seem to get easier as time goes on if your a fan of suvival / city builder type of game then this is straight down ur street..Pros+ Survival+ Graphics+ Hours of Fun+ ChallengesCons- Bit BuggyOverall Score: 8 / 10			"

												An excellent game. For those who have enjoyed games like SimCity, this is the game for you. Dont expect to survive for too long though. And keep 2/3rds of your entire population collecting food for the winter. And then make sure you have a woodcutter and logs to chop ready for winter. And then make sure everyone is housed. And then make sure there isnt too few children (otherwise you lose workers as they oldies die) or too many children (or everyone starves). If youve got all that, and youve managed to get on top of every other little thing that stands in your way then something else will ensure your downfall. Still either you win or try again.			"

I don't want to give away too much but you start with a small group of people. You have to manage supplies like food and firewood. Your village only grows when you build houses. Build too quickly and your people will starve through the winter. Build too slowly and your village will die of old age.			"

This game is HARD, forget what you played in Sim City, you will find yourself restarting numerous times untill you get it right, in my case load was my best friend. It's really a calm game, the only thing you will fear are the low food reserves, untill you understand what to do of course. It's very addicting, and the maps are HUGE. You will indeed be sitting there a few hours, scratching your head as to why your citizens are dieing but that's what fun about it! For the few hours I have played this, I can say that this will be one of my few favorite games in the long run, if you're really into strategy / City Building, than this is the game you need. Very enjoyabl, and very well made.			"

												A very good city-building game. It can satisfy your city-building genre need and having pleasure while doing so. Very good graphic and nice challenge with the climate requirement. However the game is not without flaws. The game lack upgradability, which mean once you built something, there's not much left to it. If your eager is just to build everything on the build list, you'll have it all in few hours. Thankfully, there's a large mod which added lots of craftable building to the list. The game, however still lack the quest/challenge to push you forward, even with the mod. In short, it's like Anno series in sandbox mode.If you're the type of person that lost interest once you reach the stable city build, play the game with the hardest mode. This way, you'll spend more time learning and perfecting your planning, instead of just spending 3-4 hour build everything the base game has on the list.			"

												I bought ‘Banished’ expecting a hard but fair addicting micro-oriented management game, but what I ended up with was a game with too many short-comings to fulfil my hopes. The game isn’t addicting enough as it doesn’t offer enough involvement from the player at the start and turns into macro-supervision later on, reducing one of the key elements of its identity: the slightly personalised workers and the organisation of families. Worse, actually setting up a successful town shows just how little the game has to offer as there are no clear ends or goals at that point in the game.But let’s start at the beginning. ‘Banished’ is a management game about trying to successfully establish a small village in difficulty conditions, and providing for the people living in it through the satisfaction of their basic needs and caring for their happiness.‘Banished’ has a feeling of a low-budget game, hence the price, making the best of its ideas but lacking in overall polish. The biggest flaws concern the game’s goal, which is basically none-existent, and the overall difficulty which can be rather easily overcome. Polish-wise, the user-friendliness is disappointing: no alt+tabing, the user interface is full of grey (and doesn't fit the tone of the setting) but also, like many if not most game of this genre, in the explanation of the gameplay. That new houses are required to split existing families (even though there is still enough room in the original homes) to create new ones to increase your population is only one of the small information titbits missing from the tutorial. Further on, the game lacks a visually distinctive identity. It’s not graphically impressive and every building has already been seen before, creating a feeling of Deja-Vu. It’s a shame because I like the setup, -the idea of banished families banding together and trying to make the best of it while living mostly self-sufficiently-, but the game never actually goes further with this idea, doesn’t try to expand on it beyond the simple name of the game, and perhaps the necessity to buy seeds and livestock before growing farms.The personality of the game is further let down by its musical score, as the music, -which I usually truly enjoy in management games, and is quite important as that genre generally demand a commitment of long hours to get going-, feels just lacking altogether: it’s neither memorable nor setting up an enjoyable mood. Same goes for the other ambient effects of the game, which are best turned off if you don’t want to hear the constant bleating of sheep. Trying to give your villagers more personality with randomly generated names is a nice touch, but it doesn’t really amount to anything, although it can be fun to find some people at the job you would least expect, like the town eldest of 79 years working alone in the quarry. But those points are just nit-picks. The main problem I have with ‘Banished’ is that the game doesn’t offer a challenge or a real goal beyond “survive”. What is there to do after you have taken a successful start? Survive a fire? Sure. A tornedo? Been there, done that. A tornedo and a fire? Yes, that too. Once successfully set up, it is rather difficult to be completely decimated, even if setbacks are still a possibility, they are nothing that can’t be fixed with a little patience. The game just isn’t challenging enough in the long run, once the mechanics have been understood and that knowledge successfully applied in game. There are some achievements, true, but that’s not really my cup of tea, especially since the starting setup is the same and repetition can’t be avoided. Even at ten times the game speed, I was already growing weary of the game, as waiting for resources to be collected is the main part of ‘Banished’, leaving little to do for long periods of time. The micro-management parts don’t require much attention and don’t offer much to do anyway as resources are collected for your next projects, while the macro-management parts don’t invest the player as goods become abundant. I did enjoy a few points of course, the game isn’t bad, it’s completely functional and has mod support. I do like the idea of not being taxed, ie. that buildings have no running cost, apart from requiring a villager to operate obviously, and also that every trade requires a barter and so on. I do enjoy the forest lodges, actual caring for a forest, -and thus having a great synergy with other buildings requiring trees to work-, while also giving a regular income of wood. The game has some specific mechanics but it is not enough to set it apart and make me want to play more of it. After less than twenty hours, and playing a game on the harshest and rockiest settings, I feel like the game has nothing more to offer, which might be alright for the price tag for some. I didn’t find mods to spike my interest either, and those are a gamble anyway. Like so many of the starving/malnourished villagers, I couldn’t help feeling hungry for a little bit more here.			"

												First off, the AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Secondly, their retardation manages to keep them alive for surprisingly long.Citizens are selfish, they hoard ALL the food that they can while others starve to death. That aside, the game is surprisingly fun albeit frustrating from time to time. The game can also be very difficult (it is highly likely that your first town will not succeed or be very unstable and wobbly before failing altogether). The game is time consuming and very stretched out, but like I said it does offer a challenge and I can reccomend this game despite its minor faults.			"

												I have absolutely NO REGRETS purchasing this. An odd - yet beautiful - blend of complexity and simplicity. Unlike most city-building rts games, Banished focuses on survival; there's no money involved. At all. You start from scratch, work your way up by living off the land, and eventually you'll be able to barter your resources for other resources.This game requires proper strategy and management. And since there's no single permanent map, scarcity and abundance of resources may vary with each map seed.Here's a very basic 'what to do' list for this game:> name your town> live off the land> make sure your citizens do not freeze to death or die from starvation> grow!9/10 - 9 because the way the game changes from one season to the other seems a bit too quick for me. Though overall it's an impressive game.			"

Until you accidentally build one too many houses, your population slowly starts to starve as it consumes more food than it produces, freezes because there aren't enough coats or firewood, gets a disease that sweeps through the villages (thanks Mr. Boat Trader guy!), and is cleansed by fires that people can't put out fast enough because they're starving, freezing, and sick!

												Banished is, at it's very basic core, a city-builder. That being said, it would be better to call it a ""Town-builder""; instead of games such as SimCity where citizens are given in the thousands, and their well-being can be negligable at some points, this game focuses on keeping them alive and thriving. Food, warmth, and resources are arguably the core concepts. There is no defined currency in the game; resources are used (wood, stone, food, iron, leather, tools, etc.) to construct buildings or to trade. When beginning, the game might seem overly-difficult and overwhelming, though after ""mastering"" the game it can become repetetive and lacking. Pros: Mostly original take on city-buildersChallenging, but not challenging enough to ruin itvery few bugsfuture workshop supportCons: Beginning can be daunting and frequent restarts are requiredlimited end-game content, expanding can become a grind for resources  **Could be fixed when the workshop is introduced** "

Banished is a city building simulator with a difference. My first few attempts met with disaster and I quickly realized that it's also a survival simulator. Building a healthy colony that will prosper over the years requires planning and careful, moderate growth.  Early survival sometimes is balanced on a knife edge. While all buildings are unlocked immediately in the unmodded game, overconfidence is a killer, and many folks may find this a harsher, less forgiving simulator than most.  However, once one works out the mechanics one soon has a colony up and running and carefully building up a surplus while not over-expanding can lead to an addictive game for those that are detail oriented.  Hours and even complete afternoons may quickly disappear while managing one's colony. The game is visually pretty great. It runs smoothly and without any difficulty on my Windows 8.1 set up. While  there is some minor lagginess when running at 10x speed with a population over 800, that's NOT really a problem most of the time. I understand that the game is the work of one single developer and I find that amazing. It's an incredible achievement.I've currently got 94 hours in game and have collected 27 of the Steam Achievements associated with the game. So far I've NOT played with any of the mods though I have watched a couple let's play series using them and mods add a whole extra level of awesome to this game. And that brings up one of my few complaints... Achievements cannot be earned if any mods are enabled. Of course that includes the mods that allow non-English speakers to play the game. (Guess one of the hidden challenges is that one must master English in order to earn any achievements) Several of the achievements aren't conducive to earning in the same game. These include building a colony without any agriculture , or building a colony without educating one's populace, or even building an isolationist colony that doesn't trade with the outside world.  While I THINK that I could now earn any of these in separate replays (and I''m planning on trying) I'm more interested in exploring how the game plays with some  great mods that are available.  If only there were a mod (like the one in City Skylines) that allows you to earn achievements with Mods enabled...For a game that costs less than a movie in Manhattan this game was a GREAT investment. (I got it in one of Steams frequent major discount sales) By All Means if this sounds like your kind of thing I'd check it out.			"

You also have food, tools and other supplies to worry about, but the supplies are not tedious at all to aquire, as the civilians automatically aquire and transport the supplies based on their job. Civilians aren't locked into a certain job either, so you can force them to switch jobs dependent on what you need.			"

												Good game, mods can be useful, only major downside is that you can't control your citizens directly, instead you have to hope the AI does what it is suppose to (AI is pretty reliable most of the time). Just like any other game, AI has its minor flaws, so you just gotta ride along with it and set your town up hoping for the best. Relatively easy once you get the hang of it.			"

												I love Banished! It's a nice release from other games to pop in and play for a few hours. Workshop mods make it even better. Although, you're not going to play this as regularly as you'd expect, just when you feel like it.OK graphics, would like them to be better but they're good enough. Gameplay is hard, finding yourself struggling on the easiest of settings. But hey, easy mode and some crazy resource mods make it fun.			"

												This is the relaxing fun departure I wanted, from the blood and mayhem that fills out most of my game library.  It's the same experience that I enjoyed when playing From Dust.  The seasonal weather provides a stable pace.  The music is calm and entrancing.  It lends a coziness and inspiration to be a bit precious with my people and resources in this game, in the same way that Tropico used it's salsa soundtrack to encourage me to be a bit madcap and never take any disaster very seriously or worry if the city became onesided.There's a strong sense of freedom here, but what keeps it from becoming a bland blur of click and place is the constant need to balance as I build.  If I haven't built homes in awhile, my villagers start to live with their parents and stop having babies.  If I let it get out of hand, I'm going to have a huge wave of childless people dying off of old age at once, throwing my large town into disorder.  So I build houses, and babies start showing up in them.  More mouths to feed.  Do I have space for farms?  Are there good points on the river for fisheries?  Are there plentiful forests to set up hunter/gatherer stations, or do I want to take the long view and plant an orchard for a couple of years later?  And there's a lot more detail to this end, but not so much that it feels tedious or confusing, just very satisfying.I'm not very far in, but I don't expect that I'll play this game like a hardcore addiction.  It seems rather, like a bright, happy little diversion that will fill a few weekends.  I'm very impressed though, with how much this developer was able to do to create an immersive experience, without it being a rich overstimulation like a lot of my Triple A favorites.			"

												Let's get some technical questions out of the way. The User Interface is fluid. The game is responsive. The attention to detail is astounding. When you build farms, you don't just have a farm, you are allowed to choose between a dozen food types. Your main resources are wood, stone, iron, coal. Which you harvest in familiar ways. The options are what stand out to me in this game. Other simulations might have you build farms for every 10 people or some other fixed value. In Bansihed you have choices. Lots of choices. Lots and Lots of choices. You might start the game only knowing how to farm squash. But everntually you will be able to have over a dozen fruits, vegetables, and meats to choose from. You have farms, in the typical fashion, but you have orchards now. This allows your brewer to use any fruits, or wheat to make ales. You have fruit and nut trees. You have over a dozen food choices to from. Corn, pumpkin, squash, wheat, beans, and more. Easily worth the $20 i dropped on it. I missed it on sale for 15 by a few hours. Already have 20 hours in the game. So at $1 an hour, well worth the investment, and I'm just getting started.			"

												Setting aside for a minute that this game was made by a single developer...it would be a great game even if it were made by a big company. I'd call it more of a ""village simulator"" than a city builder but the concepts are the same: you have to plan your layout, make sure you don't grow too quickly or too slowly, and try to expand in a way that makes sense. And all the while you get to watch your citizens go about their business.The graphics are pleasant if you don't expect too much, and there's some pretty serious calculations going on behind the scenes. And this is a game that screams out for mods...which is why it's so exciting that the developer has confirmed that he'll release a mod kit. When mods start coming out, this game is going to be unbelievable. All in all, if you are into the ""building"" genre, you have to check out Banished. Highly recommended.			"

I don't want to give away too much but you start with a small group of people. You have to manage supplies like food and firewood. Your village only grows when you build houses. Build too quickly and your people will starve through the winter. Build too slowly and your village will die of old age.			"

												Well let's start off by saying this game is EPIC, but lets look into the things you might expect if you are deciding to buy the game. This game is HARD, forget what you played in Sim City, you will find yourself restarting numerous times untill you get it right, in my case load was my best friend. It's really a calm game, the only thing you will fear are the low food reserves, untill you understand what to do of course. It's very addicting, and the maps are HUGE. You will indeed be sitting there a few hours, scratching your head as to why your citizens are dieing but that's what fun about it! For the few hours I have played this, I can say that this will be one of my few favorite games in the long run, if you're really into strategy / City Building, than this is the game you need. Very enjoyabl, and very well made.			"

												A very good city-building game. It can satisfy your city-building genre need and having pleasure while doing so. Very good graphic and nice challenge with the climate requirement. However the game is not without flaws. The game lack upgradability, which mean once you built something, there's not much left to it. If your eager is just to build everything on the build list, you'll have it all in few hours. Thankfully, there's a large mod which added lots of craftable building to the list. The game, however still lack the quest/challenge to push you forward, even with the mod. In short, it's like Anno series in sandbox mode.If you're the type of person that lost interest once you reach the stable city build, play the game with the hardest mode. This way, you'll spend more time learning and perfecting your planning, instead of just spending 3-4 hour build everything the base game has on the list.			"

The game does have a learning curve if you're playing blind but there are many great guides to help a person out. On top of being a great base game, the game is very well suited to mods and integrating them is very seamless with both the workshop and the in game overlay (which lets you mod as you play).

Banished is a city building simulator with a difference. My first few attempts met with disaster and I quickly realized that it's also a survival simulator. Building a healthy colony that will prosper over the years requires planning and careful, moderate growth.  Early survival sometimes is balanced on a knife edge. While all buildings are unlocked immediately in the unmodded game, overconfidence is a killer, and many folks may find this a harsher, less forgiving simulator than most.  However, once one works out the mechanics one soon has a colony up and running and carefully building up a surplus while not over-expanding can lead to an addictive game for those that are detail oriented.  Hours and even complete afternoons may quickly disappear while managing one's colony. The game is visually pretty great. It runs smoothly and without any difficulty on my Windows 8.1 set up. While  there is some minor lagginess when running at 10x speed with a population over 800, that's NOT really a problem most of the time. I understand that the game is the work of one single developer and I find that amazing. It's an incredible achievement.I've currently got 94 hours in game and have collected 27 of the Steam Achievements associated with the game. So far I've NOT played with any of the mods though I have watched a couple let's play series using them and mods add a whole extra level of awesome to this game. And that brings up one of my few complaints... Achievements cannot be earned if any mods are enabled. Of course that includes the mods that allow non-English speakers to play the game. (Guess one of the hidden challenges is that one must master English in order to earn any achievements) Several of the achievements aren't conducive to earning in the same game. These include building a colony without any agriculture , or building a colony without educating one's populace, or even building an isolationist colony that doesn't trade with the outside world.  While I THINK that I could now earn any of these in separate replays (and I''m planning on trying) I'm more interested in exploring how the game plays with some  great mods that are available.  If only there were a mod (like the one in City Skylines) that allows you to earn achievements with Mods enabled...For a game that costs less than a movie in Manhattan this game was a GREAT investment. (I got it in one of Steams frequent major discount sales) By All Means if this sounds like your kind of thing I'd check it out.			"

Posted: August 3, 2015
												This review is based on the current vanilla version of the game, which is to be regarded as completely finished (There will not be any further updates or patches). THE GOOD + It's Different: Banished is a city-, or rather, village builder. The main goal, however, is not to build a prosperous metropolis, but to keep your citizens alive in a hostile environment. The key to this is wise resource management and proper planning. Banished has been called ""The Dark Souls of City Builders"" and I can agree with this. It may seem very hard - even unfair - at first, but once you understand the mechanics, it becomes very doable as long as you keep paying attention.+ Actual Simulation: Every single citizen is born to a family, given a (weird) name and after growing up and finishing school, will get a job, move in with a partner and found a family of their own. Everything that you set in motion will be visibly carried out by your citizens; from clearing land to planting seeds to finally bringing in the harvest, you can observe every step being carried out. Similarly, buildings don't just plop up where you order them built, the necessary materials have to be carried to the location, after which you can watch the structure being erected in two or three visible stages. Your workers have to get there first though, which means the farther away from established infrastructure you chose to build, the longer it will take (and the less efficient production buildings will be). + The Achievements: There are no ""Do something incredibly moronic and counter-intuitive that will totally frack up your savegame, or just be a boring grind that will taint your memory of the game if you care enough about achievements to actually do it"" type achievements. Almost all of them are just about doing well at the game. The others, like ""Mountain Men"", can be viewed as scenarios (which are otherwise missing from the game).+ The Bugs: I haven't encountered any. THE ""MEH"" ~ Graphics: The graphics are OK, i.e. ""not ugly"". Fully zoomed out, they're even kind of charming, as long as you ignore stuff like the river-crossing Jesus Deer.~ Sound: The loop of a very limited number of background music tracks quickly becomes boring, but at least the music isn't annoying (to me). The same cannot be said for some of the ambience sounds like the mooing of cows or the gusts of wind, which are constant if you play on x10 speed. MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH MOO MOO MOO WOOOSH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH. You'll probably play with (ambience-) sound off after a while. (Why isn't this under ""bad""? Because it's almost enjoyable on x1 speed.)~ Resource Management Tools: While overall very well done, they're lacking in some parts. E.g.: - You can place production limits on all manufactured goods, including clothing, but not on leather and wool, which are needed for clothing. If you produce slightly more raw materials than your tailor uses (and if you don't keep an eye on this), your storage barns will eventually overflow with them, meaning there's no space for produced goods anymore. This is exaggerated when the clothing limit has been reached and the tailors stop production. - You cannot prohibit citizens from using certain goods. They will eat the wheat intended for your brewers to make ale and they will use coal instead of firewood to heat their homes if coal is stored closer to the market than firewood at that moment. (You need coal for steel tools). You also cannot limit selected stockpiles to only store certain goods, or a maximum amount of a specific good.These are minor issues and there are ways to get around them, but it certainly isn't optimal.~ Variety: There's not a lot of it, except in food. There are very few building types and even fewer upgrades (one for houses). But hey, it works and there is enough to manage. THE BAD - Performance: This simulation-heavy game is not optimized to run on multi-core processors and will only use one core. This results in simulation speed and FPS drops after a certain amount of citizens in your town. The point of the game slowing to a constant crawl was reached at a population of around 1000 in my case (i7 5930K). This is quite late in the game though. Point of reference: The highest population achievement is 900. CONCLUSION I obviously enjoyed playing Banished and I sincerely recommend it to everyone who is interested enough to read through this review. It's a good game. Not great, but good.			"

												Surprisingly chill game. Worth a shot if you enjoy building a town from scratch and evolving it into cities as time goes by. You also have food, tools and other supplies to worry about, but the supplies are not tedious at all to aquire, as the civilians automatically aquire and transport the supplies based on their job. Civilians aren't locked into a certain job either, so you can force them to switch jobs dependent on what you need.			"

												If you enjoy games like Anno then buy this game. It's hard as nails and it's really easy to screw things up but there's a sense of accomplishment when you have a thriving village. I don't want to give away too much but you start with a small group of people. You have to manage supplies like food and firewood. Your village only grows when you build houses. Build too quickly and your people will starve through the winter. Build too slowly and your village will die of old age.			"

												Well let's start off by saying this game is EPIC, but lets look into the things you might expect if you are deciding to buy the game. This game is HARD, forget what you played in Sim City, you will find yourself restarting numerous times untill you get it right, in my case load was my best friend. It's really a calm game, the only thing you will fear are the low food reserves, untill you understand what to do of course. It's very addicting, and the maps are HUGE. You will indeed be sitting there a few hours, scratching your head as to why your citizens are dieing but that's what fun about it! For the few hours I have played this, I can say that this will be one of my few favorite games in the long run, if you're really into strategy / City Building, than this is the game you need. Very enjoyabl, and very well made.			"

												Surviving Winter Simulator is a great game with a new look on civilization building games. Banished seemed to have this strange attraction which made me want to keep watching my village go through seasons and increase in population. There is no money system in this game, but it works really well with the style of the game. There is no quest, campaign, or even objectives. Your only goal is to survive. The HUD is fairly small which lets you focus on watching your civilians accomplish your tasks. The game is layed out beautifully with nice graphics and great sound effects. I am extremely supprised that this game is the accomplishment of a single mans work. The guy did everything for the game, and he did it quite well.I only have a few complaints about the game. The game seems to get a little boring when you start to thrive, and there is no real incentive to just make a new game and startover everytime you get your city to the point where you are not needed. I would also like to see more placeable objects in the game. For instance, I would have liked to seen more types of houses and more recreational objects for the citizens. Other then those two complaints Banished is a great city builder game priced at only $20.00.8.2/10 Sloanster Stars			"

												In Banished you are controlling a group of Banished people who try to survive in a surrounding field with dangers and opportunities. If you manage well and plan ahead you are rewarded with a thriving town and educated, happy citizens who live their lives in comfort, a price which is quit satisfaction because of the high skill demand of the game. Best explained is the game by saying it is  group survival, real time strategy  and resource management game. A Great thought of and with this game accomplished concept which creates a game that is in some ways the first of its kind. The greatest addition in this game is the ""human as resources"" element. As in many other RTS games humans are not considered as a strategy giving part at all, like for example in the Anno series. Or the human ""resource"" management part of the game is not as much advanced as in Banished as for example in the settler series, age of empires series (empire earth series)...  The other great concept of the game is the real time survival strategy part as Banished really feels like a survival game. One mistake and half of your townspeople die in the winter and that's a situation after which it is difficult to recover again.Banished comes with a huge variety of different and comprehensible resources which are connected with each other in understandable connection and traceable chain productions. For example the hunter does not come home with just meat, he comes home with venison and leather. The venison is than used as food and the leather goes to the tailor to create warmer cloth. Or the gatherer does not just gather food, there are many different roots, mushrooms, berries and herbs it can collect. Its true that the chain productions do not have the advanced level of a Settler 7 or a Anno 1701 but sometimes less is more (or less is not too few). I personally would have wished for a slower start into the game as one of the first buildings you build in the beginning is a 2 story hunting cabin that than is just filed with one hunter as not enough people are available to hunt. That's a situation which bothered me quit allot as it takes away some parts of the toughly  created realism in the detailed variety of resources. In general the auto placement of the citizens to houses near to their work side, works good, but a system where the player could decide by himself who is going to live where would have been more intuitive. As it bothered me allot that sometimes the computer would not get it right. Another situation that totally ruined my first game-round was that I decided its a good idea to build many small farms. Sadly I realized afterwards that managing these farms is an impossible task. Because each spring it has to be decided which field are work on and what is going to be planed on each field. A selection the player has to make manually by clicking on each field assigning a farmer and selecting the crop. In this situation an automated system would have been an crucial improvement of the game.In general there is a bad feedback according productivity of all kind of production chains and bad general statistics. A situation that  leaves small room for satisfactory optimizing of the town.I also think that there is a bit of a balancing problem in late game as it kind of gets more difficult to collect enough timber and stone for upgrading and building higher ranked buildings.In the conclusion I have to admit that I have a huge respect for the game and its developer as it is a one man project.  I think the comprehensible resources, the general concept of the game and the humans as resources idea is phenomenal but the realization and implementing of some game mechanics is quiet weak.http://architectonreview.blogspot.com.tr/2017/04/banished.html "

												Big shout out to my girl Felicia Day for being the one who made me discover Banished!10/10 – Absolutely amazing gameBanished is a city building and managing simulation game developed by Shinning Rock Software. In Banished you guide a group of outcasts as they build a band new village and help them settle and grow as a community. Banished is one of the best city simulation I have ever played right up there with Cities: Skyline, but with a completely different genre. In the game, you have to manage the collecting and distribution of goods, food, tools as well as things such as firewood that are necessary for the survival of each and every one of your citizen. It gets cold, sometimes the food gets low, and people age and die, and all of these things are things that you need to keep an eye on, as well as whether or not your citizens are happy enough to procreate and thus expending your population. Banished isn’t a particularly easy game, or rather, I’d say that it can be quite the challenge. You can choose the zoning of your village, the size of the map, the temperate, as well as the difficulty, but even the lowest can still offer you some challenges. It took me a while to get a hold and a good understanding of the mechanism in Banished, but when you do, the game works great and the soundtrack becomes almost therapeutic.As stated, although Banished can be assumed to be a straightforward, simple simulation and managing game, do not be fooled, as it also is way up there with Cities: Skyline in terms of how complicated and messy it can get if you do not pay enough attention, especially in the winter. Jobs need to be assigned and certain buildings needs to be built in appropriate places, such as the hunter’s cabin, the gatherers etc Do not dismiss the importance of food because your townspeople will die of starvation rather quickly.All in all, now that I have figured out (or at least think I have) how Banished works, I look forward to push my population to the highest numbers and observe where things go. It is a game that I adore, that is incredibly fun and entertaining and that I would recommend to any and all lover of simulation games.			"

												When I first bought Banished and started playing I was immediately hooked.  A game that seems so simplistic is actually quite challenging.   Graphics and Performance While Banished won't win any awards for graphics they are adequate.  The animations of the citizen models and animals are quite good.  I have not seen the game slow down at all, even with a large map full of buildings and crops the game runs well. Gameplay and Replay Value The gameplay can be as challenging as you want, feeling brave?  Do a harsh mountain environment with natural disasters.  First game?  Then maybe go easy, turn disasters off and start with a couple houses.  The choice is yours.  The game is easy to jump into and start playing but complex enough that you do have to think and plan ahead.  Like most ""City Building"" games this one has you managing resources, some renewable and some not.  For the non-renewable resource the game allows a trader to visit your town so that you can buy some supplies.The replay value of this game cannot be underestimated.  With over 100 hours in this game for far I am still just as hooked as I was after 1 hour.  The replay value is awesome.Bugs and CrashesVery few crashes, once in awhile a citizen will get ""stuck"" between buildings and starve.  Other than that I have not ran into any bugs with the game.CustomizationActive mod community and steam workshop.  Mods that are out right now are great.Overall 9/10.  Would recommend to other Steam users.			"

												My little village was thriving in the frontier; however, one winter was especially harsh. The cold and lack of food managed to kill off most of the village's population, leaving only 4 people, including Evra and his son, Rake. Time went on and the 3 men and the boy made the best of the situation, providing food and shelter for themselves and surviving many more winters. Although, without any women, time was running out for the village. Eventually Evra and the other men passed away, leaving Rake as the sole survivor in the village. Rake performed all the village duties by himself, living in solitude to a ripe old age. His last task was to make a graveyard for himself; although, there was nobody left to bury him.RIP Rake "

But it's beautifully executed for what it is, and there is hope that it will grow into a deeper game with continued effort from the lone developer and the eventual community of modders.As the game currently stands: given the mechanics and simplistic simulation model, I don't see it having staying power for very long. It's a pleasant enough diversion, and it sure is pretty.As the game that it will hopefully become: I can only offer a cautious thumbs up.			"

												One of the best town sims I've ever played. It takes elements from other games like  the Anno series and ""Knights and Merchants"" then rolls them all into one game minus the combat aspect. you start out slumming it struggling to get food and firewood for winter then work your way up to a massive town with over a 100 people. Good micromanagement is a must for this game. The graphics are also quite pretty. Getting to watch the seasons change and seeing how snows and ice affect the villagers in real time can be pretty immersive. I'm already very addicted.			"

I just whished it wasnt so cruel.I almost whish I could play this in an mmo world and trade with others, survive together, as a lategame.But otherwise, the experience was worth the costs. The mod scene is awesome for later. The game itself really makes you question whether you want kids in a harsh winter.Big +++Update: The price increase is maybe nice for people to support such lovely games in the future, but I would wate for a steam sale; I can understand if 20 bucks might be too much for the explorer of a small good game, the early release price was a lot more adequate. However, I also whish the producer the best for future projects; or add a multiplayer trade system / event system / diplomacy to it, then the price would become right. Somehow indirectly communicating or trading with other towns would make this game a total new type of game.			"

												Simulators like this give ""games"" a good name. At first glance, it looks like Age of Empires, but you'll quickly realize this is not the same animal. Only after a few days of playing will you realize that there is no confrontation, but you'll be thinking, ""Ain't nobody got time for that!"" Banished is very simple to get into and yet the depth keeps increasing even after hours of play. The interface is well thought out and minimal or as complex as you would like. Drag n dropping info boxes in order to compare crop yield rates, or just looking over your town's inventory to see what can be traded, either is made simple by the flexible dialog box system. Yes, it's a meditation and it's zen, till an early winter ♥♥♥♥♥-slaps you. After decades of searching for a city builder game, I think my search is over.

												Good idea, not so good realisation.The basic idea of a mere survival game, that gives the player a hard time feeding his people and cheering them up, is great.Also the first impression was ""wow, quite something to do"".But after you found out how it works you will reach a situation, where everything was build, where you only build more storages and houses, and thats it....The game could have a very high potencial, if there were more buildings, jobs, eventually a few more possibilities to use the map (flatting ground etc.), even a few logic production lines would be great.There is Wheat, but no bakery, there are cows, but no butcher, there is a tavern, but no logic behind the brewery, that takes mere fruit for alcohol...Also updates take a very long time.My word on this game: Wonderful idea, good graphics for a small game, but not enough content for a game that costs money.Don´t buy until this game has more content.

												This is not exactly a bad game, and for a pro, I'd say it's quite catchy and interesting at very first. The idea of a slow-paced building sim + resources management looks great at first glance, but it wears out very quickly as the mechanichs and the whole concept of ""challenging"" becomes a boring rinse repeat;First, I've bought this game because unlike ""Sim City"" alikes, you deal with just a handful of people, where everybody perform a task for the good of the ""whole"". The concept sounds interesting, and again, challenging, but the execution didnt paid off, and why? The factor that makes this game ""difficult"" (it's not really challenging, its just meant to be hard) is because pretty much everyone MUST be working at something, the balance is way too strict, so if a few babies are born, food wont be enough anymore, people starve later. Same If some farmer die of old age, or even a random rock crush a random miner (yes, just like that...) or some forager or wood cutter gets killed by an animal, it unleashes a chain of bad events that cannot be countered within a resonable timeframe, everything is just too slow! months and seasons pass by and people just walk and roam slow regardless of their impending doom, there's no way to make them work harder aside from just removing some people from one profession to another. even so they will follow all the protocols wich makes it cost an entire season just for a ingot to get to the blacksmith, and while that does not work efficitently, other areas will lack... suddenly people start dropping dead left and right because the lack of food, or firewood, or because they did not had tools in time, and without them, workers never fills the quota wich leads to the lack of every possible thing. Rinse and repeat, a bunch of people die and you get to start again with a few survivors...After realizing how the mechanics of this game works, it gets boring after a few hours of fast fowards just to try to get a a few houses built or a bridge, wich by the way, will kill you! laborers will take logs to the construction sites as soon as they find one by the storage. No lumber, no firewood... and you know where it goes with this...  More often,  you find yourself expecting that a baby or two will be born or for someone to finally grow up so you can finally assign him to work at the mine because realocating anyone else for that matter would cause the total system colapse... and when they grow up, someone dies... someone gets crushed... this back and forth gaming is frustrating to say at least, theres basically no margins for Plan B or surplus.Once again, just because the balance is always leaning towards the bad side of events, it doesn't makes the game challenging and furthermore fun, instead, just punishing after a couple of hours.

												This game is brutal. It doesn't care about you, your time, your buildings, or your villagers. I can't stop playing it. There is no supernatural enemy to fend off, no enemy hordes to fight, it's just your little ragtag group of people versus the elements. And, nine times out of ten, the elements win. Either via starvation or the little idiots freezing to death. You will either play this game for hours on end, or throw your computer across the room in frustration after ten minutes. If you can bend it to your will, you'll enjoy it. If you can't, you'll hate it. Good luck.			"

												Let me begin by stating that Banished is not for the faint, It is not a Sim City, It is Not Anno, there is no glorious Empire to be built, no shining Utopian city to be founded, only a handful of citizen, trying to make subsistance living. Banished is a hard game, even on the easiest settings, ensuring the growth of your town is difficult, there will be hard times, starvation, cold, and disease, and that in part is the beauty of this game. This is a true survival game, you must build your town from scratch, what it looks like, and how it functions is heavily determined by your surroundings. Will you develope a large fishing and trade empire,focused around the sole trade river which is the life blood of your town? Will you develope an industrial powerhouse, using mines and Quarries to produce precious stone and iron for tools to then sell for just enough food to ensure most of your citizens make it through the winter? Or will you play a subsistance society, living off the land, replanting trees and harvesting berries from the surrounding woodland, knowing that to grow will take many, many more years? The best part is that the choice is up to you, and this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ many many times, before you even have a glimpse of mastery, and a glimpse of a great society. All in all, BUY THIS GAME!			"

												EA gave the customers their middle finger with the latest release of the success-series Sim City. They turned a series of games that was highly loved by it's fans and widely played, to a pile of stinking camel-feces - all after spending a huge hunk of cash on development.And then along comes Banished. Not quite as complex. Not quite as good looking. Not quite there, but still not very far off at all! What it does have is a whole lot of charm, and a big portion of genuine atmosphere. It's one of these games that's easy to get into and understand, but it is a hell of a wild bullride to really master. Expect sudden population-deaths, because of infestations and bad crops. Expect a long time mining out stones so you can build. Expect frustrations over short summers and long winters. But most of all, expect to just fall in love with this game - even though it is not very advanced on any part. It is the total opposite of what EA and Sim ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is - it is just what it shows you, nothing more, and very honest. And cheap. Get this game.			"

												Great game.  This game is difficult but rewarding.  I have read some negative reviews and honestly I don't see the game in the same way as those with issues.  Slow down your ambitions and speed up the simulation.  Once I slowed down and let the villagers complete their tasks and used the priority tool things became much easier.  Also plan things in seasons, the winter will be rough so stock up on firewood and food.  Don't set the food, firewood limits, etc. too high you want the Wood Cutter, Blacksmith, etc. to do the right balance of work in his/her profession, when the max is hit it seems they become a laborer during the down time and return to work when supplies drop below the set max in their profession.  So no need to over micromanage.  When they meet the quota they help gather and move goods to the barn or stockpile.  Same with farmers when not farming.  I find that most people who have had a difficult time with this game are missing the immersion aspect.  Try putting yourself in their shoes and play less god and more village leader.  Distance matters as well, time is energy wasted, villagers go home to eat, food is stored in the homes along with firewood.  If you have a Forester, a Herbologist, or some Gatherers away from the main village give them local lodging and if things get big enough give them the ability to store their supplies or rations nearby or between the main village and their outpost.  Hope some of this helps.  Also turn off disasters and things get a lot easier.  Turn them back on once you get the hang of it.  Loving this game and support indie projects.  Give them the support, feedback, and patience to be successful in the long run.  Thanks for the game, for me, 20 bucks well spent.			"

												I can't believe this was made by one developer! The game is well executed and has many subtleties. Most importantly, this game tries to be a real simulation; all buildings are available from the beginning.This is where Sim-City meets Settlers of Catan. The game focuses on building a soceity for your banished settlers. You are forced to use proper resource management. If you extensively hunt or fish you can seriously deplete or even cause some species to go extinct. Gathering is only effective in a mature forest, so you have to be mindful of your logging. You have to develop a sustainable society, and develop a balance with your environment. The game can be troubling at first, especially watching your settlers starve to death after a few seasons. On my first attempt, I tried to urban plan my whole settlement, only to see a mismanged group of settlers struggle and eventually die. You have to build realistically, and start as a hunter/gather society.  It is important to read the wiki, play the tutorial and start on easy with mild conditions. As you master the art of sustainability you can attempt harder difficulties.PS: A tip for anyone struggling is to remember that labourers are useful. When I first started playing I tried to maximize all  my trades, and that left my skilled tradeswo/men doing labourer duties. If you look closely, you'll see wood cutters leaving piles of firewood. The fisherwo/men will box up caught fish at their hut. If a labourer doesn't remove these items, it forces the skilled worker to remove them. You can maximize your building and hunting by leaving a small labourer pool.			"

												Amazing slow paced resource-based city builder. It's really managed to fill a niche where other games simply don't have the same level of multitasking without an enemy attacking you. However, the game is not without its downsides, in that the supply/demand margins seem excessively high, in that being able to use the buildings, such as farms, foresters and what not, do not seem to be able to pump out the required logs and food that the citizens use them up in. Getting though the first year tends to see at least 2 families die of starvation, even with as many food sites maxed out with people.  Furthermore, citizens appear to be quite ‘greedy’, in the essence of if one family is starving and they have an excess of food in their house, they will not share it out, and you cannot move it yourself, which can be a bit of an annoyance. Adding on to this, the seasons seem a bit short, in that autumn can end while you’re still half way through gathering a crop, which can lead to quite a high loss of food. On another note, the villagers priorities can often seem a bit jumbled up, in that while you want them to be building something; they may be off cutting down a tree or building a road. While I understand if they’re doing a survival action, such as getting food or warmth, it can be a hassle when you need a new storehouse or farm and the citizen does not appear to be doing this.On to a more positive note, the game does manage to pose a very good challenge to the player. Despite the downsides just listed, they do not seem to be too game breaking, and you can still build up quite the settlement even with all this difficulties. Perhaps I was simply not ready for the learning curve hence I have run into supply issues, I cannot greatly say. However since I have still managed to create a small hamlet with these issues, I feel anyone else with a knack for this genre will also be able to do so. The background music is wonderfully made and non-obtrusive. The graphics have been made wonderfully, and the game looks beautiful.  In conclusion, despite the issues with supply/demand and the somewhat steep learning curve, with no tutorial or lessons mode, the game is still a greatly enjoyable game, and a great way to spend some time if you’re just looking for a calm game to manage, without the hassle of enemy units, or the ease of 1 resource games. Great game, certainly worth giving it a go if you enjoy the genre.21/02/14 Edit: I have recently got past the issue with food, thanks to reading up on some hints on the community section, and that's helped greatly. I still feel at times the income can be a bit slow, especially when you need to trade with a trader (which is somewhat annoyingly infrequent) and you don't have enough goods to perform a trade, as the goods are often quite expensive, especially seeds.

												If your looking for something like simcity then stop and back away. This game is nothing like it. Banished brings you into a real fight for survival. you are a settlers to new land with nothing but what you got on your back and some supplies. you must leader your citzens to create a town that they can live in during the coldest of winters.  I recommend Banished for people who love planning and can see the big picture. if you happen to miss the smallest of details it could turn you newly found home into a ghost town. beware of time for you may be caught in this game for a long time.

												One of the best Indie games on Steam. It's rock solid stable, I've never seen a glitch or so much as a hiccup in my time playing it. It also has one of the best tutorial systems I've ever seen in an Indie game, you can actually learn the game as opposed to going online to watch someone else teach it. What will keep you coming back is the endless variety. Your maps are based on seeds (a la Minecraft) so each time you play it will be something different and there's a great online community for sharing map seeds. You won't be disappointed with this game.			"

												Mechanically, it's simpler than other DF-likes such as Towns, and even city-builders like Tropico. But it's beautifully executed for what it is, and there is hope that it will grow into a deeper game with continued effort from the lone developer and the eventual community of modders.As the game currently stands: given the mechanics and simplistic simulation model, I don't see it having staying power for very long. It's a pleasant enough diversion, and it sure is pretty.As the game that it will hopefully become: I can only offer a cautious thumbs up.			"

												This game is great. Overall  7.5/10Bought it think it was just gonna be like another sim city or something it was real easy to build a balanced city with a large population. oh boy was i wrong. within the first 2 hours my first town had died, and by the end of the night i had probably restarted about 10 times at just the pure hardness to build a stable town. Due to this frustration it hooks you, you want to proove the game wrong and succeed, and my word be prepared to put in. The graphics of this game does it job, in being detailed enough but not over detailed that your system struggles to run it. Game runs pretty much hassle free from start. If you're into building ctites but without the conflict this is for you, it will provide you with hours of challenges, it the achievements provides you with outcomes to meet to keep the game interesting for you. Adding in the many great mods available only enchances this game further.			"

												""Waiting for trade boats the game"" Is a resource management game to the extreme. While having similar aspects to games in the city building genre such as sim city or tropico it has a slightly different flavor the game is more focused producing the correct amount of resources and managing expansion instead of the normal produce as much resource as humanly possible. I still feel like this game is missing something, but even so its fun and relaxing to play.Specific complaints there is no way to prioritize stock piles and/or set them to only hold certain resources which can be a giant hassle if you are trying to stream line a wood cutter. Laborers priority settings are lacking if they are out harvesting resources and you drop a house which has a tree on it they will not stop harvesting to remove the tree. While this may just be a complaint I have its a bit tedious to deselect everything drop the house then reselect everything again.			"

												I can't really recommend this game. It has some great sandbox value for sure, but I find myself getting frustrated with the interface A LOT. It's very difficult to micromanage such a large colony because of it. The UI on top of things that are already odd to micomanage. A lot of areas I don't feel like I should have to micromanage, they should be far more autmated like in other games. What your farmers are doing could be handled much easier.Ultimately, I kept waiting for quality of life patches to come but they never did. What's there is decent, and you can definitely build a cool little town and have some fun here, but the struggles of the UI and micromanagement get annoying fast. There are better games in the genre to play.			"

												At first you may think the game is overpriced at 20 dollars, yes you can get a game like this named town for about 10 bucks but the quality of this game supersedes town. Town is a great game and the only big difference I see in town, is that you can make your own buildings block by block and that there are enemies you have to fend against. Other than that this game has WAY better graphics,smoother building, and a overall interesting system. I do recommend this game to everyone who enjoys city builders but if your an inpatient person I wouldn't recommend it to you. Even though it has a X10 speed...			"

												Sometimes when you start a game your residents don't perform the tasks they are assigned to, one such example is when my builders were not working on the projects assigned to them, but were instead working at my fishing dock which already had 4 assigned workers. Even set the fishing dock to have 0 workers and this still did not fix the issue, but once I assigned my builders to build a random section of road they then proceeded to build the buildings they were previously assigned to build. The AI in this game is pretty poorly coded. Villagers/Residents only want to work on the task assigned about 60% of the time. Also they get stuck in an ""Idle"" loop, where they continuously stand around with their thumb up their *** even when they could clearly be doing the assigned task. Got this game during the winter sale for aroun $4.99 USD and I still feel I overpaid for such poorly optimized AI and gameplay.			"

They turned a series of games that was highly loved by it's fans and widely played, to a pile of stinking camel-feces - all after spending a huge hunk of cash on development.And then along comes Banished. Not quite as complex. Not quite as good looking. Not quite there, but still not very far off at all! What it does have is a whole lot of charm, and a big portion of genuine atmosphere. It's one of these games that's easy to get into and understand, but it is a hell of a wild bullride to really master. Expect sudden population-deaths, because of infestations and bad crops. Expect a long time mining out stones so you can build. Expect frustrations over short summers and long winters. But most of all, expect to just fall in love with this game - even though it is not very advanced on any part. It is the total opposite of what EA and Sim ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is - it is just what it shows you, nothing more, and very honest. And cheap. Get this game.			"

												After wathching many ""Let's play"" videos prior to the release, I really wanted to try out this game. Honestly, I didn't think that I will get sucked in, because I have seen every game mechanic and building in the game watching those videos. Boy, was I wrong. When playing this game, you enter another time dimension where it practicaly flies by you. Game doesn't feature any fighting threats, which is in my opinion a very good thing - you have a relaxing experience where you can plan every sturcture position, logistical chain of production, survival techniques etc. But be wary of catastrophies such as tornados, fires, diseases... If you like building games such as Anno, you will absolutely love this game. Highly recommended.			"

												Its inexpensive with high quality - if you want a fun in depth city building and taking care of people without a roman army attacking you - this is the game for you - the community support is excellent makeing complete mods that update the game and add lots of cool functionsPro's Good GameSimple to learn - Hard to MasterExcellent communityNo CombatBuildings with max resource citizens do other things - example a firewood chopper hits max wood - so they go do labor jobs till more is made - yes this may not seem big when you think of 40-60k people like ceaser or settlers but when your community has only 50-100 familys it can make a big differenceCons No Combat - yeah I know I posted this twice but with such a interesting style of game I just wonder things like - what if a wolf attacked my people? what if a bandit group came by? nothing full siege ish but I just like the ideaa bit of a steep learning curve first 2-3 gameslearning the mix of structures and jobs you need is a bit time consuming at firstNot allot of numbers - buildings do not tell you how much they are making (example hunters don't say - +34H Meat) so you have to look more at storage and guess what you need at timesFinal verdict - buy it - my only regret about this game I wish I had more time to play it in my busy schedule			"

												If your looking for something like simcity then stop and back away. This game is nothing like it. Banished brings you into a real fight for survival. you are a settlers to new land with nothing but what you got on your back and some supplies. you must leader your citzens to create a town that they can live in during the coldest of winters.  I recommend Banished for people who love planning and can see the big picture. if you happen to miss the smallest of details it could turn you newly found home into a ghost town. beware of time for you may be caught in this game for a long time.

												A Briliant City Builder:The game has a simle concept, you start with a few people, some food, and other supplies, and maybe a few buildings. Now survive. The game Is mirror polished, and executes it's concept beautifully. Everything from the UI to the graphics, to  the sound is great, which is impressice, considering this was all made by one guy (except the music) In short, if you've been lookign for a new city builder, or like me none of the existing city builders were quite what you were lookign for, i reccomend you give this one a shot.

												I am always looking for a city builder that doesn't involve you raising an army to fight some arbitrary enemy or risk having the charming settlement I've built get burned to the ground for no reason other than some people can't understand playing a game where there isn't someone else to kill.This is one of those rare treasures. It is not easy or even strictly peaceful by any means; you will genuinely struggle to survive in a lot of cases, but you're struggling against the environment and your ability to manage it and your distribution of its resources effectively.Highly enjoyable.

												Tried to gather enough wood and food for the first winter. Built a well. First house started to burn.  Managed to get the fire out, but the house was lost, together with a lot of food. Built a new house as fast as possible for the former inhabitants. After it was finished they starved to death since their new house was not filled with food yet. (And they don't seem to be smart enough to eat right from the stoarge barn).New family went in, BUT, they did not get any food either since some blasted women, whos houses were FULL of freaking food, were always picking the remaining food from the storage right before the new family could get any. The father of that family went to the fisher, got a crate full of fish, and transported it, .... not to his house where his family was starving, NO to the storage, .... and guess what ... that darn hag with a house full of food went there again and picked up the freaking fish, and brought it to her house. While starving father was occupied transporting some other stuff.Father of the starving family went back to the fisher and got a new crate full of fish. On the way back he finaly died of starvation, with the crate of fish still in his hands ... which kinda serves him right for being so god damn stupid. Like eat the freaking fish you are holding in your hand, YES EVEN RAW would be better than dying of starvation!With now 2 families dead (because of general AI stupidty), production was slowing down drastically. And even more so when I noticed that most people were not working anymore. They were standing at the house where the two families had died and guess what ... they were mourning! MOURNING OVER THEIR NEIGHBOURS THEY GREEDILY LET STARVE TO DEATH by stockpilling all the remaining food into their own houses, which were already full of food. Oh the irony! And now they even singed their own suicide note by stopping work for mourning. Okay I should have build a graveyard, but this behaviour is ridiculously exaggerated, and basically a death sentence to the whole village. Stoped playing right there out of frustation for the lack of control and idiotic game logic.I usualy love sim games like this, I also like challenging hard games, but this game is not hard because of a believable, smart, or complex system. No this game is hard because its AI is so darn dumb and utterly incompetend in keeping themselfs alive. Its like a village full of Lemmings. This is whats causing all those ""spirals of death"" this game is so well known off.Worst AI simulation I have ever experienced in a sim game. People who call this a feature are just wrong, ""You were not producing enough food!"" Ok fine, but if overproducing food is the only way of compensating stupid AI behaviour to prevent unstopable spirals of death, then this is REALY BAD GAMEDESIGN. And don't come up with ""But this game was made by only one person!"" so what? So is Rimworld, which is by far a better game, with a lot smarter AI, ingame depth, events, more control and a lot more long term content than Banished. And its also hard and challenging, but this time for the right reasons.			"

												""The ability to micromanage is an essential part of playing “Banished”.  If you prefer city-builders that are more relaxed to where you can hit the fast-forward button and let the game play itself, “Banished” may not be ideal for you.  You’ll thrust your fist up in satisfaction when your storage barn fills with food, and cry when you realize that your last tool broke and you haven’t even constructed a blacksmith yet in order to make more.  It’s a hell of a rollercoaster, I’ll give it that…well worth the twenty bucks I paid to add it to my ever-growing collection.""Full Review: http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/banished/There's also an overview & gameplay video for those not interested in reading:

												I don't think the mechanics are quite right in this game.  There is a weird tipping point where your people start to starve, and even if you tell everyone to make food, they still sit there and starve.  If everyone alive is producing food why are my people starving?  One minute there was 600+ extra fish and deer meat in the stores, and next thing I know people are going hungry, so turn up the amount of people working food sources and the starving gets worse.   Maybe there is a nuance I am missing, but the game lost it's fun fairly early on.  I'll take another look at the game later on and try it again.			"

												I am nearly 200 hours into Banished, the first 100 were probably played over 4-6 weeks with the last 100 over the last 4-6 months. If you read most negative reviews for the game you'll see ""Depth, content, etc"" mentioned a lot, and its a valid point. There really isn't much to do once you get a decent sized city built. The AI is not the best, the interface is lacking but functional.After two years, I would have expected something new, new buildings, new animas, new seeds, new something. I get its a very small team but I'm sure they've had some time and resources (this game has sold fairly well) to introduce new content. I thought about not recommending it but I can't, the game is enjoyable, I like seeing my citizens go about, albiet a bit lost sometimes and doing what they do.I hope more content becomes available soon, I like the game, and I want to like it more than I do now.7.5/10			"

												It's a very good game for those of us who don't mind not having to fight space invaders while building a town in the woods.  The learning curve is fun, as is the norm with these games- be prepared to lose lots of people to starvation and cold! I love that unlike ""Anno 2070"", you aren't forced to build the thing to unlock the thing to unlock the thing... you have access to everything at the start to build the type of town you want.			"

												Okay, so first off, know yourself - know what kind of games you like.Banished isn't the type of game you can give a clear Yes/No recommendation on because of its specific style.For many this game will be horrible, for others it is amazing.If you ask *me* personally whether or not I'd recommend Banished my answer is yes.I just love this genre, and I'm a big fan of the slower paced more tactical games to begin with.Add to that the fact that I enjoy economical/resource management games over military strategy and you've pretty much have banished in a nutshell.There is another thing to consider. If you've reached this point and have not yet resolved that Banished isn't for you because you prefer fast-paced action. You need to know that Banished is quite polished, but it is not very expansive in terms of content yet. Its a sandbox, and what it offers, it does so very well. There are plans for modding support and the developer has plenty of ideas for future additions.But as the game is right now, if you are one that quickly gets bored and that doesn't feel expanding on an existing town is enough for you to keep you entertained for long Banished might not be for you either.So it all comes down to your preferences. Do I recommend Banished as a game and is it worth its $20 pricepoint - Yes.Is Banished going to be the right game for you? I can't answer that, it'll mostly depend on your preferences and your patience.What Banished offers: - ""City-building/City-management"" (some argue town building is more apt in this case...) - Resource and population management - An overall slow-paced, relaxing gaming experience - A sandbox environment with a currently limited number of toys to play with - A promise for modding support soonishWhat Banished does not offer: - Zombies (please stop asking about this...) - Combat - Cooperative/Competative Multiplayer - Fast-paced and/or twitch reaction gameplay			"

												Good idea, not so good realisation.The basic idea of a mere survival game, that gives the player a hard time feeding his people and cheering them up, is great.Also the first impression was ""wow, quite something to do"".But after you found out how it works you will reach a situation, where everything was build, where you only build more storages and houses, and thats it....The game could have a very high potencial, if there were more buildings, jobs, eventually a few more possibilities to use the map (flatting ground etc.), even a few logic production lines would be great.There is Wheat, but no bakery, there are cows, but no butcher, there is a tavern, but no logic behind the brewery, that takes mere fruit for alcohol...Also updates take a very long time.My word on this game: Wonderful idea, good graphics for a small game, but not enough content for a game that costs money.Don´t buy until this game has more content.

												Simulators like this give ""games"" a good name. At first glance, it looks like Age of Empires, but you'll quickly realize this is not the same animal. Only after a few days of playing will you realize that there is no confrontation, but you'll be thinking, ""Ain't nobody got time for that!"" Banished is very simple to get into and yet the depth keeps increasing even after hours of play. The interface is well thought out and minimal or as complex as you would like. Drag n dropping info boxes in order to compare crop yield rates, or just looking over your town's inventory to see what can be traded, either is made simple by the flexible dialog box system. Yes, it's a meditation and it's zen, till an early winter ♥♥♥♥♥-slaps you. After decades of searching for a city builder game, I think my search is over.

												It's between Don't Starve and Sim City. Mostly Don't Starve (: sometimes your folks begin to die from starvation after 2 years even if you have enough food. You need to be careful with the home-to-work routes. People need serious attention to do their exact jobs. Fast forwarding is too dangerous sometimes, one minute everything is fine in the other everyone starts to complain about the weather and food. Children, specially students is your town's future (: take good care of them. Winter is harder, you need to stack up some food. Don't build too much building in first years, but build enough.

												This is not exactly a bad game, and for a pro, I'd say it's quite catchy and interesting at very first. The idea of a slow-paced building sim + resources management looks great at first glance, but it wears out very quickly as the mechanichs and the whole concept of ""challenging"" becomes a boring rinse repeat;First, I've bought this game because unlike ""Sim City"" alikes, you deal with just a handful of people, where everybody perform a task for the good of the ""whole"". The concept sounds interesting, and again, challenging, but the execution didnt paid off, and why? The factor that makes this game ""difficult"" (it's not really challenging, its just meant to be hard) is because pretty much everyone MUST be working at something, the balance is way too strict, so if a few babies are born, food wont be enough anymore, people starve later. Same If some farmer die of old age, or even a random rock crush a random miner (yes, just like that...) or some forager or wood cutter gets killed by an animal, it unleashes a chain of bad events that cannot be countered within a resonable timeframe, everything is just too slow! months and seasons pass by and people just walk and roam slow regardless of their impending doom, there's no way to make them work harder aside from just removing some people from one profession to another. even so they will follow all the protocols wich makes it cost an entire season just for a ingot to get to the blacksmith, and while that does not work efficitently, other areas will lack... suddenly people start dropping dead left and right because the lack of food, or firewood, or because they did not had tools in time, and without them, workers never fills the quota wich leads to the lack of every possible thing. Rinse and repeat, a bunch of people die and you get to start again with a few survivors...After realizing how the mechanics of this game works, it gets boring after a few hours of fast fowards just to try to get a a few houses built or a bridge, wich by the way, will kill you! laborers will take logs to the construction sites as soon as they find one by the storage. No lumber, no firewood... and you know where it goes with this...  More often,  you find yourself expecting that a baby or two will be born or for someone to finally grow up so you can finally assign him to work at the mine because realocating anyone else for that matter would cause the total system colapse... and when they grow up, someone dies... someone gets crushed... this back and forth gaming is frustrating to say at least, theres basically no margins for Plan B or surplus.Once again, just because the balance is always leaning towards the bad side of events, it doesn't makes the game challenging and furthermore fun, instead, just punishing after a couple of hours.

												Banished was one of those games I was really looking forward to. And in truth it lived up to my expectations at first, but once you’ve built all there is to build and you pretty much got yourself a running settlement the game loses its charm. There is no challenge in it other than survival in winter and that is easily achieved midgame. There are way too few buildings and not enough production chains to entertain a good economic simulation. There are no wars, no disasters or anything that would shake up the gameplay a little. This game will be fun for the first 1-2hours, than you just watch seasons change and your people living… nothing more.			"

Oh look an indie town sim game, this'll be fun, how hard can it be?"">Start new game>Hard difficulty>First Winter>""Alright, I've got 200 fish and a whole house!"">Everyone freezes and starves to deathWhat's truly great about Banished is how challenging it is without even adding the concept of violence (unless you include trees falling on and killing my foresters ♥♥♥♥ YOU PINE!

												This is not exactly a bad game, and for a pro, I'd say it's quite catchy and interesting at very first. The idea of a slow-paced building sim + resources management looks great at first glance, but it wears out very quickly as the mechanichs and the whole concept of ""challenging"" becomes a boring rinse repeat;First, I've bought this game because unlike ""Sim City"" alikes, you deal with just a handful of people, where everybody perform a task for the good of the ""whole"". The concept sounds interesting, and again, challenging, but the execution didnt paid off, and why? The factor that makes this game ""difficult"" (it's not really challenging, its just meant to be hard) is because pretty much everyone MUST be working at something, the balance is way too strict, so if a few babies are born, food wont be enough anymore, people starve later. Same If some farmer die of old age, or even a random rock crush a random miner (yes, just like that...) or some forager or wood cutter gets killed by an animal, it unleashes a chain of bad events that cannot be countered within a resonable timeframe, everything is just too slow! months and seasons pass by and people just walk and roam slow regardless of their impending doom, there's no way to make them work harder aside from just removing some people from one profession to another. even so they will follow all the protocols wich makes it cost an entire season just for a ingot to get to the blacksmith, and while that does not work efficitently, other areas will lack... suddenly people start dropping dead left and right because the lack of food, or firewood, or because they did not had tools in time, and without them, workers never fills the quota wich leads to the lack of every possible thing. Rinse and repeat, a bunch of people die and you get to start again with a few survivors...After realizing how the mechanics of this game works, it gets boring after a few hours of fast fowards just to try to get a a few houses built or a bridge, wich by the way, will kill you! laborers will take logs to the construction sites as soon as they find one by the storage. No lumber, no firewood... and you know where it goes with this...  More often,  you find yourself expecting that a baby or two will be born or for someone to finally grow up so you can finally assign him to work at the mine because realocating anyone else for that matter would cause the total system colapse... and when they grow up, someone dies... someone gets crushed... this back and forth gaming is frustrating to say at least, theres basically no margins for Plan B or surplus.Once again, just because the balance is always leaning towards the bad side of events, it doesn't makes the game challenging and furthermore fun, instead, just punishing after a couple of hours.

												Like Anno Series, but smaller in actual game size (currently 300mb).Not cheaper, but more entertaining then from d4mn Ubisoft (I hate u!).I have lots of fun and I pressume this game will get a lot better in the future.Currently it lacks multiplayer and combat, AI too, this so actually combat would be useless (except for MP).Of course it is too early for a proper review.Still much more gain then for Anno 2070 (next expensive DLC with buildings in blue shadings available soon, only 9.99 :P /sarcasm) and getting an account at another d4mn online community (up(l)ay or what's it called? xD).Did I mention I hate Ubisoft as much as I do hate EA?

												TL;DR:If you like slow paced, peaceful ""chill"" building games, this will do it, but I expected more. First of all, Banished is NOT a bad game. I only dare to give a negative review because there are a lot of positive ones so I won't ruin their reputation.On the other hand, it is not a terribly interesting game. Since the game gives you all the tools from the beginning, you don't unlock anything new later, there is no ""research tree"" or anything similar. Basically you survive the first few winters, and then you are okay, the game switches to an ""idle game"".You can still trade for new seeds or animals you don't have yet, but this isn't enough to keep long-term interest.The game is also very peaceful, no enemies, no bandits, no wild animals. I count this a negative, but it might be positive for some people. "

												This game is amazing. It's a grown up game for grown ups, with no zombies, defences, creatures and barbarians. This game will make you think about city planning, and how to build up your city, while maintaining happiness and healthiness. My first playthrough, was a good one, noone died of hunger, cold or sickness. Until suddenly my blacksmith died of old age. Noone was able to fill his spot. Soon tools began to break and noone could do anything. We ran out of resources, and eventually a fire came and burned down my resource barn. Then it was just a waiting game until they all died of the cold winter to follow.Such a wonderful game, a city builder for competant mature people. it emcompasses the mindset of building, managing and protecting. You actually feel upset whenever any of your citizens die. One playthrough is enough to learn any lesson regarding shortages and the like.  Even now in it's unfinished state it is the game I've been waiting for, and has an excellent future for it, as long as the developer continues to add to it. I hope he reads this review, I'm very happy with this game.			"

												If it is on sale buy it - otherwise think about it firstIt's a fun game though it does get a little boring with time. The simplicity of the game is being touted as a positive, but this also means that the end-game gets a little boring. There might not even be an endgame. You can't really win the game, nor build some wonder or other mega-project.Most of the fun is in the early part of playing when you die constantly. Some small thing happens and your entire colony dies in a couple of minutes. Then you try again, this time avoiding the previous mistakes and each time your city last a little longer. At some point you make cities that could run forever, and then you kinda run out of stuff to do.			"

												I'm not sure where to begin... This is a brilliant little city building game and I'd say best I've played all 2014 BUT I felt it just was not a simulation in terms of classic simulations.. I felt it was mor eof an arcade game dressed up as a simulation game... The game works on Balance so of course you must feed your people... so I got them fed.. then they all got sick and died. and I mean all of them.. not like oh 3 got the Flu and died... I was not producing enough medicine to meet demands so they ALL died... so balancing food, medicine and then the fact they need firewood to... I felt like this was more of a hardcore arcade game built into a city simulator... I'm not going to recommend it to my Simulation/Strategy friends BUT I do want to recommend it to all.. it is a brilliant little game! So a 6/10 from me, now please buy it... but don't buy it! (Steam please give me a meh option... I endorse this game but I don't endorse it!)			"

												This isn't my usual kind of game, as I generally go for something with some form of combat.  However, I do like to build things.  I found this game oddly addictive.  I wouldn't say it was fun, but it kept me interested.  I'm not sure if this game qualifies as ""causual"", but that's what it was for me.  It filled a gap when I wasn't sure what I wanted to play, but knew I wanted to play something.  Starting this little town and growing it and it's people till it spanned the map was an interesting little side project.  I would indeed recommend this game if some likes games like it or just wants to try something different.			"

												I had high hopes. I imagined a game where I can build a town while fighting with all the sufferings of the medieval life: nature, wildlife, diseases. Fortunately, Banished's basic concepts are these things. Not so fortunate, this game is all about concept.If you have ever played a town/city or basicly any builder game, you know the drill: build efficiently and keep people happy (and alive). Banished was never intended to revolutionize the industry, which I think is a good thing considering all the games which started to rethink the basics and squeezed under it's own weigth.Following the minimalist path, there is a very short list of buildings you can build. You start with a cart and two families, it's your job to build them everything they need before winter. The graphics is great, I really love it, perfectly fits into the theme. The first hours are also awesome, understanding the UI and examining the possibilites took about 5 minutes. Than the winter came......And nothing happened. My town turned white, and people used firewoods to keep themselves warm. This was the part when things started to stink. Where are the extreme snowfalls you read in medieval books? Why people are not shivering or at least give a damn about the freezing cold in their unheated wooden house? Of course, when you run out firewood, people can't heat and eventually they die but somehow I expected a more complex behaviour.Okay, well, still playing hours with this game, After a few winter, suddenly a text box appeared: one of my villager was ran over by a boar. A textbox? You serious? WTF? Is the village mourning (as 30 people lived in my village at that point), or at least his family? Ney, Banished ignores all these community thingies. Oh, I almost forgot the merchants who are only willing to come by boat, after you have built an expensive harbor.Well, still playing. I have every resources to live happily, but the population is not growing. As I read in the forums, it is because I didn't build houses. They make children only if you build houses before (you read it right). In addition, the quality of the house really counts: in shanks, a couple can have one child only, while in a brick house more is allowed. (Not speaking about new-born children living in a house alone)At this point, I was really worried, but insisted on playing. My town grew and grew, and eventually, I've found my ultimate problem with this game: this game has no porpuse at all! Of course, build your town and stuff like that, but there is no achievement in this whole game. You built a school? Good. Now, you'll have educated workers, who theoretically works better.  Have a church? Now a guy can work there. Asking a townsman about his thougths? Rofl. A basic diplomacy (e.g. like in Tropico) would have been a good point but it was never in the cards.Banished stands on strong legs. The concept is great, but it is full of half-solutions. While playing I thought maybe after a certain size it will be more diverse and exciting, but no. It might become harder if you plan wrong, but not more exciting. Using the workshop you can put a lot of buildings in it, which are really great, worths a try, though they cannot fix the big problems with this game. There is not a single point where you can bind to your townspeople (I think they don't even have a name), or your town. This game is not that good, and not bad either but it is a real time-killer for sure. If you have a lot of free-time I recommend it, because it makes the hours fly, but if you play one or two hours only a day, maybe you should keep looking.			"

												This is a real city (or town) builder. There is no silly monsters or other form of combat, your only interaction with the world at large is through traders, and the occasional nomads.Banished is a brutal, unforgiving game. You will likely have many villages where your entire population dies from starvation, cold, or both, before you learn how much food and firewood you need to sustain your population. And then still disaster can strike if someone in the food or wood industry dies, and you don't have a new citizen to take over.Banished is one of those time sink games you simply cannot put down. I  recommend this to everyone who likes the city building genre even a little bit, but be prepared for a harsh learning curve.			"

												to get the full experience of this game all you must do is play for 30 min then refund it. there is nothing in this game besides bad AI. the only upgrade you can do in the game is wood house to stone house. and the ai is so bad it will kill your entire town out of starvation regardless of food stocks. AI will not help eachother in any task regardless of how many workers their are. farmers that are finished harvesting dont help the farmers still working, instead they go idle for the rest of the year. a worker will work on one end of the map, but live on the opposite side, so they get zero productivity. a farm can get only 15% in a year because the farmer takes so long to get their regardless of how many houses you build near the farm. this could be called a open beta at best but there is nothing being done to it. do not buy this.

Product received for free
												this game feels a bit like a development of Blue Byte's Die Siedler II. The core of the game is about running complex cycles of commodities and build up a sustaining community of banished settlers, which is quite challenging. Another nice and innovative aspect is, that you don't have enemies to conquer or defeat. The 'only' hazards for you are hard winters or natural disasters like a Tornado.And you can run it offline, which might be interesting for people on business trips or during assembly.7,5/10  points in my opinion, great single-player; regrettably no MP, but this would not fit to the game mechanix			"

												Tis game is a must if you enjoy city builders. You will find it quite rewarding. While after about 200 hours - you know the game in and out, there are still mods in development tat will make the game even more fun. After 300 hours spent in the game i'm still at it, and I can warmly recommend this game to anyone who love the city bulder genre for what it's worth.If you are a casual player, this is the game for you.10/10			"

												City building and planning at its best.  You aren't simply trying to keep the towns books in the black but trying to keep your people alive.Also if you ever happen to feel evil you can cause your whole town to freeze or starve to death which is a much darker way to kill them all off then going the natural disaster rout.  I call this the North Korea Simulator.			"

												To start of: Banished is a city builder type of game in the same vein as Age of Mythology, Anno series, The Settlers, Children of the Nile, ect. But how the game differs is in its design philosophy: Namely the game isn't so much about upgrading your settlements like in many of the aforementioned game and combat doesn't even exist at all.This is where the greatest enemy is the environment itself. Unless you play on a very easy setting - you will be controlling a small group of people who settle in a quite cold biome resembling the northen europe/russia climate which means; very harsh winters and a single harvesting opportunity in autumn.The game takes place in medieval times - they live in relatively poorly insulated tree houses which require fuel to sustain heat during the winter. The fuel is either coal dug from mines or firewood chopped from regular lumber. To keep this resource in a steady supply thereforth becomes a priority.The other challenge is farming. In most other city builders you can sustain your population with relatively low amounts of farmers or less amount of effort, more in vein with the modern farming revolution that allows more farming with less manpower. In this game however you need to dedicate at the absolute minimum 50% of your population to gathering food from different sources. This becomes a rather important issue throughout the whole game regardless of your population size. Since farmlands take up a lot of space, it presents an interesting dilemma for how you're supposed to plan your village. It doesn't work very well to try and plan like a city where farms are at the edges of society. Instead they need to be an integral part of where you put your housing for your people. If you think this is boring to read about - then you might not like this game. It is very important part of the game sadly that the game is very unforgiving about. Sometimes famines happen due to a overconsumtion of a few families, which makes food gathering so very important and even a relatively short famine has devestating effects that are nigh impossible to stop - often reducing your population with 75% which in turn makes it harder to gather food.When you get the food situation under control - you then need to make sure that your villagers can surivive the winter. Since climate gets quite cold during the winter you need to make sure that they have enough fuel. Thankfully this isn't as big an issue sometimes and can be helped in a number of more ways than farming. For example; in addition to providing more fuel you can also provide coats of leather, wool or both (which you aquire from livestock and hunting). You can also upgrade your houses from wooden houses to stone houses. Stone being a more difficult material to gather and requiring more manpower makes this largely a very late game thing. Especially when the woodcutters start to run out of convenient space and any reduction in your citizens needs are incredibly helpful. The benefits of building stone houses early exists but are ultimately rather small to begin with.This sort of makes winter an easy thing to deal with for anyone knowing what they're doing, and really - these are the only two needs for the citiziens to be satisfied. There are two other needs which are health and happiness but from what I've played - and I haven't played a lot: I haven't seen any need for satisfying health or happiness. My citizens live up until the 70 ages which in my opinion sounds like a massive lot in those times. Especially considering that most age related diseases starts at 40 - 50 years of age and only escalates. With that in mind I think that the game's idea of people's life expectancy is a bit unrealistic.Happiness is satisfied in two ways: Religion and Drinking. You can build chapels and taverns in the village where the population gathers to pray or drink their problems away. But there's no interesting dynamic to them. Everybody in the village seem to be able to become a member of a church, but they don't seen to take any time off to really go and pray. But I don't know if it's the same with taverns.Health is satisfied in two ways too. You can keep your citizens healthy through a varied diet so growing different corps has a benefit in that regard. And there's also a herbalist building which gathers herms in ""ancient forests"" which increases health as well. Since the game doesn't seen to have any mechanics of sickness (of exclusion of diseases which are not cured by herbalists but by doctors in a hospital), the importances of placing herbalists seem to be more trouble than it's worth.Diseases like I mentioned before are another aspects of the game: Namely catastrophies. These events are either fires or diseases. These seem to happen very rarely with low populations so again - it's a late game thing, but they're easy to solve. In the case of disease: Putting down a hospital or two makes it so that all sick people gathers there and are kept from the rest of your healthy population. Often they even get cured there somehow and can later return to the workforce with a surprisingly low amount of consequences. You combat fires by placing out wells around the town for your citizens to pull water from. Since I never have experienced a fire - I cannot even tell how that mechanic work.So to summarize: This is a game with a bunch of elements, that it tries to keep realistic. You mostly sit and wait for your workers to grow crops, grow the population, put down more places where crops are supposed to grow, waiting for them to gather materials (which I forgot to mention, but it's takes a long time and requires a lot of manpower). Sadly the game just isn't very fun. There are no interesting dynamics in play here. Yes people need to eat, yes people need to be kept warm. These are good basic mechanics, but what about town events or entertainment or traveling minstrels or raiders? The village seem so very isolated and it makes the game seem so much more barebones than its competitors. I think the game could have used some more time to think up better dynamics because ultimately it's boring to watch people strolling around and collecting stuff and waiting for opportunities to expand. This makes the player a slave to the game instead of the other way around which I think it should be. I like city builders a lot but this is in my opinion a poor one. You might still like it thanks to its difficulty but for me it was not a lot that I felt was worth going through the difficulty to make it feel rewarding enough - thereforth I don't recommend this game.

Product received for free
												TL;DR (whole review here: http://dagondogs.com/2016/10/19/banished-quick-n-dirty-review/ )Banished is a simple and slimmed-down blueprint of what makes up a city builder strategy game. It has some of the necessary pieces in place and there is certainly some satisfaction to the gameplay. However, Banished ends up being too basic and lacks the necessary risk/reward, or a sense of progression to convince me to keep playing. Not to mention, the over-reliance on mods to make this barebones game more interesting rubbed me the wrong way, especially in terms of the current price at the time of this review. If Banished were $5 I'd be more inclined to accept it for what it does, but at its current price of $20, I can't recommend it.			"

												It's a pleasent game but it's not managed to keep my interest. there is no end goal and there really is a limited experiance to be had here.you simply build a village and keep it stable with limited buildings and gameplay variety through the seasons and with the odd disasters/hard winter.think ballancing a spinning plate on your finger and then think of that as the key game dynamic for this title, ballance and going for as long as you can.Thankfully the steamworkshop has a generous selection of player created content that does fatten out the game a little but still with the missing end game it makes the entire experiance seem flat.

												This game is kind of fun, but some mechanics are so annoying it really doesnt make it worth the price. things to improve:- citizens hoard food, resulting in one household having hundrets of units of food, others have none (even though there are ways to deal with this, it really takes time to do or even notice that they are hoarding)- hungry citizens die way to quick. they can literally walk 500m and they are dead-even worse, hungry citizens do not cease their work and go eat something and just die while working (had this multiple times, food was in the storages, but hungry citizens would not go eat) - the AI is kind of primitive. resources will always have to be taken to a storage before being taken to where they are needed (a hungry farmer takes the food to the storage, then to his house, then he eats. most of the time he dies on his way. builders clean up a building area, take the resources to a storage, take the same resource from the storage to the workplace. this game could be a lot of fun, especially if there were rival towns to fight against. but for a game thats only focussed on the management of a town, i think this is really underachieving.

												With almost 40 hours in the game i can honestly say that the concept is awesome. However the mechanics are way off. Where to begin.... i could say the same thing as so many other ""farmers starving while harvesting"" but i wont. Instead how about a crop field being worked by 6 farmers (max) not clearing the harvest before winter takes it away, mind you my storage barns are right next to the fields. How about the respawn rate of herbs and gatherer items. Even placed in a dense forest they drop off very sevrerly after the 2nd year.  lets talk about the ai pathing, even with stone roads placed to every building/field/stockpile they still decide to cut a straight line to their destination. while on the topc of AI how much sense does it make that a single person living in a home takes 300 units of venison and 150 units of squash. even with a market the people take way more food than they need. Moving on.... the mining and stone cutting speed OH MY GOD. a whole year to mine 45 iron with 10 miners, again stockpile stupid close to the mine. Also the aging system, children take 3-4 years before they become laborers or students but people can die of old age in 3-4 years, really. By year 35 i had a lost probably 45 citizens to old age. i get maybe the shortened lifespan due to primative conditions but it wasnt that friggin short.All in all, its a great game with mods turned on. However you cant get achievments with mods turned on. This game needs a serious overhaul.			"

												This is an incomplete game. There has not been any updates in over a year. The only thing the developer is willing to do is getting the game to work on OpenGL so he can capitalize on the OSX and Linux communities and milk this incomplete product as much as he can. I would urge you to stay away unless you enjoy incomplete alpha versions of games... I will take it a step further and suggest staying away from all future titles from Shining Rock Software LLC, the developer has made it perfectly clear that he has no interest in finishing this title and will likely hold the same sentiment in future titles.

												Not complex or deep. Folks who say so and recomended it to me seldom play for more then a few hours. Very little complexity other then providing food. Sometimes that is a fine thing in a game, but ones you mastered it there is nothing to keep you going (And no it aint no minecraft either mods will not solve it for free this time. If you dont put great content and great design in from the start do not expect moders to do so for you either). With so many great builder games out there, do not pick this one unless you have an interest in studying it.			"

The following are the worst problems I noticed:- Guy goes off to chop wood. Has raisins in inventory.  Wants to go home. Dies of starvation.- Hunter wants to hunt. Deer roam in town like they own the place. Cant gather food.- The robots of Banished are too stupid to borrow a bit of food from their neighbors to save their family. "

												It's was one of those indie games that had great potential. Created by just one dev it got praised on YouTube by many. but allas it seems that the game is now completely broken.I played it for a while and based my building order on what I found online and for a great while is goes great, building up your food, fuel, wood, stone and iron. Then you decide to expand your town a bit hmm food supplies go down so build another fishery you think right? WRONG, I had 50 people and 32 were on food duty and quess what, all dead due to starvation with at least 150 fish in each house and an ample supply in stock. This could simply be a bug but unfortunately the one dev stopped updating the game september 2016 and it seems he totally abbandoned the game. The website receives no more updates, the forum is full of spam and yet the game still sells on steam for €20. Now I'm not going to write an in depth analysis on what's wrong because I would just repeat others but I'd not recommend this to anyone since the game is broken and the dev clearly doesn't care anymore which is a real shame because Banished had such great potential.

												This game has potential even with the mods, but the AI's as lot of the negative ney sayers would say. Is broken. I have follow individual characters and seen how a hunter would stand next to a deer and he doesnt hunt it just goes off, and it says he is idling... he stats are high yet, the deer just walk past him in peace....Maybe it's the Deer God, who knows, but that is just an example of many broken ai, I have watch my food storage gone from 8000 with only 100 people down to nothing in secs and people start starving even though there was an abudance of food secs ago in 5x Fast Forward.... with the farms and orchards, and fish farms i have...I understand this is trying to tell a story of those being banished from their home land and struggling to survive but seriously the ai is broken. The Bigger the population gets the more you have to micro manage each individual and slow time down to standard otherwise the individuals would spend most their time wandering all over the map rather than doing the set tasks. Orchards & Crops need to have an automatic option to set to harvest and /or cut trees otherwise you pass too much time micromanaging just the crops Now if you have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) than this game is for YOU!!!!Less this the game is has potential for being a very good city simulator/builder just need to fix the ai/hunger/jobs/crops/orchards.... Maybe someone might come up with a Mod for all of this... in the meantime. . . sorry... I want to give a thumbs up...			"

You not only decide how to develop the city, but you must also consider the finer details. HOW WILL YOUR CITIZENS SURVIVE? You take each life into your own hands, and inevitably your going to lose some of them. This game specializes in the school of hard knocks. But once your graduate you'll find yourself thriving instead of struggling and in the end. That is what delivers the thrill that this game really is.			"

												As a fan of city builders, when I saw this game pop up on the store I had to have it and I finally did. Normally when getting into a city builder, you know what you're getting into for the most part and I find most city builders miss the element of a challenge. Banished is a very challenging game. The first year of your town is always the hardest. When the first winter came, was always the point when everything just went to crap. There is a tutorial, which teaches you how to built things, assign workers and stuff like that. So it is very useful, but I found that after a few failed attempts, I needed a little help from YouTube to learn how to survive your first year. Once you do and get the ball rolling it is incredibly fun and a phenomenal game to say the least. The team that made this, and by team I mean one guy. ONE GUY MADE THIS GAME! One guy made this, and Call of Duty still sucks♥♥♥♥♥with three huge companies making them. For $19.99 this game is a steal. This game will work your brain, and kills so much time it's insane. The few hours I've spent on this game blew on by and I loved every second of it. Pick this game up, turn on some music and just enjoy yourself. 10/10			"

												Banished is one of those indie games that revives one of the old genres that has been abandoned by the mainstream: city building. You start as a group of exiles banished from their homeland and sent to live in the untamed new world. You build houses, set aside land for farming, chop down trees...do what you'd think you'd do to survive. One of the quirks of the game is that you have no direct control over what your citizens do. Instead, you just assign a number to a job, and free hands fill it. Honestly, while this idea mostly plays well, it can be very aggravating. Sometimes, you want your miner to live right by the mine, but he instead lives on the other side of town. Nothing you can do there. Also aggravating is citizens starving despite having stockpiled food.The game is very unforgiving and your first town will fail quickly. Yet it's a very fun time waster, and can be relaxing. When people aren't dying, that is. It's like Dwarf Fortress, except not as complex or insane.			"

												Banished is an indie game of the year contender.  It is brutal and unforgiving, and at no point are you ever truly on top of the situation as a couple of mistakes and some bad seasons can kill the most successful, thriving town, slowly, over many turns as you frantically try to claw it back only to inevitably fail and watch your dwindling hamlet die of starvation or freeze to death.  Ignore those who say the game lacks depth; it may not have tech trees and upgrades but it is incredibly well balanced, no matter how far you advance into the life of your village, hyper-realistic, and beautiful to look at and to listen to.  What a game, what an addictive, brutal game.			"

												This game is amazing! I'm going to let you know right from start that this game will be challenging. I've had a couple cities perish until I finally found good balances for resources. The music, the graphics, the tiny little details for the villagers' daily lives that go on in the game are wonderful. The game is just a blast to play. While you might think ""What if I want to eventually fight something?"" you're not going to have time to think that because you'll be more concerned about how you're going to keep your food storage constant enough to maintain your villigers during the winter.Gaming Tips:I personally recommend building a fishing dock first thing when you start unless you're not near water, then I would go for the hunter's cabin instead. I also play on 5x speed but that is also up to you. Just make sure you have firewood and food for when winter comes because a lot of times the first winter makes or breaks a village. And with crop fields, Have your farmers there at early spring, then once the fields have been harvested (usually sometime in autum, it depends) then have them work on other things in the village so they won't be wasting their time until early spring returns (or if the snow thaws in late winter)I can say that this game will be eating up many hours of free time.

												Great rts game. The lack of enemies aloows for much more intricate economic development. Has a bit of a learning curve, but thats what makes it fun. Mods are pretty great, but the the vanilla game a dozen runs or so first. It is amazing on its own.			"

 If your going to play this game, please play the tutorials first, or look up how to play online.  This game can be really fun, if you know how to play it. I basically learned through trial and error, and I don't believe I ever looked up how to play or even played a tutorial. This game is mainly about managing your citizens right so that they all don't starve to death or freeze to death.Here's a few tips if your too lazy to look some up or play a tutorial or two:1. Food is the first most important thing you'll need. But start with building a pasture, the fishing dock, hunting cabin, and/or the gathering hut. Because the crop and orchard fields, might not be cleared fast enough for you to grow food before winter comes. Also the orchards won't produce anything for at least three years.2. Firewood the next improtant thing, other wise your citizens will freeze to death. So build a forester lodge and wood cutter ASAP. btw when buiding a forester lodge, gather's hut, hunting cabin, and herbalist hut, make sure to not build anything else inside the yellow circle, but the one buidling. Though I like to put the forester lodge, hunting cabin, and gatther's hut all together.3. Next you'll want to build the mine and stone quarry, so you'll have the materials you'll nedd to build more.4. Next build a blacksmith and tailor. Because you do NOT want to run out of tools for your citizens. Which causes them to produce less and also the symbol is really annoying.5. Build a herbalist next. Because when the citizens aren't that healthy, they are known to idle more, and basically just not really doing wha tyou want.6. Oh, I almost forgot. I like to keep the jobs board thing in the top left corner, the map in the top right corner, the events log in the bottom left corner, and the thing that tells you your towns name, the resources you have, and the average town health and happiness, I like to keep that next to the town log, on it's right. Hope this helps. Also I'd give this game 8.5/10. Because I'm addicted and can't stop playing once I start.  "

												BanishedBanished is a sort of Civilisation, or City Simulator based in the past, where the general theme is to expand your town/city while managing your resources and citizens closely.Visually I find this game very pleasing. The trees, water and even rocks look very nice, and the animations are also done well. There isn’t a huge amount to say about the audio, but it does the job. 	The game itself is hard to talk about. You start with a small number of villagers, and have to have them collect resources such as wood, stone, and food, while building new houses for them to live in. Houses allow your population to grow, giving you more children, which eventually will become adults and workers. That all sounds fairly standard, and even simplistic, but do not be fooled; this game can destroy you. That may sound somewhat strange, when you consider the fact there are no roaming barbarians, vicious animals, or in fact any enemies at all. No, the difficulty is the extent of micro management that is required to keep your town functioning. It’s about finding balance. You might want to build several houses for your villagers, so they can sleep, and take shelter from the weather. That’s all well and good, but that one simple choice now has several consequences such as the need for more wood to be converted to firewood to keep the people warm, it will also increase the population as people start to have children. More children will eventually mean more workers, but in the short term they’re just more mouths to consume precious food. You also have to consider the materials used for the house, and how many people you assign to build it, will no longer be collecting those resources for the time it takes to build. This is just one example, but that is the kind of thing that makes it what it is. Every choice has to be thought through, even the positioning of the houses. A house too far away from the occupants work area means less efficiency and less resources gathered. 	Your citizens will need to be closely monitored, as they have general health, which can be maintained with a Herbalist making remedies, happiness which is very hard to manage, but can be helped with buildings like Taverns, and Hunger needs to be monitored so they don’t starve to death. Interestingly your citizens will grow old, and they will die of old age, which is an easy thing to forget, and if you do, you may end up with a very old town, incapable of having children, and so you lose by attrition. Weather affects them too, meaning you need to make some warm clothes for winter, and light for summer, and maintain a steady supply of tools for people to actually do their jobs with. 	Overall the mechanics are very solid and are easy to understand, but difficult to master. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows for the game, unfortunately. The pacing of the game can be extremely slow, even when you manually adjust the timer to the fastest setting. Some of the controls, like having someone stop their current job and start doing something else (or work somewhere else) seems very much in the hands of the AI. Sometimes people just won’t do what you want. The biggest thing with Banished though, is ‘the point’. As in ‘what’s the point?’. Truth be told, there isn’t one. There are no technologies to advance, no enemies to conquer, no end of the game or unlocks. You simply just go until you fill the map (which looks quite small). Now, I appreciate that not all games have ‘a point’ per se (ex: Minecraft, Space Engineers, Garry’s Mod) but the majority do, and the ones that don’t are usually based on the player creating something unique, and are multiplayer. Banished has none of those features. Conclusion; to wrap it up I’d say that Banished is a well made and balanced game, with an emphasis on resource and micro-management in a slow paced environment. A recommendation really depends on the person considering buying the game. If you’re the sort of person that likes to pick up a game, play it from start to finish and put it down for a while, this game is likely not for you, so avoid it at all costs. However, if you’re the sort of person that likes a nice, slow paced game, with heavy man-management systems and are not too bothered by campaigns or story driven games, then this is right up your street.Assuming you’re the latter category, I’d give it 8.5/10 "

												This game is outstanding. It is beautiful, the UI elements are easy to understand, the game mechanics are really good. Overall just a really solid experience.Constructive criticism:-The logic for storing and limiting items in the marketplace is counter-intuitive.-It would be great if item limits could be building-specific.-I would love if there were some defense / attack elements - but that is an entirely different kind of game.

												There's some small bugs but nothing game breaking. It's a good town simulator, kinda like a prettier version of Dwarf Fortress, where the only threat is proper resource management (which admittedly can still be difficult).Just keep an eye on your reserves and don't expand too fast. Always have an excess of food, and be prepared for disasters.			"

												This game is pretty fun and a great value. Surviving the winter makes it interesting in the early game and the scramble for more resources makes the late game fun. I liked turning my little village into a good looking town. I do think there needs to be a bit more end game, but there might be and I just haven't discovered it yet.			"

It is an easy game to learn and there are multiple terrains and difficulty settings to keep it interesting and fresh.  Once I got the mechanics down, I went to the Banished Workshop and downloaded some amazing mods that haved helped extend the playtime of this game.  I give Banished 2 thumbs up.			"

												The mission sounds simple: You have a few banished people that want to settle their new life in a new untouched piece of land. Your only worries are food, a warm place, tools, clothing...Banished impresses me with a highly complex system how every single object (Food, Materials, People) interacts with each other and you have to maintain a very fragile balance in the city to keep it growing. One mistake can lead into danger to threaten your peaceful city. Are you ready for this challenge?			"

												Banished is an outstanding achievement for a one man team. The game has very complex mechanics that reward the player that experiments with the environment of the game. This even though everything is very well explained at the beginning, at least the basics. The tutorials are clear and well made, short but not so to skip anything important that the beginner needs to know. I managed to make a village of 500 people in 7-8 hours of gameplay. However to achieve this village I dumped two villages for a total of 42h of gameplay. It has high replayability value, with different terrains conditions and seeds, try different resource gathering strategies, or different town layouts. I feel I beat the game (I will truly beat it when I get 900+ villagers) but nonetheless I am curious about what other possible strategies there are to achieve a 300+ pop. An example of other gathering strategies, build a lot of woodcutters and build many tradeposts, then buy stone and iron with the surplus of fuel. This way you don't need any mines or quarries. Make a lot of hunters and pastures with cattle, to get a surplus of leather, then make a few tailors, get a surplus of coats and sell them for food + stone + iron + coal. etc... etc...I have recommended very few games but this one deserves it. Go on and read the bad reviews, you will see most of them haven't played the game more than 20h or haven't achieved 300+ pop. They say wether that it's too easy or that it's too hard, if they say it's too easy it is because it is easy... at the beginning at least. After the 300 threshold it gets pretty challenging to coordinate supplies and the time the villagers take to get to houses from workplaces to avoid a deathmarch. Anyway, buy this game, for the sake of the developer and for a bug free release (yes, bug free!).Hugs :D			"

												I was excited for the reboot of simcity last year and like pretty much everyone else was horribly dissapointed. This game has restored my faith in city building games. It is complex and if you do not use the wiki you will have a blast failing many many times. I would advise trying it on hard and just learning from that as I found easy it to be just a little simple even my first try. Ive put hours into this game and am still not finished. The graphics are incredible, they may look a little dated but this is done by one guy. The idea that a mod kit is coming out soon is just amazing. Once the community becomes invovled I think this game will explode more then it already has. This is easily a 30$ or 40$ game, for 20$ it is a steal! BUY AND YOU WILL ENJOY!			"

												A decent game at heart that is hugely complex and great fun to delve into. I would recommend getting this for anyone who likes city builder type games and are also impartial to the timeframe.Its worth noting that this is probably the hardest city building game you will play as you can quite easily go from a happy population to a massive decline and eventual ruin. You have to carefully add certain structures whislt maintaining food and fuel supplies or your population will starve/freeze. Eventually you will also need to balance clothing and tools or your villagers will simply become awfully inefficient which will have a knock on effect to food and fuel and eventually cause starvation and freezing!Its bloody difficult!My only concern with the game is that whilst its been an amazing feat for 1 person to create it he is not making the dev team any larger and updates are pretty much non-existant. I regret to say but I can't honestly see this game being finished within the next year or two. Its just moving at too slow a pace due to it being 1 bloke doing the work.Still its a little gem of a game if you can ignore that.			"

I liked the fact that there is no money in the game; it's not about getting rich and piling up cash, it's about making a town that works. Very fulfilling.Some other reviewers complained that there wasn't a whole lot of content and that they got bored fast. I have no idea what they were talking about. I liked that all content is unlocked at the start. That doesn't mean you wanna build the biggest most expensive building right at the start, in fact it's not to your benefit to do that, but what that does is make the gameplay very open and non-linear. I can set my own goals and priorities. I've played 32 hrs + and still going strong, I can tell I'll do double that no problem. For the price, I think that's a great deal.			"

												i recomend it highly. but personally i wish i could love it. it is well made. looks nice (dont judge the super zoom in too hard. its a city builder) and really is very fun. but it is hard. i made a well designed very good town. but then my people just got old. and everyone died. no idea why they call it zen like. its not. you cant stop building. because these SOB's just wont screw in mom and dads house. they want a fancy new house. maybe they will ""fix"" that. but till then i am too stupid to win. still fun.

												At the time of writing, I've played 8 hours, and so far, it's pretty damn good.I picked up the game in a flash sale, being very wary of whether it'd actually be good or not, and I can safely say, money well spent.  I'd even go to say it'd be well spent at full price.  The game's graphics are done excellently, with their only slight fault being when zoomed in fully (at which point they're still better than most 'city' builders).  So far I've only played the game on it's easiest difficulty, and so I can't say how well the game plays on harder settings, however I hope to move up soon, as I've pretty much mastered the game at the moment.How does the game function as a 'city' builder?  It doesn't, but it is a good village or small-ish town sim.  The main challenge is to stay alive, being able to produce food and firewood before it's too late.  My main problem with my first 3 attempts (which lasted 30 mins maximum) was that I was running before I could walk.  I tried to get more houses so that I could produce more, but this in turn meant I needed to produce even more, but it's easy to find your mistakes.After you finally have a 'town' that won't trip over after it's just left the front door, you're free to expand at your own will.  You could stay as a town with only 30 inhabitants building up a stockpile, however eventually the town will become too productive.  And I don't mean with resources.  From time to time you'll accidentally♥♥♥♥♥♥something up and about 10-20 people will die, rapidly and without warning, but if you play your cards right, you'll recover pretty quickly.Only problem?  Once you have sovled your seemingly unsolvable but then easily solvable crisis, you can build exciting buildings such as the town hall (which seeminly just produces graphs, because why not), or a brewery.  There's little to expand to after you've mastered your town, except pencil pushing, booze and possibly religion (in my case as overlord govenor, there is no such thing as religion, unless there's and option to add satanism simply for a laugh, which I haven't found so far). TL;DR:  Solid game, 8/10, play it at maximum speed for a challenge and only pause if you've really cocked it up.  Buy it, it's made by one guy.  "

												Banished is a fantasticly soothing experience - as long as you don't make a mistake. Although not as hard as the likes of Dwarf Fortress (I see many comparing the two) it punishes you hard for your failures. A simple shortage in tools can send you spiralling out of controll until the whole village dies of starvation. But that's exactly what makes this game so great.Graphics-wise it is no Anno but looks nice enough to not be annyoing. The music is a little artificial but not distracting. The gameplay is superb and will get you hooked for at least 40 hours. The lategame is lacking a bit in content but the developer says he will be opening the game up to mods soon so there is at least some content to be expected.All in all Banished is in no way perfect but by far the best builder game you will have played in years. I wholeheartedly recommend buying it.			"

												If you enjoy city builders and managment, Banished is a great game for you to check out. Upon release, I would play in twelve hour+ bursts, trying to figure out the optimum layout to make the most successful place for my little banished people to live. It's challenging, it's humorous, and it will make you cry. I took a bit of a break from the game. but I re-purcased the game on Steam having previously bought it on GoG.com, and I'm working my way through the achievements again. It's still just as much fun as it was before, and I cannot wait to see if there will be a Workshop for the game, or the ability for other mods.			"

												Right around 140 hours I finally came up for air and out of Banished. This game is truly amazing. As a long time player of AOE2 and Civilization 2 (now 5), I'm always ready for god mode. The only thing missing from those games were the pure economic pursuit. Sometimes I don't want to worry about waging war and weighing decisions on doing a technology instead of a military arsenal or vice versa. I've longed for just building up an amazing empire. An empire of balance and awesome. Banished gives me that fill every time I log in. For a game under a GB and graphics smoother than most currently release games, I sometimes wondered if I was in some awesome part of gaming heaven were developers cared about quality instead of money. Turns out the Banished dev is just a rare guy who has an amazing insight into how a game should be developed, supported and nurtured. The only warning I give users with this game is the same one I give when you play Civ5: You'll turn into a liar. ""I'll log after one more building. I'll go to bed after one more farm. I'll go to be...never.""			"

												This game is something else. I love and hate it. You got to decide on your own.It's a bit like the simple minded sibling of Settlers or the Anno series. Don't get me wrong, it's fun, it's addictive and surely worth it's money, but as to everything there are some downsides.First thing you always have to keep in mind - this game is a one man show so obviously it has it's limits.The game is quite challenging, you got to trial and error and it's not forgiving. Screw up a bit and your populus goes down the drain and the system collapses. (My) The main issue though is, there is not a huge variety of produced goods and production chains.After an hour into the game you've seen all buildings and if you're reading the (very good) ingame help you should know how it works. You can fill in the blanks with common sense, farmers seed in spring, harvest in autumn, orchards need 3 seasons for the trees to grow before they bear fruit and anything less than 2 lifestock will not breed...Then it's up to you. Took me about 5h and 3 restarts to figure out how to sustain a populus of 100+, now there's nothing left to do if that's where a city sim ends for you - to just see it all.The goal now is to optimize the outputs, delivery routes, make most of the given space available - ever looked into ""Anno blueprints""? That's where the game continues from having ""seen it all"" and it's for you.With the townhall you'll get a good tool to monitor production and consumption, before that it's somewhat of a gut feeling if your folks will survive - go from there.So yeh, once you figured the game out, the challanges are the randomly generated maps (from random number seeds so you can reproduce them), the random incidents like sicknesses, accidents and catastrophes and to make the best of it.What's nice too is that you aren't bothered with violent desicions as this is utopia - no crime, no military, no combat. The harshest decision you have to make is if you let the dude who got stuck behind some buildings, due to a (most likely) bug in the pathing, starve or freeze to death, of if you remove the building and set him free... ;)Personally I am deeply satisfied the game is so successful. I hope the developer now got a financial buffer to hire a team and focus on his next game. In my opinion he got what it takes to make great games - the kind of games that don't spoonfeed you everything and give you a running kick right in the groin, laughing at you if you mess up.Also noteworthy, the game purrs like a cat performance-wise. On my machine i5-3570/GTX470 it runs 1920x1200 all maxed out with 60FPS (vsynch) at all times, so I guess it's also to run smooth on quite old machines.So I'd summarize the game is ""survive->optimize"" rather than ""buildup->micromanage"" - if that's good or bad is up to you now.

												First I want to say I love the game even if it is annoyingly hard to survive and you have to restart because everyone dies. But it is ridiculously addictive as you want to succeed so I have racked up about 20 hour so far just trying to survive in this harsh game of life and death and I have restarted maybe more then 30 times.  As every little thing I do has massive consequences like if I choose to send say 10 of my 20 farmers to mine iron next season I may have no food but over all I have had fun trying not to kill my citizen’s and progress my town in to a sustainable little community. I would say some things need to be added like being able to move goods from one stock pile to the next so you done have to had black smiths right next to a stock pile the is like say 1Km from your town but they are small things that would make it fun or even adding a multiplayer aspect to the game where I can trade with a friend that plays the game. Not having those things does not make the game unplayable but it would make it even more fun and more competitive. Over all I would rate this game a 8 out of 10			"

I would like to see them add the ability to learn new things as you upgrade.  In the school learn about different processes to build bigger and better buildings.  So far they only allow you to upgrade from a wood home to a brick home. I have added difficulty as I learn how everything works and it can be a challenge.			"

Posted: March 5, 2014
												So after a few (22 for now...) hours playing this game I feel I can leave a relatively fair review.Most of the hours I have played the game are all from one village, the other bits were from the ""how on Earth do I play this game"" period, as I only did the basic tutorial, and this was time well spent as it was very enjoyable learning the game the hard way and seeing what works and what doesn't work well.Onto the actual game I guess, no other way to say it apart from it is fantastic. Why is this game fantastic? Firstly the gameplay itself is challenging, over all the time I have had on the same world I haven't managed to get to 500 population as of yet, but I am sure that will come with time. For anyone who likes simcity-like games I would highly recommend giving this a try.Secondly, the minor details in the game are fantastic, the most notable example of this I have seen is when a group of nomads arrive in your village, they actuall walk across the map to the Town Hall and then mill around outside until they are granted citizenship or denied it. The other minor details include the villages actually performing relavent actions to the job they are doing, farmers with till the soil, fishermen will stand out on the pier and fish, crops and trees actually grow before your eyes, and these actions hold true for all the jobs. Third, the graphics are simply amazing, the water reflects (optionally) everything, every person and animal are all 3d models, as well as the buildings. While there is some repetition between certain aspects of buildings they are not glaringly obvious and do not ruin the immersion in the game. However not all is perfect in this game a handful minor bugs, which are to be expected when a game is new and even more so when developped by one person. For me personally there have only been 2 or 3 major issues where the game crashed, but the auto save feature can be set to save as often as 1 minute so there won't be any major losses in the event of a crash. To me these crashes don't hinder my game play experience due to the minor set backs that they can impose. I feel like these bugs won't be around too long either as the dev has already started a beta program for users to opt-in to test builds while the bugs are being ironed out, the first of which already addresses several of the crash issues that have been reported.As I said if you are a fan of simcity-like games definitely give this one a go. Even at 22 hours in I feel like the game has been worth my money and would recommend to others to give it a try,			"

												Simply put, Banished is a town builder where the goal is to have your village thrive. It's The Oregon Trail meets Sim City. From a handful of families to hundreds of people, you re-create how the ancient settlements of a few people became the burgeoning cities of today. The game itself has a few simple mechanics and a very stripped down UI which can be viewed in individual parts. The graphics are acceptable (nothing too amazing), and the controls are intuitive. It may not be your cup of tea as there is no win condition and there's no real economy building, so if you are interested, take a look at some game play videos which go over the game as they help illustrate how the game is played and how it feels.

												Almost any other Real Time Strategy Game boils down to one question: ""How fast can you expand?""  'Banished' chops the legs out from under that philosophy.  Expand too fast and your population explodes, quickly consuming all your resources and irrevicably crippling your economy.  But, of course, if you expand too slow, you will never have a population too begin with...It is a balancing act so delicate that the first sign of complacency spells disaster.  The only thing not critical is time.  You will forget it is time to eat, time to sleep and even time to go to work.  The first time I sat down to play, 12 hours vanished without hardly looking up.  So take a hint, set an alarm clock.  It is an excellent game.			"

												In one word this game is brutal. I walked through the tutorial and couldn't wait to begin my survival and micro manage my small clan and increase thir health, happiness and overall survivla Unortinatly more than two thirds died to starvation. It's this kind of trial and error that make banished special. On my second attempt I put my recources to food and then died of cold. Third attempt i put a balance betwwen fire wood and food. My vilage died of expoiser. After try and try to find the perfect balnce between shelter, firewood and food. Though this laerning process i found my self slowly liveing longer and longer each time. On my eith try i finally reaced a population of 100 and then lose a third of my population due to a diese. With so many iffrent things that could go wrong and only one way things could go write it becomes addictave. I despretly want to prosper, live and be overall succesfull. The game coul use improvment in some areas. The tradding were you need to bring supplies to the dock. This is an assue for a game as simple as banished this over compicates things and needs work. In additon you can't have more than one auto save at once wich can be annoying at times when trying to run multiply citys at onece. In the end banished is overall a great game. It's fun, addictive, hard (in a good way), and a learing proccess that takeshours and hours to full master. I give it 8.9 out of ten in the end because of a bad auto saveing and for the importance of trading i would like to see improvemnt here.			"

												This has got to be one of the most hardcore builders I have ever had the pleasure of playing. It looks simple at first glance but brother let me tell you it is anything but. I have already seen so many of my thriving towns go straight down the toilet in less than a year due to some unforseen disaster or watched them spiral into a slow death of attrition and getting a town started is a challenge in and of itself in the first place. It really makes me appreciate how difficult life must have been for pioneers. I can't peel away from this game even when I have much ""flashier"" ones in my library. Kudos to the developer and I can't wait for mods to open up on this bad boy. Highly recommended!			"

This is the start of a great game - I hope it's developed furtherThe good: Its nice to see a city builder game without any ""fighting"" aspects to itThe mechanics are pretty good - intuitive UI, no apparent bugsIt's immersive - you can lose track of time pretty easilyThe bad:There's not much ""bad"" per se, they just need to add more to it. The following are suggestions to the creatorsTerrain - It's pretty repetative with the same types of trees, hills, rivers, and lakes. How about adding some ocean front? Or slightly different climate types? Swamps? Different resources on different terrain typesBuildings - Every building in the game is available right from the start. Since research doesn't seem to be on the menu, why not trade for ""plans"" of more advanced buildings, like you do with crop seeds and livestock. How about multi story housing to improve city density, or irrigation to improve crop production? Variety - Like the terrain, a lot of things can get a little repetitive. Why not have traders with wagons, or sailing ships, not just rowboats. Trade with different cultures? Or build boats/wagons and go out and trade for yourself! How about different appearance for bulding depending on culture (e.g. a ""asian"", or ""south american"" appearing buildings?			"

												A decent game at heart that is hugely complex and great fun to delve into. I would recommend getting this for anyone who likes city builder type games and are also impartial to the timeframe.Its worth noting that this is probably the hardest city building game you will play as you can quite easily go from a happy population to a massive decline and eventual ruin. You have to carefully add certain structures whislt maintaining food and fuel supplies or your population will starve/freeze. Eventually you will also need to balance clothing and tools or your villagers will simply become awfully inefficient which will have a knock on effect to food and fuel and eventually cause starvation and freezing!Its bloody difficult!My only concern with the game is that whilst its been an amazing feat for 1 person to create it he is not making the dev team any larger and updates are pretty much non-existant. I regret to say but I can't honestly see this game being finished within the next year or two. Its just moving at too slow a pace due to it being 1 bloke doing the work.Still its a little gem of a game if you can ignore that.			"

												This game is the Sim City of the medevil period. Challenging at times, especially at the begining of a game and durring disasters that radomly plauge your town. It requires a lot of micro-managing and foreplaning. Only drawback is that once you reach a certian point there is nothing much else to do.			"

												This game is good....if you arent expecting your town to make weapons and invade other towns,the game is hard enough so it doesnt need warfare,all you need to do is to help your town survive,and trust me that isnt as easy as it sounds.I dont have enough thumbs to point upward.			"

												Even though it's still in developement and thus early access it is a fully playable game without any major bugs or even crashes. The basics of the game stand and you can surely play it for some hours before its addiction lets go of you! It's missing some more advanced buildings that keep you going once you got your town working with every building and a larger population but I'm sure they'll add that later!			"

												This is a really good game; it is immersive and has great music and audio you will find yourself killing lots of your towns and will screw yourself over by building to quickly. The game is easy to run and runs at a steady 40 fps on my computer and most of the time I can’t run high end graphically games but the graphics on this game are not the best but have definitely got a nice quality about them... In the future I would like to see a multiplayer but overall I recommend this game a lot and is worth the money.			"

												The best sim game I have ever played! Banished is addictive fun, your small band of survivors versus the elements. I love that it is single player, engaging and will constantly keep you adjusting to perfect your town (fires, diseases, and harsh winters make for some cool difficulty factors). This game really is worth the money, do yourself a favor pick up a copy or two, you will be glad you did!			"

												Ever played Stronghold? You'll find this is very similar in the best ways. Essentially you have to keep your town alive. Give them food, shelter, firewood, and clothes and expand when you can. It's a lot more intimate than any other citybuilder I've ever played. All your townfolk are known by name. They live one family per house. They have kids who grow up, get married, move into another house, and have their own kids. Your people are your most valuable resource. Without expanding your living quarters and as such your population, you will have nobody to work your farms or your forges. You can invest heavily into the future by building schools to educate your citizens' kids to be better workers, and keep them supplied with medicinal forest herbs to keep them alive longer. It's very rewarding to build a town of 200+ people when you only start from 10. You will run out of food, you will run out of fuel, and you will run out of storage space if you do everything else correctly. Tips: build orchards as soon as you can because they take 3 years to mature, before that the trees won't bear fruit. Don't build a trading post until 3 years in. Every winter you should reassign your farmers to other duties, like building. Don't build pastures until you have a trading dock ready and enough tradeable equipment to buy some animals. Don't bother with a stone quarry until much later. Never stop expanding: barring starvation build at least one new house per year. If you don't expand, even if you do everything else right you will lose people simply because there won't be enough children being born to keep up with people dying of old age.			"

												Very laid back, simple and polished city builder. Great to kick back with after a hard day at the IRL coal face. It's like Dwarf Fortress-lite with all the spikey bits taken out, oh, and a completely sensible and polished UI. After a few hours of play (I picked it up prior to steam unlock via the dev's website), it doesn't look too deep though, so I'm unsure about its longevity and ongoing replay value. On the plus-side, there is procedural generation for the landscapes; there is difficulty levels; and disasters. Also there is/will be soon™ an API for clever folks to mod the game with. And on that basis, with the attention to detail already displayed by this solo-enterprise, I can see the game jumping forward leaps and bounds.  Certainly more than enough to warrant the £15 asked for, or less if you get it on HB or GoG and the exchange rates are favourable. The author of this goes the DRM free route, and he deserves your pennies. I hope it does as well sales-wise as it should.  Buy it now, and you'll be building vast medieval sprawls in no time			"

												Super-duper addictive town-building game in which you try to help a couple of families survive as they're (you can guess it) banished form their hometown.I might be a little biased here, as I'm a sucker for city-builders.Protip : try to survive your first winter (on hard) and/or try to keep your population ever-growing, as by the time the first generation starts dying of old age, you'll be in trouble.

												While it initially seemed to me to be a pretty basic town building sim, I soon learned that it had more depth and complexity than what I had assumed. My first few starts were doomed, having underestimated the town's needs and overestimated production. Careful resource management is required, and building placement should be carefully considered. The game shirks a single-resource economy, going so far as to do away with money altogether. Buildings are made via a few different resources (logs, stone, and iron), but to survive you'll need food (of which a balanced diet is needed, or else there'll be health problems), housing (for warmth, comfort, and expansion of your population), clothing (for the Winter), and most likely trade (items are sold and bought using a value of ""units,"" so there's a regulated value of all items).While there is more to the game, I'd rather not chat your ear off any further. Long story short, I've played a few hours and enjoyed it, and am about to put in a few more before I turn in for the night. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to those interesting in city building sims.			"

												I enjoy it. The strategizing, the long term planning, seeing thousands of stored iron stacks when I have a good trade balance... This game is different from the usual cookie cutter expectation. The commercial reviews thus far are in direct conflict with one another (love the UI, hate the UI, it's ugly and stressful, it's gorgeous and relaxing) so from my end I'll say this: the people who like it, will love it. And even if you don't like it, understand that one person made it. He didn't blow his budget on motion capture, concept art, office space, business dinners, or marketing. He sat down and made a game on his home PC. This industry needs fewer suits and more operators with the motivation to create similar works--hopefully Banished will serve as a reminder that small companies or individuals producing viable projects is not a relic of the 90's, but part of the existing reality and market. Great effort, addictive game.			"

												This is a fun village builder but it does lack some big features. I just noticed that I've spent 23 hours playing this game since getting it earlier in the week. For now, it manages to overcome it's weaknesses but I'd love to see some improvements. What I like: Runs great on dated hardware. All the time I've put in this game was done on a 6 y/o laptop.Difficulty modes only impact what you start with in the game. So whichever you chose, you're still playing the same game. Plenty of buildings all available right away. Some buildings are useless until you get other supplies. Several ways to gather resources. You can gather what's around you or build something to produce what you need. Controls. Moving around the map and laying stuff down is easy. Overall fun gameplay. It wouldn't be any good if the gameplay wasn't solid. What I dislike: No tech upgrades. I don't call this a city builder because it doesn't feel like a city... just a big village. The only upgrades I've noticed are stone roads, stone houses, steel tools, and warmer jackets. Limited resources. Iron and stone are the most limited. There's only so many quarries / mines a map can handle. Limited water buildings. You can't build a port for your own fisherman to go on lakes so all fishing is from the docks. This makes larger bodies of water nothing more than an inconvenience.Repetitive gameplay. Once you get in the flow, it's easy to just do the same thing over and over to expand and be successful. I enjoy the game and I'd say it's worth a try. The limitations of a 1 man dev team do show; however, considering that it's a 1 man dev team, it's very impressive how good the game is.			"

												I have bought this game on release because im interested in this genre.This is not a casual game and requires great patience and skill.Lets got through pros and contras.+ Offers random map generation (seed, size, type, difficutly etc.)+ Challenging (hard to master, i failed about 15 attempts before my city could get stable and healthy/happy)+ Deep simulation system (unlike other city builders, peoples age/gender plays a great role, family is a core unit,    people dont spawn randomly, they can only be born as kids and then age into students/workers, later on you can invite    nomads into your village)+ Original gameplay (different from anno/simcity, requires micro'ing, resource system)- Contains lots of bugs (savegame crash, some buildings texture bugs, trading doc bug etc.)- Doesnt support DX11 properly (switching to DX9 will avoid lots of crashes)I think this game will provide simulation fans with many-many hours of fun. Although the crashes are annoying and ruine this fun. I recommend to pay attention to forums before u give out 18 Euro.Once most of the major bugs (savegame/trading ship) are fixed, this game will turn into a candy!			"

I have to say, I've enjoyed every moment of my experience with it thus far, as has a friend who bought it on my recommendation.In Banished you have a set of people who, strangely enough have been Banished from their home. This is a ""City builder"" in its purest sense. To me, it's very simple, but it has a tendancy to bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥just when you think that your village is sustainable. Superbly addictive and from what I have read, the dev is soon to release modding tools....which could add huge amounts of depth, which, seems to be slightly needed for long term replayability.Well worth a purchase.

												This is a very solid singleplayer city-builder. I have not played many other city builders simply because the blocky graphics (who wants to build something if it's going to make their eyes hurt?), or way too intensive micromanaging turned me off.This game is simple. This game is easy. This game is elegant with a beautiful soundtrack. That is until a single fire ravages through your urban center destroying any sense of unity your village had. Then---DEATH SPIRAL. Death spirals are so intense, as you watch graveyards fill before your eyes and entire professions become void of workers. Pulling out of one is near impossible, but if you do it is an accomplishment worthy of song.There are however some drawbacks: 1. Gameplay is more or less managing a set of spreadsheets, drop down menus and building stuff to your best ability-then observing the outcome. 2.  Starving people will walk past barns and markets FILLED TO CAPACITY with food and starve to death on the way to their house, come on people grab a peach at the market and don't die.3. So many houses... In order to keep a population growing you constantly have to build houses leading to the before mentioned urban sprawl, eventual fire, disease, lucky tornado and/or food shortage leading to DEATH SPIRAL.4. Glitches: By scheduling to demolish and then canceling the demolish order graveyards are 'emptied' of bodies even though gravestones remain allowing infinite burials on one small patch of land (useful glitch but still a glitch), Livestock walk underwater between pens instead of taking roads, lag starts to intrude with populations over 1000 (gets bad around 1400) and Gatherers are incredibly OP compared to other starting food sources.5. Do What??? Once you have a town going you may feel a sense of emptiness at having 'conquered' the game and unless you are willing to go after the achievements that sense of pointlessness will remain. However the achievements for this game offer interesting challenges instead of the standard 'get-all-the-things' sort.So overall it is a good game but there is a steep learning curve and, unless you like to achievement hunt, limited replay value, but for all that it is an addictive game into which I have sunk dozens of hours and have a few more left in me.

That said though, I have had 3 villages that have had 300 citizens and almost 100 years in each one. When this happens there is not much more you can do after that except expand, and that is all you can do. This can get very repetitive and boring.

												An extremely enjoyable game, very nice to play when you want something calm and idyllic. My advice is to be stingy on house building; there's no need to feel bad about the kids never moving out of their parents' house. ALWAYS make sure you have more than enough food to support your population. DON'T trade away stone or iron/iron tools or your steel tools. Those are finite resources on your maps, and you always want to trade FOR them. Same goes for coal - it's not worth mining (you have to choose coal or iron, choose the latter!), because steel tools aren't as valuable as you think they are (except for if you desperately need to trade for seeds maybe) and the villagers often take the coal to heat their homes, which is a complete waste. And last but not least (this will save you a headache later) build your cemetery as big as you can, preferably as far away as you can. These are just some basic advice, there are many more tips/tutorials you can find online. The only drawback on this game is maybe not enough micro-managing, which is something I prefer in my games. Unless you build a huge metropolis, you will find you often run out of things to do other than just stalk a villager or watch the animals roam around.			"

												This is game awesome... If you love city building this is something you just need to play.Everything is just very beautifully made. The graphics are very good for this type of game and the music is very relaxing.It is just all about building cities, the only threat are disasters like fire or sickness among the people. No RTS righting just solid straight to the point building. I recommend this to everyone that enjoys building stuff.			"

												This game has reminded me of Tropico for quite a bit. Instead of the humor tropico offers though, this game takes itself quite a bit more serious.The color-theme is quite dark, though the world is beautiful and is randomly generated with each new game. Where other games in this genre tend to get very easy once you have mastered one strategy, Banished stays remains very difficult. This is because your people actually die rather quickly if you don't fulfill their needs. For example my first games started decent, but once I made a bit too much houses and my inhabitants got children my food production was suddenly insufficient (food consumption is based on how much households you have) and people died of starvation, which meant I had less people to produce food, which meant even more people died... The hard difficulty of this game is not a bad thing though, it actually helps to keep things more interesting and it challenges players to try even better. Keeping both the needs of your people and your hunger for an even bigger town in mind you will constantly be challenged throughout the entire playthrough.			"

												Banished is a single player management/city building game. It's also addictive.  You start with a small handful of people 'Banished' from their homes. It's up to you to help them not just to survive, but thrive. At the start it's all about survival, your people need food, shelter and heat. As your settlement grows so does its needs. Better homes, fields of crops, animals for food and clothing, tools and ways to keep your people happy.In terms of what is available to build, this game is very simple. No tech trees, just buildings available for a single function.Despite the simplistic nature of the game, the balancing act of keeping your people fed, clothed and warm can be quite a challenge. Getting the right start in the right location can make the difference between a prospering community or an exercise in frustration.It's not perfect, there are still a few bugs, but this game is evolving as the single developer works continually to improve the game. A mod tool set is currently being developed  to give the players more options.As the game stands now, it's highly playable, even more addictive and with a huge amount of maps available it should keep your attention for a very long time. Buy it and enjoy it.Added April 2016 - 2400 hours later and I'm still playing, mainly thanks to the wonderful mods that have added a fair amount of content to toy with. I say 2400 hours, but I'm not the Steam champ, I know at least of one other who has played 400 hours more than me. If that's not value for money, I don't know what is.			"

												Think of Settlers combined with Tropico without an economy and without armies - and you get Banished, but without the DRM, required signups and always online requirement that the latter mentioned games have.  Banished is a simple game, weighing in at a quarter of a gigabyte in size - yet it can provide many hours of entertainment with its challenging obstacles and everchanging environment.This is city building and management at its finest.  It's like Star Trek - everybody gets a job to do, nobody gets paid.  If you don't pull your weight, you die.  Nobody complains about wages, the jobs they have to do - they just get on with it, like good Amish people without the hats.After 100 hours gameplay, I'm happy to say that this is one of the most rewarding games I've played for the price tag.  Kudos to the sole developer, and I wish you much luck with your future endeavours.  May you be this decade's Chris Sawyer.			"

												CTD and RepetitiveFIRST THE CRASH TO DESKTOP ISSUE:  My first play session worked fine, except the menu was too small for my resolution (1920 x 1080).  A few adjustments in the settings fixed that.  However, during my second play session the game would crash after about 5 minutes of play time.  (For reference, I’m running this on Windows 8.1, 64 bit)  After some research, I finally discovered a fix which involved going into the registry and deleting some entries.  And I discovered this fix only worked as long as you didn’t start a new game.  If you did, you’d have to edit the registry again.  This is certainly something a player should not have to do in order to get a working game.ON TO THE PLAYING:  So I bought the game because it seemed fun.  I generally like resource management and time management games.  I've played Sims, SimCity, Diner Dash, Cooking Dash, etc. just to give you an idea.At first it was fun.  I could place buildings where I wanted.  A few like the houses even had different styles to choose from by typing the ""F"" key before placing it on the ground.  I liked watching my little worker ants hurry around.  I quickly got a handle on my food supply, and this was despite some of the workers hoarding a disproportionate amount of food in their houses which meant less for others.  It’s not that hard really.  Just have some farm fields during the growing season, and you also have a few hunters, fishermen, and/or gatherers.  I also got control of wood, stone, etc.In the end, it seemed all I needed to do was sit with the workers pane open and subtract or add workers to different positions as I needed.  For example: “Subtract 3 workers from Gathering, and add those 3 to Building because I have a wave of construction projects going on.”  It’s just a matter of clicking up or down on the arrows next to the jobs in the list.  I just needed to do that and keep an eye on the resource panes.  That’s why it got repetitive, and I played less than 10 hours.  Maybe that’s all the game is really meant for.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot, it's a laidback village building sim - you need to make sure your villagers have enough food, clothes, tools, fire wood etc. It sounds simple but can be deceptively hard, one bad harvest and a large percentage of your village might die of starvation, now you don't have enough people for the basic day to day functions and it all spirals out of control. If that's not enought there's also natural disasters such as tornadoes and fires. Recommended.			"

												Banished is a gem in the rough. Following little publicitly, it popped onto the Steam store in mid-February and enjoyed its time in the limelight of online streaming. Becoming known among many of those who know it as the game where your city dies in the winter, it seems to have enjoyed a good amount of success considering the scale of the release and the relatively unknown nature of the game. Banished shines in the way it's presented. It doesn't just give you problems to solve, it makes you the one who determines what the problems are. Making the decision to expand your city by constructing additional houses for new families to move into provides you with a larger workforce down the line, allowing you to mine crucial resources or complete construction projects faster. But it also emburdens your settlement with the requirement to feed more mouths. And when that mouth is a child's, it won't be paying you back in the form of useful labor for years to come. Hence your town dying in the winter. You learn Banished through a series of catastrophic mistakes. A multi-tier tutorial can help you along in understanding the purpose of Banished's different structures, villager professions, and so on, but to its benefit I didn't find that I needed it beyond the first lesson or two. The real learning occurs when the urban center of your treasured town burns down in a fire that makes the Great Fire of London seem trivial. You learn quickly in Banished because it -hurts- to lose what you've worked up to. When something goes wrong despite all your plans and analysis, after some initial baffelement or frustration, the question always arises: why, and how can I fix it? Like any any unpolished gem, Banished is not without its imperfections. Your prime resources - your town's settlers - offer little in the way of communication other than letting you know when they're starving to death or lacking tools. I struggled to understand why buildings weren't being constructed when I had sufficient builders and resources available, only to realize that I just didn't have stockpiles of the materials needed close enough to move the process along. Thankfully, one of the greatest tools in Banished's aresenal is the priority tool, a function letting you paint areas of the map to designate to your settlers what needs to be done the most. This expedites whatever you want done satisfyingly, and fixes a lot of Banished's occassional lack of feedback.That said, I've had multiple towns ruined multiple times by aforementioned flash fires. Despite having water-dispersing wells placed throughout my city, the majority of it continued to completely burn down whenever a fire broke out. Eventually, and much to my gamer shame, I turned the ""disasters"" feature off because I just couldn't get the occassional doomsday fire to stop. But these complaints are secondary to the great game that Banished is. If you're craving a city sim and aren't satisfied by Anno or Sim City, this is the title for you. The graphics are humble but well-executed, the atmosphere convincing, and the sandbox nature that makes each town different from the last promising many hours of play. There's real depth here, and the long term hope is that Shining Rock understands there's room to expand upon it.			"

Pros: A refreshing take on the city sim genreA fun challenge, difficult to masterLightweight game that works on my old laptop144hz supportSolid game, no bugs encounteredCons: No steam cloud support for savesThe game is hard to learn, I found myself googling a lotGraphics and sound are lackingThoughtsFirst time I ran Banished I was overwhelmed, my whole town died off, nothing worked right.  I came back to it months later and only fared slightly better.  I started hitting up Reddit everytime I ran into a problem and now I am starting to learn the game.  The game is brutally hard for me.  But that's sort of the point, the odds are stacked against your banished citizens.  This isn't Sim City where you just zone large swaths of land and things will largley sort themselves out to some degree; even if you do end up a simulation of Detroit.  In this game your whole town will die if you don't micromanage all the rescources.  But its very rewarding to have a stockpile of food and firewood ready for winter.  The graphics aren't anything to brag about - but on the flipside the game supports 144hz, it can also run on an old i5 dual core laptop, and it takes up less than 300mb of space.  The sound ins't great, but it gets the job done.  I didn't care for the constant rain, but the effect can be disabled.			"

												This is a city builder and management type game, with an interesting atmosphere. The funny thing is that once you get your buildings placed, by and large the game play simply turns into clicking up and down arrows. THAT'S IT!There is odd strategy in clicking those arrows though. Assign the wrong jobs and your town could take a horrible turn that you can't recover from. You have to constanty evaluate assignments. Yet it doesn't feel frustrating, it feels RELAXING. Seeing the seasons come and go is just beautiful, and you feel really invested in your population. I feel like you have to be both passive and micro manage at the same time, which is very difficult to explain. I have simply never played a city manager like this one. I think that says a lot, it being one of my favorite genres. This game is a masterpiece in it's very own niche that it's created for itself.			"

												Outright this game is very enjoyable.  That said, after 10-20 hours of playing and generally figuring things out you'll start to feel an itch.This game does the fundamentals very well, but after getting to know it the ""itch"" becomes things it could do better or expand on.  You start wanting more things to build, more oddities that can occur, etc..  You start thinking ""boy I wish there were more occupational buildings I could make!"" and ""I wish I could do something with this lake...it's just there taking up a ton of space"".  On the other hand, you start encountering little gripes like ""Why are my villagers so damn dumb?  Use the roads I built you fools!"" or ""Why are workers carrying stuff to the storages on the opposite end of the map when there none of the others are full?""  However, this is a great problem to have in general as it gives some indication of direction for later efforts (both by community and dev).Very recommended for people like me who can spend an entire weekend day playing and even for those with busy daily lives who may not be able to dedicate more than maybe an hour in a sitting.  The really hard part for both types of players is prying yourself away from it to do things that are necessary...like eating and sleeping.			"

												If you're a fan of Dwarf Fortress, you'll love this game - mostly. It plays a lot like a 3D, simplified DF - and I love it! Being just released, I hope we'll see a bunch of additions to the game - I'd love to see raiders, offensive/defensive structures and a few other things that you'd find in DF. Personally, once you figure out the formula you can sustain a settlement forever, and it's almost too easy, so it sort of peters out after several years. I think this would be a killer game if priced at $14.99, this just doesn't seem like $20 worth of game, but I'm banking that there will be more added + community mods. Hands down, get this game if you like the simulation genre.			"

												Imagine a cross between Sim City and Age of Empires, and you’ll roughly have thought of Banished. It’s a fantastic game which focuses on the survival of a group of nomads who have been exiled from their original villages, and you are tasked with helping them build a city of their own. It doesn’t have a defined time period, but it’s set in a “ye olde” time rather than in a more current or futuristic setting.Read More at VG Almanac[vgalmanac.com] "

												A solid city builder with intelligent mechanics... Well worth the $20 to the developer. Instead of focusing on military expansion, which is prevalent in this genre. This game focuses on town management. I have ruined my game a number of times by getting ""too big for my boots"", so to speak. You have to really think about every placement you add. Every excess building can really bite your colony in the behind if not placed strategically. The city has a large array of buildings that you will at one stage probably possess them all.. Only to have your colony wiped out by disaster or mismanagement, sickness or climate. The game has a steep learning curve for the first time user, once the basics are learnt it is an addictive addition to your steam library.			"

												This is the most masterful city builder game I have played in the longest time. This far exceeds the standard of games developed by first party developers, especially considering it was made by one person.If you're at all intrested in city building, strategy and survival games, this is certainly worth picking up.

												TLDR: Banished is tough and addictive for a city building game. Every problem you solve for your town creates another problem. Eventually you hit endgame and you get bored. I give Banished an 8/10.Banished is one of the tougher city building games i have played. During the first few playthroughs the people in your town will either die of starvation or the cold from a blizzard. This happens because you aren't quick enough and focus on the wrong things to build first. There is no tech tree, meaning all buildings are available at the start of your game. All you need to do is build them in the right order due to the needs of your population. The AI in this game (the behavior of the villagers) does not always do what you want them to do. A villager that lives alone can stockpile his house with tons of food while the family of 6 people next door are starving because there is nothing left. You can't control them in any way other than giving them professions.Banished has no goal other than to create a self sufficient town/city. To reach this point however will take allot of time. As soon as you learned the ropes of this game and know how to counter most problems, you will notice that solving one problem creates another. For instance:Every ingame year you notice a shortage of food because people are starving so you need more farms for vegetables, pastures for raising lifestock or fishing docks for catching fish. Now that the food situation is stable you notice that all the new facilities you created required all your free workers, meaning that if you want to build something else there won't be anyone available to work at it to keep it running. To counter this you need to build houses. You need wood and stone to build houses so you send your two available workers to mine some stone and cut some wood. Next thing you know, the new houses are built and are filled with people and resources (Food and Firewood). But it looks like not all of the new houses are fully filled with firewood. Next project: create more woodcutters so your people won't freeze to death during the winter. But that has left us with another problem. There is not enough wood and the nearby forest is all but depleted of trees. So now we need to fix that by planting more trees and cutting them. But wait, we don't have enough people to work so more wood can be generated. So that means we need more houses, after that we need food, clothing, firewood etc.Eventually you will find a way to have a perfect income of every resource. Wich means you could leave your computer for work and return to your town still alive and thriving. That also means that you cannot build anything new without interupting this beautiful balance you have created.If you are into city building games and love a challenge i suggest buying this game. You will have to start multiple sessions of this game because you WILL lose your first few towns due to starvation, blizzards or natural disasters.			"

												This game is kinda reminds me of Stronghold. Just started off, but the tutorial is kind of overwhelming, you'd probably only get the hang of the game AFTER playing the actual playthrough. So far I love it, it's been the kind of game I've been waiting for in ages. It's like Age of Empires with SimCity in one nice combination. So far, very happy.			"

												A timesuck if there ever was one. I've spent days on one village and restarted others several times. There are quite a few guides online to give a few tips (like best sizes for farm and livestock pens) to make the game easier but it tends to boil down to waiting a while for your villagers to do things. For example, the school is important for better workers but it adds a few years onto actually having the workers. You don't interact much with them other then assigning jobs. You can set limits on food production, movement of goods and trading but most of that can be automated. It is very much a 'build this here, gather that there and work in this building' and let the villagers run amok type of game.If you enjoy city building then this game is definitely worth the $20 price. Still, there is nothing like watching a starving villager pick up food, only to walk a few paces and drop it then run between the food and the barn repeatedly until they die.			"

Comment: I got bored playing this because I ran out of land! Solution: Larger and customizable maps. Comment: I got bored because I had to do the same thing every year. Solution: Ability to predetermine villager actions based upon time of the year. Comment: It moves too slowly especially when attempting to accumulate inventory.Solution: Increase game play options. Don't get me wrong. I recommend you pick up your pitch fork and become a farmer on Banished until the day you realize there isn't anything else you can do here in this village..			"

												""Banished"" is a sick, twisted game. You play as a town of exiles who must work together to survive harsh winters, famine, and natural disaster. While the premise sounds simple, the game throws a lot of really complex mechanics at you from the get-go.The gameplay takes the Simulation genre to the next level. It's realistic enough that you must wait as the children in your town grow to working age, or until your orchards begin to yield crop. Unlike other simulation games, ""Banished"" also takes a very personal approach, going as far as to name each and every townsperson--and tell you when they die.Each map is randomly seeded, so you must constantly adapt to the environment. For example, if there are no nearby animals to pasture, it is hard to collect wool for clothing. As a result, you might want to rely more on firewood early on. The key is always to go slow, but steady! Expanding too quickly will burn out your resources, but going too slowly is a death sentence when you run out of tools or have no access to medicine a few years in....There's really a lot to say about this game and not enough space to say it. The art style is perfect, the UI is minimal, gameplay is balanced. Get this game if you're into simulations. It's a true masterpiece. Not much for fans of action gaming, but it might be worth a try.			"

												This game is so damn hard! You think you are doing well and then you notice that your citizens have no food and then half of them are dead, literally. However, the feeling you get when you overcome these challenges, at least temporarily, is immense.There will always be a struggle for resources, whether it be food, clothes or building materials and it isn't a simple case of mining what you need or whatever the case may be. You need to have citizens to be available to do these tasks, if there are none then what you want done will not be done.There are a couple of things that aren't quite right, such as people forever switching jobs with each other whenever they please and builders taking the long route to build a bridge, but that doesn't make it a bad game, in fact it's quite the opposite.This game involves no fighting against other people or anything like that, it's all about building a town, with people who were banished from somewhere, and managing to get it to survive against the harsh reality of nature and prosper.It is no simple task.

I am a huge fan of games such as Roller Coaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, Warcraft, C&C, Starcraft, Stronghold... I just had to give this game a go based on the positive user reviews.Banished is quite brutal - you will restart your game many times before you perfect it.  But the variety in buildings you can make, professions your villagers can have and especially the trading aspect mean you won't find yourself getting bored.  You have to CONSTANTLY pay attention to a range of things in order to keep expanding.One other positive of note is the mods available through Steam.  I have only used the Colonial Charter mod so far and it literally doubled the in-game content ie new maps, buildings, food, professions, trade etc.This really is a peach of a game.			"

The goal is to sustainably grow your population, whilst managing trade, comfort and health.This game is relaxing. This game can also be challenging. The only thing letting this game down is the apparent barrier you reach after your settlement has grown to a sustainable size.

An idea would be to make your villagers flatten mountains and with the dirt they obtain to fill in mines/quarries as they are permenant at the moment.

												My population was growing to about 100 (easy for some, not for me). Then, I look towards my forester/hunter/gatherer area and notice the trees are going away. I remember that I turned off planting. That winter, half of my population died (the younger half) of starvation and the following years, the rest died of old age.Remind me to never be in charge of a real town.			"

												I love it when I take a chance on a game I haven't read much about but has a Very Positive review and it actually is something I quite like.  I'll return the favour and add my ""thumbs up"" for this charming game.I give this a 4 out of 5 stars.Pros:Helpful tutorial that isn't overly longReference manual that is easily navigated and seems to succinctly answer everything I've needed to knowNice graphical style- looks polished and completeEngaging gameplay.  It's easy to spend a lot of time without realizing it.  You can't just ""set it and forget it"" and let the village run/grow without expecting consequences.Very good strategy/sim elementsEasy to build what you want where you want itAdjustable difficultyCons:No progression/advancements as the years go byThe variety of buildings, walkways, and customability seem limited. I realize there are a lot of mods, but in the base game, I feel a bit disappointed. "

												I've loved playing Banished, and I've often found myself playing it repeatedly in-between other game campaigns. The village layout aspect of the game feels close to Sim City.  You place all the individual buildings, and roads, and slowly fill in the map.  The management of the city is quite different.  Controlling the population level is key to the game.  Banished tracks each citizen as they progress though their lifespan.  Children of older villagers will not have children of their own unless there is an empty house for them to move out to.  This creates a boom & bust cycle that can make having enough resources to feed and clothe your villagers tricky.Once you get used to the ways that the game operates, you can have a great time either micromanaging your village, or trying to setup one that will not collapse on autopilot.

												I was really pessimistic about this one.  After all, who needs another resource/city management style of game.  This one, however, is a must.  So, here we go:Pros:Graphics are gorgeous on high settings.It is very unforgiving.  A challenge worth experiencing.Not really one you can set and walk away from, things happen quickly.Disease's and bugs.  After all, everyone loves a good case of Diptheria, or measles, or an infestation on your crops or herds.Micromanagement is spot on, if you don't you can kill your entire camp in a matter of months.The ways people die are kind of funny, ""Henry the tailor was crushed by a rock""Sound is decent, not great, but decent.Natural disasters.Fire...your gonna need a lot of wells, trust meNice tutorialCons:Its very unforgiving...you will restart many times, many, many times.Your only goal, manage a city.Lots of little things that can push a mid range pc to its limits.It does get repetitive, hopefully they fix this on later patches.Whos it for: Anyone that likes city/resource management games that are challenging.  Some might find the $20 price a little much, it is worth it, even more so at half off.  Pick it up.			"

												Remember back to when Sim City wasn't eaten by EA? Banished is kinda like that. It's throughly made with next to no bugs, and combines a very well made tutorial with unique resource management.If the dev ever reads this, thank you so much. Id make working on games like this my life.The only thing its lacking is a few extra features: A state of resource 'balance', a goal where you can say 'Yeah I made City of X size', and maybe a few more 'fun' buildings like windmills or horse farms.9/10 I'm going to drop many many more hours into this game.

It is an easy game to learn and there are multiple terrains and difficulty settings to keep it interesting and fresh.  Once I got the mechanics down, I went to the Banished Workshop and downloaded some amazing mods that haved helped extend the playtime of this game.  I give Banished 2 thumbs up.			"

												To everyone who saw the disaster that was the last Sim City from EA; this is a love letter.  While it stands on it's own as a city builder/survival game it looks even better during a dearth of good city related games.  A simple game about trying to take a small group of exhiled people, survive, and eventually become self sustained.  There have been a few issues with optimization and AI derp, but then again this was made by one guy.  If anything the real testimate of this game is that a single talented indie dev out did an entire studio under the ownership of EA.			"

												TL;DR: Without mods, it wouldn't be worth more than $30. Then again, it IS just $20! And with mod support now, the game has hopefully entered a long-term growth of value.A very, VERY relaxed city builder game. If you feel like leaning back and just enjoying some nice, slow-paced city growth, this game is for you. It comes with straight-forward controls, a well-designed management interface and a just as relaxing atmosphere.The only drawback is the content of that game, and with that, the play length. After 20 to 30 hours at normal game speed (yes, there is a switch to speed things up, if you feel like it), you'll reach the point where you've seen, built and tested everything the game offers out of the box. Then again, its' normal price is $20, which is set absolutely right.Luckily, by the time I'm typing this, the game has just added mod support. There are already some nice additions, building types, crops, even a few mechanics out there, which add nicely to the game. Hopefully, the large fanbase behind this game will create lots of content for the game, so that it extends its' replay value to far above its' current price tag.			"

												Banished is a great game and makes you loose countless hours of your life in that game. But, as any game, has some bad things about it.Pros:- It was a dynamic RTS system- Graphics were pretty good with lots of foliage- Let you customize who goes where- Allowed you to ration food and supplies- Is challenging even on Easy- Watch your city grow- Mod support ( Adds new things and possibilities)- Never smooth sailing, Things do happen- LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THINGS!- Can change how fast time is going in the gameCons:- Not alot of content in building the settlement (Core Game with no mods)- Game is fun for several hours, then that's it. You maxed everything in about 2-3 hours.- Villagers sometimes don't go where you tell them to go (Ignore you)- Supplies sometimes get glitched (Cant move them from place to place)- Houses take way to much food to their house and won't share (Selfish people)I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to manage a settlement.

												This is undoubtedly a good city builder game, and I would definitely recommend it.The way every is set up reminds of the CaesarIV game I played a while back, though this game has a quite few differences in terms of game play.The one thing this game severely lacks compared to CaesarIV is the ability to assign dedicated storage and the ability to manually assign where your workers work. It makes managing your economy and workers very inefficient since you can't micromanage things properly.Why is this a problem you ask? Because I have created a couple of enormous towns that could produce enough goods to trade that could feed themselves 100 times over, but still had an issue with starvation because all my barns were overfilled with refined goods like Tools, and Clothes, Wool, etc... that couldn't be used or traded fast enough. I literally designated 1/4 of each map as a mass storage area with like 50-200 barns that could hold everything I was producing. But all the barns close to where all the houses are were all filled with stuff that wasn't food, so my people had to walk to the outskirts of town like half way across the map to this massive storage area just to store food that they were producing/unloading off the trading post, and then they have to walk all the way back just to get a tiny bit of food.This massively reduces efficiency of your workers since they spend most of their time going out of their way to some far off unnecessary place that could of been avoided if you had been allowed better storage designation. You might say why don't you just build markets and increase the number of vendors and traders? Well because I did, and I still encountered that problem, the traders took forever to unload the food from the trading post, and it took them forever to come back to restock the trading post due to the massive amount of distance they had to travel due to the fact that you can't micro manage where things are stored.Now obviously there are mods that allow you to have specialize designated storage, but nonetheless its a massive flaw in the vanilla game that should be rectify since it can potentially ruin your game. Not to mention using any mods prevents you from getting the achievements.My only other complaints are the lack of variety in buildings, how insanely bad fishing is, and dumb the AI is when it comes to pathing and where they chose to live/work.Otherwise this game is a great.

												New twist on an old favorite genre. Made by one guy, his hardwork and dedication shows. Only issues I have is if you expand too far your population sometimes doesn't adjust and you run into people starving or they are not farming early enough in a season. I believe it's because the individual people themselves just aren't moving fast enough for the season change. Overall, a soild pick up and is really addicting until you find the secret recipes for building.			"

												Banished is a city building game which requires attention and future planning.Yays:It requires a bit of micromangament which makes the game more realistic as a game in the city building genre.Also theres LOTS of chain reactions,like if you make a farm,and another one,and another one,your gonna have a tool deficiancy which you wont be able to keep up with due to a growing population cause by the farming.When one problem is solved another takes its place as a consequence for solving that problem,which really makes it a hard core problem solver.The game can be difficult even on easy.Also whenever you get a town going you can generally go on from there as   with a large population you can just easily solve a problem as quickly and efficiantly as long as your people-to-resources ratio is good.When hitting a large population the game becomes a city builder where every building built and placed will effect gameplay.Finally the game would have alot of potential for alot of things, such as MODS!THE GLORIOUS MODS!,Multiplayer,(I dont know how it may work,maybe implement a combat system,or make it a bit like BFME/Age Of Empires/Stronghold or both,I dont know),IMPLEMENT A COMBAT SYSTEM!,(as I said before),and generally more buildings, a goverment,maybe even a tech tree would be nice.Nays:Ah were finally done eating the sugarcoating of this game,and now its time to eat its bitter core.Difficulty:The game is difficult and there should be a something like a sandbox mode or something like the ingame editor mod for Civ 5 ,or at least a mode where the game is ACCTUALLY EASY.Also the difficulty should make you think before buying this game if your prone to raging.Price:While sure its a Indie and requires the money,but you should think about if your gonna dedicate your time to it or not.Rating and Conclusion:9/10,Its not easy to my personal liking,but has LOTS of potential.

												I have only played 7 hours of this game, and it is truly amazing. One of my favorite city building games out there. Gold/money is not an option here. Every uses recourses or trade system to obtain things. It took me about 4 or 5 towns to make to get the true groove, as I either expanded too early or didn't get certain things built on time and everyone either starved to death or froze to death. You have to find that perfect spot to start expanding houses to get new families. Expaned too fast and your food will deplete way to fast. I definatly recommend this game if you love city building games. The fact that it was made by one man is jsut amazing as well. He did an amazing job on this game.

Can be relaxing, because you can pause the game any time and choose to excluse Disasters, which will reduce stress.  As your village grows, bands of nomads will pass through, seeking citizenship.  They can be useful to grow your town, but also bring disease, so be sure to have a hospital and doctor already built before accepting them.  Also, a Boarding House and School in place helps prevent them from dying of exposure and improves their productivity.Good game, I recommend it.			"

												A timesuck if there ever was one. I've spent days on one village and restarted others several times. There are quite a few guides online to give a few tips (like best sizes for farm and livestock pens) to make the game easier but it tends to boil down to waiting a while for your villagers to do things. For example, the school is important for better workers but it adds a few years onto actually having the workers. You don't interact much with them other then assigning jobs. You can set limits on food production, movement of goods and trading but most of that can be automated. It is very much a 'build this here, gather that there and work in this building' and let the villagers run amok type of game.If you enjoy city building then this game is definitely worth the $20 price. Still, there is nothing like watching a starving villager pick up food, only to walk a few paces and drop it then run between the food and the barn repeatedly until they die.			"

												I really like this game, but it is hard.  I find the hardest part of the game to be resources and demographics.  By demographics what I mean is that you will get so far in the game and then everyone gets old and won't create kids anymore and start to die off and then you are in death spiral because you lose workers, thus can't get resources, thus can't build houses to encourage people to have kids, and basically all hope is lost.  So, it is really damned difficult to play a game that continues on for some time.I really wish the developer of this game had included a cheat menu in the game for those of us who are so great and balancing all the parameters of the game perfectly but who still want to carry on building and enjoying the game.  I mean really... listen up developers...Please include the ability to hit the '~' key and open a cheat menu already.  Options should include; infinite resources, add 100 resources, add children, reduce population age, add workers/people, change season to winter/summer/spring/autumn, 100% harvest on crops and orchards, etc.Also, a sandbox mode would be great.  Sometimes people just want to build and not worry about all the particulars of running the community.Thank you. "

												If you like city builders and even strategy games in general, this game is probably something you'll enjoy. Games like Banished aren't for everyone, and can seem quite slow at times,  but for what it is, this game is pretty amazing.It's got a somewhat challenging, but very graspable learning curve, and the gameplay is very engaging as there's always something to do. Towards the late game, the game can be quite tedious at times, but it's still quite fulfilling and enjoyable to build out a sprawling city. I would recommend getting the game on sale though, as 20$ is a bit much for how much content is actually in the game, though there are great mods for this game that can extend the replayibility by a lot. Anyways, I would rate this game a solid 8.5/10, and I think it's worth a buy.			"

												7.5 / 10Banished is an addictive city-building and management game that gives me the same feeling that Settlers gave me when it was first released. You start small, harvest resources, grow your town and manage needs while trying to prepare for the winter and improve the quality of life in your settlement. It ticks all the boxes for fans of city builders and management games - complex but intuitive gameplay that instills a desire to grow and improve, letting you manage on a large scale or tweak the finer points as you wish. You can build, farm, harvest and trade to your heart's content.My only gripe is the lack of any story, goals or end-point to the game, but as it stands it will provide with many hours of entertainment. Overall simpler than the likes of the Anno series, but the ability to fine tune details makes up for this. Decent value for money, but don't be expecting any quests or stories here.			"

												Ted and his son scraped at the hard ground trying to mine Iron with their bare hands. The tools they used to swing wore out and now it was down to the nitty gritty. They both stared at each other with desparation as their stomach grumbled. If they couldn't get enough materials then the whole village would cave in. Soon, everyone was seen wandering around with bloody fingers and growling stomachs.The moral of this story. Build a blacksmith shop. No tools------ nothing. Great game.

												Though i've played a lot of simulation building games like Sim Cities, Build cities Plus, and Moving Cities, this game seems to almost top all of those. Yeah there isnt really much you can do besides do your best to building a thriving community in the ourskirts of some forest, but its really nice to watch it slowly grow and build and work itself together. I'd recommend this game if you like killing time building things, and like watching a civilization grow.			"

												Banished is an unique game where the main objective is building a city. Easier said than done. There are intense moments just like those moments when you get a ""kentucky eleven kill streak"" on some shooter. There was this one time where I killed all my people within ten to twenty minutes of gameplay. Despite yelling at my laptop's screen yelling, ""Don't you dare die on me fegets!"". This game requires some deep thinking on peoples' lives and such. Building to strive a ""Banished"" population. I can really say is that, this game tickled my brain and I like it.			"

												So, I really don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for this game, but here goes!I can give you 100 reasons why you should get this game, and only one why you shouldn't.If you're looking for a war/fighting game, move on. This game is a beautifully crafted true town builder, and everything I've ever wanted from a game like this.Think Age Of Empires, except when you've built your meticulously planned settlement you don't get a load of enemies coming and burning it all down. You can choose exactly where everything goes, and you really have to think about the lay-out and planning of your town to make it as effeciant and seamless as possible.I've been playing this since before all the workshop mods, and even then it was a great game. But now with the inclusion of user-created and dev created mods it's just a work of art. The crafting ladders are now massive, and you can happily run a small village or expand into a heavy working production town. You can choose to lay out your houses in beautiful hamlets, or build big and close together for the real medievil city feel.As you can see from my hours, which don't include the 150+ that for some reason vanished when I transferred my account some time ago, I have played this and loved every second of it. Taking your small band of villagers from a group of 20 to a booming town of 500 is amazing but challenging and it really keeps you on your toes for foward planning.Oh, and we can't forget the naming system. Probably the best thing about the entire game!TD;DR - Just get this game :)			"

												Banished is my favorite city-builder game I've played. It can sometimes be hard to understand, playing the game with time sped up slows down framerate significantly, and when something goes wrong it can be incredibly frustrating and impossible to fix. However, besides all of that it is an incredibly fun and engaging game. Your first village full of exiles will fail miserably. Your second will probably fail even more miserably. In fact, you'll fail quite few times before you actually get the hang of it. When you do get the hang of it though, you will feel so freaking accomplished you'll cry. Just make sure you don't run out of tools...			"

												This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥at first. But in a good way. Banished is a delightfully addicting and charming game that has a heart in the late 90s isometric pc tycoon genre. Made by a one man team, the final result is a buffet of interesting and challenging gameplay that will test your management skills. There are also plenty of mods (like colonial charter) that offer additional hours of gameplay should you grow tired of the vanilla title. I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking for historically based city builder. Truly a delightful gem.			"

												One guy's love letter to the city building genre.In a nutshell, take the good things from Black & White, Pharoah / Caesar / Zeus, Simcity and Settlers and combine it all into a fearless effort to save the genre and you've got the gist of Banished.It's a citizen management game at it's finest, guide your people from being a rag-tag group of outcasts and help them develop into a tightly knight, efficient and bustling community. Yes it's hard, and yes it has bugs.. but compared to the recent releases of the same genre (if any!), this is miles ahead of the competition. I can only imagine this getting even better through continuous development and patch.			"

												A fun if not brutal survival-town builder game. It's an interesting experience and a lot of fun if you like city builders because unlike all the others it has a survival component and is very easy to find yourself in quite the predicament if you did not prepare for the winter and your harvest was poor...I believe this game - if it does not already - was planned to have support for modding, which is a HUGE plus as it is one of those games that could greatly benifit from them. Regardless, even the vanilla experience is addicting and a lot of fun. Give this one a shot.A little trivia: this game was made by only one man!

												Great game if you like town/city simulators.This game reminded me of old game called Knights and Merchants, only without combat aspect. You micro manage your resources for building structures, choosing jobs for your citizens, and making sure you survive the next winter. There are couple essential resources that you need for survival.Most important is wood, stone, food and iron. You pretty much have unlimited food and wood resources, as you can cut down trees and replant them, and you can get food from many sources, it being fishing, hunting wild animals, gathering different foods from forest, growing corn, wheat, pumpkins, etc. Or having your own cattle, sheep, chickens and much more. There are a lot of professions and jobs for your citizens to chose from.It's fun early and mid game, that lacks end game. It gets a bit boring once you have all the buildings and high population with insane amounts of stored resources. But never the less, it's a very fun and enjoyable little game.			"

												Addicting and challenging ""city"" builder. The term ""city builder"" is used loosely here as even at the largest, the towns created in here aspire to ""large medieval hamlet"". This game distinguishes itself from other city builders in two respects. First, it is difficult; almost punishingly difficult. This is especially true if you are used to more forgiving city builder sims, where the tide of the game can be shifted with an ordinance, a building, or a tax hike. There are no such instruments in Banished. Build too many houses, a season later there are hungry mouths to feed with not enough workers to provide food. Build too slowly, and the aging population is unable to replace workers fast enough. Each decision needs to be made with the consequences of the future in mind, as the impact of a single building can have a ripple effect seasons later. Second, unlike many other city builders there are not a plethora of buildings, and no direction towards the ""You Win"" building. All buildings and upgrades are available from the word go. The exercise of Banished is one of a balancing act, rather than a sprint. The player must keep food, population, and resources in perfect balance or a death spiral can very rapidly occur. It can lead to some frustration early on, but the best advice that can be given is not to get too attached to the first town that one builds. However, as the mechanics become more and more apparent, a rhythm to the gameplay will emerge and that is when Banished truly hooks the player.The game gets a recommendation for players who long for a city builder with some serious depth despite the bucolic exterior. If someone is looking for a game with a campaign to lead them through a series of missions and hand hold through each step of the way, look elsewhere. While there is a tutorial, it only covers the very basic mechanics, it leaves the rest to the player.			"

												I really enjoy the atmosphere of this game. The graphics and music are very relaxing, maybe a little too relaxing! It's mostly very easy to figure out what you need to do and how to do it, but the few times when I'm not sure how to make something work, it can be frustrating to find the answer. For example, I built a school and assigned a teacher, but there are no students. You aren't notified when events happen, you only see them if you bring up the news scroll, which I prefer to keep closed because it eats up screen space. Stonecutters keep getting crushed, but I'm not sure if that means they are dead, or need the hospital (which has zero patients despite having 1 heart of health missing). If they are dead, there aren't any spots taken up in the cemetary, so I'm not sure what's going on. It'll probably take some searching in the guides, but all in all this is a pretty fun game. I played over 2.5 hours without even noticing, so I definitely recommend it if you like this sort of resource management/ settlement building game.			"

												I'm giving this a thumbs down because I think that for a ~20€ game there's not enough content. If you can get it for a discount, it's okay.Basically Banished is like CivClicker with graphics. You have to allocate workers and build upgrades to keep your little village flourishing.There's a lot of stuff to micromanage, and that is pleasing enough, but in the end there's just not enough. In the Steam Workshop you can find a couple of mods that make the game more interesting, but only a little. After you've built all the available constructions there's nothing much to do but to watch the numbers go up and down. I thought that was a little disappointing because for the first hour or two the game was very addicting. There's no endgame so to speak.			"

												This is a really fun game.  However, a couple of things.  1st, it is pretty repeditive.  You make your 1st little town then spread out into the woods to make your lumber area.  From there you keep moving to get resources.  By mid game, you have little pockets of villages and towns all over the map.  The problem with this is, that ever time you start a new map you end up doing the same things.  2nd: I believe this is a 1 man dev team so that means the game is not updated very often.  In fact, if I read it right, it has not been updated since June.  'With all that in mind, I still will recomend this game.  the $19 price point is a little steap IMO, but still worth a buy.			"

												Banished is a town building game done right. Its everything you could want in a town building and survival game with a simple goal: Survive. Banished puts you incontrol of a small group of people that have traveled far away to creat there own way of living. At the start of every game you start with your main familes, their homes, some resourses and thats all. you need to start finding ways to keep your families warm, fed, and what ever else you want to do. The creator of the game has stated that you can live in a small comunity just fine if you want. There are no enimies in the game besides your bad planning, for many others and I this is a good thing and a relaxing experiance, but the game can still get challenging very easy. When playing this I expaned to fast and most of my population ended up dying off do to hunger in the winter I was lucky enough to bring this under control, but I now know that over expansion can be a death sentence. Banished is a game about being patient and mindful of your people.All and all banished is a very enjoyable game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys city/town builders.Amazing job Banished, Thank you			"

												Let me start by being completely honest, I have had a great time playing Banished but suspect I don't play it very well as I haven't gotten any achievements for it yet.  >.>     Banished is a brutal city simulator where you start with practically nothing in a colonial-esque setting and must help the townspeople by instructing them what buildings to build, where to work, and generally micromanage them from a godlike perspective as you often do in city sims.Pros:     1)  Fun to play and watch, you'll want to put it on fast forward, but watching the people go about thier business is fun and fascinating.     2)  Very immersive with lots of resources and things to manage.     3)  A wide variety of buildings with a wide range of benefits mean you're constantly building something.     4)   Seasonal changes mean you'll watch as winter settles in and fades into spring and summer, foliage doesn't change for autumn which doesn't detract from the game but would be a nice addition.  However I bet someone's already made a mod for that.  (If there isn't one and there's a modder reading this...  Here's an idea for you!)Cons:     1)  When things go wrong, they go wrong fast.  You might have one family marked as starving one minute, but the next it could be all of them.     2)  Resource allocation is critical, super critical, super super super critical.  If you run out of something restock it immediately or your productions will quickly grind to a halt.     3)  Citizens actually age faster than the calendar suggests.  What I mean is your city may be in Autumn 5 (meaning the season is autumn and your city has existed for five years) with a 14 year old farmer, but by Autumn 6 the same  farmer is several years older instead of just one...  This makes population planning a bit complicated.The Overview:     As I said, I don't claim to be good at Banished but despite that I find it an enjoyable challenge.  The graphics are pretty good, and the quaint buildings have a picturesque charm that will quickly grow on you.  You'll soon get swept into the hustle and bustle and enjoy watching everyone get to work builing your vision, which is also their means for survival.     The name of the game here is balance.  People are a resource, they grow old and eventually die, so you'll want a stable population that grows at a modest rate (there is a display that tells you the number of people in the village, but not their average age or anything like that which would be helpful...) but if your village is growing too fast you won't be able to produce enough food.  If you have a lot of houses you'll need more firewood, if you want more firewood you need more logs, but you need enough logs to cover the houses you're building etc. etc.  This is a city manager that is a tricky balancing act involving gathering resources, keeping the people happy and healthy, and expanding.     For an indie project this is a solid title with lots of replay value (at least for me since I'm often starting over >.>) that rewards the meticulous and methodical planners who are comfortable tracking and anticipating the needs of the people to an almost excrutiating level of accuracy.  While this review may seem a little frightening I encourage you to try it, it's a good bang for the buck and a nice challenge that you'll quickly become engrossed in.  There are plenty of mods available that tweak things like resources per harvest that might make the game easier but I've yet to install them.Happy Gaming!   -yang			"

												It's like Age of Empires 2 but without the war. Plant your crops and then aim for getting your villages some pepper on their bland vegetables.It's a city builder and reminds me of the fun times I had playing SimCity 4. Though It's not perfect. The world lacks a bit of charm (as in voice acting and 'villager pictures'). However It has randomised replayability, difficulty levels and enough game to keep you enticed.I started with no disasters on medium. I also watched a guy play the first 10 minutes (which helped a bit) but most of it was trial and error. The game doesn't give you artificial boundaries. It's a sandbox world that is focused and detailed. I would definitely recommend it if you like SimCity, Anno ect.			"

												I've been boycotting EA Games for well over a year now. I'll admit, it's been hard at times, but I've also noticed a dramatic decline in fits of rage in my life as well as an increase in my wallet since I no longer have to spend thousands on DLC and/or micro-transactions,,,,, and then this game comes out and oh boy........ Sim-What now?....... Out of all the games that I've ever spent $20 dollars on, this one is by far the best. This is a Dev that needs and deserves the support. And to the Developer; if you happen to see this, please don't you ever sell out and sign with EA for publishing on any of your current or future gaming projects! You sir, are an inspiration that should never be tainted! Thanks so much for this wonderfully crafted game!			"

												Awesome city builder, can be very hard. For example, all my people are starving and freezing to death, with everyone on farm duty the only teacher my village could spare is a 5 year, and since there's no one to spare as a tailer, my 5 year old teacher is a naked 5 year old teacher. 60 and 70 year olds are getting married to kids who are 14 and 15 years of age. My chickens refuse to stay in their pens and instead stand around the vilage square. Recently my last two villagers left over from the beginning burned to death with the well 4 spaces outside their home. Another families house burned down and they decided to live a homeless life instead of moving into a house in one of the many abandoned sectors of the town. Seriously addicting and requires very carful planning. Best $20 game out there.			"

												Difficult to put what catagory id personally put this game without changeing the catagory of most other city small settlement games, since there is no fighting bad guys at all.  so all you do is expand a small settlement litrally. Great game, great visuals, decent difficuilty, and a few nice touches.After playing it for a few days, i would honestly say that its a decent ""first step"", as scope for expanding the game play is massive.  and with upcoming? dev support this will most possibly happen.Main tip: Plan ahead I like it, the wife likes it.  so all in all top game			"

												I have never had any inclination to ever review a game before - but this game is just simply blissful elegance to play.  I would strongly recommend purchasing this game if you are inclined towards RTS/City Building games.  The experience of this game is more enjoyable then any game to come out recently with huge development teams - but to learn that this was created by one man (Luke) is incredible.  However there are some flaws (which I am sure will be addressed soon).  The flaws I have found:Game has a tendency to suffer fatal errors in a variety of scenarios (upon save, upon different common in game actions).  I have yet to get a population above 400 - not because of my city building ability but because I have had 3 or 4 games where the game crashes and I cannot alter my play state to avoid the error.  I am not overly disappointed in this because after browsing the forum - it looks like the developer is taking a very proactive role in correcting the issues. (My Rig - Windows 7 64 bit SLI SDD).The game lacks what, to me, would be a real end goal and after a while it fills like your building small towns that work together within the map then one homogenous city.  Beyond the basic buildings I have found nothing to unlock besides Steam achievements which don't do too much to get me excited.  However - I feel like this will probably be addressed by Luke or by the modding community when the tools are eventually released.  However - on the flip side - the simplicity also adds to the beauty of the game in a way.  I could see this game getting monotonous - especially to someone who requires in your face action or war type scenarios.  I think with about 50 hours (assuming the bugs are fixed) I will have seen everything this game has to offer at this point.One thing I have really enjoyed about the game is its difficulty.  The first 4 or 5 times I played I failed miserably quickly in to the game.  The frustrations of watching all your citizens die one by one is painful and frustrating.  This is not a bad thing though - it is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game - learning from your mistakes and using foresight the next time to prevent the issues from happening again.  It's also great to know that if you are not on top of your game at any given time - 5 min later you could see your town falter and everything you worked for fall like dominoes.So summation - at full price in its current state - it would be a hard sell for me.  For $20.00 - you should buy it as long as you are aware of the flaws and have some patients during the meantime for the bugs to be worked out.  If you do wish to wait - make sure to come back eventually because this game is amazing. "

												This is a great take on the time-honored strategy game.  The fact that there are no enemies besides the unforgiving mistress that is Mother Nature (well, that and a few stray boars and falling rocks) is fascinating.  The game does a pretty good job of driving home the difficulties of creating a settlement in an isolated place.  Definitely worth checking out, it's quite re-playable and a great change-of-pace from some of the more frenetic games.			"

												This game is challenging to day the least, but it's also one of the best ""city"" builder games I have ever played. Even on easy it's surprisingly difficult just to service a few years when just starting out, but once you get the general basics down everything seems to flow... right up till sudden starvation, cold, or loss of all tools happens because you over look one tiny detail and 90% of your populous dies off. That however is not a complaint about the game, it's just something you have to overcome and when you do build back up the feeling of accomplishment is really quite wonderful. My only real complaint about the game is the bad luck I get with disasters. Supposedly tornadoes are rare in the world, but the first 3 worlds a created each had tornadoes within the first 2 years, the first of which killed all but 4 people. But again, that was more bad luck and another chance to just start over from stratch than a real issue with the game.			"

												Summer of year 2. Famine, 4 dead. Expedited gathering hut. Reduced fishermen by 1 to increase gatherers to two.Hunger still not alleviated. Added another fishermen. Problem resolved early Autmn in year 2. No one goes hungry but not enough to store. Still having mild flucuations between consumption and production of food. Starvation has nearly wiped out workforce. Villiage of 19 people from 25. I think we may have recovered in time though. Most efforts are in fishing and gathering. We have few builders and laborers.Autmn year 2. Closed market. Hunger still a problem for some. Need to perpare for winter. Lost another citizen to hunger. The first snow of the year has arrived and I fear we may lose another faimly.Early winter year 2. Was able to hold some fish in storage a few days. Is this the light at the end of the tunnel? Deer travel through our woods. Mocking us. No one here is proficent at hunting. We've made it through winter, glad to see green again.Late spring year 3. Hunger is wide spread. 4 deaths.Late summer year 3. Progress is slow. Hunting cabin almost done. Any food gained is quickly taken.Winter year 3. Lost 4 more people.Early spring year 4. Winter was cruel claimed 5 altogether. Only 5 of us remain. One female, a child, remains. She must live. Her name is lavery and now she means hope. Gathering, woodcutting and basic labor has been sacrificed toward food production. We welcome spring.Early summer year 4. Food stabilized. Firewood stocks are full. Production begins again slowly.  Autmn year 4. Autmn claims another. Laverly still fine.Laverly has died. Village doomed. Now we wait for extinction. The boy child, Leandel has died. Winter year 4.Farret 26Helmar 37We are who remain. Barely able to sustain. What will take us first, cold or hunger?Late autmn year 5. Dividing our efforts we chop firewood and fish. This may be our last winter.Decided to try and take some deer with us.Farret has died. Everyday I'm closer to running out of firewood. My efforts are focused on feeding myself. The houses are so empty. Our fields are growing wild where once they were tamed. To see how meaningless our efforts were is a slap in the face. How long will our village remain before it too deteriorates and is consumed by growth? Perhaps someone will find my journal and learn from these mistakes; rebuild and thrive. That is my dream.The lonliness has gotten to me. Farewell and better luck to whomever reads this.  Helmer - age 39, village of Grimer. Summer year 7.			"

												Amazing game that is highly specialized, and masters it's niche beautifully. Many multi-million dollar projects have been unable to accomplish what this single man has done.My gaming rig is pretty powerful, and I was pleasantly surprised to see high resolutions and advanced graphics features. The game looks stunning when maxed out. My wife and kids have been mesmerized by the detail while watching me play for hours. We've tried all kinds of things and my wife has had a lot of input on decisions made for our towns despite not being much of a gamer herself. The kids almost cried when bad decisions on my part cost us our first town.This game is so well thought out and realistic that it brings a natural focus to increased realism. You find yourself wanting to tweak certain things because of how close they are to real life. Citizen behaviors are impressively detailed and easy to believe in.  Decisions have to be made carefully, because the impact is very noticeable. At the start of the game you are dealing with such small numbers of people that everyone in the town counts.The trickiest part of the game is managing the generation cycles. It requires a lot of careful attention to produce a wide spectrum of citizen ages rather than getting locked into spaced generations that result in large death cycles. I'm not sure this is a problem so much as an aspect of realism. What happens if your town has only a few children because of limited resources and then all of the adults pass out of child-bearing age? Eventually the townsfolk might all die of old age, leaving the town without enough of a labor force to service it's own basic needs. These are the more advanced management decisions required once you get beyond basic town building. The game requires a lot of future planning to be successful, and will be very hard for anyone trying to just live in the moment. It simply isn't enough to only solve today's problems. This is especially true when it comes to the cycle of seasons, which has been handled extremely well. This is the first game I've played where the crop cycle really is as important as it was in real life centuries ago. One of my takeaways from playing has been an increased understanding and respect for how hard it must have been to establish the early American colonies. In closing, while the developer has expressed a desire to eventually explore other projects, it is my hope that he will invest as much time as he can into expanding the core functionality and content of the game before moving on. This is truly one of the great town games  of the modern era, and an incredible achievement for one man working alone.     "

												**Updated check the end of this review**Banished first had me once I saw how you had to provide the people with what they need while planning for the future. The main ideas are very basic but juggling everything is not always easy. Every adult is assigned a role in your village, they do their work while also caring for themselves and their family. Food and warmth are top priority. As you progress wants will come into play, like new types of food better clothes and tools, religion and alcohol. If you have a good thing going, people from other villages will come to join you. Bringing more hands to work, more mouths to feed and disease. A great planning and town building game, make sure you do not over extend yourself or the people will suffer.Seems that this game is setting up for some mod tools... so its 10x better than it was before. I am very excited about potential mods. Great job to the dev guy that made this!			"

												Great game.  Graphics are nice with a lot of detail when zoomed in but lack colour. I had to restart 4 times because all people died of hunger. So at first you must not go crazy building houses to get more population but see that you have an abundance of food and different types. Also one should build a forester from the start as you need lots of firewood.It has things which could have been better like the trader, when you add to the inventory, it would have been good that it shows how much you have in total in stock. I think the town hall tells you the total.Got it for $6 so its really worth it and overall enjoying the game.			"

												An interesting and brave game made by a single developer.  The city building mechanic is very solid and with enough variety to keep you occupied for a while.  The game is best played in ""zen"" mode, where you aren't too fussed about objectives, achievements or winning but just about structuring your food and resource production and city layout as you slowly grow.The most obvious flaw is that the game lacks any sort of campaign or structure beyond pure sandbox.  The unstated objective seems to be to grow as big as possible whilst surviving as long as possible.  I think this game would certainly benefit from a more structured campaign mode with clear objectives, however this  could potentially become available as mod support is supposedly in the long term plan.  Overall a truly impressive game coming from a single developer - it looks and sounds fantastic.  It is prevented from being great only by the lack of a more structured game mode.  8 out of 10			"

Its purely a city builder with enviromental challenges and it requires some thought to even make it 10 in-game years.

												While it initially seemed to me to be a pretty basic town building sim, I soon learned that it had more depth and complexity than what I had assumed. My first few starts were doomed, having underestimated the town's needs and overestimated production. Careful resource management is required, and building placement should be carefully considered. The game shirks a single-resource economy, going so far as to do away with money altogether. Buildings are made via a few different resources (logs, stone, and iron), but to survive you'll need food (of which a balanced diet is needed, or else there'll be health problems), housing (for warmth, comfort, and expansion of your population), clothing (for the Winter), and most likely trade (items are sold and bought using a value of ""units,"" so there's a regulated value of all items).While there is more to the game, I'd rather not chat your ear off any further. Long story short, I've played a few hours and enjoyed it, and am about to put in a few more before I turn in for the night. I whole-heartedly recommend this game to those interesting in city building sims.			"

It's like a more micro heavy CIV, managing resources and who does which job in your settlement and trying not to scream when everyone dies because you forgot that people need tools to build things, and to make tools you need a blacksmith, and I need tools to build the blacksmith....FFFF			"

												Very nice strategy game. Although at the start you might think this game doesn't have a lot of buildings and mechanics compared to other city builders/strategy games, the way you need to utilize them in the right way and the difficulty to keep your settlement alive gives this game enormous depth. I really hope this game will be expanded with extra content though. Anyway the groundwork is there, and it's awesome.			"

												Banished is a wonderful city building simulator with an emphasis on survival. The game is quite simple, however, there is strength in the simplicity. Everything is the game is streamlined and easy to understand. There is not too many things to build within your city but the game is still playable for hours end because the game is not about the content within. The game is about the challenge. If you buy this game you'll find yourself focusing on setting goals and challenging yourself rather than what to build. And that's the way it was designed. Your looking to survive as long as you can and as effectively as you can. Thats the point to Banished and that is what makes it enjoyable.If you have issues ""creating your own game"" with your imagination, you wont like Banished. There is certainly fun within the game and building cities but if you want layers and layers to your city, this game won't be for you. However, if you enjoy challenging yourself you will enjoy this game for hours to come.			"

												Alright, the game is pretty damn good, but it still feels a little incomplete to me... but, for the price that's not much of a complaint. The game seems hard at first, but that's because there's a few traps you can fall into. If you avoid crops and livestock early on (focusing on fishing, gather, and hunting) then you should do just fine. Along with food, you'll find that tools are incredibly important, so don't let either of those things run out. From there it's just an inverse difficulty curve, once you get passed the early part the game gets much easier.Anyway, it's a solid game that is a bit reminiscent of the old Sim City games, where failure was a possibility, although not quite as deep. Hopefully we'll see some more updates to this game.			"

												My town of Tomorrowland, a city-state that thrived from the humble beginnings of just a few friendly families banished from Great Britain to a colony meant to fail. However, those colonists thrived. After the complete disconnection from the king, they thrived and thrived. Self-sufficient! 3 farms, 2 orchards, a hunting cabin, forester lodge, gatherer's hut, and herbalists. We had medicine, food, clothing, and tools. By year 20, we had a HUGE population with mines, quarries, trading posts, and Adventurers searching for the ""Curse of the Golden Llama."" It was a COLONIAL CHARTER, and it couldn't've gone better. But the unthinkable happened.We unwillingly traded with Britain. A trade boat came that seemed like Boni, our indepentent farming goods partner whom we have a great contract with. We traded a great deal of seeds and crops, boxed filled with crops. Inside one of the boxes *gasp* was a British spy.Surveying our city-state, he noticed our distillery, great trade post, farms, pastures, palm tree lodgers, and great City Hall. He loaded our hall with firewood and burned the building down. HE burned almost everything. Left, was a group of 5 families with a stockpile of wood, stone, and very small pile of iron. Inside the lone storage barn were some tools, a couple of hide coats, and some leftover potatoes from last Spring's harvest. It was like the beginning.Honestly, this game absolutely FANTASTIC. The vanilla game is pretty good, offers a great deal of fun and learning of city building and controlling villagers. Then the workshop comes in, and the mods flow in like a river during a storm. Colonial Charter (CC) Curse of the Golden Llama adds a♥♥♥♥♥♥LOAD I mean♥♥♥♥♥♥LOAD of content, and extra little mods like Intensified Fishing Dock and More Wood/Stone/Iron per Tree/Rock/Ore make the game like no other.10/10 would watch my city-state burn again			"

												I consider myself relatively new to city builders, so I guess I have an objective view of the genre... That being said, there was something seemed very interesting about Banished. The visuals looked nice, and it looked easy enough. I had seen a not-so-serious YouTube series on it, and decided I wanted to give it a try. Once you start playing, it instantly draws you in. It is simple to pick up, and at first, it seems laughably so: ""No currency? No levels to limit your building availability? This should be easy... I'll get every building, then there will be nothing left to do."" If you are thinking this (and I have to admit I did have a bit of doubt, even after seeing gameplay), I can tell you that you are completely and utterly wrong. Keeping your citizens happy, healthy, and far away from starving or freezing to death requires careful management and planning ahead. Since there is no currency, resources are bartered in the trading system. Being able to determine what you can feasibly trade away takes a keen eye and the ablilty to think ahead. Every action has a consequence. At best, it can help grow your population; at worse, it can leave them out to starve, freeze, or die by some other means. This is not a game where you can afk for 20 minutes...If you were able to successfully keep your citizens sort of fed, housed, and, well, alive, you may eventually find that your town is home to every building available (at least at the moment). Don't fret! You will soon find that you have developed the insatiable urge to keep building and growing your population. There is always the feeling that there is something to do, whether it's build more homes to help increase your population, or build more resource collectors to keep your current population better supplied. Basically, it is quite addicting, especially if it's your goal to try to see how far your town can expand or how large the population can get.The fundamentals aside, the game is beautiful. Textures are detailed and bright, but not muddy nor unrealistic. The towns feel genuine and alive. The bustling little villages are filled with chatter, animals making noises, and tools pounding (albeit being close to a quarry at 10x speed can be a little annoying after a while). Whatever sounds begin to wear on you, though, are made up for by the peaceful acoustic soundtrack which fits the theme perfectly. The UI is simple, easy to read, yet provides plenty of information. That information is greatly expanded once you get a town hall built, where you can see graphs and stats throughout the history of the town, which is always interesting. It runs smoothly, though slower when the speed is increased to 5x and 10x, which is understandable (I usually play on 5x and find it fine).Overall, it is a decievingly simple game, with pleasant visuals, and an overall peaceful atmosphere (which can change very fast). I was at first hesitant to buy it at $20, and I did end up getting it on sale for $10, though after playing it, I would now not hesitate to buy it at full price.			"

												Really fun sandbox/city builder. Everything in this game boils down to survival, forget how much money you have, you can't buy your way out of trouble in this game. Bad harvest and your food stocks have run low, winter setting in?....tough, some people will probably starve, which mean less help with next years harvest, or perhaps no one to go hunting next spring.It's all about the people in this game, to be sucessful you have to help them survive grow food, raise livestock, build homes, educate them, assign jobs (which is actually done a nice dynamic fashion rather than per specific person)In essence, what are a bunch of simple mechanics and a seemingly easy task when you don't have to worry about money, actually blends together fantastically well into fun to play, easy to learn, hard to master game			"

												Great time waster . having to maintain a town from very little to very big is some what testing at times , I have to say the town looks much bigger then the population ( ex: 100 population = 25 homes at least ) the food and minning seem to be the hardest you have to have a lot of food , and mining is slow to come from the beginning ...The other big factor is clothing , the warm clothing is the way to go and also with tools try to get steel as quickly as possible ( requires mine because of coal ) . its good to have a few hunter cabins and gathers right from the beginning ...Over all its a great time waster like i said , ... There is no goal Just keep building and keep up the food and wood and mining , grab some nomads when you can , build some homes and increase food and make them miners....Traders can save your life if food gets to low as well , saved me once ....have high value items to trade so you can buy food at a low price , coats are worth the most to sell ...Keep a well stocked trading post with food and supplies when you can , not for selling but for restocking your supplies incase anything happens , all you have to do is put the stock back in the general population and instant supplies until you figure out what to do about what went wrong , lol/...

												Banished is a game about as oppressive and meaningless as life itself. And for that reason I would recommend it, not for its entertainment value but for the raw challenge stripped of the gilding so many other simulator games can't do without. Any moments of satisfaction you find as you struggle against nature and time to build some resemblance of a town are quickly obliterated either by the proceeding tedium of routine or the catastrophe of a town-wide fire. You spend all of your time trying to manage a continuously out of balance economy with minimal data and limited input. The lives of your citizens are woefully abstract, left for you to deduce the continuity of their mundune yet often incestuous dealings. The player becomes like a god, conversely irritated and amused at the incompetence of these vain mortals.In this respect Banished can be refreshingly cruel. It seems out of place in an age that values progress, self-sustaining systems, rewards for investment. The game is still compelling even though it rewards strife with more strife rather than superficial celebration in badges, thumbs-up, and other trinkets of gameification. The player's struggle is not for the carrot-on-a-stick of clearly defined objectives. It's tragic pathos all the way down. You find yourself struggling against both  your own intuitions, the lack of direction, and the permanent imbalance of the game's mechanics, such that the only ""victory"" possible is, like the live's of the people you lead in futility, a noble and heroic stand in the face of an inevitable downfall.Simply put, if you want the control of a SimCity or the personal interest of a Harvest Moon, don't buy it. Banished is heartless, even if it is still lovable. "

If you're looking for a strategic and survival-based town builder with a rich atmosphere, look no further. There's no technological advancement, political or military struggles to be had in Banished, sure, but as soon as you start playing you'll realize there's no need for that. This simulation is so finely crafted and complex that you'll have your hands full with simply trying to keep your people well fed and warm.Banished is an excellent mix of simulation, survival and strategy.

Banished is the game for you, but don't be fooled, this won't be a walk in the park.  Battle with harsh winters, low food supplies, and plagues that rival those of the Dark Ages.  If you are able to make it through the winter, you just might have a chance to survive.Banished is an addicting game that will take up all the spare time you have and then some.  Every change you make will affect whether or not your town will survive.			"

												Excellent city builder. Your citizens are your most important resource in this game as you try to survive against the environment, which is the kind of thing that I love the most. The only thing wrong with this game was a rather limited number of buildings and professions. But that problem has long been fixed with mods which add SO MUCH content to the game.			"

												Although promoted as a city builder, it is far more a town builder, and focuses heavily on survival. Prepare to watch your town starve, and then when you’ve figured out that problem, prepare to watch your town freeze during the harsh bite of cold during the winter.Banished is hard when you don’t know what you’re doing, and even once you’ve gotten the hang of it, will still be unforgiving if you make a mistake. Although the learning curve is tough, the game is well made and fun, though the last city builder published by a big developer was the new Sim City so the current bar on city builders is currently not terribly high.Jokes aside, being from a single developer, Banished is outstanding. The difficulty can be high, the score is not too compelling (Although soothing and relaxing), and there is the occasional oddity, but otherwise the game is well polished and very engaging.If you are a fan of city building and survival games then you will fall in love with Banished. Just make sure you save up enough food for winter! My current town is surviving solely on hot peppers and cabbage. I fully expect riots in the near future if we survive this winter.			"

												Nice game, in the spirit of the classic titles Caesar 3, Pharaoh, Sim City 4, and Stronghold (without the fighting). The first few hours of gameplay are a bit slow if intermittently intense; once you hit a certain population, however, the game becomes frantic; and it finally settles down once you claim all available land.+ Solid, balanced gameplay.+ Cute graphics.+ One of the few quality titles catering to lovers of city-builder games.- The game lacks awesome monuments like the pyramids in Pharaoh. I want to top off my town with a sweet-looking cathedral.- No combat (though this can also be a plus).- Building options somewhat limited. I want to beautify my town with gardens, have libraries, build a university, stuff like that. At best, you can build a fine village (or small town) in this game. But not a city. Maybe in the sequel.8/10 - highly recommended to city-builder players.			"

												Banished is a gem in the rough. Following little publicitly, it popped onto the Steam store in mid-February and enjoyed its time in the limelight of online streaming. Becoming known among many of those who know it as the game where your city dies in the winter, it seems to have enjoyed a good amount of success considering the scale of the release and the relatively unknown nature of the game. Banished shines in the way it's presented. It doesn't just give you problems to solve, it makes you the one who determines what the problems are. Making the decision to expand your city by constructing additional houses for new families to move into provides you with a larger workforce down the line, allowing you to mine crucial resources or complete construction projects faster. But it also emburdens your settlement with the requirement to feed more mouths. And when that mouth is a child's, it won't be paying you back in the form of useful labor for years to come. Hence your town dying in the winter. You learn Banished through a series of catastrophic mistakes. A multi-tier tutorial can help you along in understanding the purpose of Banished's different structures, villager professions, and so on, but to its benefit I didn't find that I needed it beyond the first lesson or two. The real learning occurs when the urban center of your treasured town burns down in a fire that makes the Great Fire of London seem trivial. You learn quickly in Banished because it -hurts- to lose what you've worked up to. When something goes wrong despite all your plans and analysis, after some initial baffelement or frustration, the question always arises: why, and how can I fix it? Like any any unpolished gem, Banished is not without its imperfections. Your prime resources - your town's settlers - offer little in the way of communication other than letting you know when they're starving to death or lacking tools. I struggled to understand why buildings weren't being constructed when I had sufficient builders and resources available, only to realize that I just didn't have stockpiles of the materials needed close enough to move the process along. Thankfully, one of the greatest tools in Banished's aresenal is the priority tool, a function letting you paint areas of the map to designate to your settlers what needs to be done the most. This expedites whatever you want done satisfyingly, and fixes a lot of Banished's occassional lack of feedback.That said, I've had multiple towns ruined multiple times by aforementioned flash fires. Despite having water-dispersing wells placed throughout my city, the majority of it continued to completely burn down whenever a fire broke out. Eventually, and much to my gamer shame, I turned the ""disasters"" feature off because I just couldn't get the occassional doomsday fire to stop. But these complaints are secondary to the great game that Banished is. If you're craving a city sim and aren't satisfied by Anno or Sim City, this is the title for you. The graphics are humble but well-executed, the atmosphere convincing, and the sandbox nature that makes each town different from the last promising many hours of play. There's real depth here, and the long term hope is that Shining Rock understands there's room to expand upon it.			"

												I've always admired these type of games, some can let you down, but this one will not. It's challenging, it's good-looking, and brings the toughest ""boss"" back: the winter (and some disasters too). You need to do anything to make sure that your people will survive through those hard and long winters, and sometimes, it's hard to have food, clothes and medicine to give them. Yeah, I love real challenges.A well done game by you guys, I recommend to all people that love this type of game!			"

												This game is an amazing medieval city sim builder. You will have fun, success and then failure. It is a fun and rewarding experience if you can pull off a successful town. That said though, I have had 3 villages that have had 300 citizens and almost 100 years in each one. When this happens there is not much more you can do after that except expand, and that is all you can do. This can get very repetitive and boring. I hope the developer ( and there is only one developer) has time to add more content for the end game. Putting that aside, Great Game.			"

												A really fun Strategy/City-Building/Survival game.. You start with a few people and a few supplies (how much depends on the difficulty), and the goal ain't to build an empire to stand the test of time, or build a strong economy, or what have you, But the goal is to keep your people alive and expand your village.The maps are randomly generated and huge, There are random disasters that can devastate your village such as Plauges, Tornadoes, Fires, Crop Infestations, and I'm sure many others (those are the ones that have hit me so far).This is not a game that I will play every day for months, but it is a game that I will play whenever I get a notion to.. (Kind of like Minecraft, I bought that game in early Alpha, and I still play it every couple of days/weeks/months)So Yes, I would recommend this game to anybody who likes City-Building, Strategy, or Survival games.. It's only $20, and It will (atleast for me) be one of those rare games that I never will get bored of playing.. I've bought games for $60 before, that I played for a week, stuck it on a shelf, and forgot I even had it. I'd recommend watching a video or 2 of it to see if it's the kind of game for you.			"

												Absolutely pleasant city builder here. Quite serene and logical, really makes you plan ahead considerably. While people may cry out for COMBAT! and other big-budget additions, I believe they are missing the point. This game is challenging enough without having to fend off barbarians. It showcases that nature truly is your worst evemy. Thriving school full of children? How nice! HADOOKEN! Tornado. There goes the brightest of your next generation. Beautiful little urban center around the market? Nah, sprinkle some of this inferno on there just to show him he needs to build more wells. The game rules. If I havn't convinced anyone yet, let me highlight a BIG reason I like this game: it makes me root for screw up $@(! to happen. Examples: You know,  I did pay attention, and you guys are first cousins, but we really need you to reproduce so please move in together and have a baby. Then marry them to your other first cousins kid. Or my other favorite? 68 year old widow living in a house? DIE ALREADY, people need to bang and make more people! Go move into the boarding house I made for people like you. How about this one? Ever root for some good farm animal on farm animal action? When my people are on the verge of starvation I am rooting for the chickens and cows to get nasty so my peeps can eat their peeps. (get it?) Love the game, incredible achievement for a 1 man dev, keep up the great work.			"

NOPE: build 2 more houses than necessary and everyone suddenly starts to starve to death, the lumberers don't get as much wood after a the second or third year, and oh, wait, there's not enough workers for all the jobs available.But then, there's the winter, people getting sick, fires coming up when you're not ready... did I mention the tornadoes because ♥♥♥♥ you?And when you notice the time, you've spent hours hooked up in this game.Totally worth the money.PD: Seriously, you'll lose at least 4-5 times before you get to the first 50 villagers without much trouble.

												This is a fantastic game, I love it too bits. It's always challenging you to manage your resources and makes you come into hte game with a game plan. you can't simply waltz into this game without having to think about how you'll produce food in the winter, if you're firewood supplies will last until hte following year or even if you have decent tradable goods to recieve things like crop seeds and live stock!Absolutely brilliant game, I love how everything effects citizens! If you dont have a graveyard you're citizens get sad as they struggle to remember their loved ones. Erecting a Town hall to show Cenus details adn tells you what you can do to possibly improve diets and life span!I did at the start think this game as a little like Anno but it's far from it, no boundries, no need to erect spefici building to build in a new area. All you do is slam a few food production/resource production buildings down and up the speed to x10 and watch the little guys go to work.I love how labourers can take up work from those who get killed or die of natural causes, so it automatically assigns people incase you miss the notification!I would however, really like this game to blast off and produce challenging maps instead of the Valleys and Mountains, maybe you could have grasslands with little wood and rely of foresters to plant trees and trade! Black forests with little streams and the one lake or Fyord out of reach of your current postion, until you cna gain enough goods to actually venture to it.Overall I love this game, I would recommend any Simcity or City building player to buy and play this game. You won't be disappointed!			"

												Lots of fun and not as micromanagement hell as other sims. The Colonial Charter (Excellent Adventure) is really necessary for full play and makes this fun. Rather than boring research or technology trees, you have to build interconnected supply and production chains.  Using CC, to make a saw mill, you need steel tools. To get steel tools you need a coal mine and you need to upgrade a blacksmith. To upgrade a black smith you need a brick maker. A brick maker requires a shore house. An advanced economy is a complex economy. There are many other technology routes that can be taken or explored, while ignoring others. What you can't build out can buy from traders. I'm going to gift this game to some kids next Christmas who'll love it -- and unwittingly introduce them to ""economic geography"".			"

												Absolutely amazing, and equally peaceful city building / management simulator. Aside from surviving natural disasters, There is no actual combat in the game, no aggression aspect to it.All you can do is sit down, zone out to the chilled-out medieval music in-game and start building / planning away. It's not for everybody, chances are you'll be bored staring at people you can't directly tell what to do / waiting for something to happen. It's all up to what you're looking for in your game. I bought this to be able to zone out without having to go through the intensitivity of simulating combat / any such thing. And that's exactly what it does. I usually start playing this game, and only two or three hours later do I snap out of it, save my game and repeat that process the next best time I feel like doing so.Summarized, it's a great game to play when life is a little rough on you. There's no real stress factor other than you just having to make sure your people have what their little simulated hearts require. :)I'd give Banished a 8/10 it's not perfect, and requires a certain kind of mood/mentality, but when I'm looking to de-stress myself this is the perfect game to do so!

												As addictive and rewarding as the Civilization series.On the flipside , it can also be really frustruating.  There is no difficulty degree in this game, it's all or nothing, couple that with the fact the game itself doesn't have any precise 'instructions' ( when people get unhappy, you can't be exactly sure why, you need to investigate by observving the peoples behavior.  Are they sick ?  Are they tired of eating only cabbage ?  Do they want Ale or Jesus ?  It's a best guess ) and becomes a very challenging game.But it is incredibly rewarding.  You really start to get invested in your little villagers.  You want them to  be happy and to do well.  Or sometimes you want them to die already so a younger couple can move into there house and start to reproduce.  Or you just don't like them because there unhappy all the time, and WTF Jill die already so I can bring my happiness back up.A rare and beautiful game, I search for games like these and get lucky if I can find one of them every 2 years or so.

												Banished has a level of detail that is not achieved in many city building simulators.  Unfortunately there is no technology progression like there is in Sim City or other games.  All buildings can be built straight away, with no unlocks after certain milestones or achievments, and no tech trees.  Undoubtedly though, some players will appreciate this.  That being said, there is a great deal of depth to the ways a town can be managed in this game.  Resource balance is paramount, and even the slightest changes can have significant effects in both the short and long term.  This requires an attention to detail by the palyer that I thoroughly enjoy.  The underlying mechanics in Bansihed are impressive considereing some games like Sim City and Cities XL can drive a player mad when it screws up seemingly simple mechanics like traffic flow. I have not experienced such frustration with Banished.  Citizens will actually move as close as possible to their work place.  And even as the town's population grows, the underlying mechanics don't get all screwed up like I experience in Sim City for years.I definitely recommend this game.			"

This game is brutal and punishes mistakes like Sim City never would and despite the fact that the texture quality isn't amazing it still looks fantastic. Oh, and I believe it was made by just one guy.Definitely worth the £15 price-tag			"

												Banished is my favorite city-builder game I've played. It can sometimes be hard to understand, playing the game with time sped up slows down framerate significantly, and when something goes wrong it can be incredibly frustrating and impossible to fix. However, besides all of that it is an incredibly fun and engaging game. Your first village full of exiles will fail miserably. Your second will probably fail even more miserably. In fact, you'll fail quite few times before you actually get the hang of it. When you do get the hang of it though, you will feel so freaking accomplished you'll cry. Just make sure you don't run out of tools...			"

												An organic 'village/town' builder. This is what Sim City 5/6 should have been like. Steadily advance your fledgling village, one building at a time. Build what you need, when you need it. You can't just plonk buildings down like a mayor on steroids. I've always been a big Sim City fan and, like many people, I've been bitterly disappointed by the recent reincarnations of Sim City and I was pleased to find Banished. In essence, the game is all about resource management, both in materials and labour. Keep your food stores up and only take from the environment what you can afford to lose in the short and long term. Delegate your work force to the ultimate objective - continuous, sustainable growth.Its a challenging game that requires you to think about what you want to build, when you should build it, and most importantly, why you should build it. It takes a little time to get used to the game mechanics, but it is incredibly satisfying to build that local school or get that chapel up and running. A great and well thought out game, especially considering it was only made by one guy.9/10 - Get it if you enjoy your old fashioned Sim City games!			"

												A fun and quirky game to say the least. A great mix between a full scale city builder game and a Medival era strategy game. The best of both worlds in my opinion.

												This game was great fun for the first couple of days I played it, then it just got tedious and boring after that. If you do buy this game I recommend getting it on sale because it is a very bare bones game. I will recommend it because i got it on sale, and for the price I will not complain too much about it. One night at the movies to take my family costs $60 and the last movie I paid that much to see only gave 2 hours of mediocre entertainment and I regretted spending it after I did.  It was the Avengers sequel and compared to the first it was a BIG YAWN. Two reviews in one how about that...			"

												A great game for city builder enthusiasts.Set in the XVIIIth century, you are a little colony settling in an inhospitable land. Build you town to survive the winter, and expand it to welcome more and more people. Become the best city in the New World !Featuring beautiful graphics, this game also has a very intricate economic system, which will not hesitate to slap you on the wrist for the slightest mistake. You will need to manage every resource at your disposal to survive, from wood and stone to herbs and clay. Catastrophes can stem from the smallest errors and snowball very rapidly, often resulting in comedic losses in no time.The community is active and mods are available, the best being Colonial Charter, which expands and adds vast amounts of content.Highly recommended game, but be careful, it will eat up your free time.

												One of my favorite games of all times, Banished gets you in the situation of a group of families determined to start their lives again from scratch by settling down in a new, unknown virgin land to them.There are no objectives in this game; just lean on your couch, sort out the best way to start building your city and watch how your settlers begin to work. No instant building; before even a simple house can be lifted, you must make sure that you are in possession of the required materials for it. Though it may become really relaxing for some players, don't get me wrong; this game, without mods, is as challenging as could be.In short terms, this is (at least for me) just the perfect game to relax; the gameplay comes with a smoothing music selection for you to enjoy, mixing emotions such as what the settlers may feel while facing the inclemency of the harsh weather or when they look at the future with a positive lens, working hard to earn their keep and contribute to the growth of their new hometown.

												If you enjoy sitting down and planning out the survival of your own tribe, then you will not be disappointed with this game.  I am a huge fan of games such as Roller Coaster Tycoon, Theme Hospital, Warcraft, C&C, Starcraft, Stronghold... I just had to give this game a go based on the positive user reviews.Banished is quite brutal - you will restart your game many times before you perfect it.  But the variety in buildings you can make, professions your villagers can have and especially the trading aspect mean you won't find yourself getting bored.  You have to CONSTANTLY pay attention to a range of things in order to keep expanding.One other positive of note is the mods available through Steam.  I have only used the Colonial Charter mod so far and it literally doubled the in-game content ie new maps, buildings, food, professions, trade etc.This really is a peach of a game.			"

												I was excited for the reboot of simcity last year and like pretty much everyone else was horribly dissapointed. This game has restored my faith in city building games. It is complex and if you do not use the wiki you will have a blast failing many many times. I would advise trying it on hard and just learning from that as I found easy it to be just a little simple even my first try. Ive put hours into this game and am still not finished. The graphics are incredible, they may look a little dated but this is done by one guy. The idea that a mod kit is coming out soon is just amazing. Once the community becomes invovled I think this game will explode more then it already has. This is easily a 30$ or 40$ game, for 20$ it is a steal! BUY AND YOU WILL ENJOY!			"

The map seed generator and the town name generator is just astounding. I have not yet seen a repeat of an exact same town name or map seed yet, which really tells me how much work was put into this. The only problem I do have is with how much food the people grab. Each person (adult) will grab 100 units of food, which can quickly make your food supply dwindle after about... I'd say 2 seasons in game? But other than that, I'd really recommend that you (the reader) get this game.			"

												This is a great game, I love it because it is a rather unique game, and the simulation is fantastic, you have the ability to make a totally peaceful town if you have had a bad day, then there is a hardcore version with disasters and everything. You can turn off disasters and choose the hard start, or turn off disasters and make it easy. Either way, it's realistic and a generally great game, and at 20$ it's a great steal as well. The game constantly evolves as you play, and the enviroment is fully changable, animals may become extinct and soil eventually wears out. Crop rotation is key with farms, animals can be hunted to extinction, fish can be as well. The game is dynamic and fun with varying difficulty.			"

Figure out a status configuration that works for you.3rd.	 Play the tutorial!4th.	 When you have played the basic game and have a decent idea of how the game works try out the mods.5th.	 Watch your life pass you by almost as fast as the villagers :)All in all this game is wonderful.

												Having played a good few hours of Banished so far, I've got to say: this is a good game. Not great, but good. Overall, my impression is that it's still very much a work in progress.Banished draws you in and easily sucks away hours of your life as you concern yourself with keeping your villagers alive and building them a stable and, above all, sustainable home. There is a real sense of accomplishment in transforming three families and a cartload of basic supplies into a thriving community of hundreds of villagers.However, a few times now I have got to the point where it seems I have achieved all I can in the game. Others who have played Banished might recognise it; you have built up most of the viable land on the map, stabilised your population, and backed it all up with a steady supply of food and resources. What is there left to do? Apart from sitting behind your monitor and appreciating all that you've built, honestly, not much...Once you have built all the 'civic' buildings (which can occur relatively early on) there is little left to achieve besides marginally increasing the population. That gets old rather quickly. There is the odd 'disaster' which occurs, but there is little you can do to directly combat those. Instead, you simply wait for them to run their course and rebuild, if necessary. I feel Banished is crying out for a deeper level of complexity in order to increase its replay value. Building up larger communities should come with the societal problems which typically arise from them. I once saw one of my villagers met his end because he was ""stabbed"". An incident like that should trigger an event which leads to your society choosing its own justice system. And why don't the citizens protest after a stonecutter has been crushed by a rock for the umpteenth time? Those feel like missed opportunities to me.In short, I feel that with a game like this you should be able to eventually control its society and politics a bit more to give each settlement its own 'flavour'. I'll be keeping a keen eye on the future development of this game in the hope something like that will be added.			"

												God, I've been so hooked on this game since I bought it! My first 2 villages died out very fast, but third time was the charm!You would think that playing the game with not much difference between the buildings, no combat or no big difference between each playtime would be boring, but surprisingly enough, it's not. You can basically see how your villagers are born and how they grow up, and eventually die. You'll see their children start their own families.You need to slowly adapt to your growing village. The buildings or their design doesn't chance over time. There are disasters, like tornados, fire and freezing to death, but the first two don't happen very often. Suring my playtime, I've had one tornado (that didn't hit my village) and a fire that burned down two houses. At the start of the new game, most of villagers often freeze or starve to death during the first few years, no matter how fast you try to provide them with the stuff they need. If the villagers that are left are too old or the ones that are still young enough are the same gender, they won't have children and your village will die out like two of my first ones did.The game is very repeative, but I don't find it to bother me at all. It will probably take me a long time to get tired of this game. I would recommed it if you're looking for a game that you can relax with.If you would like some challenge, I can promise you that the achievements will be pretty tough!			"

												It takes a few restarts to get going, but it's very satisfying. I'm hoping they expand with a higher margin of error - in a game where population is like your score, you should be able to take a population hit when disaster strikes, but be able to recover.Also I see it getting stale. With a higher margin for error, you could introduce random events, conditions or story elements to switch up the build orders.I haven't looked at custom buildings, but I'm wary they may throw off the balance.

												I love the premise of the game, but there are a few issues which are a bit off-putting to me.First, which may be minor to some, and may be considered a quabble to others... the age of adulthood in this game is 10 years old.  I assume they've set the thing in the Middle Ages, but there's no real reason to do that, frankly.  It could just as easily have been placed in the 18th century.  Second, which is a MUCH more game-breaking issue... food.  When you first start out you have maybe a dozen adults in your village.  Of these you have to use 2/3rds of them just to gather food.  That means 8 people working 2 fishing docks constantly.  Really?  For 12 adults and 4 kids?  That's a bit out of proportion to reality.  There are whole real-life villages being sustained by 8 fishermen, and they have more than 16 people in them.Every single game revolves around starving to death.  The only thing being banished in this game is proper food gathering/distribution/storage coding.If they'd just make this bit a touch more realistic it would be an insanely fun and engaging game.			"

An idea would be to make your villagers flatten mountains and with the dirt they obtain to fill in mines/quarries as they are permenant at the moment.  Other then that you're doing a terrific job, keep up the good work!			"

												Nice game, in the spirit of the classic titles Caesar 3, Pharaoh, Sim City 4, and Stronghold (without the fighting). The first few hours of gameplay are a bit slow if intermittently intense; once you hit a certain population, however, the game becomes frantic; and it finally settles down once you claim all available land.+ Solid, balanced gameplay.+ Cute graphics.+ One of the few quality titles catering to lovers of city-builder games.- The game lacks awesome monuments like the pyramids in Pharaoh. I want to top off my town with a sweet-looking cathedral.- No combat (though this can also be a plus).- Building options somewhat limited. I want to beautify my town with gardens, have libraries, build a university, stuff like that. At best, you can build a fine village (or small town) in this game. But not a city. Maybe in the sequel.8/10 - highly recommended to city-builder players.			"

												This game will take over your life for the first week you play it, but then shortly after you will find that there just aren't enought game mechanics to make the game the most fun it should be. Overall, the game experience was fantastic, but some people will find that it falls short in terms of content. That being said, I would recommend this game and I recommend installing mods for the game.			"

												This has easily become one of my favorite games.  It has a little bit of a learning curve, but you'll eventually figure it out.  And when you do, you'll feel quite accomplished.  It's literally the only Steam game I own that I actually tried to get achievments in.If you like city builders and enjoy planning things out waaaay in advanced.  This game is for you.  If you're looking for a game that you can invade other cities and commit mass murder, this isn't the right one.			"

												This game is can of worms, but good worms. This game is hard and does not get updates, however it is really fun. This game has no bandits or animal attacks. It is just a simple game about building a kingdom with your only worries being the cold, hunger, and disease. When playing the game put the time setting on 10, it's the only way you can get some real challenge out of the game. I do not use that lightly I mean real challege, time management and etc. However this could definitely be charaterized as ""casual"".			"

Again, not great, but not immersion breaking.Interface: 9/10Things are where you'd expect them to be. Buildings are mostly self explanatory - farms produce food, taverns produce ale, woodcutters produce firewood, etc. It helps that there aren't many buildings to begin with, maybe 30 or so, making it easy to keep things straight.Plot: N/AIt's a city builder. No plot, it starts when it starts and it ends when you get bored or everyone dies.Gameplay: 10/10Banished is different from most other civilization simulation games. Your goal is not to make money, but to survive. You will dedicate most of your population to producing food, most of your time to cultivating your resources, and most of your space to managing your population. If you enjoy that level of micromanagement, you'll enjoy this game. It is a bit of a niche market, but if you're the type of person that enjoys focusing on a more base level of survival than the traditional kill-or-be-killed style of game that's so popular these days, you may enjoy this.

												Fun little strategy game.  It seems pretty easy at first to get your city up and running smoothly, but this takes a lot of careful planning - am I running out of natural resources?  How much food do I need to produce?  Am I making sure my villagers are having babies (this did me in one time).There's a large variety of crops, livestock, and jobs to put in your town - and it's kind of addicting to get all of them.  Never in my life have I loudly proclaimed ""I HAVE SHEEP"" with so much joy.I got a little bored once my town started running like a well-oiled machine, but I'm sure when I boot the game up again some massive catastrophe will kill everyone.5/5			"

												I guided my people though many years of growth and happiness. After several generations of potato farmers, a lucky trade resulted in peach tree seeds. Our orchards were just beginning to yield fruit, with which we could start brewing peach ale!  Then, I had a tools shortage one season because I had iron surplus stored in the trading dock, and tried to build too much at once. That had a negative effect on crop yields (fewer tools), which were only just keeping up with my booming population anyway. The next several years were a slow downward spiral, as the farmers, hunters, gatherers, and their children all slowly died of starvation, each year producing less food for everyone else as there were fewer workers. Almost turned it around by clearing out food reserves, but the winter had set in, slowing down everything. Not enough woodcutters for firewood, or laborers in general. My people either starved or froze to death until no one was left, leaving a sad,empty town. No more picks clinking or trees falling or axes chopping, just the sound of the wind. Total and absoute despair. 10/10. Can't wait to try again.			"

												After about 50 hours of ""Banished!"" I highly recommend this game to fans of the city-building genre.  At first the game seems very simple but you quickly find it has a ton of depth to it and can be quite challenging.  ""Banished!"" doesn't have combat but you'll find yourself constantly battling hunger, cold, and resource management to the point where you'll be glad there aren't any invaders knocking on your door.  You will have to make some tough decisions early in each village- ""Do I spend my vital resources on food production?  but I don't have enough workers to man those buildings... so do I build houses in hopes of increasing my population?  but then I won't have enough food and my people will starve..."" These predicaments are endless which makes it extremely satisfying when you get your population to a meager 50-75 citizens or more.  The only downside is I feel like once you get a village to a certain point it is way too easy, however, the game will be mod-able soon and that should bring tons of new options to add onto this already fun game.  At a price of $20 this is a no-brainer.  Not to mention the fact that this game was created by a SINGLE PERSON, it's nice to know that the money is helping support a very talented indie game creator.			"

												This game is VERY frustrating but at the same time AMAZING!Overall 9.5/10 addictive game, WOULD recommened! - Only down side to the game and one thing I'd like to see be added would be a some sort of terrain leveling tool.Once your village starts to expand and there ends up being a little hill in the middle or surronding your village that can't be removed or flattened ends up being very annoying. An idea would be to make your villagers flatten mountains and with the dirt they obtain to fill in mines/quarries as they are permenant at the moment.  Other then that you're doing a terrific job, keep up the good work!			"

The fact that there are no enemies besides the unforgiving mistress that is Mother Nature (well, that and a few stray boars and falling rocks) is fascinating.  The game does a pretty good job of driving home the difficulties of creating a settlement in an isolated place.  Definitely worth checking out, it's quite re-playable and a great change-of-pace from some of the more frenetic games.			"

												Awesome city builder, can be very hard. For example, all my people are starving and freezing to death, with everyone on farm duty the only teacher my village could spare is a 5 year, and since there's no one to spare as a tailer, my 5 year old teacher is a naked 5 year old teacher. 60 and 70 year olds are getting married to kids who are 14 and 15 years of age. My chickens refuse to stay in their pens and instead stand around the vilage square. Recently my last two villagers left over from the beginning burned to death with the well 4 spaces outside their home. Another families house burned down and they decided to live a homeless life instead of moving into a house in one of the many abandoned sectors of the town. Seriously addicting and requires very carful planning. Best $20 game out there.			"

												This game is challenging to day the least, but it's also one of the best ""city"" builder games I have ever played. Even on easy it's surprisingly difficult just to service a few years when just starting out, but once you get the general basics down everything seems to flow... right up till sudden starvation, cold, or loss of all tools happens because you over look one tiny detail and 90% of your populous dies off. That however is not a complaint about the game, it's just something you have to overcome and when you do build back up the feeling of accomplishment is really quite wonderful. My only real complaint about the game is the bad luck I get with disasters. Supposedly tornadoes are rare in the world, but the first 3 worlds a created each had tornadoes within the first 2 years, the first of which killed all but 4 people. But again, that was more bad luck and another chance to just start over from stratch than a real issue with the game.			"

												I have never had any inclination to ever review a game before - but this game is just simply blissful elegance to play.  I would strongly recommend purchasing this game if you are inclined towards RTS/City Building games.  The experience of this game is more enjoyable then any game to come out recently with huge development teams - but to learn that this was created by one man (Luke) is incredible.  However there are some flaws (which I am sure will be addressed soon).  The flaws I have found:Game has a tendency to suffer fatal errors in a variety of scenarios (upon save, upon different common in game actions).  I have yet to get a population above 400 - not because of my city building ability but because I have had 3 or 4 games where the game crashes and I cannot alter my play state to avoid the error.  I am not overly disappointed in this because after browsing the forum - it looks like the developer is taking a very proactive role in correcting the issues. (My Rig - Windows 7 64 bit SLI SDD).The game lacks what, to me, would be a real end goal and after a while it fills like your building small towns that work together within the map then one homogenous city.  Beyond the basic buildings I have found nothing to unlock besides Steam achievements which don't do too much to get me excited.  However - I feel like this will probably be addressed by Luke or by the modding community when the tools are eventually released.  However - on the flip side - the simplicity also adds to the beauty of the game in a way.  I could see this game getting monotonous - especially to someone who requires in your face action or war type scenarios.  I think with about 50 hours (assuming the bugs are fixed) I will have seen everything this game has to offer at this point.One thing I have really enjoyed about the game is its difficulty.  The first 4 or 5 times I played I failed miserably quickly in to the game.  The frustrations of watching all your citizens die one by one is painful and frustrating.  This is not a bad thing though - it is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game - learning from your mistakes and using foresight the next time to prevent the issues from happening again.  It's also great to know that if you are not on top of your game at any given time - 5 min later you could see your town falter and everything you worked for fall like dominoes.So summation - at full price in its current state - it would be a hard sell for me.  For $20.00 - you should buy it as long as you are aware of the flaws and have some patients during the meantime for the bugs to be worked out.  If you do wish to wait - make sure to come back eventually because this game is amazing. "

												It's a rare treat to find a city building game that isn't focused on fighting, soldiers, wars or monsters, and espceially not one that manages to engage you so well. In Banishedl, your enemy is Nature itself, along with the cruel reality of trying to survive in this harsh, unforgiving world. The learning curve will absolutely take time and likely see your people and towns die off as you fgure the game out, but at the same time it's brilliant at displaying information in a manner that is concise, relevant, and easy to consume.  There aren't a thousand menus and as many things to build, which to some may appear too simplistic and dumbed-downed; however, I believe these are positives that make the game easy to approach, but very difficult to master.There are several ways to build your town in order to fulfill your people's needs, and the game allows your to assign specialized jobs to help keep your people focused on the tasks you ned done most. Overall, this is a wonderful game that will punish you for being greedy, for trying to expand too far and too quickly, and sometimes despite all your hard work and cautious preparations, Nature comes and burns down your homes or blows away all that remains like the Big Bad Wolf. I can see myself enjoying a great deal more time with this game, and hope to bring my people a flourishing society!			"

												I love this game. It has the best parts from my favourite games such as Stronghold, SimCity, Towns, Skyrim (the scenery), and even real life living in New Zealand (never enough fish in the river). I highly recommend this game as a step in the right direction away from combat simulators and base defenses. The visuals really come to life throughout the seasons. Build the houses tight like apartment blocks and feel the bustle of a dense township. Keep a bit of space between houses and enjoy that 'Riverwood' feel of trees dotting the roadsides. Build 3 houses at once to get population boost, then in 3 seasons run out of food to feed all the little mouths that won't be old enough to work the fields (or mines) until they're 11 years old.Control your growth by keeping things small and simple, or let expansion take you over as you struggle to feed and clothe an ever sprawling metropolis. Always start again and enjoy the way your first citezins walk around chopping down those first trees and building their first homes.Also a big shout out to Sips for a sterling playthrough of this game.

												Nice game, in the spirit of the classic titles Caesar 3, Pharaoh, Sim City 4, and Stronghold (without the fighting). The first few hours of gameplay are a bit slow if intermittently intense; once you hit a certain population, however, the game becomes frantic; and it finally settles down once you claim all available land.+ Solid, balanced gameplay.+ Cute graphics.+ One of the few quality titles catering to lovers of city-builder games.- The game lacks awesome monuments like the pyramids in Pharaoh. I want to top off my town with a sweet-looking cathedral.- No combat (though this can also be a plus).- Building options somewhat limited. I want to beautify my town with gardens, have libraries, build a university, stuff like that. At best, you can build a fine village (or small town) in this game. But not a city. Maybe in the sequel.8/10 - highly recommended to city-builder players.			"

												Although promoted as a city builder, it is far more a town builder, and focuses heavily on survival. Prepare to watch your town starve, and then when you’ve figured out that problem, prepare to watch your town freeze during the harsh bite of cold during the winter.Banished is hard when you don’t know what you’re doing, and even once you’ve gotten the hang of it, will still be unforgiving if you make a mistake. Although the learning curve is tough, the game is well made and fun, though the last city builder published by a big developer was the new Sim City so the current bar on city builders is currently not terribly high.Jokes aside, being from a single developer, Banished is outstanding. The difficulty can be high, the score is not too compelling (Although soothing and relaxing), and there is the occasional oddity, but otherwise the game is well polished and very engaging.If you are a fan of city building and survival games then you will fall in love with Banished. Just make sure you save up enough food for winter! My current town is surviving solely on hot peppers and cabbage. I fully expect riots in the near future if we survive this winter.			"

Tornado swoops in straight through my town 70+ population killed and 50% building destroyed.4. Back to struggling again. :D10/10			"

												it's a great game for relaxation, a kind of ""age of empires"" without constantly being attacked by enemies.in this game you build your own town, you can design it anyway you like. you can build roads, blacksmiths, you name it.the only problem i've been having is that sometimes even when your storage isn't full, your villagers stop collecting food and eventually starve. i'm not sure if this is a bug or something, but i hope i can find a fix for it.

												Brave, Bold and... Banished..?  Banished is an excellent, realistically entertaining and fun city builder.  If you ever dreamt of being a pioneer back in days of old, and want to witness the birth growth and fate of a small village, then this is the game for you.Incredibly, Banished has been developed by a one-man dev team, it is crisp, clean and very engaging.  Building, planning, farming, trading, resource gathering, expansion, seasons to prepare for, and more.  If you like city builders, then this is one game you must have.  I do hope that there are more expansion updates in the future, and if there are, these will only add to the fantastic offering already on the plate.Buy, play and enjoy! "

												I've been boycotting EA Games for well over a year now. I'll admit, it's been hard at times, but I've also noticed a dramatic decline in fits of rage in my life as well as an increase in my wallet since I no longer have to spend thousands on DLC and/or micro-transactions,,,,, and then this game comes out and oh boy........ Sim-What now?....... Out of all the games that I've ever spent $20 dollars on, this one is by far the best. This is a Dev that needs and deserves the support. And to the Developer; if you happen to see this, please don't you ever sell out and sign with EA for publishing on any of your current or future gaming projects! You sir, are an inspiration that should never be tainted! Thanks so much for this wonderfully crafted game!			"

												10/10 comfy town building game. However 6/10 for current replayability - once you've made yourself a big town, it's a bit boring (imo) and repetitive to start over and do the same thing again and again. This will hopefully improve once there are mods in the future. Wait for a sale, or wait for the mods before you buy this game.			"

												At times, very relaxing. At times, very frustrating. Banished isn't about  just peacefully building away, it is a constant struggle against the elements. The content the game offers may not be much, but due to the challenge, it'll take you a while until you get to try it all regardless. The graphics aren't fancy, but are very atmospheric and wel-optimized. The UI is completely customizable, although not especially pretty, and gameplay is smooth and well-tested. Mostly recommended to people who are already fans of the genre and like a challenge.			"

												First game I've bought on launch day in a long time and it's most definitely worth it. If you're looking for a strategic and survival-based town builder with a rich atmosphere, look no further. There's no technological advancement, political or military struggles to be had in Banished, sure, but as soon as you start playing you'll realize there's no need for that. This simulation is so finely crafted and complex that you'll have your hands full with simply trying to keep your people well fed and warm.Banished is an excellent mix of simulation, survival and strategy. Do yourself a favor and play this game.			"

												I have only played 7 hours of this game, and it is truly amazing. One of my favorite city building games out there. Gold/money is not an option here. Every uses recourses or trade system to obtain things. It took me about 4 or 5 towns to make to get the true groove, as I either expanded too early or didn't get certain things built on time and everyone either starved to death or froze to death. You have to find that perfect spot to start expanding houses to get new families. Expaned too fast and your food will deplete way to fast. I definatly recommend this game if you love city building games. The fact that it was made by one man is jsut amazing as well. He did an amazing job on this game. Can't wait to put more hours into it. 10/10			"

												As addictive and rewarding as the Civilization series.On the flipside , it can also be really frustruating.  There is no difficulty degree in this game, it's all or nothing, couple that with the fact the game itself doesn't have any precise 'instructions' ( when people get unhappy, you can't be exactly sure why, you need to investigate by observving the peoples behavior.  Are they sick ?  Are they tired of eating only cabbage ?  Do they want Ale or Jesus ?  It's a best guess ) and becomes a very challenging game.But it is incredibly rewarding.  You really start to get invested in your little villagers.  You want them to  be happy and to do well.  Or sometimes you want them to die already so a younger couple can move into there house and start to reproduce.  Or you just don't like them because there unhappy all the time, and WTF Jill die already so I can bring my happiness back up.A rare and beautiful game, I search for games like these and get lucky if I can find one of them every 2 years or so.

												This is a fantastic game, I love it too bits. It's always challenging you to manage your resources and makes you come into hte game with a game plan. you can't simply waltz into this game without having to think about how you'll produce food in the winter, if you're firewood supplies will last until hte following year or even if you have decent tradable goods to recieve things like crop seeds and live stock!Absolutely brilliant game, I love how everything effects citizens! If you dont have a graveyard you're citizens get sad as they struggle to remember their loved ones. Erecting a Town hall to show Cenus details adn tells you what you can do to possibly improve diets and life span!I did at the start think this game as a little like Anno but it's far from it, no boundries, no need to erect spefici building to build in a new area. All you do is slam a few food production/resource production buildings down and up the speed to x10 and watch the little guys go to work.I love how labourers can take up work from those who get killed or die of natural causes, so it automatically assigns people incase you miss the notification!I would however, really like this game to blast off and produce challenging maps instead of the Valleys and Mountains, maybe you could have grasslands with little wood and rely of foresters to plant trees and trade! Black forests with little streams and the one lake or Fyord out of reach of your current postion, until you cna gain enough goods to actually venture to it.Overall I love this game, I would recommend any Simcity or City building player to buy and play this game. You won't be disappointed!			"

												I recommend the game if you like builder sims.   If you played Dawn Of Discovery and prefer to have no combat, this might be for you.  It has a calming charm to it.  For me, is a relaxing game where I take my  time, steadily building my expansion plans.Learning how to keep a civilization growing steady and healthy is not difficult once you learn how to use your town hall.  If you require a deep and difficult game to master (like Sid's Civilization), then this game might not be for you.I praise the game's style, pace of play, encouragment for you to experiment, and generally understandable AI (not to say they are always doing the smartest things, but you start to learn how it behaves and can adapt how you play to it).I think the game could have done better in providing more difficult options, and longer term goals.  In 100 hours of play, I have never seen a disaster that was more than a minor irritation - it never put my citizens in risk of losing most of its population.   I would have also liked to seen some expensive, hard to achieve super structures, like a large cathedral, mega storage warehouses, and universities.   I think the choice to keep it simple has some charm, but some tech tree or building upgrades would be nice (e.g. hunter shack to hunter hut to hunter cabin to hunter lodge - each with larger range, number of assignable workers, and productivity.   Why can't people live in a hunter cabin, anyway ;)			"

												Very early in my playing of this, I decided my people could use a tavern for some nice home brews. However, what I didn't realize is that my resource production team was a bit crap and couldn't handle the big building. So, with the tavern requiring so many resources such as WOOD for FIREWOOD, I discovered the woodcutter wasn't getting any input for fuel making. Yeah, when winter rolled around, I began to panic. Because INSTANTLY 29 people SIMULTANEOUSLY froze to death.Reload the save, don't place the tavern, and everyone lives happily and not a soul is lost.The only game where placing a tavern can lead to mass death from freezing to death.

												I recommend this game, although just barely. When I purchased this a couple of years ago, the description made it sound as if new features would be added periodically, but nothing new has been released since I've seen it. The developer's blog indicates that he is focusing on developing mod support and compatibility with other platforms as opposed to fleshing out the game's content more. This still seems like a half-baked game in terms of content, and there still seem to be various bugs and glitches. I like the overall program in spite of that, but I think one can spend their money on another better developed city-building game for the time being.			"

												Old School city sim meets 2014.  Banished is a city simulator set around the medieval period that involves many different aspects from citizen death to baby booms due to mismanaged housing.  Banished is a game that ignored combat (for once) and focuses entirely on economy and managing the social aspect of your game.  In addition, Banished also contains other concepts such as trade with a merchant as well as micromanagement of labor down to the citizen.  Just by looking at the screenshots you can tell that the game itself looks quite well for a game in 2014 developed by an indie company.  Other than some citizens walking through solid objects such as stone fences around a cemetary, nothing is really bad here.  Snow, rain, the seasons in general all look great.  Zooming in and out is breeze but the citizens themselves do look a bit bland but who cares?  Graphics do not make a game, gameplay does.The music in this game is second to none when it comes to something enjoyable.  I liked the soft atmosphere and ability to get away from some of the other games out there that keep your heart pumping and your face twitching.  The music is very well done and the sound effects work very well for this game.  The only complaint I have here, is that there needs to be more music since some of the tracks get repetitive.Finally, the gameplay itself.  Think Caesar IV/III without military and money.  You do trade with merchants but it is based off of the goods worth.  You can't stockpile gold to buy resources and you can overpay for items should you feel the need to get rid of some of your stocks without destroying them in the process.  Controls are very easy to learn and the tutorial does an excellent job at explaining the basics but that is about as far as that goes.  My main complaint is that there are many other factors that I had to research or dig deep into the manual to find.  While this isn't a problem, getting past 30 citizens will require some knowledge on yourt part about this game.  For instance, I never knew that houses need two people to procriate.  If the house is filled, no babies are born.  So keep that in mind when you play this game or if you play this game!  There are other small nuances about the game that you learn over time such as your cattle/chickens/sheep.  You need to buy these from a merchant before you can actually use them (unless you are on easy).  It is these things that make the game better in my opinion though and makes this adventure worth playing.  The random map seeds for the game are also outstanding.  Sometimes you get ♥♥♥♥ed and other times you are sitting in the middle of a vast field in the valley that rocks.  Again, keep in mind, clearing forests only as necessary, it seems as though herbs grow mainly in the old forests, not regrown ones!  So, advanced mechanics to a point that it isn't rediculous combined with pleasing music and great graphical effects make this game great for twenty dollars.  Other games similar cost substantially more when they were new and don't offer the same replayability this game does.  While multiplayer is not required, it is something I would like to see in the future.  Maybe leaderboards only or a way to connect you and a players towns together for trade in much the same way you trade with the ship that comes by every so often.  Then again, keep it single player!  Nothing wrong with the game in it's current state.  I highly recommend trying this game out, twenty isn't to much to ask for hours of fun.  Especially since my general rule is one hour per dollar spent on a game means I got my moneys worth.  So go ahead, give it a shot!			"

												A nice little Simulation, that (more or less) realisticly lets you build your own town. Its not so much about getting gigantic citys but more a struggle for survival. You need to feed your people, give them cloths and tools and shelter. All in all its is extremly relaxing and a unique strategy game, that provided me hours of fun.

												A great RTS and survival game that offers addictive fun as well as rather complex and unforgiving challenges to face that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The best micromanaging simulator I've ever played so far!Imagine starting with a population of 12 and then losing 8 of them because you couldn't gather enough food in time before they starved. Now it is down to 3 guys and 1 woman to repopulate the whole town. And when you got back on your feet with everything you need (ex. population of 18, farmlands, schoolhouse, etc), oh no a big tornado decides to steam roll through your town destroying your schoolhouse, killing all the small children and most of your workers in the process :( Now down to a Pop of 3 and all over the age of 55, you make more kids somehow and send all your kids at the age of 10 to go work in the mines or become the town doctor (way cooler than being a pokemon trainer, amiright?) Only Con: I'll never understand why 85 year olds will continue being a lumberjack, 10 year olds becoming blacksmiths, or how in the ""20 years"" my town exists in-game that you will have citizens that will be born there and will die at the age of 90. In all honesty, this doesn't ruin the game at all for me but I do find it hilarious watching an extremely healthy and happy person die of old age at 65 while the very unhealthy and most depressed person ever will live to 89 (cause of death: A rock in the quarry fell on him). 10/10 would run town into ground again			"

												What an interesting little game!For the last year or so I've been constantly whining at my partner, and my friends, that there's simply no good settlement building game on general release. I know Tropico 5 will be awesome (I'm a long time fan of the Tropico series, but I'm on a tight budget). We all may choose to argue the merits of Cities XL, Sim City, and the various Empire building games in the Roman-esque genre (started by Sierra back in the 1990s with their title Caesar), but this game offers something a little different.I read many reviews before buying 'Banished', some of which complain about various little mechanics, others praise the 'mature' nature of the game. Granted, this title won't suit everyone; for there are no enemies advancing on your settlement ready to remove you from power, nor are there any options to build up a military and slaughter some AI controlled foe (as you would in the Stronghold series). Instead, what Banished delivers is a settlement building game in which you battle the elements and the tight restrictions imposed by gathering the resources needed to build and thrive in your randomly generated landscape - before the cold winter sets in, or you run out of food. This may sound a little dull on paper, but it really is very difficult to master.Attempt number 1 resulted in my population dying from starvation. So I restarted and placed emphasis on food stocks.Attempt number 2 resulted in my nourished population freezing to death during a harsh winter.Attempt number 3 resulted in an outbreak of the mumps, which without proper medical facilities became deadly.Attempt number 4... Well, I'll let you know. The previous three attempts took me six hours (hours that simply flew by!)I guess the TL:DR of this review is; if you want a settlement builder that's really quite intelligent, beautifully charming to play, and that doesn't cost a fortune, buy Banished.

												LOVE THIS GAME!!! Love the setting and the intensity that comes with it. Will my people thrive or dive into a non stop whirlpool of death? Hunger they cry, hunger! Just a couple of suggestions to the creators though. Maybe add a fort or outpost theme? Guns and defenses? A town sherrif and crime? Maybe adding copper or tin resorces for the creation of pots and pans as well as guns and knifes? Add indians or hordes of barbarians? I see alot of potential with this that can be taken in so many directions while keeping that edge of your seat game play. Can't wait to see what the future holds for this title. Take my money now, you have my wallet and attention... I have neglected to shower or shave in fear I might miss an opportunity to expand or unknowly kill everyone off... LOL			"

												Winter was very long and cold,we almost used all of out food supplies,we started sowing a bit late,and then a disaster stikes,epidemy of Typhus.Luckily for you,your glorious leader had built you a hospital so you will survive,but we will have less manpower for the crops until you recover.And then another disaster,a swarm of bugs,entire crops were lost.We menaged to save 1/3 of the crops before the bugs got the rest of it.We stored it all in barns and hoped it was enough to survive the winter.But on that horrible day the deadly tornado has formed just outside of our town.We gathered in church to pray to our Lord for salvation but in vain.Tornado had passed through our little town and devastated half of the homes.Woodcuters,blacksmiths...all gone....But thats not the worst...the barn...and almost all our food...gone...Then the winter came,cold and harsh.2/3 of population have died from starvation and cold.People would just walk in the streets,sit,and die.Oh the horrors...

85/100This is a really well done settlement/colony sim! The gameplay/visuals/sounds is very relaxing yet it is a challenging game that makes you think ahead and plan out your strategy. Specially when you think the game becomes to easy the game mechanics kicks in and releases a virus on the people and if not prepared half your village dies with in a year time.  I love the city/civ/colony sim genre and this is definitely a (new) favorite!This is a typical game that you plan to play for 1 hour and next time you look on the clock it's 4 hours later.  As for the amount of features and depth of the game it could have been a bit bigger. There is no upgrading of buildings, nor a research tree or other advancing options, but the features that are there are well implemented. This is not a tripple A big budget game and only created by a few people which makes it even more outstanding as it is. Love to see a sequel of this game that has more features. Oh and before I forget. The UI is just great! I wish more similar games did the UI like this!Edited: grammar			"

												Banished is of course one of the best Settlement Building Simulator there is, though it's set in Medieval times. The goal is to sustainably grow your population, whilst managing trade, comfort and health.This game is relaxing. This game can also be challenging. The only thing letting this game down is the apparent barrier you reach after your settlement has grown to a sustainable size. It becomes very hard to maintain food levels and whilst keeping citizens healthy and without experiencing a Baby Boom or a wipeout of your town.Definately worth getting though!			"

This is no easy game, and some People may say that it is too difficult and not worth £15 (UK Player Sorry!), but it is it is worth a lot more. No Tech Trees to hold you back just fun and enjoyment and your creativity, want to build a small farming hamlet and watch the families past on stories and secrets, great do it. Want to building a Glorious City filled with Stone Houses Chruch Spires and Bellowing Smoke, No Problem.This Game is Worth the Price which is small for such a filled game with a great Future!			"

												In Banished you take the reigns as a benevolent dictator guiding a small group of outcasts to an unknown land. You hold their very lives in your hands as they unwittingly follow your every command to build a new town in the image of a perfect socialist paradise where everyone works where they are needed until they lie in heir grave.Traders are a necessary evil at the beginning of your town's life, however once you have exploited them for their access to livestock and seed you will be able to create a self-sufficiency that will cause your people to thrive, taking what they need when they need it and being untainted by capitalism.However you must prepare yourself for tragedy of natural disasters and disease that may decimate your loyal populace. Nomads, hearing of your success will petition to join your community, should be carefully vetted lest they bring in scarlet fever, mumps, or some other abominable plague.In the end you must not be asking whether this game is good enough for you, you should be asking whether you have what it takes to lead your people to the perfect communist utopia.

												Loved it ...Especially when i first started the game. Dont think tht it is a Zen game and goes by your smile. NO!! While you were chasing butterflies in your Cherry Tree orchards a gigantic tornado passes through your beloved land all your effort. Dont worry, you can recover too but actually tht part of the game is its challenge. Unlike the other city making games (Caesar, Zeus, Simcity etc.) this game has diffrent balance. Some mistakes are not being forgotten in this game ( like if you are out of tools it is a simple gg/KO). However game still needs some fixations in my opinion and still so fresh to talk bad about its mistakes. Banished is a good piece and can really be improved. Waiting for the mod maker at the moment and after tht i can decide all around what is good or bad about Banished. If you like some realistic features and prettyness at the same time in a citybuilding game. Get this game asap !			"

												I have to respect that this game was a labor of love, built from the ground up. The AI is a little wonky, but takes on a metagame in and of itself as you plan the best roads and town layouts to ensure your minions are toiling away effeciently. If the base game seems too dull for you, there are fantastic mods that add far more settings and play options. The various start conditions in certain mods even allow for some decent role play experience.All in all, VERY worth the price of the game.			"

												On the surface this may seem like another city sim except in the middle ages however you'll very quickly find out this is more like the Dark Souls of city builders.

Tornadoes, fires, starvation, plagues, frostbite and every other sickness and hardship you can imagine will be fighting you every step of the way but it just makes seeing your little town slowly growing into a city even more enjoyable.

												Outstanding! Elegant design; simple, but in a good way. Addictive gameplay. Very well designed game. It's everything SimCity wishes it could be. I liked the fact that there is no money in the game; it's not about getting rich and piling up cash, it's about making a town that works. Very fulfilling.Some other reviewers complained that there wasn't a whole lot of content and that they got bored fast. I have no idea what they were talking about. I liked that all content is unlocked at the start. That doesn't mean you wanna build the biggest most expensive building right at the start, in fact it's not to your benefit to do that, but what that does is make the gameplay very open and non-linear. I can set my own goals and priorities. I've played 32 hrs + and still going strong, I can tell I'll do double that no problem. For the price, I think that's a great deal.			"

It's challenging, it's humorous, and it will make you cry. I took a bit of a break from the game. but I re-purcased the game on Steam having previously bought it on GoG.com, and I'm working my way through the achievements again.

The game is interesting in some ways as it is similar to Sim City as you get to build your own city. This game's major fault however is that it is incredibly hard to predict what will happen with your people from time to time, and they will often starve or freeze themselves without reason.

												Decent as a budget title if you buy it on sale; Banished provides a fair challenge at the early stages of the game when you're struggling to survive against starvation and harsh weather.Unfortunately, there is no endgame here. Once your town gets a foothold (usually about 4 hours in), there is very little that can stop it. Once you've become self-sufficient, you occasionally have to manage citizens - replacing your blacksmith when he dies of old age, for instance. Disasters are non-interactive; you usually just want for it to run its course and then rebuild whatever it damaged.That said, this is an indie title by one lone developer, and it is impressive that one person could create a moderately entertaining city builder on his own.

												Banished is a fantasticly soothing experience - as long as you don't make a mistake. Although not as hard as the likes of Dwarf Fortress (I see many comparing the two) it punishes you hard for your failures. A simple shortage in tools can send you spiralling out of controll until the whole village dies of starvation. But that's exactly what makes this game so great.Graphics-wise it is no Anno but looks nice enough to not be annyoing. The music is a little artificial but not distracting. The gameplay is superb and will get you hooked for at least 40 hours. The lategame is lacking a bit in content but the developer says he will be opening the game up to mods soon so there is at least some content to be expected.All in all Banished is in no way perfect but by far the best builder game you will have played in years. I wholeheartedly recommend buying it.			"

												At the time of writing, I've played 8 hours, and so far, it's pretty damn good.I picked up the game in a flash sale, being very wary of whether it'd actually be good or not, and I can safely say, money well spent.  I'd even go to say it'd be well spent at full price.  The game's graphics are done excellently, with their only slight fault being when zoomed in fully (at which point they're still better than most 'city' builders).  So far I've only played the game on it's easiest difficulty, and so I can't say how well the game plays on harder settings, however I hope to move up soon, as I've pretty much mastered the game at the moment.How does the game function as a 'city' builder?  It doesn't, but it is a good village or small-ish town sim.  The main challenge is to stay alive, being able to produce food and firewood before it's too late.  My main problem with my first 3 attempts (which lasted 30 mins maximum) was that I was running before I could walk.  I tried to get more houses so that I could produce more, but this in turn meant I needed to produce even more, but it's easy to find your mistakes.After you finally have a 'town' that won't trip over after it's just left the front door, you're free to expand at your own will.  You could stay as a town with only 30 inhabitants building up a stockpile, however eventually the town will become too productive.  And I don't mean with resources.  From time to time you'll accidentally♥♥♥♥♥♥something up and about 10-20 people will die, rapidly and without warning, but if you play your cards right, you'll recover pretty quickly.Only problem?  Once you have sovled your seemingly unsolvable but then easily solvable crisis, you can build exciting buildings such as the town hall (which seeminly just produces graphs, because why not), or a brewery.  There's little to expand to after you've mastered your town, except pencil pushing, booze and possibly religion (in my case as overlord govenor, there is no such thing as religion, unless there's and option to add satanism simply for a laugh, which I haven't found so far). TL;DR:  Solid game, 8/10, play it at maximum speed for a challenge and only pause if you've really cocked it up.  Buy it, it's made by one guy.  "

												I bought this game after watching someone do a lets play of this and it looked really good. After purchasing this game i can confirm it really is good! Lovely little simulation game with nice, simple graphics with a lot of attention to detail on the work and actions the villagers carry out. there is a nice level of challenge to the game both for those casual gamers, like myself and for more vetran level simulation games :P My favourite game of the year, but a word of warning it eats away at your time, don't play it during your dissertation like I did!

												I simply love this game. I bought it yesterday and I have been playing almost constantly since then. It is by far the best simulation that I have seen that models a remote settlement and the challenges that people had to face not so long ago.It could be improved further, but this game is very well made and fun to play. I have already spent almost 20 hours in two days time, which says a lot, I think.I only hope/wish that it will be expanded and improved even more during the years to come, for it has such potential.

												This game is absolutely amazing. If you didn't already know that this game was made by one person, you would never guess it by playing the game. The art is well-done and so are the trade system and citizen management. I wish there was a way to re-name individual citizens and get even more involved with the people you govern, but perhaps that will come in a future update. :) A great game and definately worth the price tag.

												If you like city builders and even strategy games in general, this game is probably something you'll enjoy. Games like Banished aren't for everyone, and can seem quite slow at times,  but for what it is, this game is pretty amazing.It's got a somewhat challenging, but very graspable learning curve, and the gameplay is very engaging as there's always something to do. Towards the late game, the game can be quite tedious at times, but it's still quite fulfilling and enjoyable to build out a sprawling city. I would recommend getting the game on sale though, as 20$ is a bit much for how much content is actually in the game, though there are great mods for this game that can extend the replayibility by a lot. Anyways, I would rate this game a solid 8.5/10, and I think it's worth a buy.			"

												One of the best city builders that as come out in the last few years. For once you have to think before you do anything.This game should serve as an example, almost like a benchmark. It was developed entirely by ONE guy and yet, it's one of the best city builder sims to come out in a very long time (it's still in beta!). There's also a survival aspect and it features disasters. There's no silly endgame scenarios (""Build x houses""). Maps are randomly generated using seeds. Gameplay is refreshing and addicting.10/10.			"

												I love this game and am amazed that one person made it. It's more polished than many big-company games I've had the misfortune to buy. If you've played city builders before, the gameplay will be familiar, but it also has its own flavor -- for instance, the hilarious/goofy villager names. It is relaxing to play (and has soothing music), but it's also challenging. I'm glad there is no fighting and you can just concentrate on building your city. This is the first game I've reviewed on Steam, and it is WELL WORTH BUYING!			"

												I wanted a SimCity like game but a challenge.  While this may not be enjoyed by causal player, I found this is great fun for the more serious city/survival/strategy player.  Instead of being buried beneath of endless need to build bigger and better, you are made to think ""how to do this"" as you are working with basic set of building structures to make the most use out of the land you have around you.  I think this is great fun and already played over 40+ hours with my first game and you can easily play into 100+ hours in this game.  Thanks for the recent game updates!			"

												No monsters. No quests. No swords. I found this game refreshing, as it manages to be fun without forcing you to fight anything. The difficulty stems entirely from within. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something completely different, something that not a lot of games provide. If you like one genre of game, or think that anything without action-intense combat is boring, I would not recommend this game for you.For anyone on the fence, here are some pros and cons. Everyone likes pros and cons.Pros:○ The UI is phenomenal. Some things might be a little too big or too small, but everything is pretty easy to find, and you can tell what everything is supposed to do.○ Difficulty is just customizable enough. Likewise, the difficulty curve is naturally progressing and works well.○ The game alt-tabs just fine. A minor point, but there are a surprising number of games which you just can't alt-tab out of. Banished auto-pauses you if you alt-tab.○ The graphics are, in my opinion, quite nice. The theme of the game comes through very strongly through the graphical style used.Cons:○ The game is relatively slow-paced, and it can take a long time to get anywhere.○ Not a lot of content at this time, so it's a long game with few options. Can get boring if you manage to stabilize a village.○ Villagers are sometimes really stupid. Not dwarf stupid, but pretty stupid.Other Points:○ No game over screen when things spiral completely out of control and you're left with no citizens and no way to get more citizens. Just a small quirk. Not good or bad, really. I kinda like it: you get to watch as your village is slowly consumed by nature once more.			"

												Brave, Bold and... Banished..?  Banished is an excellent, realistically entertaining and fun city builder.  If you ever dreamt of being a pioneer back in days of old, and want to witness the birth growth and fate of a small village, then this is the game for you.Incredibly, Banished has been developed by a one-man dev team, it is crisp, clean and very engaging.  Building, planning, farming, trading, resource gathering, expansion, seasons to prepare for, and more.  If you like city builders, then this is one game you must have.  I do hope that there are more expansion updates in the future, and if there are, these will only add to the fantastic offering already on the plate.Buy, play and enjoy! "

												Build a delicate wee township, and then grow it into a delicate huge colony. It's like balancing everything a group of people need on the tip of a pin. Too far one way or the other and half your population dies! It takes practise and some dedication. Don't give up when everyone starts starving to death, eventually your population will balance out and you can grow again. Every civilisation has it's ups and downs after all.			"

												Great casual city builder. Simple fast to learn micromanagement, there are lots of numbers but it is definitely not overwhelming. People may complain about the food management being difficult, but after my third city I got a good grip on how to build a successful city with enough food. There is a learning curve obviously but it is by no means steep. It's a good game to either sink many hours into at once, or to return to play for 20 minutes or so when you have time. I would definitely recommend this to people interested in city builders / micromanagement games.			"

												LOVE The game BUT!!! This game is amazing so far. Especially since it is being developed by ONE PERSON! I played for 16 hours with no issues before getting a the fatal crash bug. Looks to be save related. But we have to be patient. The indie community is blowing away AAA devs. At least Indie Devs are doing their best to fix the bugs. AAA Devs flat out refuse to fix bugs most of the time. So let's calm down and let the man deal with the issues we've brought to his attention. There is no reason to yell and get angry at a person that is creating a masterpiece like Banished. I understand you might be impatient and wish you could play. I have no doubt the developer is doing everything he can to have a perfect game. Keep Calm and try to help out those that are lucky enough not to have a Fatal Crash :D Indie games need community support! Without them we'd be stuck with heartless AAA Devs laughing past our complaints while they develop the next atrocity. Help where you can. Be patient. And give this title your support! I have no doubt in my mind that it will be remembered as one of the greatest City Builders of all time :) It already has that title from me. And I have a fatal crash. IT WILL BE FIXED! Understand that even games with 1000 programmers STILL have bugs! Expecting 100% perfection from one man is ridiculous.			"

												Tons of fun. I was initially a bit hesitent to get the game after seeing some reviewers going off about how difficult/impossible the game is, but I'm so glad I bought it. It's not as difficult/impossible as some reviewers would have you believe, especially if you do a little basic strategy research beforehand. With that, my FIRST town reached a population of ~450 before finally collapsing due to mistakes on my part (a massive food distribution problem during a famine). I've started over from scratch and I expect my next town to be even bigger and better now that I understand the game mechanics better this time around. Yes, the game can be difficult and has a bit of a learning curve, but that doesn't make it as difficult/impossible as a lot of disgruntled reviewers would have you believe. (Tip: Stick to hunting/gathering/fishing early on! Only start planting crops for farming when you have a stable food supply and a surplus of food and labor! This is almost all you need to know to get off to a good start!) If you like city-builders and you have the small amount of patience required to learn how to play the game properly, you will love it and wonder what happened to your weekend. My only criticism so far is that I would like to see some more features eventually - for example, a way to slightly alter terrain. We don't need to have the ability to move mountains, but it's annoying when you can't put down a 15x15 crop field because ONE tile inside the area is too ""uneven."" Also, ridges that are too uneven to build roads over and too shallow to build tunnels through, yet that people are able to walk over, are annoying. It would also be fun to eventually see some new crops, livestock, jobs, resources, etc. The game is already a blast, but also has a LOT of potential.			"

												Banished is a great citybuilding singleplayer game that finally revives the genre.The mechanics, a very important thing for citybuilders are easy to learn and very well polished.The AI is smart and can survive without you as well. Does this mean the game gets boring once your village can sustain?No it doesn't! Even though your peopl can survive without you for quite some time, you will ALWAYS find something else to do in this amazing piece of art. Be it expanding, finding just another resource you could gather somewhere on those gigantic maps or just managing your trade depot because you want all those different kinds of seeds so bad!The game comes with a great set of Jobs, buildings and fun things to do so it will never get boring.Oh, and lets not forget those disasters! (Which you can disable) You think your whole town is good to go and some tornado basically kills half your population.Also, there will eventually be a great modkit that, together with a very loving community, will give loads of new and free content as well.So if you love managing cities, looking at loving art and watching people live their colony life, this game is a must! But I gotta warn you: It's addictive!			"

												This game is a masterpiece.  It may appear simple at first glance, but that is a deception.  The music is relaxing, and the graphics are surprisingly decent for a one-man development team.  The largest map size blows SimCity out of the water.  More importantly, each town's history can easily  become a rich and unforgettable story of struggle, triumph, and even horror.My first attempt at city-building reminded me of something out of Kentucky where, after a particularly harsh winter, all but 2 old men and a little girl had died of starvation.  I  literally cheered when the little girl hit the magical age of consent (10), married her old neighbor, and started popping out new laborers.. er kids.  And then the incest really began.  In my second attempt, I watched helplessly as a tornado ravaged my little citizens, tearing down trees and houses alike.  Within a year, the surviors had successfully rebuilt most of their little paradise only for a  second tornado to wipe out all but a brother and sister.  Not even incest could save them.Someday, I will have a glorious tale to tell of a village that evolved into a sprawling landscape of commerce and booze... a land where brother and sister need not contemplate the survival of their people through sinister acts... For a mere $20, you can too.			"

												My first 3 civs starved to death. My fourth had enough food to support themselves, and even survived a tornado and a city fire. when I reached 40 citiziens I  realized there was a ""old age wave"" and not enough youths to survive because I hadn't built enough houses for the new families. I went down to 8 adults and I started rising once again, I managed to build a bunch of houses before this happened and my families started to grow and expand again. When I had reclaimed half of my old population: nomads came and settled in my city. We'll see how this will go...I'd recommend this to everyone who likes city builders but also enjoys the survival oriented aspect.Buy!			"

												This is a fun village builder but it does lack some big features. I just noticed that I've spent 23 hours playing this game since getting it earlier in the week. For now, it manages to overcome it's weaknesses but I'd love to see some improvements. What I like: Runs great on dated hardware. All the time I've put in this game was done on a 6 y/o laptop.Difficulty modes only impact what you start with in the game. So whichever you chose, you're still playing the same game. Plenty of buildings all available right away. Some buildings are useless until you get other supplies. Several ways to gather resources. You can gather what's around you or build something to produce what you need. Controls. Moving around the map and laying stuff down is easy. Overall fun gameplay. It wouldn't be any good if the gameplay wasn't solid. What I dislike: No tech upgrades. I don't call this a city builder because it doesn't feel like a city... just a big village. The only upgrades I've noticed are stone roads, stone houses, steel tools, and warmer jackets. Limited resources. Iron and stone are the most limited. There's only so many quarries / mines a map can handle. Limited water buildings. You can't build a port for your own fisherman to go on lakes so all fishing is from the docks. This makes larger bodies of water nothing more than an inconvenience.Repetitive gameplay. Once you get in the flow, it's easy to just do the same thing over and over to expand and be successful. I enjoy the game and I'd say it's worth a try. The limitations of a 1 man dev team do show; however, considering that it's a 1 man dev team, it's very impressive how good the game is.			"

												I have bought this game on release because im interested in this genre.This is not a casual game and requires great patience and skill.Lets got through pros and contras.+ Offers random map generation (seed, size, type, difficutly etc.)+ Challenging (hard to master, i failed about 15 attempts before my city could get stable and healthy/happy)+ Deep simulation system (unlike other city builders, peoples age/gender plays a great role, family is a core unit,    people dont spawn randomly, they can only be born as kids and then age into students/workers, later on you can invite    nomads into your village)+ Original gameplay (different from anno/simcity, requires micro'ing, resource system)- Contains lots of bugs (savegame crash, some buildings texture bugs, trading doc bug etc.)- Doesnt support DX11 properly (switching to DX9 will avoid lots of crashes)I think this game will provide simulation fans with many-many hours of fun. Although the crashes are annoying and ruine this fun. I recommend to pay attention to forums before u give out 18 Euro.Once most of the major bugs (savegame/trading ship) are fixed, this game will turn into a candy!			"

This is a ""City builder"" in its purest sense. To me, it's very simple, but it has a tendancy to bite you on the♥♥♥♥♥just when you think that your village is sustainable. Superbly addictive and from what I have read, the dev is soon to release modding tools....which could add huge amounts of depth, which, seems to be slightly needed for long term replayability.Well worth a purchase.

Some times you have to constantly think about what you are doing, while other times you can just sit back and watch the people run around. But it is when the disasters come that you curse the game, feel guilty about the deaths of the people and you go and rebuild. No battles, No enemies. Just good old Villiage Building with a few natural diasters and zen like game play. Love it! and Thank you for making this game.			"

												City-building in micro form: build a small town out of nothing. Workers are born, grow up and die within your settlement, making this one of the few games where managing population strata is important. The balancing of resources is superb - there are only a few raw ingredients, the gathering of which requires significant manpower. It also involves some rather nuanced feedback loops. But despite the amount of balancing to be done, there are few games as relaxing to play. Wonderful game in the vein of Settlers (sans combat) - highly recommend it.			"

												Patience. Once you establish the basics, the game will teach you patience. Ambition will punish, and time will not allow you to stand still.Banished establishes a high difficulty curve from the start. As a fairly technical city-building game, this might be welcome. For those looking for a simplistic game, this shouldn't be for you. Nonetheless, a light difficulty and disaster toggle might allow the more casual experience to have some fun. Development expects to implement modding later, but at the moment, the game is still working out some late-development bugs and compatibility issues. Read the latest news to know if you're able to run it on your machine.The game's technical approach is considerably difficult to learn, but the advanced techniques it allows means you and try to establish your own goals, or you can quickly adapt after a sudden disaster.Disappointed with the mess that was ""that other city-building game that had umpteen bajillion problems""? This is less than half the cost, twice the fun, and a fraction of the unplayability issues, if any.			"

												I won't go into describing how this game works as other fellow Steam players have already gone into great depths of explaining.   I will only say that this game is incredibly addicted for anyone with a taste for city-building. The real challenge for me was to survive the first years (I will shamefully admit that after my first failed attempts I turned disasters ""off"" till I learned how to play, which translates into properly planning the city and providing enough food for the people). Now, after a year, the only problem I have found is the slight but noticeable lag when a city's population reaches 1,000 inhabitants - and it takes a lot of work to get there.  "

												I have racked up over 70 hours of game play and I have to say that this game is positively wonderful. It is a wonderful de-stress (unless your villages is in the grips of calmity)...First thing right off the bat this is a city builder game that is similar to the old Windows Sid Myer's Sim City game but, in a medieval setting. There is no goal, no competition between rival towns or other players. Just you, your villagers, and a wide expanse of wilderness just waiting to be tame. And with the difficulty of the game able to adjusted to your style and desire of play and random seed map genrator not two plays are ever the same. It is a great way to relax and relish in the joys of creating, it is completely open -ended and was one of the first games I purchased on Steam a couple years back. It was in early access when I purchased it and it was one of the best risks I took. My friend who I had shown it to was hesitant to recommend buying it because it was early access but, forgive him he has been badly burned by a number of Early Access games before. However shortly after I purchased it and we sat down to play it I fell in love with this game, and he did too (litterally buying within the hour after we stoped playing). This game is one of only five that have made it into my Favorites listing which say alot as I don't add games to find them easier it is a honest to goodness favorite game of mine. The game has only gotten better and the developer has always been diligent in bug fixing and maintenance.I highly recommend this game, it is great for say a college student who doesn't get a whole lot of time to play but, wants something fun. Another plus to this game is if you grew up like I did playing the orginal Sim City game then you will like this game its a wonderful reminder of childhood for me.			"

												Think of Settlers combined with Tropico without an economy and without armies - and you get Banished, but without the DRM, required signups and always online requirement that the latter mentioned games have.  Banished is a simple game, weighing in at a quarter of a gigabyte in size - yet it can provide many hours of entertainment with its challenging obstacles and everchanging environment.This is city building and management at its finest.  It's like Star Trek - everybody gets a job to do, nobody gets paid.  If you don't pull your weight, you die.  Nobody complains about wages, the jobs they have to do - they just get on with it, like good Amish people without the hats.After 100 hours gameplay, I'm happy to say that this is one of the most rewarding games I've played for the price tag.  Kudos to the sole developer, and I wish you much luck with your future endeavours.  May you be this decade's Chris Sawyer.			"

												CTD and RepetitiveFIRST THE CRASH TO DESKTOP ISSUE:  My first play session worked fine, except the menu was too small for my resolution (1920 x 1080).  A few adjustments in the settings fixed that.  However, during my second play session the game would crash after about 5 minutes of play time.  (For reference, I’m running this on Windows 8.1, 64 bit)  After some research, I finally discovered a fix which involved going into the registry and deleting some entries.  And I discovered this fix only worked as long as you didn’t start a new game.  If you did, you’d have to edit the registry again.  This is certainly something a player should not have to do in order to get a working game.ON TO THE PLAYING:  So I bought the game because it seemed fun.  I generally like resource management and time management games.  I've played Sims, SimCity, Diner Dash, Cooking Dash, etc. just to give you an idea.At first it was fun.  I could place buildings where I wanted.  A few like the houses even had different styles to choose from by typing the ""F"" key before placing it on the ground.  I liked watching my little worker ants hurry around.  I quickly got a handle on my food supply, and this was despite some of the workers hoarding a disproportionate amount of food in their houses which meant less for others.  It’s not that hard really.  Just have some farm fields during the growing season, and you also have a few hunters, fishermen, and/or gatherers.  I also got control of wood, stone, etc.In the end, it seemed all I needed to do was sit with the workers pane open and subtract or add workers to different positions as I needed.  For example: “Subtract 3 workers from Gathering, and add those 3 to Building because I have a wave of construction projects going on.”  It’s just a matter of clicking up or down on the arrows next to the jobs in the list.  I just needed to do that and keep an eye on the resource panes.  That’s why it got repetitive, and I played less than 10 hours.  Maybe that’s all the game is really meant for.			"

												Fun, but hard. Very very hard. If you like your city management games unforgiving, where you have to plan years in advance, this is for you. Once you have a village set up it is quite easy to maintain it, but you must expand to survive, it only takes 1 harsh winter, 1 crop infestation or one outbreak of influenza to suddenly put your population on the path to extinction, and stopping the knock on effects of low population and thus resource gathering spiraling out of control force you to restructure everything.Absolutly love it.

It was developed entirely by ONE guy and yet, it's one of the best city builder sims to come out in a very long time (it's still in beta!). There's also a survival aspect and it features disasters. There's no silly endgame scenarios (""Build x houses""). Maps are randomly generated using seeds. Gameplay is refreshing and addicting.10/10.			"

If you've played city builders before, the gameplay will be familiar, but it also has its own flavor -- for instance, the hilarious/goofy villager names. It is relaxing to play (and has soothing music), but it's also challenging. I'm glad there is no fighting and you can just concentrate on building your city. This is the first game I've reviewed on Steam, and it is WELL WORTH BUYING!			"

Instead of being buried beneath of endless need to build bigger and better, you are made to think ""how to do this"" as you are working with basic set of building structures to make the most use out of the land you have around you.

												No monsters. No quests. No swords. I found this game refreshing, as it manages to be fun without forcing you to fight anything. The difficulty stems entirely from within. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something completely different, something that not a lot of games provide. If you like one genre of game, or think that anything without action-intense combat is boring, I would not recommend this game for you.For anyone on the fence, here are some pros and cons. Everyone likes pros and cons.Pros:○ The UI is phenomenal. Some things might be a little too big or too small, but everything is pretty easy to find, and you can tell what everything is supposed to do.○ Difficulty is just customizable enough. Likewise, the difficulty curve is naturally progressing and works well.○ The game alt-tabs just fine. A minor point, but there are a surprising number of games which you just can't alt-tab out of. Banished auto-pauses you if you alt-tab.○ The graphics are, in my opinion, quite nice. The theme of the game comes through very strongly through the graphical style used.Cons:○ The game is relatively slow-paced, and it can take a long time to get anywhere.○ Not a lot of content at this time, so it's a long game with few options. Can get boring if you manage to stabilize a village.○ Villagers are sometimes really stupid. Not dwarf stupid, but pretty stupid.Other Points:○ No game over screen when things spiral completely out of control and you're left with no citizens and no way to get more citizens. Just a small quirk. Not good or bad, really. I kinda like it: you get to watch as your village is slowly consumed by nature once more.			"

												This game is challenging to day the least, but it's also one of the best ""city"" builder games I have ever played. Even on easy it's surprisingly difficult just to service a few years when just starting out, but once you get the general basics down everything seems to flow... right up till sudden starvation, cold, or loss of all tools happens because you over look one tiny detail and 90% of your populous dies off. That however is not a complaint about the game, it's just something you have to overcome and when you do build back up the feeling of accomplishment is really quite wonderful. My only real complaint about the game is the bad luck I get with disasters. Supposedly tornadoes are rare in the world, but the first 3 worlds a created each had tornadoes within the first 2 years, the first of which killed all but 4 people. But again, that was more bad luck and another chance to just start over from stratch than a real issue with the game.			"

												I have never had any inclination to ever review a game before - but this game is just simply blissful elegance to play.  I would strongly recommend purchasing this game if you are inclined towards RTS/City Building games.  The experience of this game is more enjoyable then any game to come out recently with huge development teams - but to learn that this was created by one man (Luke) is incredible.  However there are some flaws (which I am sure will be addressed soon).  The flaws I have found:Game has a tendency to suffer fatal errors in a variety of scenarios (upon save, upon different common in game actions).  I have yet to get a population above 400 - not because of my city building ability but because I have had 3 or 4 games where the game crashes and I cannot alter my play state to avoid the error.  I am not overly disappointed in this because after browsing the forum - it looks like the developer is taking a very proactive role in correcting the issues. (My Rig - Windows 7 64 bit SLI SDD).The game lacks what, to me, would be a real end goal and after a while it fills like your building small towns that work together within the map then one homogenous city.  Beyond the basic buildings I have found nothing to unlock besides Steam achievements which don't do too much to get me excited.  However - I feel like this will probably be addressed by Luke or by the modding community when the tools are eventually released.  However - on the flip side - the simplicity also adds to the beauty of the game in a way.  I could see this game getting monotonous - especially to someone who requires in your face action or war type scenarios.  I think with about 50 hours (assuming the bugs are fixed) I will have seen everything this game has to offer at this point.One thing I have really enjoyed about the game is its difficulty.  The first 4 or 5 times I played I failed miserably quickly in to the game.  The frustrations of watching all your citizens die one by one is painful and frustrating.  This is not a bad thing though - it is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game - learning from your mistakes and using foresight the next time to prevent the issues from happening again.  It's also great to know that if you are not on top of your game at any given time - 5 min later you could see your town falter and everything you worked for fall like dominoes.So summation - at full price in its current state - it would be a hard sell for me.  For $20.00 - you should buy it as long as you are aware of the flaws and have some patients during the meantime for the bugs to be worked out.  If you do wish to wait - make sure to come back eventually because this game is amazing. "

It's addictive, has great details, is challenging and really makes you think. Very glad I bought it! The community is also very friendly and willing to help, there are some great videos and a brilliant help thread.			"

												This is a great take on the time-honored strategy game.  The fact that there are no enemies besides the unforgiving mistress that is Mother Nature (well, that and a few stray boars and falling rocks) is fascinating.  The game does a pretty good job of driving home the difficulties of creating a settlement in an isolated place.  Definitely worth checking out, it's quite re-playable and a great change-of-pace from some of the more frenetic games.			"

												Banished is a unique and somewhat unforgiving take on the city building genre. The game puts you in charge of a small colony of people that have just arrived in a strange, (and randomly generated), land. The game requires you to make sure your people are fed, have housing (and warmth!), tools, and clothes to survive with. On the surface it seems very much like your typical sim...where the difference lies is the difficulty! If you react too soon to a problem - you spread your self too thin and you limit your growth. Do it too late and you do not have time to adjust. For example: waiting until your almost out of food to build more farms..by the time the crops are planted and harvested (which take an entire season in game). Your people will have already started to die off. The game can be hard..but it also has a very rewarding feeling when you manage to grow your little hamlet of 20 people to a sprawling town of 500+. If your looking for a more serious take on a sim game I say give this one a try. Just be ready to watch your people freeze/starve/be crushed by rocks/eaten by boars for your first few games. Highly recommended!			"

												Excellent game.Not every builder needs to turn into another combat game, which is apparently a rule for most designers.  Apparently it's too tough to make a game interesting without weapons.  Sometimes its challenging just keeping people alive, well fed and warm.  An early frost can be just as deadly as a zerg rush.  There's a lot here to keep you busy, and enough variation to keep you occupied a long time.  If you have any interest in city builders, this is for you.I have to say that I love the negative reviewer who thinks every building is required to produce the exact same amount every year.  Genius!  Because that's how life in the wilderness works, right?   I can still hear my great great great garndfather saying ""we were 200 corn short last year.  I told you that field should have been 12x12 not 10x10.""I do wish you could choose a bit more about your start possessions, or at least have a random button.  But with a game like this there will always be more you'd like to add, and I haven't spent long yet browsing the mods.  If you like builders, buy this now.  Or check out some Let's Plays if you're not sure (Quill18 has a couple good ones).			"

												Addicting and challenging ""city"" builder. The term ""city builder"" is used loosely here as even at the largest, the towns created in here aspire to ""large medieval hamlet"". This game distinguishes itself from other city builders in two respects. First, it is difficult; almost punishingly difficult. This is especially true if you are used to more forgiving city builder sims, where the tide of the game can be shifted with an ordinance, a building, or a tax hike. There are no such instruments in Banished. Build too many houses, a season later there are hungry mouths to feed with not enough workers to provide food. Build too slowly, and the aging population is unable to replace workers fast enough. Each decision needs to be made with the consequences of the future in mind, as the impact of a single building can have a ripple effect seasons later. Second, unlike many other city builders there are not a plethora of buildings, and no direction towards the ""You Win"" building. All buildings and upgrades are available from the word go. The exercise of Banished is one of a balancing act, rather than a sprint. The player must keep food, population, and resources in perfect balance or a death spiral can very rapidly occur. It can lead to some frustration early on, but the best advice that can be given is not to get too attached to the first town that one builds. However, as the mechanics become more and more apparent, a rhythm to the gameplay will emerge and that is when Banished truly hooks the player.The game gets a recommendation for players who long for a city builder with some serious depth despite the bucolic exterior. If someone is looking for a game with a campaign to lead them through a series of missions and hand hold through each step of the way, look elsewhere. While there is a tutorial, it only covers the very basic mechanics, it leaves the rest to the player.			"

												Decent as a budget title if you buy it on sale; Banished provides a fair challenge at the early stages of the game when you're struggling to survive against starvation and harsh weather.Unfortunately, there is no endgame here. Once your town gets a foothold (usually about 4 hours in), there is very little that can stop it. Once you've become self-sufficient, you occasionally have to manage citizens - replacing your blacksmith when he dies of old age, for instance. Disasters are non-interactive; you usually just want for it to run its course and then rebuild whatever it damaged.That said, this is an indie title by one lone developer, and it is impressive that one person could create a moderately entertaining city builder on his own.

												Outright this game is very enjoyable.  That said, after 10-20 hours of playing and generally figuring things out you'll start to feel an itch.This game does the fundamentals very well, but after getting to know it the ""itch"" becomes things it could do better or expand on.  You start wanting more things to build, more oddities that can occur, etc..  You start thinking ""boy I wish there were more occupational buildings I could make!"" and ""I wish I could do something with this lake...it's just there taking up a ton of space"".  On the other hand, you start encountering little gripes like ""Why are my villagers so damn dumb?  Use the roads I built you fools!"" or ""Why are workers carrying stuff to the storages on the opposite end of the map when there none of the others are full?""  However, this is a great problem to have in general as it gives some indication of direction for later efforts (both by community and dev).Very recommended for people like me who can spend an entire weekend day playing and even for those with busy daily lives who may not be able to dedicate more than maybe an hour in a sitting.  The really hard part for both types of players is prying yourself away from it to do things that are necessary...like eating and sleeping.			"

												Banished is a game goes back to the roots for people who enjoy City Builder games. It's pretty simple in it's setup, yet has some incredible dept that sucks you in and gives you hours and hours of entertainment.For me personally this game really reminds me of the older simcities, back when there was much less handholding. As I said the strenght of this game is in the challanging mechanics below the seemingly easy exterior. The whole game is a well executed balance game, where most action have certain consequences. Unlike a lot of other city builder games as of late (including for example the latest version of Simcity), where the games are generally more forgiving when taking a sub-optimal route.A good example is the balance that comes with expanding your population. In Banished it's not as easy as just putting down a few extra houses. Sure this will increase your population, but if you have to keep in mind the increase in resource consumed (essential ones like food, but also secondary resources like firewood). On the other hand not expanding your population quickly enough could mean you run into the problem of having too many people die of old age which will cut hard into your workforce.The only negative I can probably note about this game is that at a certain point it will start lacking a bit of repeatability. Once you get the hang of the balance game and get good at setting up efficient supply chains, expanding your towns is mostly a rince and repeat activity. And because this is a pure city builder game to the core, there are no other ""objectives"" to keep you busy. On the plus side, this game is still fully in development so we might expect to see some decent additions.(TL;DR)All in all Banished is a game that will keep you busy for quite a while, making it more than worth the price. It goes back to the roots of City Builder games and it's simple setup with some challanging mechanics will keep you entertained whether you're new to the genre or a veteran.			"

												BanishedBanished is a sort of Civilisation, or City Simulator based in the past, where the general theme is to expand your town/city while managing your resources and citizens closely.Visually I find this game very pleasing. The trees, water and even rocks look very nice, and the animations are also done well. There isn’t a huge amount to say about the audio, but it does the job. 	The game itself is hard to talk about. You start with a small number of villagers, and have to have them collect resources such as wood, stone, and food, while building new houses for them to live in. Houses allow your population to grow, giving you more children, which eventually will become adults and workers. That all sounds fairly standard, and even simplistic, but do not be fooled; this game can destroy you. That may sound somewhat strange, when you consider the fact there are no roaming barbarians, vicious animals, or in fact any enemies at all. No, the difficulty is the extent of micro management that is required to keep your town functioning. It’s about finding balance. You might want to build several houses for your villagers, so they can sleep, and take shelter from the weather. That’s all well and good, but that one simple choice now has several consequences such as the need for more wood to be converted to firewood to keep the people warm, it will also increase the population as people start to have children. More children will eventually mean more workers, but in the short term they’re just more mouths to consume precious food. You also have to consider the materials used for the house, and how many people you assign to build it, will no longer be collecting those resources for the time it takes to build. This is just one example, but that is the kind of thing that makes it what it is. Every choice has to be thought through, even the positioning of the houses. A house too far away from the occupants work area means less efficiency and less resources gathered. 	Your citizens will need to be closely monitored, as they have general health, which can be maintained with a Herbalist making remedies, happiness which is very hard to manage, but can be helped with buildings like Taverns, and Hunger needs to be monitored so they don’t starve to death. Interestingly your citizens will grow old, and they will die of old age, which is an easy thing to forget, and if you do, you may end up with a very old town, incapable of having children, and so you lose by attrition. Weather affects them too, meaning you need to make some warm clothes for winter, and light for summer, and maintain a steady supply of tools for people to actually do their jobs with. 	Overall the mechanics are very solid and are easy to understand, but difficult to master. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows for the game, unfortunately. The pacing of the game can be extremely slow, even when you manually adjust the timer to the fastest setting. Some of the controls, like having someone stop their current job and start doing something else (or work somewhere else) seems very much in the hands of the AI. Sometimes people just won’t do what you want. The biggest thing with Banished though, is ‘the point’. As in ‘what’s the point?’. Truth be told, there isn’t one. There are no technologies to advance, no enemies to conquer, no end of the game or unlocks. You simply just go until you fill the map (which looks quite small). Now, I appreciate that not all games have ‘a point’ per se (ex: Minecraft, Space Engineers, Garry’s Mod) but the majority do, and the ones that don’t are usually based on the player creating something unique, and are multiplayer. Banished has none of those features. Conclusion; to wrap it up I’d say that Banished is a well made and balanced game, with an emphasis on resource and micro-management in a slow paced environment. A recommendation really depends on the person considering buying the game. If you’re the sort of person that likes to pick up a game, play it from start to finish and put it down for a while, this game is likely not for you, so avoid it at all costs. However, if you’re the sort of person that likes a nice, slow paced game, with heavy man-management systems and are not too bothered by campaigns or story driven games, then this is right up your street.Assuming you’re the latter category, I’d give it 8.5/10 "

												This game is amazing! I'm going to let you know right from start that this game will be challenging. I've had a couple cities perish until I finally found good balances for resources. The music, the graphics, the tiny little details for the villagers' daily lives that go on in the game are wonderful. The game is just a blast to play. While you might think ""What if I want to eventually fight something?"" you're not going to have time to think that because you'll be more concerned about how you're going to keep your food storage constant enough to maintain your villigers during the winter.Gaming Tips:I personally recommend building a fishing dock first thing when you start unless you're not near water, then I would go for the hunter's cabin instead. I also play on 5x speed but that is also up to you. Just make sure you have firewood and food for when winter comes because a lot of times the first winter makes or breaks a village. And with crop fields, Have your farmers there at early spring, then once the fields have been harvested (usually sometime in autum, it depends) then have them work on other things in the village so they won't be wasting their time until early spring returns (or if the snow thaws in late winter)I can say that this game will be eating up many hours of free time.

												Banished is a primitive, (maybe a bit too primitive) yet beautiful city simulation.I rate this game a solid 7/10This game is a game that can be played for hours on end.Pros: Lots of automated things, you don't have to assign people to houses, they just find a house and live in it. Very easy to use user interface. You can have a ton of cities at once. It's one of those games that you can play for hours on end, just evolving and growing your city.Cons: Sometimes a bit difficult even on Easy mode. Very bare-bones style. It seems as though that all you do is make sure people live, and that's about it. Graphics should be better. (Games like this rarely have good graphics, so I can't blame it.) Wish I could zoom in just a bit more. Sometimes there's nothing you can do, and you just have to watch your city die and start all over again, which is one of the worst things to happen.How it could improve: Fix all of the cons. (Obviously) You should be able to change things a bit more. (Upgrade houses and things like fishing docks and wood cutters, build boats to fish from, etc.) I'd like to be able to get close to the characters and hear them speaking. I'd like to tap in to peoples lives, just to make the game a little more immersive.Conclusion:All in all, I enjoy the game and have played for hours on end. I'd say that it's well worth $20.			"

												One of the best city building sims I've ever played. It seems, almost, too simple of a game...build farms, cut down trees, chip away at the stone, hunt some deer etc. Then, all of a sudden, your tools are broken, so you cannot harvest wood for warmth, cannot break stone or mine iron to make new tools, and then your townsfolk start dying off....So, be prepared to start over, chances are your town will die off (due to starvation, lack of warmth, population has stopped growing, or simply due to illness). The replayability is decent enough, so starting over isn't a huge deal, and it has a learning curve (esecially the larger settlements).The mod support adds so much to the vanilla game (Though I suggest starting off with the core game, as some mods can seem overwhelming to a beginner).All in all, I highly suggest this game (especially if you enjoy this genre). I got it on sale, I suggest you do too (Let's face it, most of us get our games this way)			"

85/100This is a really well done settlement/colony sim! The gameplay/visuals/sounds is very relaxing yet it is a challenging game that makes you think ahead and plan out your strategy. Specially when you think the game becomes to easy the game mechanics kicks in and releases a virus on the people and if not prepared half your village dies with in a year time.  I love the city/civ/colony sim genre and this is definitely a (new) favorite!This is a typical game that you plan to play for 1 hour and next time you look on the clock it's 4 hours later.  As for the amount of features and depth of the game it could have been a bit bigger. There is no upgrading of buildings, nor a research tree or other advancing options, but the features that are there are well implemented. This is not a tripple A big budget game and only created by a few people which makes it even more outstanding as it is. Love to see a sequel of this game that has more features. Oh and before I forget. The UI is just great! I wish more similar games did the UI like this!Edited: grammar			"

												It may look a little difficult at first, but once you figure the basics out, it's very easy to make progress. You have difficulty settings, too, so if you prefer a relaxing game or want to learn without stress, you have the option. On the other hand, if you love challenges, you can have them (and they can be pretty harsh!)The UI is fantastic, you can choose to display or hide as much as you prefer. The AI is very good, the mechanics are tough but fair, and learning them feels truly rewarding.I've found that, in longer games, I end up a bit bored, but only because I don't dare continue making my town bigger. I have yet to create a proper city (I just love tiny cute towns so much)I think Banished is an excellent game for fans of classic strategy and city building/management, but also a great starting point for someone new to the genre. If you've never played strategy but want to try it, Banished is a great candidate for it. I definitely recommend it.			"

												I grew up on games like Zeus and Poseidon, Pharaoh and Cleopatra, and the Anno Series. This game is very much in the same genre, but the focus is much more on the people and the ""economy."" For me this is a huge plus. The way that everything is managed (very number oriented) makes for huge amounts of depth. Definitely worth a buy.Bonus points if the dev releases a Linux version (which I am hopeful he will).			"

												Best indi game last year. It cam out polished and working like a well oiled machine. Beautiful visuals. Relaxing and non-annoying music. I have enjoyed this more than other building type games. The player exprience i much less frustrating and focused on learning the mechanics than trying to work around on bugs. Bravo to this developer. Obviously the toolset works well and is popular based on the amount of mods and large scale of them. I would recomend this to my friends. Of course most of them that like this kind of game already have it cause its awsome!			"

												If you like resource gathering, micro management, and city building this is for you! Make sure you have adept and quick thinking problem solving skills. I find rises escelate really quickly. You'll be really tempted to play in the fastest speed, but thats how things just kinda snowball. Expand slowly and micromanage and honestly you'll just have fun sprawling over the map! The music is great and the graphics are good enough for me, not sure what else to expect from them tbh.			"

												Outright this game is very enjoyable.  That said, after 10-20 hours of playing and generally figuring things out you'll start to feel an itch.This game does the fundamentals very well, but after getting to know it the ""itch"" becomes things it could do better or expand on.  You start wanting more things to build, more oddities that can occur, etc..  You start thinking ""boy I wish there were more occupational buildings I could make!"" and ""I wish I could do something with this lake...it's just there taking up a ton of space"".  On the other hand, you start encountering little gripes like ""Why are my villagers so damn dumb?  Use the roads I built you fools!"" or ""Why are workers carrying stuff to the storages on the opposite end of the map when there none of the others are full?""  However, this is a great problem to have in general as it gives some indication of direction for later efforts (both by community and dev).Very recommended for people like me who can spend an entire weekend day playing and even for those with busy daily lives who may not be able to dedicate more than maybe an hour in a sitting.  The really hard part for both types of players is prying yourself away from it to do things that are necessary...like eating and sleeping.			"

												Its a survival city building game.  It takes its inspiration from games like Dwarf Fortress, Towns, and Gnomoria.  Dwarf Fortress being the most complex of them, and the others being very derivative and simpler.  Banished is definitely the simplest and least complex of them all.  However that doesn't really detract from the fun of trying to survive in the harsh land you have been dropped into.  Double however, once you have figured out how to strike a balance with your world and have grown it out there is little more to do, due to the lack of content and end game goals.  And there aren't many mods that add anything terribly interesting to the game.  Much of them are little tweaks to annoying aspects of the game or aesthetic tweaks.  But until then you will find the game challenging and fun.			"

												Banished is an outstanding achievement for a one man team. The game has very complex mechanics that reward the player that experiments with the environment of the game. This even though everything is very well explained at the beginning, at least the basics. The tutorials are clear and well made, short but not so to skip anything important that the beginner needs to know. I managed to make a village of 500 people in 7-8 hours of gameplay. However to achieve this village I dumped two villages for a total of 42h of gameplay. It has high replayability value, with different terrains conditions and seeds, try different resource gathering strategies, or different town layouts. I feel I beat the game (I will truly beat it when I get 900+ villagers) but nonetheless I am curious about what other possible strategies there are to achieve a 300+ pop. An example of other gathering strategies, build a lot of woodcutters and build many tradeposts, then buy stone and iron with the surplus of fuel. This way you don't need any mines or quarries. Make a lot of hunters and pastures with cattle, to get a surplus of leather, then make a few tailors, get a surplus of coats and sell them for food + stone + iron + coal. etc... etc...I have recommended very few games but this one deserves it. Go on and read the bad reviews, you will see most of them haven't played the game more than 20h or haven't achieved 300+ pop. They say wether that it's too easy or that it's too hard, if they say it's too easy it is because it is easy... at the beginning at least. After the 300 threshold it gets pretty challenging to coordinate supplies and the time the villagers take to get to houses from workplaces to avoid a deathmarch. Anyway, buy this game, for the sake of the developer and for a bug free release (yes, bug free!).Hugs :D			"

												I've played though all difficulties and came up with this information:Easy if you would like to figure out the extent of the game and to have fun without worry.Medium, you'll have a challenge to build houses at first, but it's not so bad when you get enough food.Hard if you want a real challenge, also add in some random events for fun. You'll have a hard time and may fail right away if you don't understand the way this game is played.Tips/Spoiler: Center town plus North, East, West, South stockpiles and stores with gatherers and hunters out there. Add a market to the center to cover the four areas and work from there. If you're playing the harder than easy difficulties, you're on your own but I will leave you with this: Time is on your side only if you can manage it, so take care of the speed system.			"

												This game is so damn hard! You think you are doing well and then you notice that your citizens have no food and then half of them are dead, literally. However, the feeling you get when you overcome these challenges, at least temporarily, is immense.There will always be a struggle for resources, whether it be food, clothes or building materials and it isn't a simple case of mining what you need or whatever the case may be. You need to have citizens to be available to do these tasks, if there are none then what you want done will not be done.There are a couple of things that aren't quite right, such as people forever switching jobs with each other whenever they please and builders taking the long route to build a bridge, but that doesn't make it a bad game, in fact it's quite the opposite.This game involves no fighting against other people or anything like that, it's all about building a town, with people who were banished from somewhere, and managing to get it to survive against the harsh reality of nature and prosper.It is no simple task.

												Simply put, Banished is a town builder where the goal is to have your village thrive. It's The Oregon Trail meets Sim City. From a handful of families to hundreds of people, you re-create how the ancient settlements of a few people became the burgeoning cities of today. The game itself has a few simple mechanics and a very stripped down UI which can be viewed in individual parts. The graphics are acceptable (nothing too amazing), and the controls are intuitive. It may not be your cup of tea as there is no win condition and there's no real economy building, so if you are interested, take a look at some game play videos which go over the game as they help illustrate how the game is played and how it feels.

												A fantastic game that teaches you to be patient.If you are a fan of micromanaging, this game will be a good fit. You are constantly striving to balance your growth to your available resources.... which is trickier then it sounds.Nothing like the guilt of turning away a band of nomads, because you know you would have them all die of starvation and/or exposure through the winter. Or lacking the facilities to deal with the disease they are surely bringing with them.I am still in awe this is developed by one person.....The possiblity for future expansions with this system is vast. I look forward to seeing how large and complex the worlds you make will be with future expansions.			"

												Banished has a curious and compelling mix of quiet contemplative planning and strategy-based game play that brings with it a growing subtle urgency. It's deceptively difficult to meet the constantly growing demands of your citizenry as your population booms, and the pacing allows it to remain fun even as that urgency grows. I haven't had this much fun with a city builder in a long time, and that's speaking as a fan of the genre.			"

												A great city-building game. I love the atmosphere and scenery of the game, and the relaxing music makes this a very chill experience (punctuated by the first frantic winters of scrambling to get enough food and firewood of course). It is in many ways something of a puzzle-game combined with a city-builder though, because like a good puzzle game, once you’ve found the optimal placement of buildings and such, the game doesn’t really introduce anything new, and instead can get a bit dull.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good puzzle game or city-builder. I would simply say not to play this expecting some big grand city-building experience—there are no bandits to raid your outlying villages, no avalanches or floods to wash away massive sections of your town certain times of year (though there are occasional tornados and a few other minor events). It is good for what it does, just don’t expect it to be bigger or grander than what it is.			"

												Banished is a unique and somewhat unforgiving take on the city building genre. The game puts you in charge of a small colony of people that have just arrived in a strange, (and randomly generated), land. The game requires you to make sure your people are fed, have housing (and warmth!), tools, and clothes to survive with. On the surface it seems very much like your typical sim...where the difference lies is the difficulty! If you react too soon to a problem - you spread your self too thin and you limit your growth. Do it too late and you do not have time to adjust. For example: waiting until your almost out of food to build more farms..by the time the crops are planted and harvested (which take an entire season in game). Your people will have already started to die off. The game can be hard..but it also has a very rewarding feeling when you manage to grow your little hamlet of 20 people to a sprawling town of 500+. If your looking for a more serious take on a sim game I say give this one a try. Just be ready to watch your people freeze/starve/be crushed by rocks/eaten by boars for your first few games. Highly recommended!			"

												A great RTS and survival game that offers addictive fun as well as rather complex and unforgiving challenges to face that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The best micromanaging simulator I've ever played so far!Imagine starting with a population of 12 and then losing 8 of them because you couldn't gather enough food in time before they starved. Now it is down to 3 guys and 1 woman to repopulate the whole town. And when you got back on your feet with everything you need (ex. population of 18, farmlands, schoolhouse, etc), oh no a big tornado decides to steam roll through your town destroying your schoolhouse, killing all the small children and most of your workers in the process :( Now down to a Pop of 3 and all over the age of 55, you make more kids somehow and send all your kids at the age of 10 to go work in the mines or become the town doctor (way cooler than being a pokemon trainer, amiright?) Only Con: I'll never understand why 85 year olds will continue being a lumberjack, 10 year olds becoming blacksmiths, or how in the ""20 years"" my town exists in-game that you will have citizens that will be born there and will die at the age of 90. In all honesty, this doesn't ruin the game at all for me but I do find it hilarious watching an extremely healthy and happy person die of old age at 65 while the very unhealthy and most depressed person ever will live to 89 (cause of death: A rock in the quarry fell on him). 10/10 would run town into ground again			"

												Libertie spent all day, every day, collecting food for the rest of the village. She worked until her fingers were numb and bleeding, but never ceased in her quest to provide for the other townsfolk. When the food began to run out, Libertie worked even harder, foregoing her own meals in order to provide more and more for the older and younger members of her fledgeling community. Libertie worked harder and harder, and got thinner and thinner, starving herself in order to put more food into the mouths of others. Then, one day, out in the forest with no-one but the birds to witness her selfless work, Libertie's body simply gave up. She died of starvation, while gathering food.10/10Will play again.			"

												Having played a good few hours of Banished so far, I've got to say: this is a good game. Not great, but good. Overall, my impression is that it's still very much a work in progress.Banished draws you in and easily sucks away hours of your life as you concern yourself with keeping your villagers alive and building them a stable and, above all, sustainable home. There is a real sense of accomplishment in transforming three families and a cartload of basic supplies into a thriving community of hundreds of villagers.However, a few times now I have got to the point where it seems I have achieved all I can in the game. Others who have played Banished might recognise it; you have built up most of the viable land on the map, stabilised your population, and backed it all up with a steady supply of food and resources. What is there left to do? Apart from sitting behind your monitor and appreciating all that you've built, honestly, not much...Once you have built all the 'civic' buildings (which can occur relatively early on) there is little left to achieve besides marginally increasing the population. That gets old rather quickly. There is the odd 'disaster' which occurs, but there is little you can do to directly combat those. Instead, you simply wait for them to run their course and rebuild, if necessary. I feel Banished is crying out for a deeper level of complexity in order to increase its replay value. Building up larger communities should come with the societal problems which typically arise from them. I once saw one of my villagers met his end because he was ""stabbed"". An incident like that should trigger an event which leads to your society choosing its own justice system. And why don't the citizens protest after a stonecutter has been crushed by a rock for the umpteenth time? Those feel like missed opportunities to me.In short, I feel that with a game like this you should be able to eventually control its society and politics a bit more to give each settlement its own 'flavour'. I'll be keeping a keen eye on the future development of this game in the hope something like that will be added.			"

												This game is really fun. I thought that it would be stressful and all of my people would die. I am happy to say I have only had 6 deaths. Only because one family was greedy and took all the food. The game is sort of simple to learn. The only hard part to the game is keeping everyone alive for the first few years. I am currently on year 8 and have had to build 2 storage houses to store all my food.The basic movement and placement controls are nice and simple. The game runs really smooth, never have an issue with choppy FPS or anything along those lines (running on high graphics). I like that they kept the camera controls to the WASD instead of the arrow keys. The only thing I don't like is trying to remember what keys do what for the tool bar. Kind of wish they wouldn't have used the function keys but that is my view and I could just change them in options. Other than that, I think the controls are great and user friendly.I think the graphics could have been a little better. I feel like I am playing a more economy based StrongHold 2. On the flip side I like having the graphics like that because older computers can play the game as well.I like the idea of having mods. I know that they just updated the game to allow mods so I don't expect to much yet. From what I have used, most work while others don't. I do look forward to seeing more building types thought. I think by having mods we are able to build our towns/cities better.Over all rating: 9/10Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 8/10Controls: 9/10Replay Value: 10/10Mods: 7/10			"

												It takes a few restarts to get going, but it's very satisfying. I'm hoping they expand with a higher margin of error - in a game where population is like your score, you should be able to take a population hit when disaster strikes, but be able to recover.Also I see it getting stale. With a higher margin for error, you could introduce random events, conditions or story elements to switch up the build orders.I haven't looked at custom buildings, but I'm wary they may throw off the balance.

												This is an excelent game in it's current state, but it could be SO much more.  When I was younger, my mother played a game called ""Zeus"", an ancient egyptian city builder.  It played a lot like this, (in a much lower res, of course), but it had a much vaster and more interactive world.  The game evolved as you played it more and more.  With Banished, I'm able to play it for several hours at a time, but once I've got a thriving population, and collected all the seeds and animals I needed, there was nothing more to do.  You're stuck in time, unable to move forward and advance your city, there's no inovation.  The game looks great, and plays great for several hours, for the $20 price mark, it's worth it, in my opinion, but there just needs to be an expansion, an official expansion, that brings your city forward.  My personal opinion?  Have new buildings that unlock as the years go by, events that occur within the game, (inventions, discoveries, etc.), and make it a city builder that people will remember for years.  One massive expansion, and this game would be EVERYTHING i've wanted it to be.  7/10.			"

												I recommend this game, although just barely. When I purchased this a couple of years ago, the description made it sound as if new features would be added periodically, but nothing new has been released since I've seen it. The developer's blog indicates that he is focusing on developing mod support and compatibility with other platforms as opposed to fleshing out the game's content more. This still seems like a half-baked game in terms of content, and there still seem to be various bugs and glitches. I like the overall program in spite of that, but I think one can spend their money on another better developed city-building game for the time being.			"

The simple yet perfect graphics give the game the spot on blend between reality and old fashion computer game. The game has a simple premise of building a bustling town out of nothing but your surroundings, yet has a impressive replay value. There are so many ways to play the game from going completely farm based to living solely off of hunted and fished game. Banished gives you the simple yet perfect freedom to create your own town of misfits and organize a population into something fantastic.

												This is a very solid singleplayer city-builder. I have not played many other city builders simply because the blocky graphics (who wants to build something if it's going to make their eyes hurt?), or way too intensive micromanaging turned me off.This game is simple. This game is easy. This game is elegant with a beautiful soundtrack. That is until a single fire ravages through your urban center destroying any sense of unity your village had. Then---DEATH SPIRAL. Death spirals are so intense, as you watch graveyards fill before your eyes and entire professions become void of workers. Pulling out of one is near impossible, but if you do it is an accomplishment worthy of song.There are however some drawbacks: 1. Gameplay is more or less managing a set of spreadsheets, drop down menus and building stuff to your best ability-then observing the outcome. 2.  Starving people will walk past barns and markets FILLED TO CAPACITY with food and starve to death on the way to their house, come on people grab a peach at the market and don't die.3. So many houses... In order to keep a population growing you constantly have to build houses leading to the before mentioned urban sprawl, eventual fire, disease, lucky tornado and/or food shortage leading to DEATH SPIRAL.4. Glitches: By scheduling to demolish and then canceling the demolish order graveyards are 'emptied' of bodies even though gravestones remain allowing infinite burials on one small patch of land (useful glitch but still a glitch), Livestock walk underwater between pens instead of taking roads, lag starts to intrude with populations over 1000 (gets bad around 1400) and Gatherers are incredibly OP compared to other starting food sources.5. Do What??? Once you have a town going you may feel a sense of emptiness at having 'conquered' the game and unless you are willing to go after the achievements that sense of pointlessness will remain. However the achievements for this game offer interesting challenges instead of the standard 'get-all-the-things' sort.So overall it is a good game but there is a steep learning curve and, unless you like to achievement hunt, limited replay value, but for all that it is an addictive game into which I have sunk dozens of hours and have a few more left in me.

												An extremely enjoyable game, very nice to play when you want something calm and idyllic. My advice is to be stingy on house building; there's no need to feel bad about the kids never moving out of their parents' house. ALWAYS make sure you have more than enough food to support your population. DON'T trade away stone or iron/iron tools or your steel tools. Those are finite resources on your maps, and you always want to trade FOR them. Same goes for coal - it's not worth mining (you have to choose coal or iron, choose the latter!), because steel tools aren't as valuable as you think they are (except for if you desperately need to trade for seeds maybe) and the villagers often take the coal to heat their homes, which is a complete waste. And last but not least (this will save you a headache later) build your cemetery as big as you can, preferably as far away as you can. These are just some basic advice, there are many more tips/tutorials you can find online. The only drawback on this game is maybe not enough micro-managing, which is something I prefer in my games. Unless you build a huge metropolis, you will find you often run out of things to do other than just stalk a villager or watch the animals roam around.			"

Banished is the game for you, but don't be fooled, this won't be a walk in the park.  Battle with harsh winters, low food supplies, and plagues that rival those of the Dark Ages.  If you are able to make it through the winter, you just might have a chance to survive.Banished is an addicting game that will take up all the spare time you have and then some.  Every change you make will affect whether or not your town will survive.			"

												While it's on sale my (very short) two cents about the game: If you like survival games and/or strategy games this one is great. Better in many ways than the mainstream games of its genre.I'm honest the truth not that much of a strategy gamer but I wouldn't want to miss Banished for ""those times"". Fully recommend it to whomever is intrigued by its description on the store-page - full price or sale, you'll win.  :)			"

												Banished is a game about as oppressive and meaningless as life itself. And for that reason I would recommend it, not for its entertainment value but for the raw challenge stripped of the gilding so many other simulator games can't do without. Any moments of satisfaction you find as you struggle against nature and time to build some resemblance of a town are quickly obliterated either by the proceeding tedium of routine or the catastrophe of a town-wide fire. You spend all of your time trying to manage a continuously out of balance economy with minimal data and limited input. The lives of your citizens are woefully abstract, left for you to deduce the continuity of their mundune yet often incestuous dealings. The player becomes like a god, conversely irritated and amused at the incompetence of these vain mortals.In this respect Banished can be refreshingly cruel. It seems out of place in an age that values progress, self-sustaining systems, rewards for investment. The game is still compelling even though it rewards strife with more strife rather than superficial celebration in badges, thumbs-up, and other trinkets of gameification. The player's struggle is not for the carrot-on-a-stick of clearly defined objectives. It's tragic pathos all the way down. You find yourself struggling against both  your own intuitions, the lack of direction, and the permanent imbalance of the game's mechanics, such that the only ""victory"" possible is, like the live's of the people you lead in futility, a noble and heroic stand in the face of an inevitable downfall.Simply put, if you want the control of a SimCity or the personal interest of a Harvest Moon, don't buy it. Banished is heartless, even if it is still lovable. "

												Banished has a level of detail that is not achieved in many city building simulators.  Unfortunately there is no technology progression like there is in Sim City or other games.  All buildings can be built straight away, with no unlocks after certain milestones or achievments, and no tech trees.  Undoubtedly though, some players will appreciate this.  That being said, there is a great deal of depth to the ways a town can be managed in this game.  Resource balance is paramount, and even the slightest changes can have significant effects in both the short and long term.  This requires an attention to detail by the palyer that I thoroughly enjoy.  The underlying mechanics in Bansihed are impressive considereing some games like Sim City and Cities XL can drive a player mad when it screws up seemingly simple mechanics like traffic flow. I have not experienced such frustration with Banished.  Citizens will actually move as close as possible to their work place.  And even as the town's population grows, the underlying mechanics don't get all screwed up like I experience in Sim City for years.I definitely recommend this game.			"

												Banished is a great game for those who prefer quiet sim-city like god building.  Once you get into the rythym of building it may seem like a simple game but the achievements... and the odd tornado throw a stick in your plans.  If you are playing banished for the first time it's important to understand that there is no war, its a game based on resources management and juggling in order to expand your population.  I enjoy playing this game and have downloaded a few simple mods from the free store in order to keep things fresh for design possibilities.  If you like sim-city type games, but don't need to raise armies for battle you will also love this game.			"

												LOVE THIS GAME!!! Love the setting and the intensity that comes with it. Will my people thrive or dive into a non stop whirlpool of death? Hunger they cry, hunger! Just a couple of suggestions to the creators though. Maybe add a fort or outpost theme? Guns and defenses? A town sherrif and crime? Maybe adding copper or tin resorces for the creation of pots and pans as well as guns and knifes? Add indians or hordes of barbarians? I see alot of potential with this that can be taken in so many directions while keeping that edge of your seat game play. Can't wait to see what the future holds for this title. Take my money now, you have my wallet and attention... I have neglected to shower or shave in fear I might miss an opportunity to expand or unknowly kill everyone off... LOL			"

												Banished is a town building game done right. Its everything you could want in a town building and survival game with a simple goal: Survive. Banished puts you incontrol of a small group of people that have traveled far away to creat there own way of living. At the start of every game you start with your main familes, their homes, some resourses and thats all. you need to start finding ways to keep your families warm, fed, and what ever else you want to do. The creator of the game has stated that you can live in a small comunity just fine if you want. There are no enimies in the game besides your bad planning, for many others and I this is a good thing and a relaxing experiance, but the game can still get challenging very easy. When playing this I expaned to fast and most of my population ended up dying off do to hunger in the winter I was lucky enough to bring this under control, but I now know that over expansion can be a death sentence. Banished is a game about being patient and mindful of your people.All and all banished is a very enjoyable game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys city/town builders.Amazing job Banished, Thank you			"

												Banished has a ton going for it, without the need for enemies. The weather, food and population will keep you busy micromanaging that you wouldn't want to add enemies on top of it. My first few play attempts I got ""rek'd"" real good, the furthest I made it was 23 years before the entire population ran out of tools.......Not something you'd think would make/break a community of roughly 200 people, but boy did it. No tools? Then you can't make jack #%$@! Tools are required to build, harvest, or even make more tools! Its small things like this that make Banished so unique in this genre. For me, when playing Age of Empires, I'd create an awesome looking town/city/village and then BAM attacked by a whole hoard of an army. Meanwhile I'm sitting at like 50 military, and then you get demolished. All that beautiful town planning put to waste, well in Banished that's the key to it all. If you take your time, plan each move and GROW SLOWLY then you'll see that Banished is quite rewarding. If you're a fast paced RTS kind of person though, this isn't for you. The game has the ability to speed up production time and overall game speed, however I don't recommend going passed x2. Why? Its not like anyone is going to come with an unstoppable hoard and destroy you right? True, but mother nature doesn't need an army to decimate you, just some snow, and uneducated people and you're SOL. That's right education also plays a huge factor in this game, if you have stupid citizens, you can expect them to produce significantly less than those who are educated. Again, if you like micromanaging, great music, and a overall relaxing town/city builder, then Banished is for you..			"

												There's some small bugs but nothing game breaking. It's a good town simulator, kinda like a prettier version of Dwarf Fortress, where the only threat is proper resource management (which admittedly can still be difficult).Just keep an eye on your reserves and don't expand too fast. Always have an excess of food, and be prepared for disasters.			"

												This is definatly a game for those of you that enjoy building towns and cities. The game is unforgiving if you make poor decisions from the very beginning, so don't be disheartened if you don't immidiatly start to flourish. Every failed town is a lesson on what you're able to do at a given point. The biggest problem I've run into is that once you establish a good food source, you population expands....And continues to do so, exponetially. This obviously puts a bigger strain on food, meaning more production, meaning more people allocated to grow the food.			"

Banished KFVG ReviewThe GameBanished is a city building simulation game with resource and population management. The game is a set in a randomly generated map and you are given survivors who have been exiled from the mainland to fend for themselves.Pros Quick to understand gameplay Great AI Seasons make the game feel more alive along with the aging system Allows for different options making a town, such as having a fishing village or a town based on trade alone Steam Workshop mods and Dev modkit is constantly adding to the gameCons Game has no story or objectives and apart from different difficulties you will need to install mods to get true replayabilirt from the game  Options for specialized and private stockpiles without mods would be a welcome changeShould you buy it?In a word, yes. Banished, although lacking in objective based gameplay and having a low replayability value without dipping into the steam workshop, is a fantastic city builder which has you taking an interest in the indiviual lives of your settlers.I had a settler named Jenser, he left home and lived on his own at the tender age of 12, he became a lonely hunter out in the woods, getting venison and leather for my then small community, he lived from 12-48 all on his own until he finally got a lovely wife Linda, she was the town tailor. They had a child called Owen who later became a hunter, just like his Dad.These kinds of stories are ones I'm constantly seeing in this game and I'll continue to play it and hope for future updates to expand on the game and maybe even give it a grand objective.So yes, get Banished.

												Banished is a great game and makes you loose countless hours of your life in that game. But, as any game, has some bad things about it.Pros:- It was a dynamic RTS system- Graphics were pretty good with lots of foliage- Let you customize who goes where- Allowed you to ration food and supplies- Is challenging even on Easy- Watch your city grow- Mod support ( Adds new things and possibilities)- Never smooth sailing, Things do happen- LEARN HOW TO MANAGE THINGS!- Can change how fast time is going in the gameCons:- Not alot of content in building the settlement (Core Game with no mods)- Game is fun for several hours, then that's it. You maxed everything in about 2-3 hours.- Villagers sometimes don't go where you tell them to go (Ignore you)- Supplies sometimes get glitched (Cant move them from place to place)- Houses take way to much food to their house and won't share (Selfish people)I would recommend this game to anyone wanting to manage a settlement.

												A timesuck if there ever was one. I've spent days on one village and restarted others several times. There are quite a few guides online to give a few tips (like best sizes for farm and livestock pens) to make the game easier but it tends to boil down to waiting a while for your villagers to do things. For example, the school is important for better workers but it adds a few years onto actually having the workers. You don't interact much with them other then assigning jobs. You can set limits on food production, movement of goods and trading but most of that can be automated. It is very much a 'build this here, gather that there and work in this building' and let the villagers run amok type of game.If you enjoy city building then this game is definitely worth the $20 price. Still, there is nothing like watching a starving villager pick up food, only to walk a few paces and drop it then run between the food and the barn repeatedly until they die.			"

												This is a very solid singleplayer city-builder. I have not played many other city builders simply because the blocky graphics (who wants to build something if it's going to make their eyes hurt?), or way too intensive micromanaging turned me off.This game is simple. This game is easy. This game is elegant with a beautiful soundtrack. That is until a single fire ravages through your urban center destroying any sense of unity your village had. Then---DEATH SPIRAL. Death spirals are so intense, as you watch graveyards fill before your eyes and entire professions become void of workers. Pulling out of one is near impossible, but if you do it is an accomplishment worthy of song.There are however some drawbacks: 1. Gameplay is more or less managing a set of spreadsheets, drop down menus and building stuff to your best ability-then observing the outcome. 2.  Starving people will walk past barns and markets FILLED TO CAPACITY with food and starve to death on the way to their house, come on people grab a peach at the market and don't die.3. So many houses... In order to keep a population growing you constantly have to build houses leading to the before mentioned urban sprawl, eventual fire, disease, lucky tornado and/or food shortage leading to DEATH SPIRAL.4. Glitches: By scheduling to demolish and then canceling the demolish order graveyards are 'emptied' of bodies even though gravestones remain allowing infinite burials on one small patch of land (useful glitch but still a glitch), Livestock walk underwater between pens instead of taking roads, lag starts to intrude with populations over 1000 (gets bad around 1400) and Gatherers are incredibly OP compared to other starting food sources.5. Do What??? Once you have a town going you may feel a sense of emptiness at having 'conquered' the game and unless you are willing to go after the achievements that sense of pointlessness will remain. However the achievements for this game offer interesting challenges instead of the standard 'get-all-the-things' sort.So overall it is a good game but there is a steep learning curve and, unless you like to achievement hunt, limited replay value, but for all that it is an addictive game into which I have sunk dozens of hours and have a few more left in me.

Pros: A refreshing take on the city sim genreA fun challenge, difficult to masterLightweight game that works on my old laptop144hz supportSolid game, no bugs encounteredCons: No steam cloud support for savesThe game is hard to learn, I found myself googling a lotGraphics and sound are lackingThoughtsFirst time I ran Banished I was overwhelmed, my whole town died off, nothing worked right.  I came back to it months later and only fared slightly better.  I started hitting up Reddit everytime I ran into a problem and now I am starting to learn the game.  The game is brutally hard for me.  But that's sort of the point, the odds are stacked against your banished citizens.  This isn't Sim City where you just zone large swaths of land and things will largley sort themselves out to some degree; even if you do end up a simulation of Detroit.  In this game your whole town will die if you don't micromanage all the rescources.  But its very rewarding to have a stockpile of food and firewood ready for winter.  The graphics aren't anything to brag about - but on the flipside the game supports 144hz, it can also run on an old i5 dual core laptop, and it takes up less than 300mb of space.  The sound ins't great, but it gets the job done.  I didn't care for the constant rain, but the effect can be disabled.			"

												This game is an amazing medieval city sim builder. You will have fun, success and then failure. It is a fun and rewarding experience if you can pull off a successful town. That said though, I have had 3 villages that have had 300 citizens and almost 100 years in each one. When this happens there is not much more you can do after that except expand, and that is all you can do. This can get very repetitive and boring. I hope the developer ( and there is only one developer) has time to add more content for the end game. Putting that aside, Great Game.			"

												This game is majestic. It reminds me so much to my times of Age of Empires II but without the warfare or the medieval environment, just focusing on what I truly liked: survival, development and expansion. One of a kind. I love it.			"

												I absolutely love this game! Much more challenging than SimCity and you actually feel proud when things work. I have started 4 new games and all of them failed, because I didn't know exactly how to play it. When you first get a hang of it, you can make a 'civilization' go really far. One of the best games I have ever played. My rating: 11/10			"

												I have fallen in love with this game. It's a city builder for those who are looking for a challenge. Rather than the conventional city builder where you try to build an economic superpower in this game you have just one goal... to keep your population alive. This game is brutal and punishes mistakes like Sim City never would and despite the fact that the texture quality isn't amazing it still looks fantastic. Oh, and I believe it was made by just one guy.Definitely worth the £15 price-tag			"

												I very much enjoy Banished, it's a solid city-builder that doesn't get too complicated or bogged down in useless features. It lacks endgame content and can get a little stale if you stick to one city for too long, but I've found raising the difficuilty periodically makes it much more entertaining. Highly recommended.

												So, I really don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for this game, but here goes!I can give you 100 reasons why you should get this game, and only one why you shouldn't.If you're looking for a war/fighting game, move on. This game is a beautifully crafted true town builder, and everything I've ever wanted from a game like this.Think Age Of Empires, except when you've built your meticulously planned settlement you don't get a load of enemies coming and burning it all down. You can choose exactly where everything goes, and you really have to think about the lay-out and planning of your town to make it as effeciant and seamless as possible.I've been playing this since before all the workshop mods, and even then it was a great game. But now with the inclusion of user-created and dev created mods it's just a work of art. The crafting ladders are now massive, and you can happily run a small village or expand into a heavy working production town. You can choose to lay out your houses in beautiful hamlets, or build big and close together for the real medievil city feel.As you can see from my hours, which don't include the 150+ that for some reason vanished when I transferred my account some time ago, I have played this and loved every second of it. Taking your small band of villagers from a group of 20 to a booming town of 500 is amazing but challenging and it really keeps you on your toes for foward planning.Oh, and we can't forget the naming system. Probably the best thing about the entire game!TD;DR - Just get this game :)			"

												So addictive, you can play both active and passively depending on desire and skill level. You'll certainly fail the first few times but eventually you will have the whole map :)			"

												This game is a nice way to relax. That is if you manage to get through your first days, weeks or year. I find amusement in the horribly generated names the children get and ... Well, one of my first villagers died by falling off of a ladder after I built a Tavern. 10/10			"
