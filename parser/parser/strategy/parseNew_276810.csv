												I was torn on wether I wanted to put down a negative or positive recommendation. It's still kinda sad there's no neutral variant.The game has a solid foundation, and nails the atmosphere / Design a Warhammer Game like this should have. Also, to the Developers Credit, the game has gotten very far from the days back when it was just a Tutorial and some skirmishing (I bought it a long time ago in Early Access). The Warbands are varied, and developing characters and building your Warband is interesting. I wanted to get this stuff out of the way first, beefore I go into the bad traits.What holds Mordheim back massively in my opinion, and the main reason I cant reccomend it, is the sheer number of rough edges and weird design decisions, a lot of them taken not long before release. Let's start with the major ones:The Difficulty. A lot of people say the game is hard, unforgiving, challenging. In truth, it just has a steep learning curve, before turning into a failry easy game with some major random spikes in difficulty. Let's not mince words, the AI is stupid. Really, really stupid. This by itself would not be an issue, it's incredibly hard to design even a half decent AI for a system like this. The problem is the way the Dev's are trying to compensate for it. The game basically works with a handicap system. Enemy Ai Warbands will ALLWAYS be superior to yours. More hp, higher Stats etc. The Difficulty of a mission decides how high the difference in strength will be. So in Normal they are just a bit stronger, while in Deadly you are clearly fighting a superior foe, who will absolutely ruin your day in a fair fight.While this sounds unwinnable on paper, in practice, it's actually childishly easy to just set up fight at chokepoints, in buildings or just on Elevation, and then slowly drop the enemy one by one. As your Warband raises in Level, this becomes progressively easier, since your Guys actually become more and more decent at the specific thing you build them for. While the AI stays it's usual, dumb self. You will reach a point where everything but Brutal or Deadly seems like a waste of time. And even those are, as I said, just slightly harder as long as you play it safe.In short, the game will seem hard at first. Unfair even. But as soon as you get even a basic grasp of the mechanics, the AI and building your guys, it falls apart and becomes almost too easy.That is until you get hit by the RNG of course. There are quite a few mechanics implemented solely for the purpose of ruining your day, showering the AI with even more advantages, and reinforcing the ""Hardcore"" feeling the game likes so much.Firstly, there are ambushes. There is a chance (10% last I checked) on taking each mission, that you get an ambush Event. Basically the one doing the ambushing starts out with all his guys in a offensive Stance (Ambush for Melee, Overwatch for Ranged), while the one that got ambushed get's quite a few penalties (Less chance to hit, for example). As if that wasnt enough, the Deyploment is usualy set up in a way where the ambushers are set up very near or outright next to their enemies.It's completely possible, if your Warband is not built for high Initative, to get ambushed by a highspeed Skaven Warband and loose 1-3 guy before you even get to act ONCE.There is no strategy to this. There is no way for you to properly react to it when you get ambushed, beyond praying to Nuffle that you'll get lucky in that first turn. On the other hand, getting to ambush the AI basically means a free win, which feels cheap and unsatisfying.Then we have Demons. To give the game credit, they do not appear in early game and only on Brutal or above. But they add another, unnecessary, easily abused factor to the game. They are very strong. Having a ton of hp, a lot of attacks, and high damage. They usually home in on the first guy they see. So usually, it's actually fairly easy to wait for the AI to just run into them and then enjoy your free win. Ironically, they cannot climb. So just hiding up in a building and waiting until the victory screen pops up is a frequent thing. On the other hand, if you get unlucky in deyploment, running into one is almost certainly a death sentence. Don't get me wrong, you CAN kill them. But you will NOT be in shape for another fight, especially on Deadly.Next, we have the different Warbands, and how they're built. Chaos Warbands are nigh unplayable right now, due to random mutations. Imagine you buying a mutant. Imagine you get lucky and you get a blue bow early on. Great, I wanna build a ranged guy! Cool, he got clawed Feet on Level 1! Now he's faster! Then you hit Level 5. And his arm mutates. He can not use ranged weapons now. Oh you invested all his points into Ballistic Skill? Well too bad. Throw him out. Then you have melee guys who get a thousand eyes. Now they cant wear armor anymore! You built him for tanking? Well up yours and your silly tactics! Buy a new one!It's arbitary, there is no system to it, and it will frustrate you to the point where after the sixth time you had to throw out a high level guy, you're just not gonna play them anymore.Finally, and probably the ""least"" offensive, is the UI, loading screens, and bugs. Some of the information is hidden behind 3 different windows, and there is NO way to customize any of it. Everytime you wanna look up something, calculate your next move or just flat out inform yourself about the guys you're fighting, it involves annoying clicks, searching through 4 different menus until you finally find what you're looking for. Deployment does not allow you to jsut click on the spot on the map, you have to cycle trough each deployment point manually. Some maps have what feels like 50 deyploment points. Imagine how fun it is to cycle trough each with EACH of your guys. 10 man Warbands? The fun is here!There was also an announcer added with the release. The general announcer sounds like a random dude, let's call him Jeff, they pulled out of an office to announce EVERY BLODDY THING you do. Gotta collect 10 Wyrdstones? Don't worry, he will ""update"" you on it EVERYTIME you pick up one! The voice is not even cool, it's not a cool evil voice like you'd have in Dungeon Keeper, or War for the Overworld. It's just a boring, regular guy. You got the atmosphere down on the other stuff, why suddenly slack off here?Bugwise, it's a lot better than it was in earlier versions. But there are still random things that should not be acceptable in a full release. The ai will sometimes randomly engage and diesengage people it isn't supposed or get stuck (Usually on staircases). Some doorways and holes cant be entered from one side, but from the other side they can. The game feels like having rough edges, that should definetely have been fixed in EA before coming out proper.Now, if the above is looked at, changed, or adjusted, this game will get a big fat blue thumb from me RIGHT AWAY. The foundation is there, the game can and will be fun for you, if you can get past all that. But IF they fix it, it's gonna be even better. Fantastic even.			"

												NOTE: if you consider yourself as strictly casual player please read the last paragraphs and better pass on this one.This game should seriously be named City Of Slaanesh cause playing it feels like constantly cutting your wrists, or being kicked in the balls... but for some weird reason you quite enjoy that and want more.It's hard, it does not forgive mistakes but it actually feels really good when you acheve something.And don't look at all these posts complaining about the RNG (random number generator)... well, its random! Clue is in the name.There are few things that made me love Mordheim:+ Great warhammer feel, no knights in shining armours or single characters chopping hordes of your enemies in one strike. The world is grim, sad and constantly you lose something - your warriors became decapitated, weakend or start loosing their mind. Dark fantasy done right. + As for almost every warhammer game I've encountered so far audio is superb! Especially for skavens, but the narrator's voice - can't stand this guy. + Amazing customization, tons of skills and attributes to choose from, which gives lots of possibilities in developing warband members to your specific needs. + Mordheim as a battleground has been created perfectly. It certainly gives good WH feel and offers various tactical advantages/disadvantages, traps, random loot etc. Sadly that most of the time you cannot fully use it because AI will blindly rush you head on. +DLC's came out after a while and are not ripped away parts of an original game, or some overpowered aspects for multiplayer which seems to be rarity in these days, lol. It's just the additional content for players that like the game and want to have something extra - nothing fancy, nothing too bad. Although all i just said I can understand many people disliking the game, here are the reasons why:- AI is terrible, but on the other hand I understand that you cannot simply create challenging AI for a game like this (which highly depend on tactical gameplay) without giving it some advantages. Yet still it sometimes makes me flip the table when your opponent is simply rushing you straight forward, when there's whole crapload of wyrdstone winking at you... bloody irritating. - There's no save button, one huge mistake or series of bad luck can sometimes cost you the whole game (imagine spending 40+ hrs on a single warband). - It will cost you many warbands to actually learn how to properly play the came and counter your enemies, but when you do it becomes fairly easy, if RNG wont strike you in the face that is. All that said, there's one big issue I have with the game and that's your progress in the single player campaign. The thing is, if you consider yourself as a casual player you wont even probably make it through chapter one. Why? Mordheim is reaaaaaaaly time consuming, and without any way to somehow secure your progress an unfortunate stike of RNG can end your journey easly. If you want to play this game from time to time, to kill boredom and chill out please, please run away and never look back. I'm pretty damn stoic when it gets to videogames but this one... oh, it made me scream, belive me. In my opinion there should be an option for strictly casual players to have their ONLY single player restricted warband that you can save ... dunno... at least every at chapter you go through. Not having that simply takes away a lot of potential customers from the game, so why not allowing them to enjoy it and give the devs sum more $$?  Thanks for reading :)			"

												Hi all,I will present this review in different segments depending on if you are:1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)3) everyone else (EE)First the TL:DR version:1) a GW fanatic and preferably familiar with the Mordheim Tabletop game. (GWF)You have been waiting for this game since the first time you critted the Ogre mercenary. It's here. Go buy it. Oh wait, its not a straight conversion like BB? Hmmm. Well then have a look below to see if this adaptation is for you. Yes there are some bugs and yes the AI is not great, but this is meant to be played vs friends anyway right?2) A general fantasy/tactics lover (GFTL)If you like levelling units, creating a unique warband in a medievalesque, semifantasy setting where death lurks around every corner, where every conseqence is final (no re-doing ANYTHING) in a turnbased environment that you can play vs the AI or vs a friend online, then this might be for you. If you do not like permadeath and rather be able to reload a battle until you get that perfect win: stay away. 3) everyone else (EE)Well actually see 2. You wouldnt be reading this if you were looking for a great footballmanager now would you? :)See below for a more detailed description. Use ctrl-f to quickly find your part. 1) If you are  a GW fanatic and familiar with the TT version. (GWF)I'm betting you have been waiting for a vid adaptation of TT for ages. Well here it is. So go get it. I'm thinking for you the most important question is: Is this Mordheim?The answer is both yes and no. (isnt that great ;) ). No because this is NOT a straight conversion (Like BB for instance). Some mechanics have been changed, see below. Yes because this is indeed the city of Mordheim and how you always wanted it to look. Yes, because in essence its about levelling units, gathering wyrdstone.Yes because its unforgiving, no turning back, no savescumming, no redo if you pick a wrong skill. This can be frustrating but never more so than in the original because there progression was basically random (yeah! +1 Initiative for my skaven assassin, woot woot! Not).So whats different, whats the same?Main similarities are:-turnbased mechanic-injuries and levelling-climbing-charging-critical hits-wyrdstone gathering/selling-most weapons of the TT are in-and some skills. -there is RNG ('dicerolls')-psychologyMain differences:-the turn-bases system is unit-, not warband based (so units alternate turns according to an initiative ladder instead of complete warbands ).-the skillset has been changed with many new skills, some familiar but many that are new.-there are a lot more stats which have a lot higher thresholds. -dodge is no longer a 'skill' (like sidestep) but together with parry, overwatch and ambush are selectable stances that finish a units turn (and activate when a unit is in range or attacks). -warband rosters have been changed around a little to make them more similar.-stuff like fear and terror behave differently from the TT etc. -There is an action pool for movement and reloading and such, another one for attacks and spells and such.-There are no wounds but each unit has a health bar, and thus units damage for health not wounds. -Deployment is not the same as in the TT as the nodes you can deploy in a are predefined. You might not like all the changes they've made to the game. For me, in the end, the similarities outweight the changes which I see as an attempt to recreate the game for a vritual medium. Again, if you like GW and like(d) the TT this is a must-have. Watch some lets-plays if you are unsure about the new ruleset. 2) If you are a general fantasy/tactics lover. (GFTL)Then you don't really care much about the comparison with the TT because you never played it. You know the GW universe perhaps but have never been into their miniature games. However, if you do like fantasy stuff then the setting of this game will appeal to you. There are ratmen, there are horribly mutated creatures, regular mercs, and some crazy nuns with hammers. Sounds good? Read on. This game is basically an X-com type game. Units take turns on a map, that represents a district in the city of Mordheim, a Medievalesque city that has been hit by a meteor so its somewhat in shambles. You and your band are there to gather fragments of this meteor (called wyrdstone). Since the meteor hit however the City of Mordheim has become somewhat unpleasant. So what are some features of this game? -procedural maps that retain their basic layout (street here, square there) but are different each time, (hey last time this building was still standing now its gone/missing the topfloor/completely ruined etc.) creating new routes, blockades etc. each time you play. -customizable units (appearance and playstyle).-many many skills. -units progress and become better or get hurt and die. -non-obligatory story missions -four warbands with distinct playing style. UPDATE: with the current DLC there are six warbands, the two new warbands will also appear as adversaries without the DLC. There are also four new heroes, two for each side: Order and Destruction. -MP play possible (but limited in its options, i.e. no matchmaking or rankings or whatever). -variety of weapons, spells and units to equip, level and master. -Difficulty: I think its important to note this from the get-go. This game is not easy, esp if you are a newcomer. RNG mechanics seem to favor the AI (as they always seem to do :) ), your captain can go Out of Action (OOA) during the match by failing three 80% parry chances and end up post-match losing his leg, being megalomaniac or worse, plain dead. As in terminaly, no turning back, no re-loading dead. And he just turned level 6. And now he's dead. Get the picture? If you are hoping for an easy game stay away, because you will ragequit so often you'll develop haemerroids. The next point ties in with this. -alt-f4 is punished. If you, for any reason abort the game, the engine will treat it as if you ran away from battle and all your units are considered to have gone OOA. This means they all get to roll for injuries. This could mean your warband is crippled and its startover time. Is there no save? Well offc there is. But you can't reload it to 're-do' something. If you mess up and charge a deamon with your level 1 youngblood and he's dead, he's dead, and he stays dead. No turning back. So let's say that you like all this? Anything else? Well yes. While the game might be difficult because of how it works, the AI is not very, you know, smart. In fact, given some practice, you will be able to defeat the AI on the hardest missions unless you are unlucky with your deployment. On higher difficulty missions the AI gets a health and damage boost and that goes a long way to increase the challenge. But if you are looking for a really hardcore challenge in tactical terms you need to play online because the AI will not deliver.Also, the story missions can be a bit of a chore sometimes, but hey, they are optional, so the game doesn't force these on you. But still, even with an AI thats not perfect (and let's face it, in which complicated game is the AI ever perfect? Total War, I'm looking at you, you money-receiving, morale boosted, stackbuilding, mapsitting incompentent!) this game is many hours of absolute fun. The maps are beautifully created with lots of attention to detail and winning matches can be exhilarating. Especially online where they are butt-clinching, sweat-drenching affairs.			"

Early Access Review
								For anyone looking for a faithful replication of the boardgame: keep waiting/look elsewhere. While the graphics are nice (they have done a good job of making it LOOK like Mordheim), the gameplay is tied to a clunky UI and control scheme that the developers are very attached to and they won't consider changing.The game is clearly built around a controller being the primary input device: in-game menus and the UI cannot be controlled via mouse cursor but instead use a right and left click for up/down/forward/back through UI elements. There are no mouseovers and feedback from the UI is very poor as a result.Each unit plays their turn in initiative order. All unit control is done from a 3rd person/over the shoulder perspective when it is that unit's ""turn"", using WASD/Controller to move the unit in realtime around the point at which they started, up to a certain distance depending on that unit's stats.There is a tactical overview map which can be brought up. Unfortunately, due to some fairly arbitrary reasoning: you cannot control any of your units from this tactical view like in other strategy games. I feel as a result the game suffers quite a lot. The developers have confirmed that this will not change.The choice of inital mercenary bands is disappointing. All empire mercs are now lumped into a single faction (no Reiklanders, Middenheimers or Marienburgers).I am very disappointed I bought this game, and would urge anyone considering a purchase to wait for a demo to be available to be able to give the game a try before fronting up any cash.Update:To be fair to the devs, since I wrote this review they have started a thread asking for ideas to improve the mouse and keyboard controls: http://steamcommunity.com/app/276810/discussions/3/606068060820913464/Unless some really dramatic changes come out of this however, I don't see my opinion changing.

Early Access Review
								Mordheim City of the Damned was originally a tabletop game by Games Workshop that combined tabletop strategy with RPG elements. For those who neither know mordheim nor tabletop games:It's a turnbased strategy game where you command a gang of heroes and henchmen exploring the ruins of a town destroyed by the forces of chaos searching for treasures. Since you aren't the only with that great idea you will meet other gangs there ... meeting in that case means you fight them. The gameplay can be compared with other turnbased strat games like X-Com but your warband (your gang) is a bit greater. Since there are no custom warbands yet I can't tell what exatcly sizes are possible. In the original boardgame most warbands have a maximum size of 15 and only skaven warbands (mutand rat people) can recruit up to 20 bandmembers.In this early acces state these RPG elements (like building your own warband, recruit new ""soldiers"", buy equipment, search the city for loot and treasures after battle, learn the fate of your wounded bandmembers or level up your bandmembers) aren't implemented yet. But you get an impression on how the gameplay is working and in my opinion it plays out well. Further there are some enhancements compared to the boardgame: for example vision and spotting system.While playing the boardgame you always know where your opponents troops are. Thats changed here and adds a great immersive feeling to the game ( threats could lure behind every corner in the narrow gaps of Mordheim) and of course it opens new possibilitys for ambush tactics.The controls and gameplay are very simple and even playable with a controllerpad if you want to play it on your TV from the sofa. Although most of the rather complex strategy elements of the boardgame aren't missing here. (Like several stat checks on moral, ini, etc.. Great for ppl. like me who are cursed with misfortune as soon as they grab a dice, all random events are calculated automatically. )So positioning and awareness of your strenghts and weaknesses are as important as they were in the original boardgame.Fight itself is also calculated based on stats. Hits have a chance to fail, victim has a chance to parry/dodge, damage varies and has a chance to crit and so on. But fights take longer as they do in the boardgame since combatants have more HP. In the boardgame fighters (espeacially henchmen) happen to be taken out of action extremly fast. Often a succesful hit + damagecheck is enough to take em out (most fighters haven't more then 1 HP). The ""more HP system"" of the PC version pleases me more. On the other hand, the crit system is a bit booring (as far as I saw it). Crits just do extra damage and once I stunned an opponent with a melee crit. Crits in the boardgame are more funny since crazy **** is about to happen after a crit :) I'm missing that a bit here.Graphics are quite good and events like climbing/jumping/fighting are shown like a little movie (like in X-Com)The atmosphere is great so far.Only con from my side so far:- only 4 Warbands ""races"" are planned so far ( Human Mercs, Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar and Cult of the Possessed ) missing are Witchhunters and Undead that are also available in the standart boardgame rules without any expansions.I could imagine that they will probably be added as DLCs but I hope they don't sell em for ripoff prices. With all the boardgame expansions the variety of different Warbands is nearly endless.I really think this game has a lot of potential and I really hope they implement all the things that made the boardgame great and don't screw it up. TLDR:No RPG Warband content yet. Combat gameplay only.Pro:- Great combat gameplay so far- Boardgame mechanics are represented well - Good atmosphere- Nice graphics- At some points better then the boardgame ( for example real ambushes since the opponent can't see your troops all the time... technical impossible with a boardgame ) Con:- Only 4 Warbands planned so far, original boardgame version had 6 (+ X with expansions)- Critical hit system was more exiting in the boardgame. As far as I saw it here it was more damage + chance to stun.So far great potential (it even made me write a review ... that happened never before). Curious to see the RPG elements coming that made the boardgame great and special.PS: Sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language.			"

												If you're considering this game, do yourself a favor and get it.  This is what a Games Workshop adaptation done right looks like!With more than 70 hours of play time under my belt, I'm still just as captivated by the game.  The tactical combat is serious fun and easy to pick up but just keeps getting deeper as you learn and progress.  The persistant warband progression features a huge skill tree to customize your units and both permadeath and persistant injury to keep things tense.  The four factions (Human Mercenaries, Skaven, Chaos and Sisters of Battle) are nicely varied, asymetrical and can be sucessfully adapted to different tactics.  Battles are filled with meaningfull tactical decisions where positioning, timing, equipment and skill set all matter.  Each trip back into Mordheim still feels like an exciting, high stakes risk.   ---Original Early Access Review Below---Having just finished my first Early Access skirmish, the first thing I wanted to do was come here and report that it's exactly what I was hoping for.   The game systems remind me of my favorite things from Firaxis XCOM and Valkyria Chronicles, and it's easy to tell the developers care about the GW source material.  The first Early Access version only includes a small slice of the game, but it's already possible to play a fun skirmish, and there is a ton of potential here once persistance and progression are added. Three thumbs up (Three? Blame Tzeentch..) for a good looking, faithful, and most importantly, fun Mordheim adaption.			"

												This game is about carefully grinding up your warband and honing them into perfect killing machines over many, many hours then having all of your heroes get permanant wounds from a single fight because you missed 5 95% shots in a row and the enemy critted on every single swing they took.  They are then replaced by level 0 punks who are immediately targeted by the enemy and killed in two shots in every fight making it impossible to level them up again.  It is highly repetetive and slow.  The AI does not change it's strategy in any way, ever.  Whatever the goal of the mission they will rush you and try to inflict permentant wounds without any other goal or concern for its own troops because it's squads are randomly generated and not presistant.  Occasionally it is exciting, but it is the excitement of gambling, only good when you happen to beat the odds.There is a good game here, buried under bad decisions based on apeing the boardgame and making things as grindy as humanly possible and providing no 'endgame' to that grind besides killing your units so you can start over again at a significant disadvantage.  ""but the point is to fail and then start over!""  if so, it is poorly designed because starting over is a vastly painful waste of time.			"

												love the premise love the fact the game is unforgiving and hard, which based on lore it is supposed to be.however what is not acceptable is how ♥♥♥♥ing dumb it is that winning feels still feels like losing becuase you lost out on all the valuable stuff that was just lying next to your guys when the final blow was struck.i found a fairly nice crossbow, the guy carrying it got K.O'ed turn before victory. He was next to 4 of his own forces so youd think they might have picked it up when they left victorious.  but nah that♥♥♥♥♥♥ait worth the time.  neither is apparntly looting the area when the entire objective of your little possy turning up was to loot the area but nah, we killed some dudes lets go home without picking up any of the♥♥♥♥♥♥it is a point of bad game design when you have to rely on arbitary loot mechanics to make the game harder. there is no reason to leave items be it warpstone or crossbows ever given. nor can i think of any practical reason. it forces you to make dumb decisions like prolonging fights just to loot stuff: it just feels so detached and it compleatly ♥♥♥♥s with immersion. which is a shame becuase if not for thouse aspects the game would be extrodinarly fun and rewarding to play.  instead it just feels like it slaps you in the face if you win or lose.

												I know the feelings about this game are very mixed but as far as I am concerned it is perfect. The difficulty is the kind of unfair that requires you to think about every move you make, even one attempt to cut a corner and you're punished severely.I've played a fair bit now and from the negative reviews I've read alot of people seem to dislike the hardcore nature of the game. I can appreciate why but I don't think anyone was ever mislead about how difficult this game would be or the penalties your units face for going out of action in a mission. This is almost a roguelike RTS, the best thing about this game is that you use the environment as part of your strategy to out manouvre the far superior enemy, lock them down and beat them into nothing.At the start of this game everything is a struggle, in the middle of this game everything is a struggle, and the nature of this game is that you will eventually lose. At the beginning you will be strapped for resources and struggle to meet demands, but after a while you will be strong enough to use key warband members to cover small areas while your fastest guys rush to get what you need before diving back into the fight. You do slowly build up breathing room as you go on but its only ever really enough to cover the losses you suffer since the further you get in the more devastating each loss gets.To close I will tell you the story of one of my favourite troops, the troop that really got me attached to the game. This is the story of Stumpy. Stumpy wasn't always called Stumpy he used to be called Lushkin Var but that only lasted a few weeks. Stumpy was just a normal Verminkin with a simple goal, not die horribly anytime soon or suffer an injury that leads to a name change. Sadly this is Mordheim so that was always going to be based on a wing and a prayer. Stumpy served the warband well, he was fast and efficient and gathered much wardstone but one day he got carried way and over extended against the dreaded Possessed and was cornered by two Brethren and a Chaos Spawn. Stumpy was mangled before he could even fight back and although the battle was won by his side Stumpy lost an arm and from that point on he was Stumpy. Stumpy used to be a halberd user, all his stats and skills were based on this and at level 7 at the point of losing his arm this effectively made him not as good as he could be, (I know alot of people like to call a troop useless at this point but the truth is they are not useless, they are just not optimal which is not the same thing, and the fact that makes you give up on your troops is appalling its your fault they end up this way anyway). So the newly made Stumpy picked up a sword and bided his time till he recovered from his injuries.Once Stumpy got back on the battle field he was kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names, with 20% less body for the enemy to hit he suddenly had a massive advantage in terms of 20% more dodge. He'd take anyone on head to head with almost a suicidal recklessness, alas after months and months of being the back bone of my fighting force he eventually got cornered in an abandonned building by the dreaded Possessed heavy line up. Unable to beat them in a fair fight he tried to run out but the only exit to the building available to him was the attic, and to get to it a climb was required. With only one arm Stumpy was trapped, he could not escape and had only one choice, fight for his life. Stumpy did the only thing he could and stood at the top of the stairs forcing the enemy to engage him one at a time.Stumpy fought hard and took out two of the dreaded possessed before the unthinkable happened, a Dark Soul jumped into the room through the attic Stumpy had hoped to escape from with an enemy on both sides and not chance to disengage of room to flee just to buy time Stumpy failed his All Alone Test on the next turn. He failed it soo badly he tried to flee and the first free attack from the Dark Soul stunned him,  he was a sitting duck and because of this he was taken out.As the rest of my warband mopped the enemies up and broke through the ones stopping them from helping Stumpy the battled ended with us winning, but sadly Stumpy suffered the dreaded permanent death. He was gone forever, I was devastated, like I had to make a cup of tea and watch TV for a bit. It was awful but life is cheap, and I got over it before my tea got cold and moved my focus to my Black Skaven duo, the gruesome twosome - Belle and Sebastion. But thats another story. In summary this game is hard, this game is frustrating, this game needs patience and this game is not to be played for hours and hours every day. This game is slow and best played as a mission a night, after work and before bed its a great unwinder after a long day of a 2 hour commute and a 10 hour shift. The atmosphere of the environment and its aesthetic are sublime. It does have long wait times but so what, start loading and go make a cup of tea, or pair your socks or some other thing that takes a few minutes that you always put off. Its worth it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THIS EDIT WAS ADDED 6th February 2016Since the latest patch and the introduction of two new hired swords in DLC the game has improved significantly over some of its initial flaws held against it in alot of other reviews, the most major improvement of which is the loading times have been drastically reduced. I am not impressed with this however as I no longer have enough time to make a cup of tea while its loading.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a lazy, lazy man. I tend not to write reviews. I tend not to take out the rubbish (trash) and I often find myself tutting at the sound of my girlfriend cleaning up around me. I tell you this to put my recommendation into perspective. It would be spiteful of me not to recommend this game. This is one of my favourite games. I watched it, I waited for it, and, finally, I bought it. I regret not a coin. This game is not even finished, and it's already awesome. I hope and pray that I don't tempt fate (or encourage the devs to get lazy) but I have very high hopes for the final release, and I'm even looking forward to the inevitable DLC (a concept I loathe to the core). As for what it is, it's a turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. The customization is what makes it. I love games like Xcom, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem but I have always wanted a game where the team really felt like my own. This is the closest yet. Let me demonstrate how. I use a player on my near perfect team who is missing an eye and a leg, sometimes gets confused and fails to acts, and is so battered that he can only move half as far as his teammates. Why do I hamper myself with Glen Hobble? Because he has been with me since day one. He picked up his injuries in the line of duty and he lost a leg saving his captain. I care more about Glen Hobble than my own good-for-nothing son. Buy this game. Help the community to make it even better. Do it for me. Do it for Glen.			"

												When reading reviews for this game pay attention to the hours played. The people complaing about the AI being too hard or the RNG throwing off the game are mostly all still playing with low level characters. When you first start out, your soldiers are lvl 0. Of course they will miss alot and get their♥♥♥♥♥kicked. If you keep them in groups they will support eachother and you'll level up pretty quick. I have a lvl 6 soldier who can kill enemies in one or two turns at the most... just a few levels prior he was getting his butt kicked almost every battle. About the game itself... if you like turn based games like X Com, or you D&D, or X Wing Miniatures... and want a fantasy theme... this game is great. I enjoy it a lot. The graphics are cool... the environments have a nice mood and feel. The battles are very strategic and challenging. The game doesn't allow do overs so you have to play with caution if you want to keep your soldiers around for many more battles. I'm having a blast playing it and think its worth the money. Glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of gams.			"

												I recommend this game but ONLY if you can live with:-> Ironman Mode(Hardcore + no voluntary saves)-> RNG Infestation-> Moderate+ difficulty(it starts very high and drops from there)It has:-> Beautiful artwork(not to be confused with graphics which are just passable)-> Fun gameplay(if you are into xcom type games{I'm not})-> Nice character building-> One of the best IPs around(Warhammer Fantasy)-> Awesome devs(things they do put AAA devs to shame)Unfortunately, I can't play this because it causes nervous breakdown(plus I'm not into this kind of game and care only about WHFB part of it), but that doesn't mean I'll be unfair and not recommend it. Because, after all, this game truly is a gem in the rough.Good hunting in Mordheim! Have fun!			"

								The game feels like your playing the table top.The mechanics are nice even at this stage and the maps are large and interesting, and they are very detailed with you being able to hide characters inside houses and even jump from Z level to Z level.Right now you can only play preset war bands but in the coming weeks you are going to be able to design your own and have a persistent warband you fight with through multiplayer and single player. It is well worth the buy but if you are undecided i would wait until the warband management section of the game is released, in my opinion this is where the most fun is going to be keeping your guys alive.

												This is a tough one. I've given it a fair crack and there's a lot I like about the game, but in the end I've decided that the negatives outweigh the positives.It has the worst case of RNG♥♥♥♥♥hattery I've yet encountered. It makes bloodbowl look even handed and fair.Routinely expect to rack up failure after failure at apparently simple tasks. (Writing this, I have just failed 13 sequential attempts to climb a wall that apparently had a 67% chance of success). It's also common place for you to miss a swing at an almost dead opponent who promptly turns around and kills your hero, while tzeentch strikes down your spellcasters at random. There's not enough men in a warband to compensate for these failures, so each battle quickly becomes incredibly frustrating and a few bad luck failures in a row cost you the battle and theres nothing you can do about it.Crappy map work with lots of inexplicable cant-go-there spots.Bugs. Many and various bugs. Ranging from graphical glitches and some twitchy camera work to it being completely random whether or not your guy in ambush stance actually attacks people moving into his range. Also I'm damned if I can figure out what conditions you have to satisy to make ""charge"" an option. Sometimes its' there, sometimes its not.Gameplay is slow and drawn out. I've played for about 15 hours or so and only completed 1 story mission. Exciting it is not.Battles have optional objectives which are intended to shake things up, however the moment you come into contact with the enemy you quickly become tied into a series of small fights and the optional objectives are forgotten. Since the enemy will rout and the battle ends as soon as more than 2-3 guys go down you never get a chance to go back to them.The RPG elements dont appear to have much affect on the gameplay. None of the skills you can learn are really significant, most add a couple of % to a few RNG tests which, as previously stated, are utter bolloks anyway. Certainly they're massively outweighed by the effects of injuries.Obscenely long loading times. I mean it. Go get a drink and do something else while the levels load.			"

												Despite thoroughly enjoying Mordheim, I'm finding myself cautious about recommending it. The reason for this is simple - Mordheim is not a game that will appeal to everyone. It is not casual, it is not forgiving, and it is not polished to the standards of a AAA game. That being said, what you do get is a very solid turn-based strategy with RPG character development. Its gameplay is well thought through, and once you get into it, it is very hard to stop playing. The four starting races are reasonably well balanced, and differ enough to give each a unique feel (I struggle with the Skaven, but their play style doesn't really suit me).At the core of the love/hate reactions is the fact that Mordheim is a sadistic mistress. It is mercilessly difficult, especially at first, but even once you get familiar with it then a single moment of carelessness, cockiness or overconfidence will end horribly. Maastering the game relies on absolute concentration, and contingencies for every possibility. If you don't master the steep learning curve, you will die. If you're too cautious, you'll run out of money and die. If you're too greedy, you'll die. If you don't prepare in advance for the deaths of your best heroes, you will die. You get the idea. The game autosaves after every action - no do-overs or loading after a disaster. Your fallen warriors will suffer persistant injuries or perma-death, and a single mis-step can mean the end for even the most veteran of warriors. Some complain about that the RNG is stacked against them, but I've generally found it fair - if you're leaving your plan in the hands of luck then it's not a very good plan!If any of the above put you off, then Mordheim is probably not the game for you. If you're still reading then you can probably buy with confidence. The game is pretty well made for the ambitious scope and small developer, though a few minor niggles leave it feeling a little rough around the edges. Customisation options are a little limited, so you'll probably be stuck with some very similar looking troops in larger warbands, but at least equipment shows up on the character. The AI pathfinding is sometimes a little wonky, but you'll be glad for every time the computer gets their Rat Ogre stuck in a doorway. Occasionally a piece of terrain will unexpectedly be a little bigger than it appears and block a shot or charge, but you're given considerable freedom to undo and redo your movement until you're happy with it. Very small complaints in the grand scheme of things.So, a qualified recommendation for a game I personally greatly enjoyed. If you like turn-based strategy and aren't put off by a challenge (or by your favourite hero getting wiped out by a tiny miscalculation) then you'll likely find Mordheim a fun and rewarding experience. If not, well, probably best to give it a miss.			"

 I'm having fun* playing this game, so I'm going to reccomend it HOWEVER! this is possibly the most unintuitive game ever so I'm going to include a small guide on how to have fun* playing it.*DISCLAIMER: fun is a completely subjective experience. The author cannot ensure that you will have fun. In fact equal parts stress and fun are to be expected. If you do not have fun playing this game try going for a bike ride or playing skippy-rope.Firstly, a concept that might be familliar to some: Winning isn't always good! If you've played Darkest Dungeon, you'll already know this, but if you haven't bare this in mind. In this game there is winning and there is  winning . There is ""killing the enemy team with minimal casualties, collecting plenty of precious green-crack (wyrdstone) and completing all of the objectives"" winning. And then there is ""half of my warband that I spent thousands of gold on died but it's ok because the narrator told me I did good in the loading screen"" winning. Now people might tell you it's the hideous AI that cause the difference, but I've found that every time the latter has happened to me it's because I was too greedy. Too greedy for that sweet green crack.That leads to the second tip on how to have funᵗᵐ Don't be too greedy! Actually I should rephrase this. Don't get upset if all your dudes die when you're greedy! Being greedy is pretty fun in this game, so I'm not gonna tell you to refrain yourself from scrounging up enough green crack as possile. But be warned - this is the primarily way your warband will die. You will have just won a mission pretty convincingly. You'll be assursed of your skill as a masterful tactician and may even be convinced that Sun Tzu himself would have been proud of your most gracious dispray. You'll start deploying for the next mission:""yeeeeah, I'm sure I can be spread that thin"" you'll tell yourself, ""I'll just make a rush for the wyrdstone then regroup my dudes!!"" And then two turns later all your heroes will be surrounded whilst your fat little henchmen try and scramble to help them, plodding slowly accross the map before deciding ♥♥♥♥ it, it's not worth it, and surrendering half way. This how is my wizard became a blind psychopath who can barely use magic anymore. I still keep him around, though I'm not quite sure why. Now for some guidance on the more unintuitive points: The loot system is a little bit ♥♥♥♥ed Okay, so apparently a mercenary is unable to throw 5 gold pennies on the floor in order to pick up a piece of ripe green crack rock worth around 100 gold. The loot system in this game can be pretty frustrating, but once you get used to it, it definitely adds to the flavour. You cannot swap items unless there is space in what you are looting, which means you can't pick up any green crack if you're inventory is full. This is something that annoyed me at the start of the game as you just want to pick up all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you can and then not being able to swap items for far more valuable wyrdstone is frustrating. But later on you realise it adds more to the game. You have to be careful with what you loot and decide early on who you're pack ♥♥♥♥♥es will be so you can have them sup from the pap of strength.This also applies to extra mission objectives. If you win a mission by killing someone - guess what? You can't loot their corpse! This doesn't really make a lot of sense and it makes extra objectives a lot more difficult, but rightly so really - they give you pretty hefty rewards. If you have a bounty mission you want*(*optional being the key word here) to complete you have to try not to win too fast so you can kill and collect the bounties before the games over. your dudes are pretty fat, be careful where you put them! Ocassionally you will accidentally place your buddy a little bit too centred in a tight pass. Ocasionally this will block 4/5 of your buddies/guys from getting where they need to go. Ocasionally this will cost you a mission as half your warband sit there waiting for your buddy to get his fat♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the way. You may also end up getting your favourite hero trapped in a corner and brutally murdered by an enemy hero because you thought a hard difficulty mission wouldn't be that bad and you assumed there was space to flee.That brings us to the next point: Only do normal missions!..  ...at firstStarting out with a warband be very wary about doing missions other than normal ones. Your first warband is like a newborn babe. It is very fragile and very precious to you. Attempting a Hard or Brutal mission is like trying to feed your newborn baby a rare steak when it's only just started teething. Only start with harder level missions once you have some levels under your belt and/or you start to understand how the AI works. When you have a more developed warband they can be more fun, but don't be surprised if something goes wrong and you're favourite hero dies.  RNG in this game is RNG ""REAL ♥♥♥♥ING OBVIOUS MAN""Not so much. There is RNG and there is  RNG . You won't find any PDR handholding here like in dota 2 or wow or most other mainstream titles for that matter. Some people seem to claim that the RNG in this game is fasle and the actual percentages for completing actions is lower than what's listed but this seems like BS and I can't see any reason for the devs to do this.From my perspective the RNG in this game seems exactly that - random. You'll have moments where your dude will miss 2 attacks in a row that had a 86% chance to hit, but you'll also have moments when all 3 of your marksmen will manage 40% chance shots into combat in a row and save your hero from getting his face mushed into putty. Also, failing acrobatics tests are both frustrating and hilarious. Yes, my leader did just spent half his turn trying to scramble up a small ledge, losing half his hp and then giving up, yours was busy collecting green crack? Well done.  Pick up this game if: you like other masochistic titles like Dark Souls or Darkest Dungeonyou like watching men in tights trying to scramble up wallsyou like watching people kill themselves by trying to be wizardsyou like watching mutants slap people in the headyou are catholic/ like nunsyou fantasize about colonies of rat people living in the sewers under your city/ townFor the best dramatic effect I suggest you start the game with Reikland Mercenaries, take mostly marksmen for your henchmen, and give everyone a gun and an American WW2 name.

												- Update - Since the game has now been released and the game developers have reminded me of the title, I figured i'd update this review for anyone reading it in the future. I have to say that the game devs have impressed me with their attention to the community, despite some of the issues remaining (see below for original early access review) it has improved a lot. I'd still say that if you're only looking at the game because of the title, you will likely be disappointed. The style of game is not the same as the tabletop original. It plays better than it did in early access, a lot of it has been fleshed out now. And the XP/progression and customization has been added rather well. I haven't played all that much since release but it seems that warband progression increases the overall difficulty of every single battle available, so that progression seems to be offset by how much the fights increase. Rather than giving easier options for lower rewards, everything just gets harder based solely on your warband score. So you can min/max it, or just keep disbanding experienced troops to lower that score and farm. Which goes against the purpose a bit if they were aiming to avoid people grinding against easier opponents. It just removes a choice of play. Again, this is based mostly on the community posts I've read and the limited time i've put into the game since release. I'm still wary that this game will be yet another DLC heavy game, and being one of those who find that to be very anti consumer it's another black mark. The existing 4 warbands seem fairly fleshed out, not exactly balanced yet nor true to the source but each seems fun to play. Tl;Dr - I would still have not purchased this back in early access if I could go back, but if it was on a sale I'd give it a look. Maybe watch the progress for a while if you're unsure, I doubt it's finished yet despite being released.-Original Review-Stay away from it for now. After pre-order it MIGHT be worthwhile, who knows..Firstly this is coming from a fan of Mordheim, the tabletop game. A lot of my issues with the game are solely down to how much they've deviated from it, as the only reason I even looked at this game is because of the name.Does it play well on PC? Barely. It feels like a console port.There's currently no XP/progression/customization. This WILL be in the released version, but how well they manage it is in question..4 initial warbands promised, this screams a warning of a DLC heavy game. As well as minimal customization. But are those warbands accurate to the tabletop warbands? So far, not at all. The game's being balanced around equal sized warbands, and as they've included skaven as one of the first released this becomes an issue. Skaven were always meant to be weaker in equal numbers, but they had a significant number and mobility advantage. That's gone. The humans have been merged into one, and been stripped of any actual character. They're just generic humans now.1-2 Knockdown, 3-4 Stunned, 5-6 Out of Action? Nope. Hitpoints, when that gets to 0 it's more than likely out of action.Armour saves to shrug off all damage? Nope. Very small damage reduction.The only positives I can think of are that finally someone's making a mordheim game, even if it is just in name and theme rather than content.. The graphics are pretty damned good so far, but not that great compared to other games that are currently out. The third person perspective's an interesting concept, but so far it's just been a bit of a poor gimmick rather than something that actually benefits the game.I really hope they take a few steps back and recreate the game in a closer manner to the blood bowl PC game. They're clearly going after the fanbase of the tabletop game, and this game really doesn't feel anywhere near to the tabletop version. Hopefully this doesn't end up another game that I regret pre ordering, my inner fanboy (mordheim was my favourite games workshop game) and hype swayed my hand and now I'm looking at it a bit clearer I shouldn't of risked it.

												To start with, lets establish something: Im a Mordheim nut. Before there was any information about this game really beyond ""it sort of exists, a bit..."" I pre-ordered it. And i've never stopped regreting the decision.And it was a mess. The maps were badly designed, the navmeshes were buggy as hell so targeting was a total crapshoot and the stat system was hilariously complex and arcane. But that's early access for you.Unfortunately, its not much better in full release.To start with, if you're expecting a faithful recreation of the tabletop game a la Blood Bowl - forget it. This is not that. It sort of limply gestures in Mordheim's direction, but its an affectation at best.The core of the game revolves around fairly repetitive missions in which your little band of warriors will be scattered around some ruins. These ruins are populated by defined points at which you can climb and descend, knee high walls WILL irrevocably impede your process and no, you cannot climb out of a ground floor window or push open a ruined door.So far so forgivable.The issue is that the AI is stupid, but the game is enough of a general crapshoot that it hardly matters. So much is dependent on a random number generator whose margins of favour are so razor thin that the game devolves into a series of coin flips. The only reliably strategy is that if you flip more coins than your enemy, more of them will probably come up heads (no guarentees though!) and you'll win.And that's about it for depth.You'll also struggle to get more than a couple of missions into it. Its not brutal in the sense that say, Dark Souls is brutal. Mordheim doesn't teach you lessons, or punish your failure to precisely execute manuevers by setting you back to your previous position and saying ""try again, this time don't suck.""No no. It sets you back to your previous position, ties one of your arms behind your back and tells you to try again.There's no learning curve, really. There's no opportunity to take a mistake learn from it because that mistake will haunt you forever. Every screw up, every misclick, every bad dice roll will be added around your neck like a millstone, and you will never get to remove them. In a purely multiplayer environment this might be a part of the fun. Everyone would acquire these albatrosses and the players with fewer of them would have an edge.But the AI doesn't suffer these problems.You will spend your first ten hours of the game being beaten into a bloody smear, winning by hair's bredths and losing by massive margins. When you do lose, and you will, it will set off a landslide of consequences you will never fully recover from.If I could refund this, I would. If playable demos were still a thing in gaming, this product would never sell another copy.Its bad. Its not fun. The only reason to peservere with it is spite, but you'll lose more of your life than the sale price is worth. Save yourself the hassle and just play something else.			"

												As you can see by the many hours I've put into this game, I find it to be the most fun game I've ever played, at least on PC. And I'm a quite a very active player.As many others beofre me have stated, this game is very punishing and you need to embrace that, or it's not for you. The RNG isn't flawed at all, it's just that because the game can be so punishing, having some bad rolls can make you quite frustrated and think the RNG is broken. That's because most people don't understand statistics. They think two missed 90% rolls is a conspiracy in a gamewhere hundreds of rolls are made per mission. If you have 10 warriors each hitting twice per turn at 90%, there should statistically be two misses. But when it happens, people think RNG is broken.The game has some DLC but they are not needed to enjoy the game, and the AI will play all DLC races against you even if you did not buy them. There is a lot of grind to be done in this game, adnd I am not even close to be done with all the hours I've put in, but noen of the grind is necessary at all. It's just a nice added incentive to keep going while you develop your warband.TI haven't even done all the story misisons, but they're pretty fun. Some can be very hard though. For me, multiplayer is where the real fun is. I am an admin of the currently only active MP league, called the Mordheim MP Permaleague. We have a great system for doing fair matches and anyone can join with a new team and play on equal terms against others. What's fun with MP games is that there are tow modes. Exhibition games without permanent effects afterwards, or Contest games with permanent effects. The league I play in do Contest games. So any loot you grab off your opponent you get to keep and they lose it, any injuries you suffer are there to stay, and so on. It's great fun if you can accept that you WILL suffer losses. But league players also get AI games that they can use to recover in when needed.Unfortunately this game lacks a server based matchmaking system, and that is its biggest flaw.Pros:- Best Games Workshop game adaption to date with its awesome fantasy and lore.- Awesome an helpful community.- Devs stays in close touch with the players and do balancing changes based on community feedback and they have a great sense of humor and a genuine interest in the game.- Many different warbands that all have a very unique playstyle and spellcasters (if you own all DLCS, base game has 4 warbands which still is enough for many many hours).- Very long replayability because there are countless of diffferent viable skill builds to make and toy with for each class and race.- Lots of skills to choose from, where most of them are quite useful.- Procedually generated maps and many different deployment types.- A lot of different runes to discover and enhance your gear with.- Generally a good economy system where you'll find yourself in short of money for a very long time unless you're quite skilled and know what you're doing.- The become a ""pro"" player you will probably need hundreds of hours and understand how to work the RNG in your favor, which is a good thing!Cons:- Punishing and unforgiving, can cause serious ragequits.- Poor AI pathing, especially with Impressives often getting stuck. An issue that's still not been resolved after a year.- Some very annoying bugs connected to ambushes, stairs and obstacles on the ground, that can cause desyncs in MP games.- No MP matchmaking system. If you want to play MP you need to find friends, ask in the forums, or join a league.- Some skills are pretty useless, but they're thankfully not that many and with a lot to choose from it will not impact overall gameplay.- Devs go very silent between DLCs/patches, and become very active and communicative weeks before such a release. Could be more consistently visible on the forums.- Lack of customisation options for your warband. There are some, but generally fairly limited. Doesn't bother me much, but for many it does. "

												This could quite possibly be my favorite game ever. It is in no way perfect, but man oh man did they capture the thrills AND frustrations of the table-top game, which I adore. The visuals are perfectly suited to Mordheim and look like they've been torn right from the rulebook and town cryers. The character design and development system is terrific. I love the fact that you have no idea who you're going into battle with beforehand, and I love how the game is played through the eyes of the characters.Yes, it can be very aggravating when attacks are dodged multiple times in a row, even though your character has a 95% chance to hit. Yes, it's maddening to have a warband route just before you accomplish a secondary objective. Yes, it's insanely frustrating when a character with over a 70% chance just can't climb a wall. Yes, it's brutal when you have a few bad games and you have to disband and start again. But all these ""problems"" are absolutely how the table-top game plays out, too! Welcome to Mordheim! To all who worked so hard to make this game, THANK YOU! I can only hope there will be some future DLC with more warbands joining the mix!			"

												Oh RNG, let me count the ways i hate you...Yes, it's one of THOSE games..Warhammer setting is really cool.Permadeath squad management is super-duper cool.RNG sabotaging a 20 hour playthrough, with nothing you can do about it... Not so cool.thei nherent problem with this game is that you start with fresh little recruits that can barely stand up to a mild breeze, and it is mostly luck or overwhelming odds that allow them to live to be these elite mercenaries hope want.But not even the most elite is safe from the RNg saying ""no, youve had too much fun"" and instagib's all your best guys in a row, no matter the odds.If you can stomach the Xcom level of RNG shenanigans, by all means, it's a great game.

Early Access Review
								Turnbased Warhammer Fantasy Squad game. With Skaven (don't we all love them?) Considering it's only early access you should not get too depressed at the lack of options at this moment. The game flows quite nicely with the two currently available factions (Skaven, Empire) - And at that I did actually enjoy myself despite the lack of variant gameplay options. Right now it's only 1on1 Skirmish (quick-battle) for us to play. Altho, as I've only faced the computer I noticed the AI is quite simplistic, and also it's abit too easy for units locked in melee to disengage, thus completely stopping a melee character to root an archer for example from shooting him in the face after disengaging melee,Also, the options to make use of the last actionpoints after attacking are very lacking - After you attack, either parry or dodge action is allowed for the typical melee character. Thus there is no real punishment for an attacker. After you swing, you'r always allowed to boost your parry/dodge stats. - Why not simply make it automatic - since no one would simply click end turn and thus wasting the free boost. There are several weak points in combat so far - no terrain advantage/disadvantage in combat. An archer on the ground is able to snipe at high percentage possibility vs a small rat hiding 1 meter inside a building. Go sixth sense! - But do not ever forget, it's still early access and these things are subject to change. If you buy and test this game at early access, it will be your obligation to report issues and give positive feedback to the developers, if not for them - do it to make sure your investment makes a quality purchase instead of a ""chance-risk"" of a money exchange for entertainment. It's totally up to you if you wish to dedicate yourself into an unfinished product.  "

												This game has a lot going for it.  It's a great turn-based strategy game with individual levelling for all characters.  There is a great feeling of satisfaction that goes into levelling up a party.  To that extent, it's a lot of fun, but it has some pretty serious issues.This is a ""hardcore"" style game.  If a character gets hurt, he stays hurt.  If a character dies, he's gone forever.  this is an interesting dynamic which I typically do not like, but it's okay if it's done well.  In this game, it is done well.  Most of the time.  however, towards the end game, it turns into a game breaker, and I'll explain why.The story missions are challenging, to say the least.  No, I'll go one step beyond that.  They are hard.  First of all, they put my warband into a tactically stupid situation that I would never put myself into.  Both of my archers were paired with my mage, and two of them were dead before they even had a turn on my first play-through.  On my second playthrough, after losing one of my archers to perma-death and firing the other because he was pretty much worthless after suffering a brain injury, I used only melee characters with much better success.  That doesn't change the fact that my warband was pretty much decimated due to a flaw in the game.  Oh well.  Another 20-30 hours of play time to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.On my second playthrough, I was plugging along just fine.  The basic premise behind that mission is that there is an invicincible opponent that goes around destroying all of your characters without batting an eye while the player struggles to figure out how to inflict damage on her.  When I finally figured out that you need to disable the pillars, it took three turns to arrive at the first pillar while this enemy is mercilessly killing my warband.  When I finally arrive, I think ""finally.  I might be able to inflict some damage!""  But no.  I need some shard or something, and who knows where the heck that is.  Suddenly, it sinks in.  Even with the shard, it will take 5-6 turns to disable all of the pillars.  And that's not including the amount of time it will take to find the shard.  So, yeah.  My warband was completely decimated a second time, and I'm not willing to put 20-30 hours of play time into this game again just to get my warband powerful enough to take on the mission again.Simply put, when I purchased this game, I was looking for two things.  I wanted a turn-based strategy game.  Check.  Secondly, I wanted a game where I had the ability to level up individual characters in my war party.  Check.  What I did not want is a puzzle game where if you get it wrong the first time, you realize you've wasted 20-30 hours of your life.  If I wanted to solve puzzles, I'd go play Portal.  There is a reason why I don't play Portal.  It's because I hate puzzle games.  What's worse than a puzzle game?  A puzzle game where failure is pretty much permanent.If that type of frustration is what you are looking for in a game, then by all means:  Purchase Mordheim.  As it sits, this game took over 100 hours of my time, and I want that time back.   "

Early Access Review
								PRE-RELEASE REVIEWI have been playing Mordheim: City of the Damned (M:CotD) for about eight weeks.The Early Access copy was not supplied by anything other than my own cash.THE UPS:-A multi-dimensional challenge with many different builds, challenges, and tactics.-A really nice aesthetic representation of Mordheim post-comet.-Rewards intelligence, tactics, foresight, planning and force multiplication while retaining a random factor.-No two games ever work out the same.-A devoted community already developing.THE MEHS-The RNG *WILL* bend you over at some point. Not because it's unfair, but more because you're planning opposed rolls based on YOUR probabilities. A fictitious example: Your captain attacks and the system tells you that you have a 90% to-hit. What it doesn't tell you is that with enemy abilities, skills etc., you actually only have a 30% chance to hit. If you knew it was 30% overall, you might choose to disengage and/or switch to ranged. But you won't be given this opportunity.-Min/max builds and system gaming already rife. Needs a balancing mechanic.THE BAD-I haven't won the lottery so it's going to be a while before I can retire and play 24/7. RECOMMENDED AUDIENCE-Necromunda fans-Mordheim fans-WHFB fans pre-WHFB sharkjumping olympics-Born during the Vietnam War-Super cool people who used to play tabletop games but developed careers-Stoners-Obsessive-compulsives-People who are super talented at painting minis and building terrain, plus they brew their own beer, but not any more-Sad old tabletop wargamers looking to relive their glory days-Awesome cool people who just don't give a tinker's curse about K/D ratios, lanespam, grenade spam etc. and just want a thinker's game linked by an ongoing campaign-Me and every gamer I respectSeriously 10/10 top effort. This game deserves to succeed, if only to open up DLC, Necromunda, WW2: the Turnbased Third-person Tactical game, et cetera. If you're a thinking gamer not a twitch gamer, don't think: buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim is a gritty and near to literal take on the original Mordheim system.  The emphasis in early access has been on balance and keeping to the spirit of its tabletop predecessor, and it has done that in spades.  Its color pallete and graphic design are ludicrously dark and forboding.  Every map is liberally painted with corruption and death, with every little bump or crevess hiding another way to get killed.  In this aspect, it is just like every game of Mordheim you've ever played on your high school buddies kitchen table.Where the game differs is in its combat and warband growth.  The warband building system is difficult to master, yet varied enough to cater to quite a few different playstyles in one warband.  Half of the challenge right now is finding out what works the best, and I forsee it becoming quite similar to the tabletop game's tendency to rely on cookie cutter net lists, but this doesn't bother me at all.  Its something you can plan for and counter with ingenuity and skilled gameplay.  Combat is often initiated totally by surprise, yet can be flipped in just two or three actions.  While individual characters can shine, what really makes the difference is your follow up.  This is a great way to really do combat, as it makes you truly have to think out each turn before you take action.  All of these together come wrapped up in a very neat little package, a promise of things to come.  Its still in early access, but there is still so much more Rogue Factor can do.  The skys the limit...try it out..watch the learning curve, and you will be happy you spent the cash "

												There's a lot to like about Mordheim, but not enough to recommend it. The visuals are solid: graphics are good, aesthetic customization is satisfyingly deep, and the ruined city, forgive the expression, comes alive. Though some have criticized the gameplay, I really liked the combat system, and had a lot of fun in the actual fights. However:The campaign becomes extremely unfun pretty quickly because of how the game compensatses for the poor fighting skills of the AI, namely, massive, massive bonuses. You can see it in the description of the difficulty of a given mission, but what isn't clear is how the game ""balances"" the strength of your warband as you level up. Enemy warbands will have a rating similar to yours, but will have /all/ their members leveled. In addition to this, they'll have a composition similar to yours, so if you have six members, they have six members. If you have one of your special heroes, they'll have one of their special heroes. One of the biggest frustrations I experienced was leveling up my Cult warband until I could, FINALLY, hire the Possessed. Once I fielded him, though, I found myself up against a fully leveled and upgraded Augur that handed his♥♥♥♥♥to him. Read some guides, found out that people that Possessed heroes were underpowered, so I ditched him, and started leveling up for the Spawn. Got the Spawn, and then faced a fully leveled and upgraded Rat Ogre. That was when I stopped playing. Maybe I'd like it better in multiplayer, but the campaign became just incredinly unfun to play after a while. The only way to win those kinds of match is to get lucky in the set up, and then exploit the very poor AI strategy. Which, by the way, is to just run straight at you along whatever road is closest. I have never seen the AI go after objectives, which also makes it hard, bordering on impossible, for you to do the same. Unless you get REALLY lucky, expect most skirmishes to devolve into a scrum, which is why the best and only strategy is to keep your whole warband together at all times. But it on sale, maybe, but I'd give it a pass. It's more frustrating than fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Let me make this clear. This game is by no means finished. I would recommend waiting until it is a little further along in development before purchasing straight away.With that out of the way let's begin. Mordheim City of the Damned is the electronic and spiritual successor to the tabletop franchise that spawned out of Games Workshop's very own tabletop world of fantasy Warhammer. You take control of a band of warriors and proceed to try and outwit and eviscerate your opponent. The gameplay is a nice blend of a turn-based RPG with elements from the tabletop game itself. In my opinion this is the game Relic should have been making for the Warhammer franchise all this time. And once it is finally completed it will be a real gem. There is talk of adding more warbands, adding to the original four. These new bands will supposedly include Undead, Dwarves and Elves.This game has tons of potential, and once all these features which are currently locked in game start working, it will get even better. Plus who doesn't enjoy watching their Commander fall flat on their♥♥♥♥♥from trying to climb a 6ft wall.			"

												Already 25 hours in and I already love this game, and Ive only used Empire Mercs for the most part (maybe 2 hours with chaos.) Why do I love it?- The setting, Warhammer is a brutal universe with great lore that really influences  the setting.- It is a great medieval tactics game.- I like RNG and Permadeath. - The link between Multiplayer and Singleplayer is awesome.- I can really feel the people who made this game have a passion for the core material.Any Cons?- Amount of content/warbands in the long run. I hope to see these come as DLC.- Minor animation and loading issues. I would like to see the load times be faster and have a way to fast forward animations that everyone does. But overall I recommend it if you like Turn based strategy, the Warhammer setting, and games with permadeath and RNG. "

												I can´t recomend this game. Maybe I expected too much, I don´t know, but I expected a better game . It has been just full released but i feel like game lacks content, A LOT.-First of all: Only four warbands. Seriously no orcs, dwarfs or undead?-Very limited customization of characters.-Few warrior classes. I expected more variety.-The management of your units in only 3 groups (leader, hero and adept) is just too basic and rusty.-Very few types of secondary objective (steal idol, kill and steal ""x"" unit equipment and collect ""x percentage"" of wyrdstone).-Multiplayer is broken: almost no matches can be found.Also, in my opinion, one of the biggest issues in this game is the AI: The AI makes lots of ""stupid"" decisions but the real problem is how the devs tried to fix it: In campaing, you will ALWAYS have to face a superior warband (even on normal difficulty), no matter the mission, it will always have better stats than your warband. So the difficulty (normal, brutal, deadly) is based in how high the difference in stats will be. I dont know, but i find this combat system too unfair, especially when you have the risk of losing your warband members forever (permadeath) and losing a couple of valuable characters means almost a forced warband restart because fights, even on normal difficulty, will be impossible.Unit placement is a nightmare: In some maps you will have more than 30 deployement spots and you cant just click the point where you want the unit to be placed, you have to switch between the 30 spots until you get the place you want.Same with inventory management: If you have fulled the capacity and want to pick something from the ground, you can´t just switch items. You will have to go to a chest and leave the objects you don´t want there before taking more. Seriously?Finally, the excesive focus on random chance in this game is just annoying.Of course the game is not rubbish but i don´t think it worths 40$. Not in my opinion.			"

Early Access Review
								I own over 100 games on steam and this is my first review.  I feel like I just have to leave a comment here - partially for the potential buyers, but also for the developers.Rogue - you have created what could be a true epic strategy game.  So far, i am loving your design choices.  Continue to pour love into this game.  Warband development / progression / equipment is probably going to be what makes or breaks this game.  If you do this well and reward players for good play and gently punish those that choose poor strategies - you will do well.  It should be fair and over time the better players should build stronger warbands.  I also feel that the possibility of having assymetric multiplayer could help this feel awesome.  Allow the community to build ""clans"" and allow clans to challenge each other for even greater rewards and risks.  This ""style"" or genre of game could become a HUGE thing.Warcraft 3 initially was going to go with this style of game (small persistent warbands that developed over time), but they abandoned it.  I always wanted that game to be made and this could be it.  The possibilities are endless.  You could overlay a ""mordheim strategy map"" that clans could vie for control over.  Limit a server to a certain number of players and let different clans and factions fight for dominance.  Anyways - i'm excited.  This game so far shows an INCREDIBLE amount of potential.  Please continue to listen to the community, but also know when to NOT listen to the community.  So far, your vision looks like it's paying off.  Good luck, Rogue. "

								Keeping in mind this is just the Alpha stage of the game, I can see huge HUGE potential here, specially in Multiplayer games.This is not a port game, some changes have been made to play it on PC (For example, it's still a turn-based game but instead of moving your band then wait 5-10 min while the other player moves his/her band, warriors are moved individually according to their initiative).Right now you've 4 tutorial to learn the ropes of the game, and a skirmish option to play vs a mate or the AI. Only Mercenaries and Skaven Eshin bands are available, but (at least) Sisters of Sigmar and The Cult of Possessed will be in the full game. I'll keep adding more info in the future, as more content is added, also a list of pro and cons.See you in the streets.			"

												I'm writing this review in response to the negative reviews about RNG. I even seen some reviews mention that they played X-COM so now they are ""experienced"" with RNG games. First thing first is X-COM is the checkers to RNG games while Mordheim is the ""beat ya like a red-headed step child"" chess version of RNG games. For instance in X-COM you get a percentage to hit and thats it...if ya hit gj ya got a hit but if ya miss oh well ya missed bad luck. Mordheim gives ya a percentage chance to hit in melee but thats not the end of it...if you roll a hit then guess what? Enemy now gets to roll chance to dodge or parry which means even though you rolled a hit, you still may miss. There are also many other factors in the game that determine your chance to hit or whether your character will even fight at all, but you can use this against the enemy too.  Mordheim has a great community with many helpful guides to make each and every warband you create a successful warband. The negative reviews about the RNG are just crybabies that are mad cuz bad. Take the time to look at the guides in the community and make reading great again. This is a very excellent tactics game that can make you rage to the point of losing faith in whatever God you worship or make a life long atheist start screaming ""BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD...SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!!"". Believe me, I've seen it happen.			"

												This is my favorite game!! It is quite challenging and so very rewarding when you make achievements. If you like a game that you can totally dominate from start to finish ,then this is not for you. Like most computer games, its harder when you start until you level up your abilities.  Then the dice rolls don't work against you as much. This game's characters are nicely detailed and so is the world. Love the warhammer universe. Its a turn based game, which I like, because you can make many choices as to what your character does in the game. Sure there is some luck involved too, but wise decisions can turn things more in your favor. Too anyone up for the challenge, I would recommend a few basic things. Set earned points on agility and weapons skill in there catagories, this helps prevent damage to you. Also equip your warband characters with highest level weapons possible, early on two single hand weapons give more damage then a two handed. Once your warband rating is around lvl 4 things start going alot better!!  Highly recommend this game if you like turn based games.			"

												Excellent game, makes time fly away and makes you think ""one last map"" and then it's over, you're in the morning and spent the night playing :)Pros:- Beautiful- Interesting character development, with items, levels, skills and spells to play with- Not so bad solo content, even if repetitive after some time- Offers a decent challenge, and is very rewarding if you spent some time optimizing your ""skill builds"", as you'll feel the power of your warband skyrocketCons:- AI is somewhat lackluster (characters can get stuck into pathing issues, giving you a one man advantage -happens more with impressives, which is even more than a one man advantage when it happens-)- Can be a little tricky to learn, but the log parser makes it a lot easier to understand what happens- As stated earlier, can become repetitive once your warband is strong enough to steamroll almost all opposition, but that's why there are ""Brutal"" and ""Deadly"" missions, to keep you challenged in the later stages of your campaign- A bit rng dependant, especially with random character positionning, can lead you into a VERY hard gameTLDR:Excellent game if you like turn based strategy games, even more so if like me, you can literally spend hours optimizing your warband skills and stats. If you like Games Workshop universe and design, you won't be disappointed either.Pass if you are the all-in, impatient kind of gamer, as this game can (and will) punish you for that.  "

												This game is a beautiful gem with some serious flaws. I should know it pretty well after about 600 hours of gameplay.Flaws from the worst to the least:PvP. It isn't well balanced, the turns are painful to wait through, and you never find matches anyway.Moderate to difficult learning curve.AI has major tactical faults, and it's still painful to wait through your opponents turn.Time consuming. I spent more than 100 hours on each of my single player warbands, but at the time I am writing this I have not completed all of the campaigns.Random number generators, usually have a bias. This one causes 1% chances to occur 25% of the time.Looting wyrdstone to improve your faction reputations takes an investment beyond any reasonable effort.Discovering the enchanting recipes is also random (many have no benefit).The Value:This emulates the feeling of table top games like warhammer, warmachines, and malifaux wonderfully.You can make a list from your collection of mercenaries and kit them them in minutes. A full game should take less than an hour, and if both players act quickly can be over in less than 30 minutes.Each of your models is highly customizable in both appearance and functionality.There are persistent effects from inuries and mutations (chaos only). Often times this means you will have a completely unique warband.The reserves allow you enough extra troops to be able to have a flexible fighting force. (You don't have to do the same thing every battle).This game is challenging, and learning its intricacies is rewarding. More importantly information is attainable.			"

												I don't review much, but I have to give a positive to offset the idiots who give negative reviews when they don't know what they are even talking about. If you haven't played the tutorials:  STFU about game mechanics or knowing how to play. If you don't like the game because it's not the same system as tabletop:  Give it a chance please. I felt the same way once. Now though, after knowing what i'm doing, I see the game is actually much better than TT, enough so that I don't know if i'll ever be going back. (This of course is ignoring the hobby aspect of it.) If you think the random number generator is biased:  Idk, just grow up. Actually on second thought, i'm a Nigerian prince who needs your bank account information to give you lots of money. The loomynarti is real too. Before you say PVP is dead:  That is because most pvp is either between friends, or you have to join a tournament or league. Or maybe people have to man up and fight each other, despite the consequences. What is Mordheim:  It is a hardcore fantasy skirmish game, from the old Warhammer setting, set in the city of Mordheim, where you control a warband of 3-10 people vs other warbands (though you can have up to 10 people in reserve too). Injuries happen and are permanent, life is tragic for most warband members. But offsetting that are those that survive and prosper, eventually becoming rightly feared heroes. You equip your warband how you want and choose their upgrades as they advance. You must manage the warband financially, which basically means leading them into the ruined city to find precious wyrdstone (magical fragments of a great comet), which is worth a fortune to alchemists, magic users and those who desire power.This game is not perfect, but it's still one of the best games I ever played. As someone who spent their life working with TT and RP games, I can't say anything about this game's system other than it is genius. Anything I want to comment on about the game that could use work I won't say, because the developers have not ignored the game and are still improving it.Buy this game, and all the DLC, even if you won't play it, even if you don't like it. This is an overlooked masterpiece of a game, and it's rare to find a creator that deserves to be rewarded this much for their work. I think if you learn the game though, and give it a chance, then you will love it.			"

												     Being a fan of the tabletop game, I really wanted to like this version of Mordheim.  Sadly, I don't.     The game does a number of things well, starting with presentation.  The graphics style matches what I always imagined Mordheim to look like, and the music and sound mesh with the art very well.  And at the tactical level, the actions your characters can perform are varied and useful enough to keep things interesting -- stuff like climbing walls to gain elevation advantage, intercepting enemies who enter your AO, providing overwatch, and so on.     That said, this game has significant issues.  Some of the more minor ones include camera positioning that ranges from awkward to actively infuriating, a clumsy and unintuitive control scheme, data feedback that misrepresents the true gameplay mechanics, and AI that's a lot bigger on the ""A"" than the ""I"".     All of the above problems are small enough to be forgivable if it wasn't for the hot mess they made of the strategic level gameplay and multiplayer aspects of the game.  Where the original Mordheim was a skirmish-focused game with some RPG elements, the devs have chosen to place the cart before the horse and create a game where the battles are just a chore you muddle through to drive the ridiculously extended character progression and loot collection.  Gone are varied victory conditions that might reward creative play and create memorable matches; now every fight revolves around grouping your warband into one giant mass and rolling it at the enemy until they rout.  Which you'll be doing A LOT of, because the pace of campaigns has been slowed down drastically to account for the CRPG tropes that were shoehorned into a game that didn't need or benefit from them.     But the most astouding failure of all is that there is no support whatsoever for multiplayer campaigns.  Let me say that again: THERE IS NO SUPPORT WHATSOEVER FOR MULTIPLAYER CAMPAIGNS.  IN A GAME THAT CALLS ITSELF MORDHEIM.  All you get are one-shot battles where you use the same warband that you spent 60 games grinding against the crappy AI with.  Ugh, I'm done.			"

												Reasons not to get this game:1. You get upset if you've spent a good bit of time working on building a character up only to have him killed by a 1/1000 chance occurence that you couldn't do anything about.2. You think games need to have save slots that you can reload if you make a mistake.3. You don't want a game that has a moderate learning curve and no forgiveness whatsoever4. You only want to fight - This is a game about trying to scavenge items in the middle of a battle.5. You are spoiled by AAA titles.If none of these apply to you and you want a difficult strategy game with good replayabliity, you probably should try this one out.  The gameplay is excellent and my only real complaints are the minor bugs in the AI and that I'm greedy and want more content (warbands, maps, hired swords, etc.).			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned Review: An Turn Based Strategy Game with RPG ElementsFirst up, this is not Table Top Mordheim. It looks like it, it feels like it, but it is an adaption of the table-top game, not a direct port. So if you want Mordheim as you remember it, this is not it. But it is still an amazing game.It captures the look and feel of TT Mordheim very well. The characters look like they jumped right off your miniature shelf and into your monitor. The world feels exactly like Mordheim should...dark, scary and evil. It is very close to Warhammer lore, and if you want a Warhammer Fantasy fix this is surely your best bet today. No Age of Shitmar junk here! Just traditional Warhammer goodness!PROS:-The maps are truly amazing and detailed. There is nothing else like it. Multiple stories in buildings, raised walkways and terrain, traps and dead ends. Ruined buildings and plenty of flanking and high ground opportunities abound. It blows away anything else in the market and needs to be seen to be believed. All maps also are different every time you play them due to procedural terrain generation. Never the same experience twice.-The graphics are well done, the animations are varied and many, and as said above they really captured the feel of Warhammer in it's entirety.-The development options are immense. 175 total skills and 8 unique spells per faction. 7 different characters for 4 warbands. So many ways to build your characters to fit your playstyle.-'Hardcode' gameplay. You cannot save and reload (although you can save/quit and continue again at any time) or as it's known, save-scumming. Characters can get injuries and die. You live with consequences.-Huge array of maps for multiplayer, with many options.-Seamless integreation of Single Player and Multiplayer. They are basially one and the same.-Unique campaign for each faction and a large single player experience.CONS:-The wealth of options can be overwhelming to new players. If this doesn't bother you, you'll love it.-The lack of dedicated MP support. Since the publisher didn't cough up the cash for dedicated servers, the community will need to start their own leagues. But nothing stops you from doing MP-only with friends. You will need an 'honor' system (and screenshots) to enforce MP only.-Hardcore gameplay can be a turn off. If you can't handle setbacks, you won't like this game.-AI still needs work. It can be challenging at first, but after a while it is fairly beatable. Of course, that's where MP comes in. Note the developers are still working on the AI.-""Only"" 4 warbands. If you want a lot of options they aren't here yet. That said, the four warbands offer immense options anyway. But if your a TT purist, or really want Undead or Dwarves, they aren't here yet.-The complex maps can sometimes cause issues with AI pathfinding, and you may not get why you cannot disengage from combat because some rock or skeleton is blocking your way.It has to be said the development team, Rogue Factor, has been truly amazing throughout the early acces in terms of accessibility, communication, and feedback. A number of suggestion I myself have made are in the game...they really listen to the community, beyond any other developer I've ever seen. They will continue to refine the game even after release, and if sales justifiy, it, they will add more Warbands and functionality.In the end, I found this to be an incredible game, well worth the $40 US. If you like warhammer, and deep turn based strategy, and want fully 3D maps that blow anything in the market away (XCOM has nothing on these maps) then this is the game for you.VERDICT: 8/10Improved MP support and AI will bump this up to a 9 or 9.5.

												they have a good foundation here, but the game is no where near finished:- code is not optimized, load times are waaay too long- balance and tactics seems off, even as the best ranged faction, i basically won everything by clumping together and having a lot of close combat guys- interface super clunky- minimap is not functional - camera is bewildering- units don't end their turn once they run out of AP, instead every single grunt has to end his turn by choosing a stance. even the AI seems to have trouble picking, since the AI plays every. one. of. its. models. as if it was a real human being (you'll be waiting 4-5-6 mins to just mop up a broken foe. not a €40 game, at least not yet. - on that note, AI is like a Rome Total War general who rushes his leader unprotected into a mass of your guys that are just lined up, waiting for him. I know AI is hard, but this is just crazy.- no pricing balance. heavy armour is 14gc but a lousy skill is 100gc- *way* too many stats and modifiers for what the game ends up being, which is something pretty simple (but also not without charm)- ""zones of contol"" orbs around the guys is confusing and now smooth. also seems buggy. e.g. you can't loot a corpse if it's inside the zone of control of another warrior in your own warband. whaaa?so what are good things, you ask?+ it's Mordheim and they got the atmosphere and factions right+ you can level up and collect stuff for your gang. hooray+ rogue-like permadeath etc. that makes kiddes cry when they can't che... i mean savescum. it really is the right thing to do for mordheim and anyone who says otherwise never understood what mordheim is about.

												If you enjoy a challenge, beware: this game is horribly, horribly ADDICTIVE.Reading through the reviews, you'll find lots of common threads: you will come to care deeply about your warband; you will curse the RNG (and the entire lineage of anyone who created it); and you will be pulled deeply into a thematic, immersive world.In the end, narrative will be a key factor in your experience — not just the narrative of the game's campaign but, more importantly, the narrative of your collective experiences. That will include tales of victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, frustrations due to unforeseen events (likely combined with minor mistakes), pyrrhic victories, and even fortunate defeats.I once had a relatively inexperienced character hold against, and severely damage, a massive Rat Ogre, long enough for help to arrive. In a later game, when facing the lethally quick Skaven (rat people), he stuck his neck out to help two fellow warriors get to a safe position, delaying the Skaven leader and tying up three others for two turns, before paying the ultimate price (perma-death).Through it all, you'll be challenged, and likely have to restart with a new warband or two. But once you get a handle on the gameplay, you'll be rewarded with a nuanced tactical and strategic challenge. For instance, I spend several minutes at the start of each game (against the AI, mind you) looking over the game's map, planning my deployment and strategy for that mission. You'll benefit not only from such planning, but also from careful use of tactics, such as adjusting your formations to ensure shooters have clear shots of incoming enemies, and ensuring that your fighters are in ambush stances to prevent access to your soft targets.Oh, and friendly tip for fellow lovers of ranged combat: set melee weapons as your primary weapons for your shooters (you can have 2 sets of weapons), and their ranged weapons as secondary. You'll be able to switch back during the game, but (most) melee weapons give you far better initiative, which can buy you time to get into position. And for this purpose, stick to initiative-boosting weapons, like spears, daggers, and swords.Enjoy!			"

												The Early Access phase of the game is over, with the game making tremendous strides since then. This game is a hardcore experience, which players often forget before purchasing the game. You will lose warband members, RNG will not go your way sometimes (as with any RNG based game), you'll be scraping to get by with your wyrdstone shipments, and many other frustrating experiences. But the game is worth, oh is it worth it. Pros:- The city of Mordheim is beautifully rendered. It really captures the feeling of exploring a haunted city. Each map is randomly generated, so no match will be exactly the same. -Each warband feels different from one another, with different skills and strategies being important for each one. -You are able to progress your character through leveling up characteristics, purchasing skills, and equipping different sets of weapons and armor. -If you're a warhammer fan, you'll love this game. -Permanent injuries make you feel a connection with your characters, since you don't know when it'll be their last session. -In depth tactical experience with positioning, stances, and environmental advantages being crucial to victory. -Rogue Factor is an amazing company. They value player feedback and have sculpted the game through Early Access in response to the community input. They are very quick to fix bugs, and bring out updates. Cons:- only four warbands (witch hunters are being added, so more warbands are on the way)-The AI can be really annoying. Their pathfinding isn't the best and they can make silly tactical choices that cost them the game. -Loading times (fixed, only 20-30 seconds now). -Needs more multiplayer support. -Could use more warband customization.I would suggest this game if you like tactical RPGs or the warhammer universe. There will be times where you are frustrated, but that comes with any game. Rogue Factor deserves another round of applause for being extremely responsive to player feedback. There will most likely be DLC down the road (warbands, customization, maps, etc).			"

												Really really good, especially for fans of Warhammer or dark fantasy in general. My message to the devs: ADD HOTSEAT!Edit:This game has come so far and improved so much. I have been playing GW games since 1996 and I consider this the most faithful interpretation of the atmosphere and aesthetics so far. Gameplay wise, I'd say if you are an X-Com fan then this is for you. Turn based (ish) with lots of depth and room for clever tactics.You and your men (or women, or ... rat people) will suffer greatly throughout the course of your campaign but half the fun is rolling with the punches and finding a way for your braindead/betentacled/peg-legged cripples to still be useful, and with a bit of imagination your characters will develop their own stories based on their exploits, triumphs and failures.

												Valkyria Chronicles in a Warhammer Fantasy related universe, this is how I would describe Mordheim to friends with my full recommendation attached.I rate it highly as it is a hidden gem that values and celebrates sophisticated turn-based strategy. The modes and mechanics offer endless gameplay, be it online or in the multi-layered and extremely replayable campaign.It still needs optimisation and polish as it just came out of early access, other than that it is a dream come true for every turn-based strategy fan.If you like the flavour of TBS that Valkyria Chronicles presented and have a knack for the gritty and dark Warhammer Fantasy universe, then you will love this.9/10 - Brave, unique and absolutely needed game.

Early Access Review
								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI highly recommend for fans of turn based strategy. Although it has been said that to players of the Tabletop Mordheim it does not feel like Mordheim except for the looks (meaning some core rules not being implemented), this is a fine game already. From playing the early version I can say that devs work hard to get rid off bugs and balance the units and they are highly appreciating user feedback in the forums. It feels a lot like XCOM in Multiplayer but has a initiative-based turn order per unit (not per player like XCOM). To me the best aspects of the game are yet to be implemented (statistics, customization, leveling, mission goals)The downside of this being early access is that you have only 2 pre-defined warbands available for play, while customization, leveling your units and creating class/skill/euipmtent combinations of your own is key to replayability. If you buy the early version you have to be aware that it is getting repetitive and the best thing to do is play 1-2 games per day max and report bugs in the forums. If you don't want to spend your money yet I recommend to follow the announcements because this game feels like it's going to be great.			"

												Pros:-Warhammer game which guarentees excellent characters and story.-Maps are beautiful rendered with a few randomly generated features and because of how quickly the AI mindlessly charges you, will never get to explore it and realize just how similar the maps really are.-Permanent consequences and wyrdstone shipment requirements make gameplay much more intense and involving.-Campaign missions are very well done and each faction has a well detailed story that gives some purpose to your warband's struggle beyond just grabbing loot.Cons:-Heavy reliance on RNG takes away from the strategy aspect and turns every engagement into little more than a game of dice, which more often than not, will feel heavily weighted in the AI's favor.-AI feels less like a rival warband attempting to seize as much loot as they safely can before engaging in battle and more like a suicidal band of madmen/madwomen with a pathological hatred of you. It will simply charge you with whatever  units it has as soon as the game starts and will largely ignore even the most valuable loot along the way.-Only way to replace units is to either hire level 0 scrubs who will be wiped out in 2 attacks later in the game or pay exhorbatant fees to hire from a weekly pool of randomly generated warriors who still are just barely a few levels higher than 0. Advancing along the games campaign and smuggling system will give a free higher level unit, but in a game so heavily reliant on RNG with such aggressive AI this will not make up for the heavy number of losses you are likely to experience.-Small number of factions combined with a very simplistic AI creates tremendous repitition with the tedium only broken by campaign missions.-Loading screens long enough for you to pick up a new hobby.-Clunky UI. Although I hear is much better if you use a controller but I was not that fortunate.My experience with this game has felt a lot less like some tactician and more like a compulsive gambler who enjoyed the ups and downs of such a hardcore game but every gambler has a point where they realize the pain of the game has finally outweighed the enjoyment. Mine came when I had 4 critical hits on three different characters and my leader killed himself with a 9999 damage bad luck roll all in one turn. That was the last straw that made me realize the game just wasn't enough fun for me to be worth such frustration.			"

												To be honest, i normally don't take the time to write reviews. This is one of my few exceptions. I bought this game when it was early access... because i love 40k... the video looked cool... and i thought that maybe i'd play it as one of my ï'm bored and i don't know what else to do""games.It developed slowly but consistently and i have to say that the devs have methodically ironed out the flaws as they've arised to make it a solid game. It now loads much faster, has few bugs, is genuinely fun and has beautiful little parts such as your warband members develping their own story over time. For example I was GENUINELY upset when ""Reject Ralph"" finally died. Reject Ralph was initially hired as a ""replacement"" gunner for when i was training one of my more valued... party disposables. Reject Ralph became a valued member of my party and... lost a leg... an arm... and an eye in service...! I was very upset the day when i realised that his little wooden leg would no longer be stepped upon and the sword held in his left hand (being no longer able to fire a rifle) would no longer swing... as i could not ""Ält + F4"" and load the game before his departure.In short, my review is outrageously positive due to the genuine investment in your party that the game makes you have. Moving forward, i would like to see a larger variety of maps, warbands and mission types but i have no doubt given the hstory of the developers that this will come.My thanks to the ""boredom game""that i actually rate highly in my library.

												I bought relatively early into Early Access, And I was super disappointed - the game was sluggish, unbalanced, boring and the multiplayer battles without consequences.And then I started again with the last patch, after taking half a year off.Boy did this get far. Mordheim is brilliant now. It's still a bit sluggish, a bit slow with the loading, but it's so, so, so much fun. While there's only four warbands, there's plenty of opportunity with different weapon styles and skillings to build your own unique troop. And every battle counts, every engagement could end badly for you.The AI isn't very good, but it gets lucky every now and then and manages to outflank you, so there's still a considerable risk. Mordheim teaches humility - like when your Matriarch tank loses her shield arm and can't enter Parry stance anymore, rendering her completely useless as a tank. And replacing her from the scratch will take a lot of time and training you might not have, as your commander expects a large delivery of warpstone soon!My initial disappointment is completely gone, and I'll be the first in line when new DLC featuring more warbands hits the store. It's so good, and so exciting. "

												I think this is truly excellent game, with a unique, well thought out take on turn based combat. Set in a rich (and slightly terrifying) environment that never seems to be the same map twice, thanks to the random(?) generation of traps, bridges and the destruction of structures.The 4 factions are well balanced and allow for surprisingly different play styles, thanks largely to their standard passive and Warband specific abilities (when you create a warband you'll see what I mean). Also, the DLC warriors are great. They add a real dynamism to the Warband.A word of warning though. This game is very unforgiving. You will make mistakes, you will overextend at some stage, hungry for Wyrdstone, your warriors will be permanently mutilated or die. Accept that. It is what makes winning a battle so exciting and losing so upsetting. If I could give the old me advice (250 hours ago), it would be:Never do maps where your Warband is scattered randomly - you are leaving them in the hands of the GodsWyrdstone is everything - try to do maps with the highest Wyrdstone rating possible, balancing difficulty.Fill every slot - hire all the warriors you can and rotate them to gain experience. It may take a little longer but that way when one loses a leg or gets brain trauma or dies, you won't be too upset.Be patient - Money is hard to come by and good gear doesn't begin to appear until at least level 4. That's fine. A time will come where you have all the money you want and can really invest in skills that suit your Warband and the gear you have.Lastly, thanks to the devs of this game. You clearly care about the game and the lore of Warhammer. Very good job.			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim: City of the Damned isn't ready - Even for early access - plain and simple. While everything looks promising, I would not recommend anyone purchase this game until it's either released as the full game, or some significant advancements are made with the game as is. Right now, it's a $30 demo with extreme loading times, and most elements of the game missing - which might be forgivable outside of the fact that those elements are what would make the game worth investing any time in to at all right now. When I say extreme loading times, we are talking 3-5 minutes for a skirmish vs. A.I. The core components of the game are looking promising, but the camera clips constantly through the scenery, often placing the camera awkwardly below the ground behind your current unit during an attack. The U.I. is in desperate need of some revisions. Attribute checks, for example, are identified on one end of the screen, and display the result on the far end of the screen. This is poor design and should be a unified element in the center of the screen tying the attribute check directly to it's result. a tip should also be included to explain what a failure or success means - this feature should be enabled by default, but allow veteran players to turn it off to reduce screen clutter. This might seem a bit strange to say, but this game is so obsessed with hiding things from obvious view that it's overly streamlined. That said, if you turn on everything, it's certainly a lot of info so there is a balance to be struck, but the radial menu feels pretty good to use and would be where I would focus my attentions as the UI designer. The map needs work also. Getting the cursor over an element should identify that element - as is, the strategic value of the map is very dependant on how well you know each and every icon. Memorizing icons is not an edge which should exist.The lack of game modes is pretty egregious for a game they are asking $30 for - certainly it's understood that this is a game in Beta/Early Access, but as is, this is not a game experience, it's a demo that isn't worth playing in it's current state. The graphics are fine, but the models require some level of enhancement, especially on the highest settings. The rat ogre, upon whom I seem to get focused during opponent actions, is quite disappointingly rendered. There is no separation on the large front teeth, the fur and skin textures are flat and outside of the life you see in the armour, everything looks pretty dull. It's not all bad, of course. The game play is pretty spot on (even with the UI deserving a bit of a reworking) and the strategy of the game has been captured well in this digital interpretation. The movement of the Skaven is well animated, and the management/advancement element of the game which is only implemented in a skin-deep ""level your warband to 10 immediately"" demonstation, does look like it's going to do the job well and fulfill the needs of the Mordheim fans to level their warband up and craft it in their own unique ways. Long story short, pop this promising game on your follow or wishlist and wait for quite a few patches and updates before you throw any money down on it. Based on potential, this game is highly recommended for a future purchase. For early access, I would say skip this offering and find something that will give you a little more return on your investment. Early Access Score : 4/10 Potential: 8/10Fun? 1/10 Why? Because playing the AI seems to generate a random warband to face - and every time, they have been significantly more powerful than my warband. As in, they appear to have at least 6 actions to my 3. They hit 2 times harder, and twice as often. October 2015 release? we shall see.			"

Early Access Review
								So originally I had written a bad review mainly out of anger for the games difficultly. After realizing the DEV had actually REPLIED to that review and asked for elaboration I will now write an honest review, and that would be I like this game. My only gripe about this game is its difficulty at times may leave you pulling your hair out of your head in frustration, with repeated defeats dispite the overview claiming you are stronger then they are only lead to increased anger. Other then that however I do enjoy the games idea and mechanics. I also give props to the Devs for actually taking the time to look at bad reviews and actually see how they can improve. You guys are allready better then atleast 50% of Devs as a whole. Keep it up.			"

Early Access Review
								I use to play the board game, and now i am playing it again in the virtual world ! So with that said I am a fanboy, and I am SUPER critical of gamesworkshop adaptations. So for none have met the standard or feel of any of the table top games , besides the DoW series and Blood Bowl which both are kinda hit and miss, but awesome none the less. This game is really good already in it's early access phase. And I can see that it is only going to get better. As it stands now ( an update for the third warband and new functions ,IE stat item allocation , is happening as I type this) you have the human Mercernaries and the Skaven Clan Eshin warbands. Customization is limited , as it is early , but it is getting there. The game is simple and complex at the sametime. The ui and function of each character is pretty self explanatory and if not, the information is easy to find. the Ui , in my opinion , is clean and not distracting. It doesn't break the immersion or distract the tactical mind.  I have played both warbands ( awaiting the patch for the third warband Sisters of Mercy YUS! ) and both feel right. The only probelm i have so far , the devs are working on.... graphical bugs , camera clips , all the NORMAL stuff for an early game. It's the only thing that breaks teh immersion, and well at times can aid you or your opponent, as in unseen movement of enemy troops.I surely DO recommend this game IF you have patience and are willing to see the game grow and expect a game NOT finished, especially at this price of $31.99. As I know GW products tend to sell on the higher end of there produst platforms, nows teh time to get this. Just get it , don't play it , and when it releases with everything , jump on t , and be happy you saved money for a more finished product in the end.UPDATE: With the latest patch, giving us progression and scenarios - This game has become even MORE amazing than before. The devs are styaying true to the GW feel and mechanics. The models look amazing, the atmosphere amazing! The music puts you right n the mindest of the Warbands! UI has been further made user friendly, loading has ssen a decrease in time ( which is amazing !! ) . Injuries ( one of my skaven is missing an arm , and it shows, and it's amazing, he's got a dagger full of skittering anger ready ! ), downtime, wages, gear, consumables, magic , tactics, player progression - aside from indivdual warbands ( warbands are Mordheims word for gang or team ) There are 4 warbands as of yet : Mercenary : soldiers looking for monies  Skaven : ratmen from Clan Eshin ( ninja / pirates ) Sisters of Sigmar : the holiest and angriest women alive >.< and Chaos : fiendish humans selling body parts for warp gifts and angry magic!All very well produced and very true to their playstyle.This is the best Early Access game I have ever purchased, and makes me believe in early access success. I keep coming back to it in between all my other follies of gaming, but this is the one you find yourself going "" Ok one more minute-mission...."" 4 hours later and 3 pots of coffee Either way buy it, play it , enjoy it. Good game !			"

												I still wish Steam had a ""neutral"" rating. While this game has a solid foundation and a very strong appeal, I cannot personally recommend it. If you're an XCOM player, or a player from the Mordheim Tabletop, then I advise caution when considering this game.If you are looking to play the game for story: Don't. It's pretty threadbare. Each faction has a campaign mode, but the vast majority of missions are pre-generated and monotonous. It feels unfair that a good chunk of the game's content is gated behind DLC when you consider the fact that each faction is doing the exact same thing. Let's start off with the basics. At the infancy of your warband, you have your leader, a hero, and three slots for henchman. As you progress through the game, your warriors become stronger through experience. You will eventually be able to have a total of 10 units on a mission, not including various factors. As you progress through missions, you'll eventually get a ""deadly mission"" that's classified as a story mission. This particular mission does not go away, so you can pursue it at your own leisure.But let's not mince words here; it's a big grind. This game is all about carefully grinding up your warband to a high level, just to have it fall to pieces on the next mission.For starters, the enemy AI is odd. You'll be sitting in place, waiting for the enemy to make goofy itineraries. Its units will always be superior to yours, assuming that their warband does not just scale with you right from the get-go. ""Normal difficulty"" really means ""equal in strength"". An easy solution for this is to simply bottle-neck your warband in a place where they can't be flushed from, and whittle down the enemy until you win. Hell, you can even kill the enemy's leader and the rest of the troops will defecate themselves and run.However, while this is going on, you're *supposed* to be collecting Wyrdstone. Your success is rather dependent on it. You will get smuggler missions where you need to collect a certain weight of Wyrdstone in an allotted amount of days, and if you mess around it will punish you.Another glaring issue with the game is its RNG. Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""But XCOM is RNG!"". While this is a fair statement, the caveat is this: XCOM is fluent. Mordheim is not.I think the RNG in this game was created by a hardcore Warriors of Chaos player who thinks, ""But losing is fun!"" is an applicable ideology to game development.  The game has a number of mechanics which favor the AI, reinforcing the notion that the developers have an erection for the ""hardcore"" elements the game espouses so much. Let's take ambushes, for example. Basically, the ambushing warband gets bonuses to their attacks, while the defenders get penalties. Unless you have a warband built around Initiative, it's very likely that you will lose half of your warband before you can even get a hold of the situation. To me, this is not ""tactical"" or ""strategic"". It's an odd RNG algorithm giving you a giant middle finger just because it can.Finally, there's the UI. It is clunky, unwieldy, and not user friendly in the least bit. The control scheme is tied to the use of WASD movement. While the developers have vastly improved it since early access, it still feels like pulling teeth.But hey, with all that said, this is a perfect example of what G-Dubs does best. If you are someone who likes ""iron man"" challenges and pure RNG based games, I recommend this. If you are someone who does not like the fact you can lose hours upon hours of progress because of one bad roll, do not buy this game.			"

												Most of the reviews done by people have bias... I've put about 220+ hours into this game. Without a doubt it has it's flaws and perks. But for the most part people who would enjoy a solid tactical high stake team based tactical RPG, this one is worthy of a purchase. My bias is that I love the Warhammer world (40K-Fantasy), and honestly if you enjoy maiming rat ogres and mutants I think you’d appreciate it too. Pros- Every match is different (after about the 200 hour mark I felt like I had pretty much saw what the game had to offer).- large unit variety, there are probably thousands of different combinations to choose from within each warband… there are 6 total (including dlc’s announced so far)- Tons of loot and equipment variation- Different tactics in taking out your enemy… do you want to fight the enemy out in the open, or   would you rather sneak around and stab them in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Interesting lore behind characters that add to RP values. I have a warband that is full of mishap war veterans, homeless mordheimers, and nut jobs... Dirty Dan is the master of man.   - If you appreciate slow and meaningful plays (similar to that of chess or blood bowl) then you’ll get a kick out of this game.- Runs smooth, I have a dated computer and I’ve never had trouble running it well.Cons*Disclaimer* This is a budget game, and in certain ways it shows its face… be warned those of you who care about such things.- Graphics are dated (although the art is pretty satisfying)- There are still some annoying bugs in the game- Gameplay can get repetitive due to small number of game modes- Online play is pretty much non existent in a practical sense, I’ve had this game for a year now and I haven’t ever been able to play an online match (There are is a small community of hardcore guys who play online) Chances are if you know about this game/are interested in this game, you probably own it already. For those of you who don’t and are on a thread, these are the main selling points that I have found. Is the game sketchy, a bit. But does it redeem the sketchiness through awesome hardcore ghetto street fighting… ♥♥♥♥ yeah. I’d recommend it to any strategy lover, or anyone who likes a 16th century gang fight simulator.Have fun all you Mordheimers			"

												Originally I tried to refund this game but I had already played it for too long for that to be an option (2hrs is the threshold). So I put a lot of time and effort into liking this game. I read guides, warband builds, reddit posts and tried to apply all this information. Ultimately Mordheim: City of the Damned just does not deliver an experience to warrant anymore of my time or in all likelihood yours.  This is a big disapointment, as I love Mordheim the tabletop game and was hoping this adaptation would measure up. While there are definitely some things to enjoy about this game, a plethora of major and minute flaws make it overall unsatisfying.This game isn't hard on the wallet. I got it on sale for $12. But it's a timesink. I have 44hrs in and I haven't beaten a campaign yet. There are 4 campaigns (6 if you buy the DLC races). The campaign is a sparse peppering of special missions that come up as you level up. You level up by doing the unending supply of regular missions which have you fighting other warbands for loot. These are randomly generated and draw from a pool of maps, mission types and warband types. The enemy warbands scale to your warband or are stronger. There is a significant sense of difficulty, you can't screw around or your warband will get wasted. You also can't reload a save or undo a bad desicion so fights can get tense when you find yourself in a bad spot or one of your favorite warriors gets isolated and surrounded. Likewise the RNG system never really lets you feel comfortable or like you can take a battle for granted. The RNG system is fine, people accuse it of being broken or rigged, but it isn't. What it is, is frustrating. Because the warbands are always so close in relative power a few bad rolls can lose you a fight or leave you scrambling to cheese out a victory. Plans go out the window when your enemy succeeds 3 morale checks in a row and you fail your first attempt, meaning you lose. In many ways this is the game's greatest strength. Every contest is so close that small desicions matter, I've played plenty of games that would be vastly improved by some iteration of this approach. Unfortunately I don't think this was executed well enough to make the game fun. Let's talk specifics. I read a guide which suggested that you would probably have to start one or two warbands and have them fail or become to injured to make it worth continuing. This seems like it would be kind of cool. The stakes are so high that when you finally do succeed it will be that much sweeter. In practice you'll evenutally figure out that you need to build your warband around ganging up on your enemy .If a unit is left by himself, they must make a leadership check or break and run, giving you an oppurtunity to make a free attack for every person in proximity to the fleeing target. This is the game. Surround them, make them run, kill them with the free attacks, repeat. You will basic melee attack thousands of times. There are ranged weapons and magic but don't worry we'll crush those dreams later. Because of the scaling it will never be a good idea to go one on one. My beefed up Cult of the Possessed leader learned this by charging at a Witch Hunter and rolling 3 misses in a row and then getting killed in one round. This would have been funny, if I hadn't put a ♥♥♥♥load of time and resources into buffing up his defenses so this shouldn't happen. This moves us to the leveling up. It's kind of cool as every fight you'll get a few bonuses to make your warriors stronger. This game is full of little micro advantages and disadvantages. My problem with this is that this when combined with the fact that other warbands always scale to your level or above it, you'll never really feel a sense of significant progress. You can devote intense resources to making a warrior intensely tanky or to do a lot of damage but the changes are so small that they will only be slightly different then the generic dude beside them. Likewise the customization is weak. There are few meaningful options. A slightly different haircut or a off color shade of brown is all the seperates your goons from there's. You'll often fight warbands populated with guys who look just like yours. There's no flavour text or background as to why you are fighting, other then they were there. Also don't bother remembering the specific warbands you fight. If you're looking for revenge or to steal back that ♥♥♥♥ing magic hammer they looted off your corpse then you're out of luck. All the enemy warbands are randomly generated so don't look for continuity there. My leader was a mage and I wasn't getting a lot of millage out of his spells. Infact all the stuff he could learn seemed like a colossal waste compared to him just running in and doing basic attacks. So I read up on magic to see if this was a universal problem. The answer was yes and no. Helpful members of the community were more than happy to point out that nothing was wrong with the spell system, merely that my question, playstyle and general attitude were the real problem. Apparently magic becomes a viable strategy once you get to level 10 and can afford to spend all your gold on spells and talents. For context, 10 is the highest level you can get to. I think this sort of speaks volumes to the type of person you should be if you think you will thorougly enjoy this game. If you think it's reasonable that an entire aspect of the game is useless until you get to the end of the game then sign right up. Likewise ranged combat isn't recommended until your warband has a posse of level 5 tough guys to bodyguard the delicate flowers who can shoot people. This isn't set in stone or a law you must follow. There's probably some masochist out there or someone with 200+ hrs logged who decided to only use spells and guns or something. But after awhile you will get tired of losing and having your people get injured to the point of uselessness or death. Likewise being broke all the time in this game is about as fun as it is in real life. So you will grind out win after win, by swarming people in 3v1s, using basic melee attacks and trying to get them to break and run. This is the fundamental flaw in this game. For a game that boasts of an immense learning curve and challenges you to eek out every advantage you can, it does everything it can to punish you for taking risks and limits your viable options. Ranged attacks do less damage then melee, have penalties to firing into combat and require complete specialization to be useful. Your spell caster will take a risk to try a spell only to have it backfire, leaving him stunned on the ground, waiting to be pulped by whoever is passing by. Daring flanking maneuvers will blow up in your face, giving your enemy the chance to 3v1 you. These risk vs reward scenarios will tempt you over and over. But the conclusion is that there is no downside to bunching your whole team together and swarming out of position enemy units, it's all reward no risk. Even the special missions boiled down to this. I rarely lose at this game but two of these came when I became so bored with the long and drawn out special missions that I stopped playing it safe. I was immediately punished and a bloodthrister popped out of a closet I hadn't check yet and layed wasted to my spread out team. For me this came down to the game rewarding me for being boring and punishing me for having fun. I would go back to school if I wanted that.TL:DR - Play this game if you have a lot of time and patience. Otherwise the repeatative gameplay and lack of progression will break you.			"

												I want SO badly to like this game.  Against my better judgement, I can't stop playing.  A WHF game where you can PLAY as SKAVEN!  Woah!  Despite a very long early access, there are a ton of balance issues.  The game advertises itself as hardcore.  It is riding the wave from the dark souls ""difficult games are good"" bandwagon.  The problem is, it isn't difficult, it's unbalanced.  Percentages don't mean anything.  You'll have a 90% chance to hit an enemy and never hit them for the whole battle.  You may have a 90% chance to dodge, but the enemy will hit you 3 times in a row.  With 2 of them being crits.  I bought this game when it was first released in early access on steam, and it wasn't this bad back then.  A recent patch says it ""fixed"" the rng system.  Since the patch, I've just noticed getting critted more often and hitting the enemy less often.  Supposedly the unbalanced RNG system is put in to counter how bad the AI can be.  I'd rather have a smarter AI. There are also so many ways for a warband to get screwed to the point that they become unplayable.  Permanent injuries happen often.  Miss 4 payments of wyrdstone and no more single player mode.  If you get rid of a warrior because of an injury that makes them basically useless (severed leg on an already super slow warrior) and you can't afford one of the overpriced hired swords, then you have to hire a new guy at level 0.  He won't help at all and will just die because the enemies will still be leveled based on your warband's level.  Ok, I've ranted enough.  I'll still be playing this game occasionally because I am a skaven fangirl, but this game really needs some fixing.			"

												I want to love this game.I like it, but I want to love it.  It's just not quite there yet.  The good news is the dev. team seems to be very, very active and also receptive to some player suggestions.  The DLC is not too expensive, but for what it offers I'm waiting on a sale.I think that some of the detail in the graphic design is amazing in some instances, and only so-so in others.  Overall, it's fairly good.  But graphics aren't everything.  The setting is interesting but levels sometimes feel a bit repetitive.  I's turn based strategy and that's a bonus for me.The buildings are well detailed and generally the characters are also quite detailed.  Where the graphics fall short is repetitiveness.  Everything eventually starts to look like everything else.  Sometimes there's just too much going on in the scenery and I find that takes away from the game.  It may improve as I progress, I hope it does.The inventory system is odd.  Not what you wield or wear but what you can pick up during a mission.  It's completely dependant on strength, but makes no sense.  Wyrdstone orders from your ""boss"" come with a weight requirement, and each of the three sizes of wyrdstone weigh a different amount.  Herer's the part that makes no sense to me.  You can carry one piece of any size in one inventory ""slot"".  The weight doesn't matter.  Say your strength is high enough for 3 inventory slots.  You can carry 3 of anything.  3 shields, plus the one you're wielding in your off hand.  Or 3 small potion vials.  Or 3 pieces of wyrdstone of any size.  It's still workable, though, and you can take quite a few characters on a mission and most will have 2 or 3 inventory slots, or more, so it's not that bad.Maybe I find it odd that inventory is so simplified because there are so.  Many.  Stats.  So many options, so many skills.  But an over-simplified inventory system while actually playing levels.  And you can't drop anything.  The only option to drop something, really, is to go back to your cart and put things in the chest.  This, my friends, is ridiculous.  If I can pick up something, I can put it back down.  Come on now.  I know, I know, it's something to do with the table-top game it's based on.  But it's not a table top game, so....  Well, enough about that.  It's not that big of a deal, just make sure you remember who picked stuff up because there's no easy way to check who's carrying what.  I can't usually tell and I still haven't found a way to check.The depth in the stats and level system is deeper than most games.  The characters are interesting enough, and can be customized to some degree by carrying different gear or wearing different items.  Despite that, one Skaven assassin looks like the next to me, and the same goes for the humans, they all start to look the same pretty quick.Here's where you start to really customize.  Stats can be upgraded as you gain experience in battles.  They are not just strength and toughnes and intelligence, like your standard RPGs, but also your combat related abilities like parrying a blow, dodging and accuracy.  These points are earned through missions and skill training and they do not come quickly.  I think the slower progression is good because you place more value on the gains when they do come.There are a *LOT* of skills.  You can build characters to perform in a very wide variety of ways.  You can make them fast and nimble, climibing around with ease and dodging almost any attack.  You can make them hard-hitting brutes, tough as nails but maybe not as nimble as their counterparts.  You can focus on melee, or range, or a mixture, or magic, or simply not focus at all and be a generalist.  Which can, actually, work because sometimes you come up against a foe that can counter your main focus, so if you haven't got a backup plan, you might find yourself in a spot of bother.So far the missions are repetitive, but I find they're usually fun.  Some levels are difficult to navigate with tonnes of jumps and winding streets.  Others are more open.  This is a good thing because it gives some variety, despite the repetitive nature of the game I've seen thus far.  It forces you to modify your tactics accordingly and you don't know what the maps will look like until you actually get in them.  You can't stack your team for range attacks only because you might be in tight quarters.  You don't want to go too heavy on melee, because if there's alot of open ground and vantage points, you'll get picked apart.  If the win-some lose-some AI is having a good day, that is.  I've had alot of luck with Skaven melee fighters since they cover a lot of ground fairly quickly.In addition to straight up fighting face to face - you can set ambushes, or stumble into them.  You can lure people into traps that you nealy bumbled into yourself, if you set yourself up in the right place and wait.  There are a lot of combat options, but I find it odd that certain warbands can only equip certain weapons.  Why can't a certain character figure out which end of an axe to hold on to, yet can easily swing a polearm that also has the pointy-sharpy end and holdy-dull end, but just a tad shorter?  Probably a game balance thing.  Same reason you can't take four ""leaders' and six ""heroes"" into a fight.  Starting off you get a leader, a hero or two and a few henchmen.  As you play more your warband ""levels up""allowing you to bring a few more along on a mission.You keep what you pick up on each mission, plus a percentage of other loot.  It seems to be based on a percentage per character you bring in to a mission, so the more the merrier - but beware, each time you go on a mission your warband expects pay.  The more you take out, the more you pay when you come back.  You don't pay 'em until the job is done, but they won't work for you again until you pay them.  Run out of coin and you'll have to sell gear, or wyrdstone, to pay them.  You also pay to treat their wounds.Speaking of wounds, they take days to heal, so your fighters can be out of the game for a while.  Luckily you can have backup waiting in the wings.  Hiring costs coin, but if they don't go fight, they don't get paid, so once you have them they don't cost upkeep if they're not going on missions.  Training also takes days, usually a few, plus a lot of coin to learn new skills.  There's no explanation why it costs money and training tokens (or points, whatever you want to call them), but it does.  Keeps you poor, too... most training starts at 90 coins and goes way up from there.  Luckily wyrdstone sells for a good amount of coin.  I two small batches to two separate factoins and earned over 300 coins on the transaction.... and if you're wondering why your warband is fighting, it's for wyrdstone.  You get ""orders' for the stuff from your boss, basically, and have to send a certain weight of wyrdstone in a certain amount of time.  I don't know what happens if you don't, because I have not yet failed to send the required amount.  You get paid for those orders, but at what seems like a reduced rate.  You can, however, eventually bring it up to a better rate.  The other sales seem to fetch full value, but be warned, sell too much to one party usually means they start to pay less.  Supply and demand, you know.I can't really get into all the nuances of the game.  I'd be writing for hours.  Suffice to say it's decent, and if you like turn based strategy, it's worth a look.  Be warned, however, the AI is wonky.  Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's just plain stupid.  Which is fine by me, my Skaven love it when enemy archers get a bit too close-near.  Which doesn't have to be all that close because the Skaven are pretty fast-quick. (Skaven double talk-speak a lot-much.)So, despite some negatives, I like the game.  Take a peek, watch some gameplay videos and, maybe give it a try.			"

								Genre - Games Workshop Board Game ConversionDisclaimer - I have only played one skirmish game. Although that is really all you can play at the moment. I saw people moaning it was targetted at console users. I used a keyboard/mouse and it as fine (you just need to get used to using Q & E to flick through abilitys). A controller can be used just as well if not a bit better though. The skirmish was hella' fun and left me wanting more. So why haven't I played it more? Because this is such an early build I want to wait and enjoy it properly.You move your 'pieces' with nice 3D graphics in real time, that actually counts as a turn. You engage the enemy and try and rout them or complete optional objectives. My optional objective was collect 16 warpstones, but due to restricted capacity there was no point in this so I just engaged the enemy. You can climb to higher ground with the risk of falling and the various units are unique (such as a stupidity check for a Rat Ogre, spell casters etc.). There is loads of potential here with a campaign, progression and equipment for your squad. There are four diverse squads at the moment. I used the Skaven and they stayed true to the Warhammer universe. So a great game is lying in wait here, but don't get it just yet, unless you can get a discount or a Games Workshop obsessive like me.			"

												Do you like the idea of physically cringing when any of your warband get a hit you KNOW will possibly mean the loss of a limb later? Or getting impotent rage at the screen when you're deployed in the WORST possible places on the map? It's all here and more! Mordheim is a great tactical game full of deep tactical opportunities and ways you can customise your own warband to lead on to glory. Don't expect to have everything your own way though, as the best part about this game is it's ability to throw you into random and deadly situations where you have to think on your feet about how to get your people out of there alive. It's normal to have a few veterans after a few levels to be missing an eye, limb or both, which just adds flavour and story to your band of intrepid treasure hunters!Very fun, very addictive, highly recommended. Would lose an arm again.			"

												Let me tell you the tale of Kashmet, the One Armed Rat.Kashmet was recruited to be the commander of the Vargen Front. A Scaven warband tasked at recovering warpstone from the depths of Mordheim. Kashmet had a loyal warband behind him. His officers, Mik Varr and Drac Rat watched his back and as he led them to victory over and over. As the Vargen Front grew so did they the attention of larger warbands that feared the rats may steal their warp stone from under their noses. Be it overconfidence or stubbornness, the Vargen Front decided to attack the rather powerful 'Cult of the Possesed.' The battle ended in a decisive defeat. Several clan rats where slain and the commanders all suffered permanent injury. Drac Rat lost a leg, but he shrugged it off. He was already slow from the heavy armor he wore, being a little bit slower won't hurt. Mik Varr lost his right eye, limiting his aim with ranged weapons, but as an assassin he preferred to stab his opponents in the back anyway. Kashmet lost an arm though. He could no longer wield his dual warp blades, who's green glow struck fear in his enemies. Unsure of his usefullness, Kashmet went into battle wielding only a club. Instead of being a handicap to the team, Kashmet beat indescribable amounts of♥♥♥♥♥ Not afraid of death, he charged headfirst into battle with his club. Many a foe received a cracked skull at his hand. Fear of the One Armed Rat spread through the rivaling warbands. Under the leadership of the One Armed Rat, the Vargen Front: Decimated the Cult of the Possessed, Burned Empire ship yards, and destroyed the burrows of the Black Paw Clan. Kashmet's status in the Under Empire grew and grew, but all great hero's must fall. The Vargen Front was charged with destroying the Temple of Sigmar in the name of the Horned Rat. An ambitious mission that Kashmet was honored to accept. It was during this mission that the One Armed Rat squared off against a Maiden of Sigmar. As an elite unit, Maiden's of Sigmar are avatars of the god. Normally one would not face such an impressive foe alone, but drastic times called for drastic decisions. The Vargen Front's flank had been broken. A Matriarch and lesser sisters has reached the more delicate members of the warband and Mik Varr's scouts had suffered injuries and to fall back. As the warp guards reinforced the flank, the Maiden showed her self. She approached wrapped in a holy light carrying a mighty war hammer. She had to be held off until the warband could reorganize their ranks. Kashmet met the Maiden in one on one combat. The Maiden hit hard, but Kashmet was fast. He dodged her slow, but powerful blows and lashed back over and over. Slowly he whittled her down. With gnashing teeth and cunning feats of agility, the One Armed Rat seemed to be besting the Maiden until she finally land a blow. Her mighty war hammer brutaly caved in the skull of the One Armed Rat, slaying him. Although their leader was defeated, the Vargen Front still achieved victory. The Temple Burned in the name of the One Armed Rat.That wall of text was the story of my favorite character from Mordheim: City of the Dammed. I have never cared so much about any character I have created in any game. He died a few days ago and I am still sad about it.About the game though. Mordheim is a tactical rpg like Fire Emblem or XCOM. Just like those games it is absolutely brutal. When a unit is defeated in battle, instead of dying right there, they have a chance to just be injured. It can be a light wound or a permanent injury. You can chose from 4 different warbands, Scaven, Sisters of Sigmar, Cult of the Possessed, and Empire Mercenaries. The aim of the game is to scavenge the fallen city of Mordheim for Ward Stone and sell it for profit. As your warband grows you can hire new units, level up each units stats, and buy new gear for individual units. Its a complex game with a very high learning curve. The online play is brutal because your units can still be injured, but it feels so good to get the hate mail when you kill some fools. The developers are very active and the game receives patches every two weeks. They plan on adding new warbands soon. This is without a doubt my favorite game of the year.			"

												So many bad reviews are from people who just don't understand how some of the mechanics work.TL/DR - You'll need to put in 20+ hours to understand all that's happening and really appreciate how much this game has to offer. Go to the forums and ask questions, watch some Let's Play before buying.Yes, this game is very hard at the start. Hell it doesn't so much have a difficulty curve as a difficulty wall built from the frustration, whining and grief of the people who smash against it.This game won't hold your hand. It won't tell you everything. It won't show you all the mechanics in action.It expects you to work some stuff out for yourself. A rarity nowadays in gaming.BUTIf you persist. Not go rage quitting after a couple of hours, ranting that it's crap & un-fair and the RnG is rubbish, etc you'll find a rewarding unique experience, that I think is the best Games Worshop adaptation doing the rounds.Yes, there's some DLC, but it's a small developement group that needs to generate funds, not some AAA title house. You don't need the DLC to enjoy the game anyway, you get 4 warbands with the base game, 2 more through DLC and some DLC hired swords. Wait and pick them up on sale if you enjoy the game.In summary, it's a game you really need to play for 20+ hours before you start to fully understand what's going on. But it is worth those hours, because 200+ hours into playing and there's still a lot I haven't done. Two of the original campaigns I've not started, two warbands I've not played at all.			"

												Mordheim is a great game, but also can be brutally punishing. If you don't like games that make you suffer for your mistakes (also this has a perma-ironman mode so all decisions are final, thus, no chance of save scumming), then this will not be for you. As true to the tabletop game, there is perma-death, there are injuries, and they can happen at the most unexpected of times. The start of the game is arguably one of the more difficult parts, you will have a severe lack of money, you'll lack skills and decent equipment. The AI is always matched to your overall exp level, which helps to provide some balance for the game, but early on this can be deadly, as they'll have had the chance to level up skills which you probably cannot even afford, and even if you could, you may not have days to spare to invest in skills. Over time though the game gets easier, and subsequent playthroughs have also felt easier (I started as Skaven after playing the tutorial and found it challenging, but my second playthrough was as the sisters and this was significantly easier as I knew what I was doing). The best way to play is to take your time and think, this is a turn based stratergy game after all...If you go charging in, you're probably walking out missing a limb. TL;DR: This game is meant to be challenging and punishing, if you don't like that idea, or ironman based games in general, this isn't for you. If you want a game which has a satisfying level of difficulty, but also gives you a slap to the face for making mistakes, this is perfect.			"

												I never wrote any review, I doubt I will ever again. But this game is good.Like, punishingly good, but as fair as possible when RNG is involved.Just so you can see how well the communication is handled, here is a thread : http://steamcommunity.com/app/276810/discussions/1/485622866436368619/?tscn=1447970621I doubt you'll see this kind of thread very often.The lore is respected, the rules are bent so that it's more video-gamey, but still faithful to the Table Top game, graphics are Unity Engine 5 IIRC, so not mind blowing but still classy. The game is gloomy as it should be. Your warriors die. I love it. DA is good. It's the first fantasy game in which I am compelled to play as humans.If you like turn based combat, the lore, fighting rats, women that hit like trucks, humans that care only about money and/or dark powers, go for it.If you like listening and respectful devs, go for it.If you like to support great devs that could put to shame many many many others around here, go for it.If you wife left you, go for it.I managed to sink 150+ hours in the late phase of the EA, so I guess that's saying something.

												Absolutely brutal.  Horribly tough.  Grotesque and unforgiving.You gain perks the more you play, so things will get easier as you as a player level up in addition to levelling up your dudes.If your dudes don't... get maimed, dismembered, mutilated and demoralized.  Getting money to pay your wretched crew is tight, supplying the local powers with the Wyrdstone they want is tough, and although your guys may qualify for a new minor skill, you rarely have the cash lying around.Tactically, it is harsh and unforgiving.  If is for hardcore players who will not throw their computer out when a major upgraded character is permanently killed.  It is dark and vile in all the most amazing ways.This is X-Com for the sewer dwellers.And it is absolutely riveting.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, I always enjoyed Mordheim and have been very excited at the prospect of this game. I really want to enjoy it and want to see it reach its potential. If you and a friend, who were both really into Mordheim have a couple of days free, you will get hours of enjoyment out of the game in its current state. The customisation is fairly extensive and the developers have stayed loyal to the feel of mordheim, without limiting themselves to a straight adaptation of the dice rolling version. Some players might be turned off by this, but the devs have done it right and the game feels great to play. If you like the warband managment side of things, you can currently spend hours just trying out different warbands and setups. The bad side is that playing against the AI gets really old, really quickly. In addition to the AI being really bad in its current form, the CPU warbands you fight in exibition are significatnly weaker than those made by the player. CPU warband rating is generally around 2k, while player made is ~3k. While I find little satisfaction in beating the AI in any game, such a lack is far more pronounced in this game currently. There are alot of bugs, but this of course is to be expected and does not overly concern me. I am confident the devs will work through them in time. Most notably and obvious is the camera angles - AI and camera seem worse on proceduraly generated maps, as does people being able to attack through walls - this should really be addressed before new maps are created, there are plently of maps at the moment, and good replayability due to specific parts being generated differently each time. Somewhat worrying, is the lack of an in game bug report system. I feel like this would benefit the devs no end, and really help focus their attention on getting the game into a better state. It would also soon remove many of the minor issues which can turn players off a game forever. Chaos spawn getting stuck in a doorway two games running is irritating. I know it will be fixed, but others are not so patient. This is doubly so where people have paid for the game, it is not a beta. I am recommending this game, the hours of enjoyment I have gotton so far have been worth the money, and there is the promise of many more hours to come if the Devs continue their hard work. Note however, that online games are uncommon so you really need a buddy to play against. Finally, and if everything else I have said is ignored, I really hope the Devs will pay attention to this point. The planned future updates make no reference to an online matchmaking system. Single player in this game will simply not keep anyone interested for long. Even if you extensively overhaul the AI in advance of the single player campaign, the joy of Mordheim is, and has always been playing against other players. I envisage a perpetual campaign where players are matched against other warbands based on their warband ranking which would effectively act as an ELO. Players will also need the ability to make their own private campaigns. I want to be able to take 6 friends and sit for a weekend starting from scratch. Private multiplayer campaigns and an ongoing online campaign should be given priority over any single player campaign. Even in the games current state, the ability to create your own league (aka bloodbowl) with friends would dramatically increase sales. This seems comparitavely simple compared to making loads of new maps and scripting 32 single player missions for the single player campaign, which will still be dull unless you plan on DRASTICALLY overhauling the AI.

												@@@ RECOMENDED FOR HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY@@@@I have been playing this game on the free weekend.  I have had this on my wishlist for a while now but have always held of buying.  Trying to learn the mechanics of a deep games like this in a day was always going to be a struggle and it did add to my frustration when playing, so bear that in mind. Having played a few games now I can tell you that I really like this game, but its deep and too unforgiving for me ( being a casual gamer).   The game clearly states its for hardcore players and its not joking,  this game is punishing and doesnt hold your hand.The progression system is good and I like the factions and characters, this is not X-Com in a fantasy setting, It's a turn based combat game in its own right.  The game is so frustrating.  For example; one of my charcters who had survivied three battles now had some stats to improve, so I loaded up and played again. During this battle I was ambushed by a spell user who buffed had  themselves and they hit my character three times in a row and he died without lifitng a blade ( I was ambushed, so l had lost inititive). Those are the game rules and not a fault of the game but its frustrting.  I managed to kill one of their team whilst taking major damage to two of my characters and the AI drafted in a reserve to the battle ( which i can't do as I dont have enoiugh money) so they are back to haviong four characters but I have olst my main hero toi an ambush and have two characters who are single hit kills.  The round ended with defeat with one character dying permenantly.  As this was the second defeat I didn't have enough money to heal my charaters or recuit a new one.  As you need four characters to play a round in campaign mode it was game over!    As i said its very unforgving.    I am still recomending this game as its a good game if your a hard core player, but I will not be buying it. The free weekend is still on, but i have stopped playing. If your a hard core gamer then stop reading this and press the add to cart button, for everyone else stay away until they release a normal mode or you will just end up rage quitting.   "

												If you're looking at the reviews, then this game already appeals to you on some level; maybe you enjoy turn based RPGs, games like XCOM, or board game/table tops? If so, I can't think of a reason to hesitate in picking this game up. It's punishing but it's immersive, time-absorbing and very rewarding. It's a weighty and substantial tactical offering that any fan of the genre should play really.I will add one caveat, given the trend of reviews since the sale started. If you want instant gratification and are unfamilar with how RNG works, or are unwilling to get over the tough start at the beginning, then maybe you should proceed with caution. For everyone else, enjoy :)			"

												This game is not going to be for everyone. Here’s a checklist for deciding whether or not you should buy it: You like turn based, squad level tactical games. For instance Xcom or anything from the Jagged Alliance series. You like harder games that actually have consequence. Ever play Xcom on Ironman mode? Do you like roguelikes with perma-death? This game has it. You know and like the source material, are a fan of GW’s WFB world, or played Mordheim on the tabletop, and are looking for a game that somewhat replicates that experience in a PC setting.If you can say yes to 1 and 2 then you should probably buy it, assuming you don’t hate the fantasy genre. If you say yes to all 3 then buy away, no question. It’s an interesting game. The UI needs a little work, but it’s not unplayable or broken. The models look great, and the dev team is adding more warbands. 5 are currently in the game if you buy the witch hunter dlc. The game is mostly about the single player experience with the option to take your warband into multiplayer with either consequence or no consequence depending on your choice. I have not done multiplayer yet so will refrain from commenting further on it until I have done so.			"

Early Access Review
								Looks like a great way to get into Mordheim again. And for those who didn't delve into the tabletop game before, it's a fun setting and a good game from Games Workshop (see Blood Bowl for another great title). The early access doesn't show what Mordheim really is about though, which is to have your own warband and see it develop or die a fiery death in the city. What the early access does show, however, is that the system will be intuitive, the commands simple and the player has time to think about tactics rather than interface. Overall the mood is quite thrilling, i was on my toes to see if my men would live to see another day. "

												Probably 6/10TL:DR- Great game but has lots of issues that will make you tear your hair out from frustration!I'd like to say that i really enjoy this game and it does have issues i found to be very noticeable, but i still liked my play of it. So here is my long review and two cents, i hope you enjoy reading it To begin with i'll mention the great -The game is set in the warhammer universe and the atmosphere of the game perfectly captures the chaotic and ruined hellscape of the ruined city of mordheim, you play as one of four warbands in your quest to plunder the city's riches and satiate the lust of your contractor, whom you must regularly send shipments of treasure (Wyrdstone) to or you suffer severe consequences. The city is tremendously pretty to adventure in, and by that i mean the maps are rather detailed and there are plenty of nods to warhammer lore.The game is turn based with an RNG system and rather similar to xcom in that you have your little ""Base"" where you do all sorts of things such as customisation of your henchmen, buying equipment and so on, as well as the fact that you send your troops off to battles around the city to loot and otherwise stab the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of anyone that gets in your way. The game also contains permadeath, mutations, and permanent injuries too, to spice things up a bit. But they can also result in you wishing to fire a henchman as it is largely a hindrance when your tank darksoul gets his shield arm severed.. The battles are rather intense at times, always keeping you on your toes and rarely forgiving of mistakes, and the loot is absolutely worth it if you take those risks. The game also contains a LOT of different weapons, each with their own benefits and drawbacks and so this allows you to tailor your warband to your tastes and play style, allowing for sneaky light armoured guys that run around shooting things from rooftops, heavily armoured guys that run around bonking things with big weapons, etcThe game has quite the ""narrative"" sort of system going for it as well, for example i have frequently conversed with my friends as to how their warbands are going and we will tell stories of how our henchmen only just barely made it out alive of battles with their lives intact, or how many people lost numerous limbs in one battle, or how even a single skaven went around on a luck streak beating the brains out of half an enemy warband. Other times we will mourn the passing of our level 10 henchmen that we literally spent over a hundred hours playing with and have uncountable stories with. This is further reinforced by the fact that you may rename your characters, and even add bios to them to make them feel more lifelike (and to make you cry more when they inevitably perish due to the city of the damned). Now, positives aside... there are some things that bother meOk, so mordheim is typically described as a ""hardcore"" game, and while it could be said that it certainly is, the problem is that this comes from the fact that most scenarios you are put in are actually...rather unfair. Now hear me out for a second - during all battles, even on easy as far as i know, the AI always brings more units than you, and with an increase in difficulty, the more units they bring than you. To make matters worse, their stats are also ALWAYS better than you, even on easy difficulty. And to further makes things harder, on any difficulty beyond hard (which is the second easiest difficulty ironically), Chaos Daemons show up on the map and rapetrain everything in sight. It's to the point where they either destroy your entire warband, perma killing half due to the level of♥♥♥♥♥♥and permanently injuring the other half of your warband OR the daemon turns on the AI warband and you run around looting every orifice of the map while the AI gets butchered helplessly. If by some strange chance you do manage to take out the daemon as it flails it's arms around the map relentlessly, you typically won't have enough leftover soldiers to actually damage the opposing warband, it took my entire warband to take out a frickin daemon just to have an entire imperial warband rock up immediately after with their pockets stuffed with half of the city's treasure and then proceed to jam their swords into my moist chaos buttocks. Further reinforcing how i feel about the game being unfair to a certain degree, is the campaign. The campaign missions are VERY hard. Very, very, hard. Even if i outclass the opponent's warband rating by 500 points. So how does that work? Well, the campaign levels are always unique to the mission and typically have lots of features you dont normally find in typical missions, such as opening doors, teleporters, weird♥♥♥♥♥daemon things, special abilities, even a unique character to come with you and so on. This means that campaign missions typically take 2-3 tries, at least for me. In which the first try was typically scouting around the map and inevitably having that be my downfall as i am forced to cluster all my soldiers for their own safety (So that they can pile into combat if an opponent reveals themself) and then find out that is a great way to clog up the corridors and get the reverse of what i wanted (One or two guys attacking one AI which eventually chews through them and then the next two unlucky sods step up to get their genitals torn off by the AI) And then if you fail the mission to begin with, your henchmen are typically rather heavily wounded, possibly for several in game weeks and maybe even missing some of their wargear. This means you must wait quite some time before you're ready to take on the campaign mission again, keep in mind you're still fighting AI which outclasses you always AND in campaign missions the AI never retreats AND respawns. Now, for my final complaint about the game i will detail what actually made me stop playing the game.. In the late chaos campaign, i had to assault a bridge which was owned by a mutated ogre, and his chaos possessed henchmen. This mission is pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and takes the ""unfair"" to the stratosphere. I will now explain why - Your warband starts off in tunnels underneath the bridge, you must take out a skaven and his rat ogre bodyguard. Ok. not too difficult. However you must then spend several turns of yours then looting the tunnels for skaven gas bombs and then ""imbuing"" them back at your spawn with some spoopy extra ability that lets you take out the damn ogre in the mission to begin with, so this is like 5 extra minutes of tedious movement. Ok... so not as bad as it could be. But, once you eventually get your little pixelated dudes to the top of the bridge, you must loot some rags in the ruined houses and dip them in oil to convert them into oil bombs in order to hurt ANY of the extremely powerful henchmen of the ogre. This is done by throwing said oil bombs at the henchmen and then piling into combat with them. The problems are as follows- 1. The rags are in random locations2. I can almost guarantee one of the henchmen will see and pursue you 3. The oil to dip the rags in.....is next to the ogre's lair... 4. If you dont oil bomb the henchmen, they can reap your soldiers and won't stop until you bomb them and kill themThis gets worse because if you attack the henchmen when they're not debuffed from the oil bombs...then your attacks heal them instead.So you can undo like ten minutes of fighting if you fail to realise that the oil has worn off and then you accidently heal them back to full by chopping them once.The same problems go with the ogre too, but are magnified greatly. the only way to kill him and his 1000hp is to douse him in BOTH the skaven gas bombs mentioned earlier AND the oil bombs. Otherwise he just nukes your warband and you cant do anything. running out of space to rant so i gotta call it a day..haha			"

												Pros:- it is hard, but not as hard as many say it is ! I am not a strategy god, but what some write here in the reviews is just BS !If u don't suck completely that is...I lost my first warband after like 10 missions and that is okay ffs ! Since then I have adapted and I am still playing with same warband after 40 missions or so. It is still hard, but doable.- not unfair: yes, sometimes u have bad rolls, but the ai has too. And yes, I had situations that made me furious, but thats just what happens if everything is based on dice rolls... U just have to play good to balance out the odds.I think everyone in the reviews who cries about the rng has never played pen and paper rpgs. Thats just what happens !- nice art style/lore adaption. most of the units and maps look pretty cool. - customization with skills, items and visuals- the factions seem balanced (at least in general)- the controls aren't annoying or overly complex imo. some think they are, but moving around with wasd and clicking on an enemy to attack them/scrolling through abilitys isn't that complex ^^- good risk/reward economy system neutral:- the base game features 4 warbands which is enough, so u don't need the dlcs- the ui is all over the place, BUT u can just hide most of it and I like the possibilty of showing all the stats etc.cons:- sometimes the ai gets stuck with their impressive units - the ""story"" is basicly just special missions which feel different gameplay-wise, but the game wouldn't be different for me if it had no story at all. But thats just me.- no multiplayer matchmaking :/			"

								Really fun game, and this is coming from someone who does not like turn based games. The combat is fun but think of this as an interesting game of chess. The factions are a lot of fun though the persistent warbands are going to make this game worth playing match after match. Currently with the game in such early stages its hard to find matches as no one plays match after match because there is no real progression yet. Game is defintely worth buying. Though if its not on sale I would just wait until release.  "

												Down-voting this game. The devs have time and time again posted how they want the game to be HARD CORE. They have done everything they can to ensure that players who want an easier difficulty are pushed about and insulted in their community forums. They went out of their way to keep people from save-scumming their warbands. The AI isnt smarter at higher difficulties- it just gets extra HP/Damage/Stats % across the board instead. The AI warbands ratings are always based on your own warband point rating and then modified with extra points(gear/stats/weaponsetc) to make it always an uneven fight in favor of the AI. The AI doesn't have to worry about trying to collect wyrdstone to keep its warboss shipments up.. while you do. The # of enemies in a warband will always mirror the # of enemies in your warband for the AI. Basically the Devs decided that A) You can't really want a more casual experience for the game, you can't WANT it because they say so. Screw you if you dont like it. That is how they come across any time it comes up. B) The AI was never really made to do anything except charge right at you and fight to the death. Individually each AI warband member will be strong and faster and have more health than your warband members - because it always gets a % boost across the board to its stats and rating. They will also be dumb .. and just run right at you the second they see you. Even if waiting 1 round would be the difference between them hitting you 1 at a time .. or all together. No tactics. No strategy.C) Basically I dislike any company that goes out of its way to eliminate savescumming or the like from its single player campaign aspects. It isn't really, IMHO, their concern if someone wants to reload a game where something nasty happened to them while they were playing a computer AI. There is no one harmed by such a deed and their claim that it somehow harms the enjoyment of the game doesn't hold water. THEM telling YOU what you enjoy and do not enjoy is straight ridiculous.			"

												It's too bad this game makes itself so hard to recommend to anyone, since somewhere underneath this game's problems hides some interesting tactical turn-based strategy fun.Issues I've had with the game so far:- Ironman *only*. It's not possible to create and load saves.- Missions completion is very unsatisfying. The missions I've played so far have all instantly ended in victory after a morale check fail on the enemy's turn. There is no chance to prevent enemies from escaping and kill them, or to loot their goodies or to explore the map after a hidden dice roll decided the game is over. Instead, there is a message informing you that the mission is completed. Um, yay?- Inventory management during missions is madness. Did you pick up 3 pieces of armor earlier and now come across something else you want to pick up, like a piece of Wyrdstone? Too bad, because there's no way to drop or swap items. Unless you want to swap items while looting a chest, that's ok. Or unless you're trying to swap Wyrdstone for Wyrdstone, in which case the swapping UI will be shown, partly clickable but unusable. ARGH! Which brings me to:- The game has a very clunky user interface. Mordheim seems to be designed with consoles in mind; the mouse is unusable for situations it would be perfect for. Get ready to swap between actions using the Q and E buttons. Also apparently a good fit for trusty Q and E: selecting locations on a map. Why allow a left-click when you can turn selecting something into a mini-game based on random chance?- A heavy focus on random chance (yes, besides the UI), including to determine between hitting an opponent for full damage or missing entirely.As well as a bunch of small bugs as well as rules you'll need to figure out by trial-and-error, all of which would be less of a problem if the game simply offered a save function.I'll continue playing for a little while longer to see if Mordheim: City of the Damned is worth it for me after getting used to these flaws, but for others who aren't already fans of the Mordheim license I recommend caution in spending the time and money required to explore this game's mysteries. In its various forms.			"

								Finally a good board game adaptation that uses the resources it has, now being a video game. Mordheim offers pretty visuals, strategic options and an intense turn based combat (Didn't think those words could go together, did you.)While the content is still extremely limited, I'd definitely recommend keeping an eye on it especially if you are a fan of the Warhammer franchise, Fantasy or 40K.(The price tag is a bit too high for this early alpha though, it might be a good idea to wait.)Copious gameplay footage for your viewing pleasure:

 THIS GAMES GREAT, but be clear: ITS NOTHING LIKE THE TABLETOP Full Review here 


Full Review 
A Guide for Mordheim: City of the Damned
By: crimsonsun

			Due to the space limitations for reviewing games on steam I've moved my full review to a guide.		


So I've been meaning to review this game for a while and with the amount of play time I have its obvious I'm rather keen on the game but if your like me and were expecting the Tabletop game in a digital format or at least roughly so then you may be disappointed! If your not a table top player skip to the second half to this reviewDepending on your experience with the tabletop game however you may be aware that the original mechanics, progression and balancing in the core games six core War-bands was utterly messed up and that the mechanics though there very simple nature were easily exploitable while also being massively reliant on luck, as such I'd imagine that like myself you'd be less bothered that this game isn't a tabletop conversion especially since the TT is also very dated now and as a whole TT game mechanics are more fluid now days anyway so those rules needed an update. This version is easier to understand if in fact you simply forget the TT rules entirely because beyond the naming of Characteristic's this game has literally nothing in common in terms of mechanics. Anyway I'm going to break this review up into a series of segments - Mechanics and Balance, Gameplay elements/structure & Campaign - SP,  Campaign - MP, Good Point/Bad Point Summary so its easier for me to keep track of because I am somewhat of a rambling writer.Mechanics and BalanceSo I have to admit that I personally find the core combat mechanics somewhat backwards in there approach working in a very illogical fashion as far as my experience with gameplay mechanics is concerned. The basic system revolves around having a %chance of hitting a target modified by the targets resistance for that type of attack, with a (damage caused)*(damage Modifiers) reduced by armour %. But where this game is strange is the initial chance to hit is standard and fighter skill has no bearing upon this initial number.The basic principles of the system being a % based system it uses a 5% auto fail/success chance at either end of the roll but its very important to remember that the percentage modifications for skills and abilities stack way beyond 100% and they need to because of the negatives stacking. So for example a Skaven War-Band has a number Heroes that are extremely adept at dodging featuring a basic dodge chance of around 140% which still only gives a 95% success rate before modification it simply means I can have 45% of negative modifiers upon that roll before my chances get worse. With that understood I can explain what is unusual and as a result provides some very strange alterations to gameplay depending on the War-bands development.All fighters have a allowance of Action Points which are divided into two separate pools, Strategy Points (SP) and Offensive Points (OP), the number of which is based on there level and the type of fighter in question. Strategy Points are used for movement, Stances and activating abilities that provide various buffs and abilities that aren’t directly offensive. Offensive Points are used for anything that could be considered an attack as well as all Spells, some aggressive Stances and generally anything that causes damage or effects that directly affect enemy fighters. Once a fighters pool of SP & or OP is used up they are unable to act further, though it should be mentioned that most stances end a fighters action for a round and there’s no requirement to use all or any of these points, in fact its often wise to store some Offensive points to be used for counter attacks.Fighters have Nine core Characteristics divided into 3 sub groups (Mental, Physical & Martial) ranging in scores between 1-20 (Impressive’s can go up to 25) which provide each fighters combat statistics used for the various tests taken in the game. In addition Fighters also have a Wounds/Health value, a Movement Value (the distance in yards a fighter can move for each SP spent) and a Armour Value.As I mentioned the basic chances for an Action to be successful are as follows: Melee 80%, Ranged 75%, Magic 100% - Difficulty. These are then further improved by Weapon Skill for Melee and Ballistic Skill for Ranged, with some Skills adding further modifiers and Runes adding more, while Magic is only altered by a Rune and a few consumables. This provides a total % chance to make a successful attack, before being modified for the Targets Melee Resistance/Ranged Resistance + Environmental Penalties. Magic is slightly different as the casting roll is separate from the casting success taken independently. If an attack is successful the defender can utilise a active defence if it entered a relevant stance such as Dodging/Parrying (only for Melee however), which if failed the attacks checks for a critical chance which is a again separate test against the targets critical resistance based on Accuracy, Weapons, Skills and Runes (Critical hits Ignore Armour, have a damage multiplier %, cause a Stun Check and apply the open Wounds de-buff – They are extremely deadly) . Then Damage is determined based on the Weapon, Skill damage Multipliers and the attackers strength/Ballistic Skill/Intelligence for Melee/Ranged/Magic reduced by the targets Armour percentage total.There’s a huge amount going on here as is likely obvious, with a vast number of factors that allow you to influence these attacks and actions which is where this game is at its strongest, as the Development of War-band's has so much scope that even after playing 1000 hours with a single war-band there’s new builds and tactical choices I’ve yet to try with them via the games experience system. Further more fighters can be equipped with a large variety of arms and armours, as well as consumables to further alter how they perform in battle. These items all have 3 levels of quality, basic/good/master-work which provide increased performance and Good/Master-work items can be further enhanced by various runes depending on the item group.Despite this variation the game is remarkably well balanced, with the War-band's being fairly equal in terms of overall ability, though some do match up against others better as well as being more focused towards a certain tactical style (though not so much as to make playing differently not viable). Progression is well paced but requires considerable play time before you begin to approach maximum rank and the persistent injuries along with looming death keep any War-band from becoming stale even in the long term as your always needing fresh recruits for the grinder.I'm posting the entire review as a guide due to the limited number of characters I'm allowed to use. I'll link when done.			"

												Great game!Here is a warning though: The most frustrating aspect of this game can be the late-to-end game (warband level 7 - 10) where you may discover rather late that you have developed an insufficient warband. There are several slow deaths to a warband but most result in you not being able to make your diliveries on time.However if you do the following you may be okay. Just remember this game likes to teach you lessons the hard way, so instead of getting angry at the demise of a beloved warband leard from their death and move on.-THE GOLDEN RULE: Use every single day to gather wyrdstone if possible.- Keep reserve members and USE them. I cannot stress this enough. You will need alternates.- Miss as few days to gather as possible. a good roster of alternates will help this when you take a beating.- Keep and train an alternate leader. Your leader is often your most bad♥♥♥♥♥ though if you want him in the front lines you will need an alternate for his eventual healing time.-Only do the story missions when you don't have a delivery pending. Sometimes these will simply kick your♥♥♥♥♥and even with the use of alternates you may have too many wounded out after a story mission (win or lose) to do anything but heal for a few days. "

												SUMMERY:This game just truly lacks any real amount of content. This would be a great game if there was more of it, i'm not sure if they are planing on going the DLC road but there is a lot missing would have to be a heck of a DLC.GAMEPLAY:Over all the game play is spot on of for a video game version of the table top game. The AI is Dumb and that's just covered up by inflating their stats but it still feels challenging. CONTENT:It's truly the lack of content that brings this game down. There are only 4 playable factions, (there are like 10 races in Warhammer not talk mention the countless sub-factions). On top of that the factions you can play are pretty limited for characters that you can recruit into your warband. As well weapons and armor are VERY limited, there is only 1 of each type of weapon that comes in 1 of 3 tiers that only change the stats. GRAPHICS:On top of that the graphics are sub-par, not killer bad but the game is done and still some walls just don't render all the way. It just feels like a Alpha/Beta gameFINAL THOUGHTS:Game feels like an Alpha/Beta game that just got a ""Good Enough"" stamp. I cant say it enough I truly thought this game was still in alpha or beta the last i played it it just feels unfinished.			"

												Overall - I recommend you only buy if you're going to play against others, such as friends.Good - I love the idea of having a group that you control and level up over time.  You could really get a sense of achievement if it was done correctly.  The way they handled the turns and player perspective is great.  You're not really playing from overhead (though there is a map).  Instead, you see what your active player sees, which improves the immersion.Bad - Improving your gang (warband) members has no meaning.  As your gang gets stronger, the AI will automatically match them.  As your gang gets bigger, the AI will automatically match that, too.  Add a big guy to your gang - you'll be seeing those on the other teams, too.  GW games have this approach in table top games so that anyone can sit down, play a game with someone they just met, and things are balanced between the two players - even if one has a much stronger team.  In the PC games, it kills all sense of progression and meaning.  If everything around you scales to match you as you progress, you never really feel any sense of accomplishment.  This kills the game and actually only increases the penalties for failure.  Losing a strong team member and replacing them with a basic new member weakens the entire team and that individual can't really contribute.  You'll see people online trying to find workarounds - such as never levelling anyone up or having gangs split up into an experienced set and inexperienced set.  Ultimately, you'll eventually feel like there's no point, though.			"

Early Access Review
Early Access ReviewReview will be updated as game is updated and finalized upon full releaseI have to give this two scores.Warhammer Tabletop Score: 9.0/10Video Gamer Score: 6/10As a player of Warhammer 40k, and newcomer to Warhammer Fantasy, I have to say this was an amazing and thoroughly enjoyable introduction. I'm a fan of Space Hulk (The original board game, not the steam version, we're talking 1990's here), it was my introduction to Warhammer and Games Workshop. The version on steam comes highly recommended by me. This game is shaping up to be an evolution of that direction, and it's absolutely fabulous. Developers, keep up the good work, as my hat is off to you.Lets break it down, the following scores are for video gamers, not warhammer fans. If you are a warhammer fan, your excitement and imagination will already see this game is possibly one of the most immersive and enjoyable tabletop simulators in existence, with expansions that evolve elegantly into the video game format. A bit of RPGish element, and a threat of permadeth of hard-won characters adds new layers to a style of gaming we've all come to love. And the FX and animations bring the world to life, like I've only seen in it my imagination. Great Job Rogue Factor Realize, no game exists I have ever given a 10 to... yet. That is a perfect score.Graphics: 9.5/10While not completely triple A, it comes incredibly close. Atmosphere and character models are high resolution and the modular qualities of the world are hidden behind well crafted layers of detail. I expect this to improve, but even if they don't, they're far beyond anything a TBS or RTS has ever attempted before.Sound: 7/10The sound effects are admirably done. The atmospherics are up to the task of providing the player with combat awareness. I am expecting, as they progress, for more sound effects to be added, atmospherics, and other aspects along with the dynamic qualities planned. While doing the job, it doesn't make you terrified. And this is Mordheim, ask a Warhammer player, you should be terrified.Level Design: 9/10Once you're done navigating the narrow alleyways and threading your way through the rubble of a house, you'll find plenty of advantages to be had above you from sniper nests to byzantine catwalks, while below your feet lie sewers and pits with murder holes a plenty. Whether your climbing over rubble to take a shot, holding back enemy at a choke point, or slipping through ruined walls and cover to flank, the maps of Mordheim are complex, layered, balanced, and ever changing. The procedurally generated map methods they use have provided me with a puzzle at the beginning of each game as I am forced to reassess and explore. I see lots of replay value.Controls: 8/10While I heard problems about using a keyboard and mouse, I found the controls to be tight and smooth. Movement is elegant, a huge step forward from X:Com and Space Hulk, giving players unprecedented options and a fluidity of play that I've never expected in a TBS. Movement is a simple WASD affair, looking is with your mouse, and all combat is done through action selection. Elegant and intuitive.Gameplay: 6/10The game is Turn Based Strategy. Two teams called warbands, each consisting of up to ten units. Units are varied, and have classes, and these will be developed as the game goes along, allowing for many options that are not available, but should give you a wide variety of customization when it comes to your characters. Currently, warbands are pre-selected.Basically,  its an evolved game of X:Com PVP, two teams, go at it. Initiative is by character not side, and action points are a bit more complex. At the moment, there is enough to keep you playing, but online I have not seen many players yet. The AI is very enjoyable to fight, I have not gotten bored of it yet. It's on par with X:Com without any singleplayer, and a lot of shiny new aspects to add some fun.Content: 2/10A lot of content is planned, a lot simply isn't there. For you who aren't warhammer fans, you may wish to hang back until more content is coming out... however... it is worth the sale price for early access, I would easily part with the full price for this game when its finished.Optimization: 5/10LONG, LONG, LONG loading times. And the game tends to freeze, in combat, without any progress being possible until the game is restarted. It is early access. 3-4 minute waits are not uncommon at this point for me in my playing. Longer are rare, but have happened. Once the game has started, aside from the above bug, the game runs smoothly, quickly, and is quite enjoyable. The slowest aspect of this game in a multiplayer setting will most likely be waiting on the other human being to make up their mind.Final Thoughts:Get the game. If you're a video gamer and love Tactical/Strategic RTS/TBS like me? If you're a fan of tabletop games of ole, or modern video game emulations of them, or if you're a Warhammer fan. Everything in the feature list is already worked into the menus. The game looks professional, it looks promising. While Early Access is always a gamble, I already consider my 32.00 well spent. And that's what it comes down to. Is this worth the money. Will it be fun for the time you spend on it and for what you spent in cash on it? The current content is worth easily 20 dollars, 30 dollars with their most recent content update. If they keep it up, you'll be buying it on sale effectively after this point.Enjoy and see you in the streets of Mordheim.			"

Early Access Review
								I must admit that, on Early Access, starting out with one gazillion Gold, not keeping track of Xp and thus not being able to level up, buy perks, etc., the lack of options other than pure single Skirmishes, only four warbands to start with, no customizations for names, colors, whine, whine, whine..., yeah, it all takes a bit fun out of it. But hey, it's EA, even if it's 31,99 EUR I've played crappier, full version games for double than that (Hello, DOA Paradise!!!).Nevertheless, I've played the tutorials and a few games and I must say it is quite fun! I only played Mordheim and Warhammer Skirmishes seldomly as a part of WHFB and, in any case, I feel this game quite absorbing; you really feel the atmosphere.The loading times are not so dramatic (as of late September 2015), and even though my graphics card and processor are old, it runs on Fantastic Graphics Mode and HD quite smoohtly. (i7 SB -3.40Ghz - 16Gb RAM- 1GB  AMD Radeon 6800 series)It has lots of potential once it becomes Gold. All in all, quoting my band's hero...LIKE-LIKE!****Updated**** : After playing the Progression Patch Release (available since Sept 24, 2015)  I must say the game now is waaaay EVEN better. I won't even go into the ""if the game had this/if it just could do that"" whining. Sure, I'd like to have more stuff and no game is perfect but, despite the minor flaws sure to be soon polished, I didn't enjoy any Warhammer game so much since Shadow Of The Horned Rat.Two big thumbs up.

												Summary: Great concept, some redeeming qualities, fairly good campaign system.  You spend very little time being able to actually interpret problems, think, problem solve, and make decisions, and spend the vast majority of your time doing tedious things, watching lame and tedious animations, or just waiting for the A.I. to complete its turn. This game compares extremely poorly to games like XCOM, which are vastly superior in virtually every way. I was extremely excited about Mordheim. I have long been wanting someone to make a games workshop game like this. I have played almost every turn based games workshop game ever made over the years, and many others besides. This is the only GW branded game I've ever played that I didn't like.  I have played tabletop Mordheim, and it is a fantastic game (though not without some ballance issues).Pros:Excellent concept, inspired by an excellent tabletop game, with the rich back-story and setting of the Warhammer World.Some of the graphics and artwork are very good. Experience and campaign system is fairly deep and fairly well done from what I have seen so far. Gradual development (as well as deaths and injuries) to your warband are fun, and makes for addictive gameplay, very similar to games like Xcom. The scripted main story missions are a good idea, although they certainly could be better.Cons:Most things in this game take way too long, way longer than is necessary. There is a lot of waiting in between taking actions, but also a lot of unnecessary and tedious clicking, in part due to a very inefficient and counter-intuitive user-interface. Aesthetically, there are a lot of problems with the game. Aesthetics should serve gameplay, but most of the eye catching details on a given map have absolutely zero effect on gameplay, and there are way too many of them, making them very distracting. The lighting in the game also often makes it more difficult to actually see things. I also find most of the art to be VERY ugly, taking away from the generally very nice and interesting looking architecture, and often excellent character models. The grotesque or horrible looking things would have more impact if they weren’t saturating every map, forcing you to always look at them. Sometimes, less is more.There are frequent unnecessary animations for every uninteresting little action you take with your units. For example, when going into overwatch, or dodge stance, or ambush stance, an animation of your character plays which looks nothing like what they’d actually be doing if they were going into a stance to be ready to do any of those things. It wastes time, and looks stupid, but what’s worse is that these stupid animations are being constantly repeated over and over again, making it extremely annoying .Navigation is very difficult. There is no minimap, and the map design as well as camera views and lack of informative visual navigational cues makes it time consuming to switch back and forth between the map view and the third person view, to try to figure out what plan to come up with and where to move your units.It is very difficult to actually look at the terrain, either with the map view or third person view, to see where the various possible paths are, or even to figure out what the shortest distance is from one point to another. You can only climb up or down obstacles in pre-determined, arbitrary points, which are marked by ugly graphical indicators. For the most part, you can’t really climb up the sides of buildings, or on top of them (unlike with the tabletop game).The terrain itself is often counter-intuitive, with many spaces which your units could obviously fit through, which are in fact impassable for no good reason. A large gap in a wall, or between buildings, larger than a doorway, is sometimes impassable. Large, open windows, are always impassable. Very small obstacles that could easily be jumped over, are often impassable. The way deployment works is very clunky, and for some scenarios really doesn't make much sense to me. Deployment should be an important and interesting tactical challenge, and more thought should have been put into how this worked, at least making it a lot less clunky. If you’re fighting over the resources on the battlefield, why is it that you don’t get to actually keep all of those resources unless you manually pick those pieces up before the battle is over? This is extremely counter-intuitive. You should get to keep everything on the battlefield if you actually win.  What’s worse is how unnecessarily time consuming it is to actually pick these items up. The A.I. is very poor. A lot of the skills and spells aren't worth taking. You don't want a significant part of gameplay to be spending lots of time figuring out which ones aren't worth taking. Furthermore, the benefits which they give at first are so minor, that it makes choosing between them a tedious, uninteresting, and not very rewarding experience. I would rather see fewer skils, but have them be more powerful, but also have a wider variety of different useful skills, allowing for meaningful specialization and more meaningful, interesting tactical choices regarding how to best use them (or counter them) on the battlefield. Making learning skills and spells cost money (in addition to points earned through experience) doesn’t fit with the setting and makes no sense. First of all, it makes no sense that your warriors would be taking short training vacations in order to develop their skills, who the hell are you even paying anyway? The amount of gold that it costs to pay for these is by far the largest expense of your warband, whereas in reality, the largest expense would simply be the costs of paying your warriors, and also buying equipment and weapons. It is very dissatisfying to have to spend most of your hard earned gold on training skills, and to be un-able to actually afford to use most of your skill points. Experience should always be convertable into improving your warriors, you shouldn’t also need money for it, it's a needlessly frustrating mechanic.I understand that it's very difficult to make a game like this. I think the devleopers bit off a bit more than they could chew, and probably spent too much time on making artistic content, and not enough time trying to develop and polish the actual gameplay, but of course it's a lot easier to criticize than to actually do it right yourself. It's not easy to be critical of your own creation. I greatly appreciate the attempt which has been made here.I would love it if someone would make another attempt to re-make this game, with a much more intuitive interface and faster gameplay (without sacrificing tactical depth).Conclusion: Another reviewer put it very well, and far more succinctly than myself, when he said ""Successfully combines all of the worst parts of XCom with none of the good parts."" Although that's not quite 100% true, it's pretty funny and unfortunately rather accurate.			"

												If you don't want to read: 9/10 Turn-based Strategy; challenging, not punishing; multiplayer somewhat lacking.Longer version:The few Cons: Multiplayer is seriously sub-optimal for playing against strangers. Matches are hard to find, partially because there is no automatic search-function going that would find an opponent of the same strength for you, partially because one does not see if there are games to be had without staying on a screen that has that as the only function, and partially because when one creates a game one can't see if someone else makes a game you would be ready to accept.If you want Multiplayer, get 1-3 friends to challenge.Story Mode is short and minimal, and compensates by being absolutely brutal. However, normal missions are the bread and butter, story missions just the cheese&ham, so it is not all that much of a con. And Story Missions are not required at all, beyond for gaining few points to make life easier (see below).The game has the strategy common sin of being very hard for new players. However, there are mechanics in place for making starting all over easier the more one has played, and recovery within a save is quite possible. After some time, the difficulty, story missions aside, averages to medium-hard-easy: your starting troops are unreliable, in the middle the enemy may surprise you with better stuff than they began with, and at the end your experienced troops should not get easily overwhelmed. Half a con, if I may.Now for the good stuff:The game is quite balanced and has immense tactical depth.Micromanaging is possible and as deep as one wants it to be, but not required beyond the minimum awareness.The artstyle is good, while obviously not quite the same quality as AAA games. Few of us play TBS for absurdly good graphics, however, and it is beyond good enough.Single Player, despite being short on story, is varied and good enough for (looks at time played), at least 450+ hours. AI is a bit dump, however.This point can't pressed hard enough: Despite being a game made with a skeleton crew, the Devs are active on the forums and actually answer to constructive feedback beyond any and all call of duty. Nothing feels like having actual personal dialog with the devs, possibly multiple times a week.Bug reports are read and acted upon. Feedback is routinely checked. We get information about what is going to happen and often why.So as said: 9/10, bought this and both DLC:s, bought to two friends as presents and have 2 more copies to spare.PS. Do, by the way, buy the DLC:s. Cheapish, good, not gamebreaking, and makes the very start somewhat easier.			"

												To paint a picture:Somebody modded a Darkest Dungeon Scenario over XCom and disgruntled the RandomNumberGenerator. The game has been designed around a gamepad. While not an issue in combat, Menu navigation will feel clunky to mouse&keyboard. The game emulates the miniature tabletop game very faithfully. Hence character customization is leaning heavily on colors rather than shapes. Do Not Skip the Tutorials. While they are dry and boring, they explain every aspect of the game. This should spare you confusion, due to this being a tabletop ported to a video game. 4 factions come with the game, while 2 additionals are locked behind DLC (as would any future/unlikely additions) Loading a mission can take quite some time. At least, completing a mission in 20 minutes, would be on the fast side. The environment of a renaissance-style, cursed city is SPOT ON! The skill mechanic system is quite extensive, if subtle in effect. It's often a difficult balance between ""Completing Objectives""&""Looting the Area""&""Staying Alive""; leading to hard&strategical decisions. The RandomNumberGenerator will lead you into a false sense of security and then show you, how much it hates you! The city is littered with traps (or I am a trap magnet). Thankfully they have negative and positive effects. The Turnbased System, gives you all the time to devise a plan (and see it fail) and also makes the game a simple choice for livestreams.If a rather slow paced strategy game in which you get to fiddle with every move at your leisure, whilst a RNG is throwing a wrench in you gear in a cursed-city scenario, is your thing, then you may want to give Mordheim a closer look.

A nice matchmaking for multiplayer and ladder games for long term attraction like BB would be great.The dismal and dark setting from Mortheim is great and pretty implemented.

												Ok, let's see:- interesting turn-based combats? Check!- Warhammer atmosphere full of awesomeness? Check!- Numerous way to develop every member of your warband? Check- just to see him loosing his limb in the next battle? Hell yeah!- literally endless replayability with ""oh my god I should try this setup with this build"" nerdness and lots of battle scenarios/diffucullties? SureWhat you can do not like:- interface is kinda meh, you need an effort to get used to.- I spent half of hour to understand how to pick up these wyrdstones, I almost quit.- loot system - it's arbitrary and you need to understand your strategic goal is collect stones as much as your tactic situation affords you.- Also there is ONLY IRONMAN mode which is so cool for me, no way for save/load  disgrace, but someone with soft balls shouldn't even try it.Bottom line: it's wonderful turn-based squad strategy with deep customisation for every unit. Also it's Warhammer. I can't get enough of it.			"

												I'm giving this a qualified recommendation. All the criticisms in other posts are mostly on-point. You live and die by the RNG, but that's also very much like the tabletop game where a series of sub-par rolls will kill you. If living and dying by the dice isn't your thing, then stay away. The optional victory conditions are unnecessarily difficult because one side or the other usually routes before they can be fulfilled. Unlike the tabletop game, finding chests isn't easy, and in the early game isn't even all that rewarding. The graphics are subpar for a game where the meat of the experience takes place in first-person, and animations are lack-luster at best to the point of reminding of the Seinfeld episode where Raquel Welch was revealed to walk without moving her arms. That said, it's a reasonably accurate translation of the boardgame, and it is fun. When the game is on sale for 60% off, it's worth the money for tbs fans looking for something a little different. At full price ($39.99 at the time of this writing) it's only worth it for dedicated fans of the original tabletop game.Also, unlike the base game, the dlc is worth the asking price, sale or no.			"

												It was nice while it lasted. I was totally sold at first and spent hours designing and customizing my warbands and I had a blast playing those first few dozen games. For awhile I was taken back to the good ol' days of the tabletop version and was looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment. Well the honeymoon is over.Heavily bias RNG strikes again ruining yet another promising game. The trend these days is to kick a game out the door and artificially inflate its AI ""difficulty"" by throwing in a terribly unbalanced random aspect. This isn't fun and it's not engaging, it's simply frustrating and makes me want to uninstall the game.Missing dozens of point blank shots with a 80% chance of hitting, the npc AI slamming into your 60% parry/dodge warband members while landing strings of criticals and an endless procession of career ending injuries that pile up even if your character isn't taken out of action. All this could be yours and more!Games Workshop's IP has been dragged through the gutter for years with very few highlights (Dawn of War being the only reasonable exception) and this is just another game in a long line of products with so much potential that is ultimately a let down. I think I've learned my lesson and will be giving future GW titles a solid pass.			"

												Does it ever happen to you to start a game just to see what its like and then spend the next 24 hours thinking of nothing else, planning strategies in your head and asking yourself at work or while at the restaurant - how will you ever manage to send that shipment, will you have to start a new warband just because of that one mistake... Well, it does not happen often to me, and yes, this is that game.			"

Product received for free
												Behind the wall of shortcomings resides a tactical and thrilling gameplay so addictive that it kept me hooked for hours, even after my dragged on failed attempt with my first warband. As an enthusiast of Warhammer 40k, I've never fully realized how much I enjoy the Fantasy setting and Mordheim helped me see this.                For all the hours I've put into this game I’m still not sure if I can recommend it. Its price tag is getting dangerously close to that of AAA titles, but without the high production value that comes with this type of game. Mordheim is visibly crippled by its lack of production value at every step. It’s clunky, lacking unique content and in desperate need of an AI that can keep up. Overcoming all these issues can be hard. In return it can easily offer dozens of hours of challenging battles, tactical ingenuity and detailed characters development. Factoring in the multiplayer which provides the most intense experience and the replay value that comes with this type of games and there is already a lot of value in Mordheim: City of the Damned.                For the fans of the tabletop games it is great to see a new game in their favorite universe. The fans of tactical turn based games will find it as a good distraction until XCOM 2 comes out. And for the rest of the players it is probably safer to wait for a sale. As for me, it’s an enjoyable game with extremely high potential delivered in a tin crackling shell that constantly undermines Mordheim's best qualities.Pros:+ Great setting+ Complex character development+ Tactical combat+ Addictive+ Unforgiving+ Atmospheric+ Stays true to the universe and lore+ The multiple campaigns add up to the replay value Cons:- Average production value- Mouse support isn’t fully implemented- The battle UI is hard to navigate and has some issues- Lacks visual variety- Long loading screens (at launch)- AI can be awkwardly dumb- Various bugsRead the full review at:http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2015/12/mordheim-city-of-damned-review.html "

												Being a veteran from tabletop Mordheim I just had to try this game. Like most games I feel this game has its strong points, oddities and areas with room for improvement.Yay!- I like the graphics and the field of view when you run around the city with your warriors, at no time did I get odd camera angles or lost sight of my warrior.- I like the movement system and the option to retrace your steps when you realise you ran the wrong way (This ofcourse is not possible if you get ambushed/ step in a trap/ pick up loot.)- Once loading is finished the missions are smooth going.- I like the campaign system. The missions in itsself arent too varied but every battle is hugely differant anyways.- customization is quite nice. Some more wouldnt have hurt at all but you can give your warriors fairly uniqye appearances. I like it you can see on a model which sort of armor it wears and what weapons it holds.Undecided:- Some more information would be nice at times. The tutorial is quite informative but a little more explaination about how combat works would have been apprechiated.- Loading times. Pretty darn long. I guess this is where refills and bathroom breaks come in. Mitigated by the lack of loading once a mission starts.- Difficulty settings: I like it when I can decide myself at what difficulty I play. Yes, you can (ussaully) decide to stick to 'normal' missions but it'd be fun too if you once in a while were the stronger gang on paper yourself.- I am not in too far so maybe this still is to come but I'd be neat if there were engagements with more then 2 gangs involved. 2 weaker gangs ganging up on a stronger gang? Yes please.Nay-Only four types of gangs! I realise the studio is small and adding new gangs costs a lot of time but I for one wouldn't mind paying if some gangs were added as dlc's. Gimme orcs! Undead! Elves! Dwarves!-All games being Ironman can be heart rending when you lose a valued member of your gang. Not seeing what your taking out members of other gangs results in is a bit dull. Why can't member be captured?? I'd be nice to have some sort of league idea where 64 gangs slug it in Mordheim in a Blood Bowl tournament style. Then it's fun to cripple an opposing warband.Despite some nays I still think all in all the game is quite worth the bucks you pay for it. If you like turnbased strategy and warhammer fantasy then Mordheim is defenitely a game you should try.			"

Early Access Review
								It is painstakingly faithful to Mordheim's aesthetics, as a result - it looks excellent. The game's mechanics have certainly captured the 'feel' of playing Mordheim perfectly. (I spent many hours playing it growing up.) It is however, as has been made clear, incomplete. Only two warbands are currently playable and only two more are confirmed. There is currently maybe 10-15 hours gameplay and that's pushing it. I'm really, really excited as to where this game could go; and I really believe it has the makings of a huge success. I say this guardedly though. They've been very tight-lipped as to exactly what features are to be expected in the future and I can't help but feel we'll be waiting an incredibly long time for a game that will really hold our attention. Currently the only really playable feature is playing one of two warbands (Skaven or Human Mercenaries) in a pretty easy match whilst you fight against a warband with half your numbers. The maps are interesting, the gameplay rewarding. But as of now - there's no reason to pick this up over say, X-Com; unless you're purely playing for the Games Workshop IP.  It's expensive for what it is, but I consider it an investment into a really solid game so far. I'm very excited as to where this goes in the future. Don't disappoint us Mordheim!			"

Early Access Review
								Being a fan of the table top mini game, when I saw early access was out I jumped right in. Im a bit disappointed though. I think in an attempt to jazz up the interface Rogue Factor did this third person view and circles stuff. Its a nice attempt to make things a bit more interesting but I dont really think it works with a game like this. Its too complex in its current form, it feels clunky. I realize that its still in early access, but I think if they just used a traditional point and click it would have made things much more simple. I hope that they realize this too - I think this game has tons of potential but the movement system is too clunky for me. I think they could still have their areas of control, and zones, and stuff with a hex, or square based system. The game would be closer to its roots. Thats just what I think .Its a great game, good animation, and tons of potential. I think they have to simplify their movement system, and their interface. We'll see how it develops.			"

Early Access Review
								Fans of Mordheim stop reading this review and go buy it. It is, essentially, a perfect reproduction of the tabletop game. (once all warband maintenance is in properly over the next few weeks it will literally be perfect)For those of you who didn't play the tabletop game.The detail and love that has been invested in this game should be readily apparent from the 10 minute gameplay trailer above. However its so much more than that. The system is easy to learn, and yet has the kind of strategic depth that will keep Turn based Tactical players coming back for more and looking further and further into the little numbers that control the world.Flanking/Charging/Parrying/Dodging, reloading ranged weapons, jumping over gaps and off ledges. All make the genius of how they have you use your Strategy points (movement) within a series of rings marking where you will use a point up via movement. Go down some stairs and the lines readjust as you move making it always clear where and WHEN you will use one.Overwatch/Ambushes Keep moving players on their toes and make scouting important.And yet the game/battles/skirmishes themselves play out fast enough that no individual game will take longer than an hour and most will be over LONG before that. Especially in the early days of your Warbands when there arent maximum members.Theres a lot to love here from a gamers perspective. Turn Based Tactical games are easy to turn into ""Turn Based Repeat every other battle you have ever had here"" This one has enough fresh content with random maps that you can run even the 2 preset warbands in the first early access release at each other again and again and it will not play out the same way.If the final product (due for release Q1 next year) continues in this vein and from all the information i have found i see no reason why it shouldnt. It will be 10/10 from me.For now, 10/10 for the content provided. (its Alpha so i expected more bugs than i saw, theres literally only one that ive encountered in 7 games. and it wasnt game ending)			"

												Whoever decided to allow free weekend access to Mordheim needs a good smack, because this seems to be specifically designed to make your first several hours' play as frustrating and annoying as possible. It may well be that once you get into hours 10-20 it gets really enjoyable, but that's unlikely to happen in one free weekend, and the only people who are likely to power through a dozen or so hours of screen-punching are people who have paid full price and are invested in the game. Anyone given a few hours to try it out is likely to come away with the impression that the last thing they want to do is play any more of that annoying nightmare.It comes down to design, which has presumably been fixed in order to ramp up difficulty and make the game more ""hard core"". The trouble is, whilst most gamers enjoy a tough challenge, what really pisses us off are stupid/illogical game mechanics that have obviously been introduced simply to make success harder. Looting, mission objectives and combat mechanics all conspire to make it impossible to get a good result from a mission. Here's why:You take control of a warband of your chosen faction, a bunch of 5 newbie toons who, in good RPG tradition, you expect to start levelling up and improving. The leader of your faction puts in an order for wyrdstones, and you need to get X stones within Y days or you'll fail: 4 fails and it's game over. You enter Mordheim seeking wyrdstones and other loot. So far, so good. At the start of a mission you see there are, for example, 20 wyrdstones and 15 scavenging points around the city, so you examine the map and think OK, I'll send a couple of guys this way, another couple over there, maybe one to hang back and guard our cart.First off, movement is incredibly slow. It may take you 2 or 3 turns to reach that pile of wyrdstones. Secondly, your inventory is ridiculously tiny - 3 items total?? Forget about carrying potions or buffs! Of course, you can dump stuff in your cart then head back out, but that takes twice the time. And if you get to the stones and there are 4+, you're going to need 2 people (40% of your entire force) or 2 trips (4-6 turns, which is an eternity) to get them.None of which would be a problem if time wasn't such a huge issue, but it is because of how combat works. Within 2 rounds, maybe 3 at most, you're going to run into the opposition. Now, being outnumbered is a real problem in Mordheim, because if you are you have to face an ""All Alone"" roll every turn, and if you fail you flee. And you can very easily get outnumbered because as soon as one of the opposing warband engages one of your guys, EVERY OTHER ENEMY RUSHES IN TO JOIN THE FIGHT. Fights aren't quick, one-shot affairs either, it'll take your newbs several turns to eliminate any enemy, and in those turns all his mates arrive. If you don't immediately start rushing all your own men to the fight, your guys are going to get overwhelmed and killed or forced to flee.What this all boils down to is this: you may think you have a bit of time to explore, wander round collecting the stuff you need to not fail and end the game, but in actual fact what happens is that within about 2 turns a fight will start, and you then have to rush all your men to fight all the enemies and see who wins. No exploration, no gathering, no tactics, just a quick rush into an all-out brawl.And even that wouldn't necessarily be too bad if you could then get back to collecting the very stones you'd come to collect (assuming you won the fight), but no! Once you've won the fight, it's mission over! What do you mean, you didn't explore any scavenge points? What do you mean you didn't go and pick up that pile of stones 20 yards away? It doesn't matter! The last enemy's dead, so poof, it's back to base IMMEDIATELY! And yes, leave all that gear and loot that's LITERALLY RIGHT AT YOUR FEET!It's so frustrating, because you can see how this could have been such a great game, but sadly the devs have decided that they need to make this game ""hard core"", so they've just introduced really stupid and illogical mechanics to achieve that regardless of how much that pisses players off. I'd love to explore Mordheim, roaming around in what looks like a fascinating setting, but in reality all that happens is that you and the enemy locate each other pretty quickly, an all-in melee ensues, and at the end the mission's over. They may as well just have made this an arena brawler. Shame.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is written, based on the first step in early access, and a lot of it is based on what the developers are promising and hopefully deliver,This game have so much potential. It is a tactical game that will generate user-stories based on skirmishes with other players, simply because it is so immersive.The team have created a game that is very true to the concept of the table top game, with the right amount of changes to the rule set to be amazing for the video game scene.I'm really excited and can not wait for all the features to be implemented.But I have also been waiting  for a long time for the Mordheim game being adapted to an online game.For those that are not that familiar with Warhammer and/or Mordheim, no doubt, you should keep an eye with this game, if you are in to strategy games and games where you develop your character or team over time....but you should wait, until a few more steps have been implemented.As for right now, there is not that much to do in the game.- You can go through the tutorial, that still are missing some features- You can play against an easy CPU (your teams strength is about twice as good as the CPU's team)There is still some problems connecting with other players, but it is promised that it will be worked on and fixed soon.Again, this game is most likely to become awesome, but it is still a very barebone product.UPDATE AFTER 1ST PATCH;Connection issues to other players seem to have been fixed. Been able to load the last five games. This is a big improvement.Though, that patch have added some issues with moving up and down stairs, which sometimes cage your characters.This is still an improvement, as you now can test the game against other players, though still with a set warband. Next content update, should add some options to customize your warband.			"

												I want to like this game. Actually, I want to love this game. But it is too strategically limited, too slow, and just too random. Let me explain...On the plus side, the game evokes the Warhammer feel very well, and the ruined city idea means the developers have been able to create environments which are tactically interesting without seeming contrived. So I keep wanting play it - to dive into the evocative ruins, in a brutal, scrappy series of skirmishes where the risk of permadeath gives extra weight to every decision. That’s really appealing!But....First off, as lots of peoples' reviews have noted, as a player you are often victim of the random number generator. And this can be spectacularly random. (As an extreme example, consider that if you cast a spell there is a random chance of something bad happening; one of those things is that the character can lose all his hitpoints; if a character loses all his hitpoints, there is a random chance of permanent death. So, on one occasion I had my fully-healthy leader lose all his hit points as a random result of casting a healing spell – and I could have lost him entirely. Seriously.) Now, some will say ""ah but Warhammer is always strongly random."" And that’s true. But that doesn't change the problem that there is a basic disjointedness between actions and consequences - if your main character can be killed because you decide to cast a healing spell, or if a glass-canon or scout-type character can be killed because a random set-up put him/her right next to a pack of enemies, this is not rewarding or fun. It's just dis-empowering.Secondly, this game is slow. Really, really slow. You wait while each enemy warrior moves even if you can't see him/her. The user interface takes a little while to go through, so your own turns aren’t uick. And then at the end of each turn you even have to sit through a message saying that the game is processing a move for each of the already dead enemies. So, even if you take a direct approach to hunting out your enemies it can take a while to finish a mission. And if you decide to try hit-and-run tactics, or lay traps and goad the enemy, etc., then it takes even longer. (The last mission I played it took 3 hours just to kill off four enemy mooks.) And of course because it is so slow you often won't bother trying different tactics - it's much less frustrating to just use a direct approach.And the same problem of pacing that bedevils the tactical game also impacts the strategic arc. Upgrades to troops are earned slowly, and don't often seem to have much real impact. A typical upgrade might give you a bonus of a few percent to some skill or other. (So, after X hours of grinding a character, what do I have to show for it? +4% to something or other? Hmm.)This leads to the third point - that there just isn't much room for experimenting with different strategies. After 20 hours my main warband was basically doing the same stuff it was doing at the outset, but with slightly higher stats. Nor is my strategy even really one I've chosen - it's just the strategy that seems to work best across all warbands. (I tried developing a hit-and-run style, I tried a missile-weapon-based warband that lured enemies into murder zones... nope, those strategies just aren't as viable as what appears to be the expected strategy.) And trying different warbands opened up no apparent strategic options, as each band (with a few minor variations, like the Sisters not having many missile troops) basically behaves the same way. By comparison, in the XCOM or Shadowrun games, as examples, having different combinations of characters allows you to approach missions in very different ways, and as the characters level up this opens up new playing styles and tactical options; in Mordheim, however, the slowly granted bonuses are really just allowing the characters to do the same stuff that they did before (perhaps with a little more specialization).So, I really want to love this game. I enjoy the feeling of the cities, and am enticed by the idea of delving into the chaos-riddled ruins. But unless you're a die-hard Warhammer fan you may find that there is only so much fun to be had from ploddingly repeating the same tactics over and over and hoping that the random number generator doesn't do anything too crazy.

												Great game! It's challenging and rewarding . . . sometimes pain. You really want your warband members to survive, since they can suffer permanent injuries or permanent death. Warbands can be customized and you can fight other players online. I spent over 300 hours in this game and I'm still not done, because the campaigns are huge.I just hope there will be more warbands in future, since the warhammer universe has so many awesome races. I think the game needs orcs and dwarves, but the 4 existing warbands are still fun to play. The DLC characters added to the game, are good to improve your warband and give you even more ways to make an unique warband.			"

												I really want to like this game... its got loads of positive qualities (the atmosphere, the fact that it's bloody MORDHEIM, and the the overall gameplay). However, there are some aspects that basically just kill it. Secondary objectives, and the wyrdstone loot (which is entirely necessary for you to get) are scattered throughout the map, and require you to pick it up, with a terrible inventory system which limits 3 pieces of loot per character. Also, there's basically no way to keep exploring/looting once combat is initiated, unless you're willing to sacrifice valuable members of your warband as cannon fodder to allow the rest of your guys to go scavenging around for stuff. Not to mention, any stuff looted by your warband members that are downed during a battle is lost... and there's no way to keep looking around after a battle is over. Even if you are winning, these battles can just end abruptly with a rout failure, making you lose any further stuff you might have gained. Also, I wish there was more customizability for your warband, more than one type of hero, etc, and maybe a couple more customizability options for each character type. But alas, its a great plan, and I hope it gets better... but as of now, I can't recommend it.			"

												This is an excellent port from the tabletop version of the game.  As an avid Mordheim player for the better part of two decades, it was great to finally have a platform version that does not suck something fierce.  My only gripe is that all of the original warbands from the book are not here.  Two Mercenary factions are missing and the Undead are completely gone.  I am looking forward to the prospect of other warbands being included like the Chaos Dwarf Slavers, Night Elves, and the Clan Skyre for the Skaven.  Also different map scenarios like Rush for the Treasure that were expansions in the Town Crier for the tabletop version.  These additions would make Mordheim complete for me.			"

												With over 60 hours on record, I give this game a huge thumbs up.  All of the complaints about hit percentages are unfounded.  I belive the percent chance to hit shown does not calculate the doge or parry chance of the enemy.  Therefore for example, a 90% hit chance will hit 9 times out of 10, unless the enemy dodges or parries.  I think the balance is quite challenging.    Finally a game that does not just let the player walk thru with ease.  This challenge has kept me interested for many hours.			"

												I saw it, I bought it, I love it.A good game for people like me that have limited multitasking skills and dislike managing massive armies.Tactical slow phased action with a nice (but steep) learning curve, filled with information that might scare some people off, but after taking some time to read its actually somewhat easy to understand.Immersive character progression and creation and after roughly 5 hours I have a newbie-leader, one experienced Hero with one eye, maimed hand and amnesia, a twitchy warrior and one with head trauma.The only downside to this game I have noticed so far is that the UI in combat can be somewhat of a hassle.Too many ""hidden"" menus with odd shortcuts. I would rather have the option to have some menus, like the available actions in combat to be always present to either side or the bottom of the screen.21/21 Golfballs.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, its early access, so lets hope it will be improved. Gameplay: nice implementation of the miniature game, however, orientation on the battlefield is little bit limited, due the insufficient mapAtmosphere, graphics: great but colors are too desaturated. Do not expect, that the game looks like the screenshots in the setam store. The ingame scenes are allmost black and white (i do play on highest gfx settings)User interface: Terrible, the game is designed for consoles, the PC version is implementing this 1:1 this needs polishing, i hope, this will be really improvedI think, there is a lot of potential, but it needs lot of work, at this stage, i would not recommend this (as steam does not have a ""neutral thumb"", which is something i would choose)			"

												Great game, very addictive. You get strangely attached to the members of your warband and when one dies it's gutting! I've only played as Chaos so far and I have to say that the comments about the mutations making them unplayable are dumb. Just adapt to them or hire another Hero and try again. The game loses some of it's appeal when everyone is at max level anyway. The RNG can be frustrating at times but that's just the nature of it. I've read a few of the negative reviews and they seem to either be people who don't understand how to take advantage of the poor enemy AI, board game players with lofty expectations or are sufferers of RNG PTSD. The only things I would really like to see are more customisation choices and more warbands to choose from.Overall 8/10 and fun enough to have prompted me to write my first review.			"

												This game is a sad joke to anyone who knows the first things about statistics.  the percentages it shows for chance to hit and dodge or parry are complete lies.  a 90% chance to do something will fail 70% of the time on most ai opponents.  the ai gets +10 damage as if they had blue weapons from the start of the game.  the only way you win anything is by 3v1-ing crap before the rest of the enemy team shows up.  if the show up before then, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ automatic loss.  (this is on normal missions, forget doing hard, or brutal, the bonuses are so huge at that point if you don't get perfect deployment and perfect luck you lose every time.  this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from a mathematical standpoint and a frustrating piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.  it might be fun for 5 mins but when you realise that everything you do is automatically going to result in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths of your characters due to the super-powered ai who can charge and ambush atomatically every time because your ranges are the same and their actions auto trigger, you won't want to play this garbage any more.  fix your frucking game.edit:  2 months later, still broken as ♥♥♥♥.  a match that should have ended went on for 3 more turns with the ai route check succeeding 3 times and a marauder w/ a 2h sword 1v3ing through 3 max health opponents dodging 13 consecutive 80%+ attacks.  the math behind this game is just ♥♥♥♥ing broken.  not worth any money			"

												I'd give this game a neutral review but since Steam only allow for a thumbs up or thumbs down, ill have to lean towards negative. But only for one main reason: this game is not Mordheim.If you have ever played tabletop Mordheim and were expecting this to be a direct translation, you'll be disappointed. In and of it self this game is an ok game for its genre, it's not a great game though. That's not to bash Rouge factor. Like tabletop Mordheim, Rouge Factor probably didnt get a lot of funding from Games Workshop. TT Mordheim had simple skirmish combat system that made for great quick battles. And Half the fun of the game was the awesome leveling system they used. It was a very casual friendly game. TT wasnt perfect, and had some issues, but with a few house rules it was a great system. Instead of making a translation from TT, Rouge factor (or GW) decided to make their own system based of the Mordhiem setting. Maybe they didnt think that space hulk or blood bowl sold enough (those games where more of a direct translation). The game mechanic system that rouge factor made seems overcomplicated for what it does, half my play time was spent trying to figure the system out. Where in tabletop you could level up almost every battle. In this game there is a lot more grind involved. When you level up in this game, a lot of the time its hard to notice any improvement. There doesnt seem to be a whole lot of game variations so it can get repetitive fairly quick.Pros: This city visuals are amazing. The cities really have the look and feel of Mordheim. Unless you had tons of dosh, and/or time and skill. You would not be able to get that on tabletop.The Developers seem to actually read and respond on the forums far more than most game Devs do. So props for that.Cons:Way too much grind in this game. Its usually not a good thing if game develops substitute grind in place of content.City movement is very restrictive and constrained. You can only climb/jump in certain spots, even though that ledge looks just as good as this one. Many times you'll find an area that looks like you can move no problem, too bad its impassable. Rotting paper thin door blocking your way? Nope cant kick it down. Trying to get into a locked “cell”(that only has two walled sides and no roof, with a grated door skaven could easily climb over) and you dont have a key? Too bad.Lack of visual character customization. Im guessing that they had plans for lots of customization, but ran out of time and/or money. Some units have a few options, most have very little.Too much focus on gathering wyrdstone during the battle. In TT this was mostly handled in the post battle sequence. It just gets too repetitive in this game. If they streamlined the system of picking it up, it would be much better.I can appreciate and understand why the developers made their own game mechanic system instead of making a more direct translation from tabletop. But, to honest I much prefer the original.			"

												Good concept but poor execution. Unpolished. Long loading times are inconvenient but turns take too long to complete as well. Lack of soldier customization other than outfit colors. Grind required to get to the good bits.On the plus side, hilarity ensues when soldiers lose an arm or become insane. Combat is good enough. Will probably appeal to Warhammer fans and/or fans of tabletop.			"

Early Access Review
								Excellent rendition (so far!) of a classic table-top game.  While there are some rule/play changes I think they might actually serve to enhance the game.   Such as strategic points (how many actions a toon can do) to the negation of the W (wounds) characteristic , and instead, a pool of hit points.  Saw something about Idols,  and that did seem a little hokey.Music and atmospheric effects are right on.  Graphics ditto.  The even have Morslieb correct.  (That green little moon).Read a comment about Ranged troops being over-powered.  In table-top, where one shot takes out a warrior, and ranged troops always in hard cover, they were just as dominant.Not enough here for yet for someone who is new to Mordheim.  Once warband experience and equipment is functional, then its a hell ya. "

												Mordheim is definitely worthwhile despite what negative reviews it might have. Missions will begin to take on a repetitive nature, but the random mission generator has kept every single encounter fresh. Party and character progress really hooked me from the beginning. It's only when you max out your heroes and complete the story quests that the game leaves nothing left to offer. By that time though, you've put in 100 hours like me.The game forces iron man mode on you and there are ways to mitigate the danger that your party ever gets into, even if a mission ends up being a slaughterhouse. If you avoid the most difficult missions, the game can actually be quite easy. This can be due in part to the AI not being as good as it should be (the worst being that opponents will swap between targets if they're surrounded instead on focusing on the one with the lowest HP and impressives often get stuck on the geometry of the map). I found it no trouble to replace warriors that died or were too wounded to be useful because of the system that allows you to hire a rotating list of leveled units.Overall, it's got engaging combat, factions with unique personalities, and gameplay that hooked me. I personally don't think the DLC is worth it, but if you're the type that loves the game so much that you'll start a new warband once maxing your main, then I see the appeal.			"

								After playing all the Tutorial missions and a skirmish game i can recommend this game.  What we have here is a solid set of core game mechanics and two warbands to try said mechanics out. The devs promise more Mordheim eskqe soon along with Warband management, a feature that anyone who played the GW version of the game wants.This game has great potential and i look forward to seeing what happens next.

Early Access Review
								I played the Mordheim 😊 at steam all week!  Humans are a little better than the Skaven(ses) 😊.  I think it is because the Reiklander heroes do melee damage higher than the listed amount on the screen and the Ogre is a boss, but the ogre is well an ogre..  The 2 Warp Guard (used to be black skaven) feel a bit weak too.  The one listed “black skaven” is pretty good though with claws and strength.. The rat ogre started out weak for a rat ogre but he has improved in damage and the ogre has reduced a little but is still the biggest damage dealer.. he can roll a good critical hit 7% of the time that will floor the rat ogre in one of 2 swings with a great hammer.. They could fix it with a little more move on the skaven to improve the swarm feel of the troops but it is still prerelease and no saved game yet..  They need to at least list the damage of the humans correctly.. Man they have the buildings too.  And fountains of fishes with blood and bubbles..  Sewers galore and chaos eyes are every were..  Its not ready for standard gamers yet.. 😊  its only the 2nd week of early release and they have 18 more to go.. It seems better than blood bowl was to start but you have to keep verifying the game code after every game.. then there is the disconnects, campaign advancement, adding Possessed, adding Sisters, better A.I., and bot losses that need to get fixed but I am pretty sure they will hammer that stuff out with time..

												This game is amazing and will either make you hate it or love it!To begin with it will be hard, but as you progress and learn how the game works (do the tutorials and watch some gameplay if you want your warband to live) you will start appreciating the difficulty of the game.If you want to check out some gameplay videos, take a look at my YouTube Channel: youtube.com/GamekNightPlays as I cover this game vigorusly!-------------------------------------------Pros:High replayability - it is almost impossible to have two missions that are the same with the randomized maps and variation in the warbands. There are also a ton of different ways you can skill up your warriors making different builds that suit your playstyle.Exciting gameplay - you will find yourself in situations where you need to make difficult descisions and that descision will mean life or death of your warriors.Great atmosphere - The city really feels like Mordheim, just beware of traps and daemons ;)Story missions - if you want to explore the Dramatis Persona's stories you can do that. They are well written with voice acting to accompany them and brings a completely new aspect to the regular missions that you face. Just be aware that these missions are usually tougher and you should prepare accordingly!------------------------------------Cons:I'm not oblivious to the problems that the game has, so here are a couple of things. Sometimes the AI will act really weird or get stuck on things - which is due to horrible pathing issues. Sometimes this saves the life of your warband and can feel a bit like cheating.The graphics are not the prettiest - but then again nor is life in Mordheim. I feel that more work could have gone into the models to make them look truly amazing.PvP is hard to setup with the lack of a matchmaking system - but there are steam groups that are dedicated to bringing people together to setup matches, just like in the TT.-------------------------------------------Remember going into this that it is a video game adaptation - not a direct port - of the tabletop game. This means that some things are different, will feel different - but I asure you that this is Mordheim in it's finest form.Thanks for reading buddy - I hope you will find your way into MordheimHave a wonderful Game kNight!youtube.com/GamekNightPlays "

Early Access Review
								Mordheim: City of the Damned  is a  Turn-Based Strategy Game that´s based on the Rules of the Games Workshop Tabletop Game Mordheim. Mordheim: CotD offers the Player the possibility to explore the ruined City of Mordheim with his Warband to scavenge for wyrdstone and treasure and  of course to battle rival warbands. Mordheim offers a single player mode as well as a multiplayer mode. The game looks fantastic and can be both great fun and highly frustrating due to its Games Workshop typical randomness.  The tactical fights in Mordheim are, especially during the first half dozen or so fights, challenging, not so much because of the brilliant AI, but in Hard, Brutal or even Deadly Maps the AI Units get buffed to the point where unskilled warbands are very likely to perish. The more strategic side of the game (levelling your warband and picking the right skills) is fun and rewarding, but due to the lack of a save game option your faults will be permant and that might proof to be very frustrating for players new to Mordheim.  The developer decided to make the game a permanent ""hard-core"" mode, meaning there is only autosave and closing the game during a battle (or the game crashing) will leave your warband in a devastated condition (wounded, missing equipment,probably even dead).So IF you allready play the Tabletop game and like it: buy Mordheim:Cotd. But as for now I wouldn´t recommend Mordheim: CotD to casual gamers because of the formentioned ""Perma Hard-Core Mode"", the game might proof to be to frustrating and time consuming to build up even your first warband.

												I really wanted to recommend this game, because it does so many things so well.  However, the things it does badly are ruin-your-day badly things that turn me off the entire experience.The theme, the graphics, sound, and warband levelling? Brilliant.  Takes me back to my childhood when the tabletop game was released.  It's everything I could've wanted.  Warband options and customization I hadn't expected, and the campaign mode's persistent unlock system - across all your failed games - is a really nice touch. However... None of that awesomeness is worth enduring:  worse-than-XCOM unfair RNG (seriously, even XCOM's non-insane difficulties have a hidden adjustment to save you from complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t failing every 90% chance you come across until you lose) impenetrable/clumsy UI flat-out nonsensical pathing restrictions unintuive-at-best-nonsensical-at-worst rules restrictions (""I know you just found a valuable cluster of wyrdstone, but we can't let you drop that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ penny you found to free up some inventory room to go grab it""),  complete failure to communicate critical mechanics in-game in a reliably consistent way (""I could defend on another turn... why can't I now?!"")   Straight-up, no excuses, stupid mechanics - like having to keep your warband dancing around your nearly-finished opponent in terror that you might accidentally win too quickly, leaving all the loot uncollected, and all the secondary objectives failed.  WHAT KIND OF IDIOT DESIGNER PUNISHES YOU FOR WINNING TOO QUICKLY?Even mouse-over tooltips are missing.  How hard is it to have mouse-over tooltips for stats so you actually know what that symbol means without having to go read the manual?The game had me thinking, ""That's so awesome,"" on a regular basis, but on the balance of it, it had me snarling, ""THAT'S SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T,"" far more often.  And not in the fun way.  Whether it's your supposedly-nimble ratmen blocked off from a critical route by an ankle-high obstacle, failing every high-percentage roll you make while the enemy doesn't seem to suffer the same problem, or a UI that makes you shift through several different menus just to equip your team with some gear, the negatives have so much of an impact that all the positives stop being enticing enough to encourage me to persevere through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  The UI and its problems are probably the most unforgivable, especially when you can see how elegantly other games  can do it.  I want to fight other warbands, not fight the UI.			"

												Preface; Don't trust the store page screenshots, fewer than half are actual screenshots of the game and the game has so much asset overuse and OTT particle effects that it runs like garbage all the time - This is on an i7 skylake with a £550 GFX card.Good points:-+ Great voice acting+ Concise UI (but it's scattered across multiple panes)+ Great story+ Truthful to the lore+ Interesting characters+ Good tutorialBad points (oh here we go…):-- Imbalanced gameplay- Little strategy (as a result of the pseudo random generator and unbalanced gameplay)- Grinding is the only way to play- Hard because it has a lot to live up to, not because it is- Endlessly punishing and unfair progression- UI has been seperated into windows, making it difficult to see all the information you need as you have to slam your ctrl and alt keys almost constantly to get information you need- Exceptionally dumb AI- Clippy terrain- Toxic community- Zero character development- Badly designed singleplayer- Lacklustre multiplayer (1v1 only)- Zero multiplayer incentive- A tiny collection of units with only 4 factions, a fraction of the number in the orginal game- Few cosmetic choices- Annoying tutorial you can't skip or disable EVERYTIME you create a new playthroughI’ve been with Mordheim since the very beginning; I’ve seen it have hits and misses when it comes to updates, but the end product of the game was ultimately not worth the money I paid for it.To elaborate on some of the points above, Mordheim is made to be punishing past the point of challenging and into the realms of stressful, irritating and boring. Every encounter is stacked against you, even the easiest encounters; as such you are always losing units and making an uphill battle into a late game progression you realistically can’t win.Mordheim is less of a race with a reward and more of a marathon that doesn’t end. It starts fun but quickly kills that fun by playing the “I’m a hard game because I need to be” rather than “I’m a hard game because I naturally am that way due to my mechanics”.The AI (which will be your primary opponent) still runs into walls and misses tactical advantages that would win them the game; however it makes up for this by having a huge overhead advantage on you from the start. The AI is through and through dumb. It gets caught on doorframes, misses easy wins and even damages itself. In the later stages, winning is determined by exploiting the dumb AI rather than playing tatically.Oh and don't bother with multiplayer, it's bland and often exploited by bad sight lines, biased spawns and imbalanced factions.There is currently an issue with the ""ambush"" feature, which allows you to end your turn but attack any enemies that come close. However, there is a small area where you can engage the unit set to ""ambush"" mode. I kid you not it is about 2 pixels in extra distance. you can get extremely lucky and try to pixel hunt for this area, risking being charged and hit. But that AI can calculate this and has no issue with charging you those 2 pixels out of your attack range, effectively making the ambush feature 100% useless unless you are in close quarters, at which point you may as well kill your own unit because the enemy AI will always have better units than you.To this end, the game quickly begins to seem like a grind, you are always going up a slope slowly and small setbacks have big impacts. Some people may enjoy that, but I don't like grinding in progression, I like to feel like I'm gaining headway every game I play. Not feeling like i'm making progress slowly kills interest in the game for me.The developer's solution for poor AI (that they keep refusing to fix) is just to heap on the imbalance with each mission. To this extent the game gets tiring and absurd very quickly.The way customisation and side missions have been implemented reeks of laziness. The developers couldn’t even be bothered to explain cosmetic customisation beyond “Style 1” and “Style 2”.That said, Mordheim follows a copy and paste layout in generalA typical Mordheim warband play through is this:1)	Randomly generated mission2)	Collectable request3)	Randomly generated mission4)	Randomly generated mission5)	Randomly generated mission6)	Randomly generated mission7)	Scripted mission8)	Collectable request9)	Randomly generated mission10)	Randomly generated mission11)	Randomly generated mission12)	Randomly generated mission13)	Randomly generated mission14)	Randomly generated mission15)	Etc.16)	Warband becomes so crippled you are forced to start again17)	Repeat at 1)On this subject, the scripted quests are so badly designed I never play them. It's always the same map with a differant scenario and items. Most often this includes taking an item to a specific place and using it, however, the map view is top down only and the quest interactions are highlighted by a gold circle where you need to interact. Not only are these circles tiny, they also can't be seen via the map unless you zoom into the closest level and pray they aren't indoors, otherwise you won't see them at all.This design is the biggest threat, not the enemies or setup of the challange. And that is a huge shame. A player shouldn't be fighting against the interface or controls to play the game.It’s impossible to explore this vast city that was made, since the AI will just charge you regardless if they are outnumbered and/or outgunned. This means you get to see tiny parts of the maps, which are very loosely randomly generated and after a while, you get to know the maps inside out because there are so few of them, as many of them have been reserved for scripted missions (which are poorly designed, see above). The maps are large at times, but you often only get put in a small area to play with.In the end, every warband you make will fail because you need to keep up to date with deliveries (which the game does a terrible job of explaining), this means you can't buy new warriors all the time and every injury sets you back by days and gradually makes you fall behind.That said, every mission is the same tatic; group up, go in as a group and just pray for crits and getting that 2% chance you need to win. To this extent, this is the primary reason why I do not like Mordheim, in tabletop Warhammer games, there was always a diverse scenario to be played. But here it's dummed down into focusing enemy units and playing watered down randomly generated scenarios.If you want you can go for the side objectives, which there are three of (yes a whole three!), these side objectives are often highly optimistic, due to how the maps are asymmetrically generated, it's common for the objective to be impossible to complete because the side objective markers are too far away from your starting point. The AI will just charge you and you will have the choice:a) Risk losing most of your armyb) Do the side objective and get a tiny bit more xp at the end of the gameIf you don't do B, your army falls behind in xp and gear and you end up being even more outclassed later on.There were a lot of ups and downs in the development, but it ultimately ended in a game that ended up worse than it started off as over a year ago.Mordheim is dumb, shallow and a waste of money.The Multiplayer is terrible and the singleplayer is even worse. Funnily enough single player seems to have the most effort put into it, of all things.It does no justice to the current failing licence, it had potential, but I seriously doubt that the developers will make it better. Don’t bother.			"

												This game has come a long way since it first released in Early Access. Now there is a persistent, fleshed out campaign for all four factions currently in the game and the interface and gameplay is smoother than it has ever been. Characters level up, get new equipment and start to take on personalities for themselves (with your imagination) sort of like XCOM and it really sucks when someone you've been grooming for greatness gets taken out completely. Also, be careful, the campaign mode does have a game over/perma death feature. Unfortunately those loading screens are still absolutely horrendous... especially when some of the levels last just as long as they do. Honestly though, there has never been a better representation of the Tabletop game of Mordheim on a visual medium than this game and I only hope more factions can be added, more humour brought from the actual game itself, and more content be added into this already complete package. Definitely recommended.Gameplay Footage:

If you enjoy turn based combat, leveling up, loot with the danger of permenant death and injuries to your team, then this is the game for you.Only 4 different warbands to choose from now but I expect once most of the bugs have been ironed out the devs will look to adding additional warbands.Thumbs-up			"

												I really really love this game. There is alot of content. It's turn based in a 3d environment. (mind blown) and there is equipment and skill and spell capabilities. (insert changed pants here)I was never a fan of Warhammer the table top but I loved the idea and concept. This is an excellent atlernative to someone who wants to avoid measuring tapes and overthinking situations. Granted occassionally the environment makes the AI dumb you can always play with another live player which is an exciting if not terrorizing concept. This game can be unforgiving to mistakes or going out alone with one of your heroes. (Stay together least you come back missing a leg or arm, for spellcasters that is TERRIBLE)I'd like to see more warbands and some more customization come to the game but this does not detract from the fact that this game absolutely took over my life and I am no where near completing all I want to do with all the warbands.This game is pretty awesome. It's a no brainer to purchase if you love Turn Based.PS The undead are a great addition.			"

								[27.09.2015]The game is early access (<--means the game isn´t close to be finished yet, so if you want to buy the game, be sure to do it to support the development and not really to play a finished game) and its very clear, that there is still much more work to be done. In this ""Early Access Review"", I will focus on what the game currently has and not what it currently lacks. -The graphics are quite nice and the character models look like the tabletop figures i know and love from my Warhammer Army.-When you built your Warband you can choose their weapons, the abilities and uprade certain qualities like strength/intelligence/initiative etc., name them/change the name of your warband,   adjust their looks. -Skirmish Mode: You fight against human enemies or CPU and you are able to determine the starting conditions of the game (like: all troops in one place or spread all over the map/the winning conditions etc.), however you are not able to choose what CPU army you want to fight, so if you want to fight a specific CPU army you need to make a private lobby and click on the CPU button till you have the enemy of your choice.The game is turn-based, in your turn you...: You walk a certain distance You can engage the enemy You attack/do magic You can loot enemies You are able to flee  You can lurk for enemys to get near to your position for an auto attack  You can increase your fighters defencehowever there are no phases like in the Warhammer tabletop game, so you have more freedom in what to do when you wanna do it.-The Campaign mode is now in the game (it´s the main game focus): In this mode you built your Warband from the ground up, equip their weapons etc., then you choose one of the 2 randomly generated missions, you earn experience, you can loot dead enemies to find new weapons etc. After you finish your mission, you have to pay your soldiers and pay the treatment of their wounds. However if one of your soldiers needs treatment, you can´t use him for a period of time (4 days for example), which can really f**** up your Warband, so you need to play very carefully. Your main objective is to smuggle a certain weight of your warpstone out of Mordheim to your contractee, you earn warpstone by winning missions, but you have only some days to gather enough warpstone for the next shipment. You can go to the shop to purchase armor, weapons and potions etc. for gold. When you are done end your day by clicking on a tent, your warriors will lern skills and the treatment days for the injured will reduce by 1. Then you go on your next missions, or a story mission, that has different objectives and conditions.-The CPU is challening, but combat against other players is much harder.-The game costs plenty of money in early access and it will even become more expensive after early access. Maybe because the Warhammer license is really pricey, but however it limits the people who will buy the game strictly, because no one who doesn´t love the Warhammer universe  will buy this game. (<--At least that are the reactions, that I saw when talking and reading about the game).-The tutorials are only battles with text sometimes and you can´t just read the text in an extra menu (<--Might be improved in the future)-Only four warbands will be aviable at the release wich is my major source of criticism because in the tabletop version of mordheim you are able to choose from 15 warbands. I understand, that making new warbands is pricey and much work, but at least the Witchhunters and the Undead would be very interesting to play and add much more variety to the game.However we will get more after release, through DLCs and this is perfectly fine as long as they have a reasonable price (4-5€)-Although the game is still in Early Access, it seems nearly finished and progressed in the right direction.[I´m German and only made the review in english because the whole game is in english, so there is the possibility of grammatical errors in this review]			"

								This game is very promising compare to warhammer, from what i've seen their updates are frequent and is one of the few of its kind actually enjoyable, with its features of future updates it will be exciting to play this game since some the features are similar to of x-com with perma death, inventory, rankups etc i highly recommend this game a lil later on once a few more of the features come out			"

												Same as everyone else the RNG is just messed right up.I can put that aside sometimes, but every mission seems repetative, group up, find enemies and have a giant melee of missing and being critted.The mandatory shipments are just rediculous, nothing like playing a game and not being able to continue unless you send away 3/4 worth of your $$.The multiplayer has nothing to offer, if it were a system of doing matchmaking, playing a game and actually splitting up your warband to get as much stuff as you can it would be great.But no one does it because there is no matchmaking so all you get to do is group up and get in a cluster ♥♥♥♥ with the computer until 1 warband runs.If they did away with the mandatory shipments and tride to breath some life into multiplayer I would recommend this game, until then no			"

												Nice game if you can pick it up for under 10$ it might maybe be okayish.Mordheim: City of the Damned, bringing Games Workshop marketing & money grab to the gaming world Episode IXBe prepared for:-endless random missions that all kinda feel the same-campaigns that add even more missions (not random but also not fun)-a console ui that is purely written for controler input (always a big plus)-new factions that will be sold per model not per faction(not so soon tm)-current factions that are sold per model not per faction(starter packs included in the game)-no modding support, who would like to write his own campain for a tabletop/rpg port anyways-an engine that is troubled to support more than 20 models, so we will never so anything other than 1 vs. 1-loading times that are officially deductable from any time you have to serve in hell			"

												Really old-school gamer here, I've been looking for a game like this for a looooong time!  This game is phenomenal!  I've never felt inclined to review a game until Mordheim came along, so this is a first! (I have about 40 hours of actual play time on the game so far, I just never close my client, lol).Old-school gamers/TTG gamers will really appreciate Mordheim, and I consider it to be the *only* digital TTG adaptation of any franchise done right (and I've played just about all of them)!  It's not without its flaws, like any game these days (mainly, AI pathing bugs), but it's very easy to look past the non-game-breaking issues when what Rogue Factor has done with Mordheim obviously shows they really cared to deliver a top-notch experience, and I trust they'll work through the bugs in due time.Well worth $40.  Support the devs and reward this amazing game with its fair, old-school business model (no nickle-and-diming Free2Play - i.e. Pay2win - here, just good ol' fashioned buy the game, play 100% of the game.)Bravo, Rogue Factor, keep it up!

												It's a great game, even a masterpiece if you like turn based strategy and warhammer universe.Game has a hard start and you better do the tutorials and learn game mechanics, just as in TT warhammer, you cannot jump to a game not having the basic notions and havea clue of what youre doing.I really recomend it if you like a challenge, and great MP potential.

												Warhammer flavored Xcom. Overall pretty good, if you like difficult strategic games. I have 3 issues with the game, however.The UI is cluttered and often finnicky. For instance in the store you can't use the scroll wheel if the mouse is on the line inbetween the items, yet if it's directly over an item the scroll works fine, meaning you have to use the arrows or drag the bar. Little things like that are here and there. The gameplay generally starts off focused on looting wyrdstone and then moves on to fighting. I like the looting aspects but it's VERY slow. It feels like the first 10-15 minutes are spent picking up rocks.Difficulty is great. I love it for that, same reason I like xcom/darksouls. But difficulty and unfairness are two separate things. When you can't control where you spawn you are rolling the dice to decide whether your game instantly ends after 20 hours of time spent into it. For instance last time I played humans I was on day 16 and started a mission.. one archer spawned completely alone in a hall with an enemy on either side. Another spawned in a corner with a rat ogre pummeling him on round one. Both were guaranteed dead in the first 2 moves(not rounds) of the game. This would ultimately mean I couldn't win the fight - even if you disregard the other 2 units of mine that would also be screwed. So.. yeah. The difficulty is fine, but never choose to play any mission where your units spawn randomly around the map or you are basically asking to lose the game. Not great design in that regard, but if you avoid those missions (which don't convey different content, just spawn points) it's fine. *And choose 'launch and deploy' to choose your spawn locations when applicable. Game never mentioned that as far as I could see, choosing 'launch' auto-assigns spawns.			"

												I recommend this game due to its replayability and challenge. In this game you start with picking one of the six warband races (two of them are DLC). You search the ruins of Mordheim, an old imperial city, for valuable wyrd stones, which have magic effects. During every mission you encounter an enemy warband, which also seeks wyrd stones. Fierce and interactive battles take place in an apocalyptic and authentic scenery. This game has a steep learning curve and it is important to play other players to understand the mechanics of Mordheim: City of the Damned. While the single player missions can be boring, Mordheim: City of the Damned excels in multiplayer. Join one of the PvP leagues on Steam to find matches with other players. Pros:- thrilling, authentic atmosphere- sophisticated skill system and warband development- permadeath and injury system- challenging AI battles and story missions- interesting and tactical PvP battlesCons: - DLCs to access characters and warbands (which are affordable)- matchmaking with other players can be taxing, because players decide on the powerlevel of grown warbands and the rating is not reflective for the power level of a warband- AI matches can feel repetitive on slower deployment types- AI gets stuck on corners and high grounds- small development budget and team- most of the actions are RNG based, which can lead to onesided matches or powerful comebacks in battles- I am not a fan of the veteran system, as it is now (other warbands start with better starting conditions depending on how much you achieved in the game thus far)To sum up: I recommend to buy this game if you are in for a tactical challenge.

								It's too early to say whether this game is good or bad. It shows alot of promise and with some tweeks combat can be made much better. I'd buy it now with 20% as if they implement all the changes they plan to it will be an amazing game. It doesn't have much content at the moment so don't buy it and expect to be amazed. Instead buy it now with 20% and then leave it until January when it will have more content. "

												UPDATE:So Mprdheim, is it good? That's what you want to know right?Yes, and no. If you like turn based, if you like managing a force and watching them grow and develop then yes. If you expect this process to be without loss or finance problems then you should look elsewhere.FIRST POST:This should have been a Demo not an early access. 2 warbands and tutorials. Seems companies have realised that they can release demos calling them early access and make a killing.The game had promise. Looks good, interface seems fine. But the real game is in Warband building. So I can't give it possitve or negative yet.			"

Early Access Review
								For almost daily streams of Mordheim and FAQ dialogue, catch my stream at http://www.twitch.tv/wicket_and_cubMordheim: City of the Damnit will make you break your computer.  Your dice will always fail.  Your best fighter is gonna go down HARD in some of the most gut wrenching ways.  And after you piece the broken parts of your computer together, you will realize just how much you love it!In Mordheim there is not just you and the opponent, there is you, the opponent, and the map.  If you are not careful, the map of Mordheim will slap you around (or help) and put an end to that uber strategy you were just gonna pull off.  The need to improvise, the need to make the best of a worst situation, these elements are actually fun.""But how the hell can losing my characters in defeat be fun?!""  Glad ya asked.  See, if one of your characters goes down in a fight, they don't die, they do an injury check.  They could lose an eye, a leg, they could be rendered useless, or they may even have a ""Near Death Experience"" and gain extra XP!  Also, for every injury, a warrior recieves a negative rating on their overall rating meter that contributes to the strenght of your warband.  Long story short, if your rating meter is lowered on a specific warrior and that warrior does not lose a vital statistic (such as his Intelligence is harmed, meanwhile he is a Strength based warrior), the warrior just made your warband stronger.  Also, some injuries are just fun and they really add flavor and character to your mercenaries.Every mode in the game feels incredibly distinct.  Such as, the random battles which fall underneath the catagories of ""Capture the Flag, Wyrdstone Rush, and Marked for Death"" are fun and exciting fast maps to play (relatively, battles can go upwards of 2 hours.)  Campaing maps are rich in story and objective and feel like a Dungeons and Dragons table top game brought to life.  On-line versus play is constantly being tweaked and perfected and strategy certainly helps.  It is VERY fast paced with options to have count down timers till the turn is ended for each player.  These times can be adjusted to fit your convenience.And to touch on customization, this system is incerdibly deep, from the character progression skill trees to the ability to customize each individual body part skin on nearly every warrior and give custom color sets as well.The amount of progress this game has had since the release of Blood Bowl 2 is staggering.  There are positives, there are negatives, but ultimately, this is a title that will please big fans of Final Fantasy Tactics, X Com, Disgaea, and Total War.I feel like I only scratched the very very tip of the iceberg when talking about this game.  Again, please check out my stream for any and all questions, I love talking about Mordheim!  http://www.twitch.tv/wicket_and_cub "

												Unlike other Games Workshop based games of recent years, this is not an attempt to translate the tabletop game directly into a videogame.  Some people who were hoping for that have been disappointed, but personally I think a direct translation would have been nearly impossible, and in the end probably less fun.  And it is fantastic fun.  Creating and customising a warband is very enjoyable, and the battles themselves are fairly short and sweet, so it's a good game to dip into for half an hour.  Each warrior will progress in both positive and negative ways as they accumulate experience and injuries, the horrors of Mordheim both hardening them and taking their toll on their minds and bodies.  That will mean that your warband will be unique in subtle ways, and you'll get to know each member.The lore and atmosphere of Mordheim are lovingly recreated and you can tell there is a lot of love for the original here.  The cityscapes are absolutely beautiful and although scenery often gets in the way more than providing many strategic options, some maps change things up wonderfully with multi-floored indoor areas being a particular favourite of mine.The game, they warn, is 'hardcore'.  Battles won't always be fair, and losing can have dire consequences.  For the most part this works well, though the sheer number of ways in which a character can be randomly screwed over, often permanently, sometimes makes you want to quit and start over.  Losing a limb, for example can make a character next to useless.  It would be awesome if there were some crazy ways to try and heal such wounds, say with erratic healing spells or mechanical prototypes with chances to add another level of random craziness to battles.It was exciting to be a player of an early access game with regular updates and news, from a team who really listened to player feedback.  There's a lot more that could be added to the game, in fact it seems a waste not to develop further with such a deep and unique framework.  The product as it is is magnificent, but it is absolutely ripe for further add-on content especially additional warbands, as I think 4 is the absolute minimum they could have got away with.  It gives lots of variety as a player, and many strategic options in multiplayer, but it certainly gets repetitive seeing the same few bands of enemies in single player mode.  Perhaps an old-fashioned 'expansion pack' would be a better idea than small pieces of DLC, as lots would be willing to pay to expand the experience with any kind of new content.In short, it's brilliant.  Maybe the best game ever made within the Warhammer universe.			"

												I am totally addicted to this game, but there are a few things you should know before buying it:It is brutal. By that I mean there is no saving and reloading to earlier points (For idiots like me who make stupid mistakes). Your characters that you spent so much time leveling up can be maimed or die from one bad decision. You can ruin your entire party if you are not careful.I ended up creating and recreating warbands (The party) due to silly decisions over and over.  It took me a good 10-15 hours to get the hang of things (see above re:idiot me). You will need to put in a few hours to get the hang of things before it starts to be very enjoyable.Normally I don't like these types of games, but this is different.It's got a fun turn based combat system that I have never seen before. It seems a little convoluted at first, but once I got used to it, there were a lot of different strategies available to me.It is turn based combat.. My first game started with me seeing a rat running towards my leader, and I freaked out a little because I thought maybe I had to click on defend or something. What threw me was that I am so used to seeing hexes in turn based games that the free running rat made me think of Skyrim or the Witcher. I have come to like the perma maiming/death system. I think what helps is that even though your warband may be devestated beyond all repairing, all your kills/looting/wins put points to a global achievement section. When you level up this achievement, you get extra benefits and skills for every new warband. These skills are set on a per warband situation, so you can pick the ones most suited to the warband you have now, knowing that you get to reassign them if you create a new one.Here are a few things I wish I knew before playing:Keep your units close to each other. A lone unit is practically guaranteed to be maimed or killed.ALWAYS ""Launch and Deploy"" - When you start a new combat, you will have the option to ""Launch"" or ""Launch and Deploy"", without any instructions on what they mean. It's as simple as it sounds, ""Launch"": the computer place your units in their starting positions, and these will often be the worst possible positions they can be in. ""Launch and Deploy"" you place your units in the starting positions.Buut sometimes even if you ""Launch and Deploy"" you will not get to deploy your troops. It depends on the mission type and what side you are on.Don't be afraid to skip a day.The enemy will place the same number of troops as you do. So, if you can only muster 4 troops due to injury or training, then deploy them. The enemy will only have 4 too.Do not get too attached to your warband early on. There are a lot of ways to screw it all up, many you will only find later (usually when you start to think you have the hang of it).One last thing: What the hell is up with the dice rolls in this game? I have never seen so many 90+ rolls (Higher is bad in this game). The only good thing is that it seems to affect the AI as much as mine. "

												With tactical gameplay in the battles and numerous options to develop your warriors that you only encounter in the best of RPGs, you will become addicted to a dangerous extent in the enjoyable experience that Mordheim gives. The game would reach perfection with some additions if, for example, enables you to mix creatures from all warbands and creating your own ""dream team"", ideal for online ""high stakes"" conflicts.In the world of Mordheim traps are commonplace and you will encounter them in all your battles. The biggest trap of all is the multiplayer mode. You must have lots of guts to encounter warbands runned by human beings. People do not make stupid moves, will not leave the battle in any way and there is a great chance to know perfectly well the map of the region in which you'll play. At the same time if they happen to have much better equipment than you, your warband is going to be chopped to pieces in a jiffy!To love passionately a video game it must offer you great excitements and Mordheim excels in that area. The ""dice"", i.e. the success rate of every action in the battlefield, is a fleeting ""mistress"" whom some times shows you her favor with a critical success and at the very next minute, turns her back on you with a critical failure, forcing you to curse gods and demons. You will feel great satisfaction watching your fighters to tremendously improve themselves by upgrading their stats while at the same time your treasury fills up with money, equipment and weapons.You can watch my ongoing videos from the game here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAlrmwwKDyU6_2BMpz9qDBQnEQQ40iwTGiannis MoschonasEditor in www.gameworld.gr "

Early Access Review
								This is a mighty good game, with some difficulty problems.  I'm readily impressed with the graphics.  They've really brought the city of Mordheim to life and have added a great deal to it, visually and mechanically (there are various traps throughout).  It is not a direct adaption of the rules, but what they've done is actually quite excellent, with strategy and tactical action points.  This allows you to move/search/set stance (strategy points) and make attacks (tactical points).  They've added stances which are quite interesting.  Each attack reveals a % chance to hit, and I do question how accurate this value actually is.  If I'm told I have an 80% chance to hit, then I expect my warriors to hit 4 out of 5 blows.  In the game, I've seen the reverse, missing 4 out of 5 blows (and I'm not at all discounting how the defense system works, because those are separate 'rolls').  The difficulty of the game is brutal.  I have to abandon my first warband because of a string of serious injuries to my leader prevented me from playing them.  Instead, I had to wait too many days and eventually I've lost out on my first shipment. The question is, is it too difficult?  That's a tricky one.  I'll try to offer my thoughts.  The luck system feels off, as I've mentioned.  There is a massive series of random rolls 'under the hood' and you never quite feel like you're in control.  As I've mentioned, 80% chance to hit ends up feeling more like a coin flip.  As such, the game feels like you're in control of the movment of your warriors, the stances and all the non-luck based actions, but when it comes to the game rolling the dice, you have no ability to affect that.  When you see a string of misses and failed rolls, it gets frustrating.  Very frustrating.  (Suggestion: If you could spend unused actions points to boost your jumps/attacks that would at least feel like you're stacking the odds in your favor).  I've seen some one-sided things that make me feel like the AI has a superior advantage.  I've seen a single AI warrior walk up and demolish one of my own, whereas I've never been able to do he same.  I seem to always require 3-4 warriors to pound away at an enemy to beat them.  In the original game, you receive money immediately after every battle.  Here you must fulfill a shipment and I find that those requirements are set a little high.  You will be struggling to collect wyrdstone to fullfill those shipments and while I get why this was done, I'm not a huge fan of it.    Where I see the problem: the auto collection of wyrdstone after a map is way too low.  The maps are generally too small to collect wyrdstone during the game.  You might have time to collect a few small pieces to bolster yourself but once the fighting starts, you need to commit all your troops to the fight.  The automatic wyrdstone collect after a fight is a paltry amount.  You can make your shipments but only if you don't receive any massive injuries that slow your progress down.  I don't find this part to be fun.    Incidentally, I did manage to get a huge windfall in one session, simply because the enemy didn't fall it's rout check and the last enemy was wandering the map aimlessly.  This allowed my warband to wander around freely and collect a large amount of wyrdstone and that changed the dynamic of the game.  This was a random event and my other warbands are struggling badly with trying to collect enough.  The difficulty of a game like Dark Souls is very hard, but there is skill behind your victories and losses.  That's what makes the difficulty tolerable.  Thsi difficulty here feels like it's randomly generated.  You've little control over many parts of the game.  One final thing about the difficulty: So far, every fight that I can do in the campaign is listed as 'normal' or harder.  Essentially, there appears to be no fights where I can pick on a weaker warband.  Everything appears to be equal or tougher.  I think there should often/always be an option to pick on a weaker warband, if only so you can recover a bit from getting brutalized from a bad situation/poor luck.  So is it too difficult?  I would say yes, just a bit.  I'm doing very well with one of my warbands but as I've mentioned above, that was dude to the AI not routing and allowing me to clean up.  Another of my warbands needs to be disbanded because of how awful the random number generated rolled on my behalf.  Essentially, what this games needs is a come from behind mechanic.  I'm enjoying this game, but find it very frustrating at points.    "

												I really, really wanted to recommend this game, because under it's horrible flaws is hidden the skeleton of something really fun. I even wrote an earlier review to that extent; it didn't post due to an error on Steam. Having played it several days since then, I just can't recommend it now.There are several minor flaws in things like the UI, AI, weird character animations, et cetera, but most of those are fairly trivial. What it comes down to is that the underlying math is horribly implemented to such an extent that the stats of your warband are essentially a lie. No matter how much you level the stats on your party, your odds of accomplishing any task on the battlefield are no better than random chance. What do I mean by this? I understand that a percentage is a probability. So, if you have say, 70% chance to dodge, it isn't a guarantee; you have 70% chance to dodge, and 30% chance to fail dodging. However, * over time *, statistically, you should dodge roughly 70% of the time.Instead, a character will get powned again and again in a round, or even an entire combat, with a statistical average of say 0-10%. This results in ridiculous battles where warbands you should slice through like butter due to your superior party members and gear, and your understanding of the game after having played it for dozens of hours, end up handing you your @$$, even if you manage to kill as many of their party as they kill of yours despite the additional obstacle of poor implementation and hence unfairness. This will happen even on normal difficulty combats - the game for some reason has a separate difficulty for combats in addition to the overall difficulty level of the game. This doesn't make the game ""hard""... it's not a fair challenge that is simply difficult. Its lack of predictability or reliability makes it aggravating to play. There is no way to improve your skill at psuedo-random number generation. Hard, brutal or deadly combats are impossible. You will also frequently face the somewhat humorous, and much more maddening, circumstance of having your butt kicked by a one-armed and/or one-legged enemy.I'm a game developer myself. I remember, several years ago, working on a game at a studio that was shut down; and having an argument with a designer about this very issue. Similar to this game, it was a turn-by-turn tactical combat game originally. He wanted me to implement a system that behaves as Mordheim does not. In other words, if you have 70% chance to accomplish something, * over time *, your successes should average out to roughly that percentage. At the time I was resistant, because I hadn't implemented that kind of system before and I knew it would be time-consuming. Unfortunately, we never got to publish that game since, as I mentioned, the studio failed. However, after playing this game, I understand. I mean, I understood the logic of this a while ago, but now I really * understand *.You will eventually end up in a situtation where you are very far along into the game, and you either have to abandon it because your warband has suffered too many setbacks in the form of defeats and injuries that you cannot recover, or you just become too exhausted to continue playing. I'm at Act II-II and I'm not sure if I'll continue or not.One last thing I'll say is that it's possible, with all the spells being cast, and gear and what-not, that other parties are simply buffing past all of your stats on-the-fly as it were. That doesn't really improve the diagnosis however, as in that case, the game is simply very unbalanced. Any way you cut it, this game is a tragic failure for the design team. Whether that is inherently due to the design, due to an improper implementation by engineering, or some other factor like poor communication or office politics, which all too sadly sometimes cause these sorts of flaws to appear in games, is pure speculation. Ultimately, for the players - the paying customers - the cause is immaterial. Being a software engineer myself, I doubt there is an easy fix for this problem, since it's a flaw deeply embedded in the entire design from top to bottom - and because, if you did fix it, you would essentially be changing the game fundamentally, which wouldn't be fair to players who had invested so much time into the game before the fix.

												The game could've been great, the different factions are varied enough and theres alot of character progression and customization. But it gets so ruined by horrendous RNG and punishing gamemechanics that only affects you. Basically it goes like this: You start a mission, deploy your dudes and start exploring. Eventually you run into the enemy warband all bunched up on top of each other more or less. Theyre all in ambush mode, meaning if you get too close they attack. Unless you charge them. But theres pretty much no way of telling how large their ambush range is compared to your charge, you just have to get closer and closer with babysteps trying to get in charge range and pray their ambush range is shorter. More often than not this ends up with you walking into an ambush and getting devastated. If you manage your way around this and end up in a fight thats fair or even in your favor theres no guarantee you will win. Fights boils down to dice throws, and when your dudes and their dudes are equal level you have a pretty good shot at hitting according to the game, 70-80% hit change, which in reality means roughly 1 in 4 because the number shown to you doesnt factor in some of the things that influence combat (such as melee resistance)... The entire game relies on RNG, and the RNGenerator is a joke among jokes, rolling either 1 or 99 half the time. Luckily, the AI is dumb and buggy and can be outmaneuvered alot of the time giving you a pretty good shot at winning most missions anyway.Long story short, the first issue i have with the game is you get f*cked by RNG alot of the time and your masterfully planned strategy just gets dumpstered by something you have no control over. The second issue is gamedesign. When you lose a mission (or even win but a guy gets knocked out) you roll for injuries. Alot of the time you get away with nothing big, but occassionally you get hit with a big one, like losing an arm on one of your more important characters. Buying a new one is not really an option as you either get a fresh one with♥♥♥♥♥♥stats that gets massacred by anything and everything or you have to pay a small nations yearly budget to get one with some levels to it, which is generally unaffordable. And yes, this doesnt affect the computer at all. I've yet to meet an AI warband that has any (visible) injuries at all and you face new, freshly generated warbands each time. This means the AI can play super aggressive (and it will) with no drawbacks. If it loses, nooooo problem! Just generates another fresh warband with no injuries next time! Basically you play the hardcore difficulty mode while the AI is in sandbox mode, and in the end its all down to RNG anyway.			"

Early Access Review
								Have you looked at this game once, maybe a few times, and thought, ""Hmph...that looks kinda cool, but..."" Are your gaming interests at all like mine, and you just can't get enough of that sweet sweet blend of turn-based strategy, rpg character building and item progression, and fantasy flavor (sci-fi is fun too, of course). Well I'm not kidding: even at this early stage, the foundation of this game is clearly well-built, fun, and has incredible potential to be that pure, addictive blend of all these elements. I read nearly every other reviewer say this similar thing--""Even in early access, it's clear that the developers are doing a great job building this game."" And probably like you, I had my doubts...And then I just decided to pay the piper. A couple clicks: bye bye 31 dollars. Let's see what you've got, Mordheim. Then I worked my way through the tutorial. Then I played my first skirmish, playing around with a bit of fine-tuning the weapons and armor of my warband...Cut to 3 or 4 hours later, and I will be following this game religiously as they add everything that's teased within the game itself right now: further customization; xp progression; other warbands...This game is fun now. If you like turn-based strategy, tabletop wargames, D&D style party combat, fantasy flavor--buy it. I can't wait to see how much better it gets along the way.			"

Early Access Review
								FInally - a developer who understands the proper use of Early Access.   The base game initially provided is playable and fairly stable and provides a solid representation of the direction the developer is going with the product.   Buteven  more importantly - it's already a LOT of fun to play.    The initial treatment appears to be a solid representation of the spirit of Mordheim while making changes to the ruleset to make a more balanced, entertaining video game.   This isn't faithful to the actual rules in the manner that Cyanide's bloodbowl was but it is obvious that the developers have a deep respect for the tabletop game and in the end this respect shines through in a game that really and truly FEELS LIKE MORDHEIM.    And that is the most important point to take away from this - as someone who is a fan of the boardgame for many years, I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier with the direction this game is going and I look forward to a complete, feature rich game set in the city of the damned!

Early Access Review
								This is an awesome port from the Table top game that I loved. Worth every penny, glad I brought it now as I can see myself having hours of fun playing this as it gets more fleshed out. 9/10, with the potential to be a classic.Hopefully over the following weeks the game gets fleshed out a bit more with the options to bu equiptment and customise your warband.The graphics are nice only thing missing from the atmosphere is Skaven chitter chatter that we all no and love; can't beat a good ""Die Die Manthings!"".The combat / action system is easy to master but looks like it could be a lot of fun once more skills are added, at first I was a little lost as to how my mage was meant to cast spells ad then found the space bar.Can't wait for the following releases of content, hopefully all the warbands of old get added as that will take this from Awesome to Legendary.Would also be cool if you could get some passive items like grappling hooks for humans so that jumping / climbing was more likely to be successful; also on th emap the ability to zoom out further.I love the fact that you can run around in the blue circles without losing movement so you can scout out where you want to go / how to path to places.Good luck on the development you have made the start of an awesome game!

Early Access Review
								First off I usually don't buy Early Access because I been burned a couple times by games not being published as promised or even updated, but this is a seasoned publisher.  So this game will actually make it to release, I have faith in that.Two, this game is Alpha phase at the time of this writing, but the have been very specific on what it contains for those that purchase Early Access. This game has loads of potential and the little bit of content they has so far to give you a taste is very satifying.  It delivers the feel of being on the ground in a skirmish while maintaining the tabletop mechanics faithfully.  For those that have played Mordheim, or like me other Games Workshop games, will be very pleased with this game.  The Developer, Rogue Factor, has a very firm grasp on what Mordheim is and how it can be represented in a digital format.So here is your chance to get the game a few dollars cheaper and help them work out the bugs and improve the game for launch.  If you have the patience to wait for the updates as they come, this is a great start and get in on the ground floor of what is shaping up to be a awesome game.			"

Early Access Review
								My brother gave me a Mordheim tabletop starter set for my birthday long ago so I was really excited to see a video game version of it. So far reading about the game and playing a couple of hours of it I find this game manages to capture the spirit of the tabletop game pretty well.- The game has great visuals from the dark Chaos touched ruins of the city, to the look of units and their abilities. The visuals really put you into the world of Mordheim. More variety  of maps would be good but I am sure more will come out with release.- The frustration of your units failing time and time again to hit an opponent while the opponent wails on them! 100% Game Authenticty.- The current Warbands are pretty fun. I love we get female characters and they aren't wearing bikini chainmail. And any game that lets you play as Skaven is an automatic win. One of the biggest things I think will make or break this game is how much will available on release and how much will be DLC later. If they give us a decent selection range, more then 4 just warbands, off the bat the game could be pretty great! Hopefully within each Warband there will be some some diversity to choose from eventually, Clan Pestilens instead of Clan Eshin for Skaven for example.- I am excited they brought the customization of your Warband to this game. I can't wait to have a unique group to despair at as the die off in combat. Have battered veterans with new skills and missing limbs. Not much of this is in the game yet so I will have to hope it delivers what is promised.- Scenario games with plenty of interesting objectives similar to the original game! I haven't delved into these too much yet but I am hopeful that the game will feel less like a bunch of pointless battles with a little bit of lore behind each one.The game is currently glitchy and a little bare bones but that is to be expected for early access. But it is still a fun game to play in its early state so I have high hopes for the game.			"

												TLDR....Atmospheric, dark fantasy combat that gets so much right you will get angry it did not hammer every aspect of the game out of the park.Lingering Issues with Optimization plus slow-pacing can be frustrating to deal with.Full ReviewRatings for this game really seemed to take a hit during the early portion of the early access period. I came late to the EA party and was generally satisfied with what I found. The additions and expansion of the game leading up to the full release yesterday have all been on the positive side.What I like...Tactical CombatFirst person POV - Valkyria Chronicles would be the closest comparision I can think of but I like this aspect even if the camera movement frustarates me4 throughly planned out factions that give a different feel and campaign for single-playerRPG elements are present but do not overshadow the tactical nature of the game at least until you reach rank 6 (up to 10 possible with full release)Atmosphere and artwork where clearly a point of emphasis for this teamHigh amount of customizations abilities/skins availble for each unitContent - Lots of it and the pacing means if you like what you see here your in for a treat because there's more of itChallenge - There is one which is niceAC/DCRNG - Present and accounted forPace - Not necessarily a drawback but early game is slow until you learn the mechanics and certain scenarios were painful to finish because of there size/hiding or hard to reach unitsMultiplayer - Slow as in even by turn-based pvp standards slowDifficulty - More specifically difficulty due to unfamiliar systems and half explained mechanics read up, play tutorials a few times each (thought incomplete still helpful), or learn as you go but not much gets spoon-fedMusic/Sound - I liked it well enough but some sound effects are off and everything gets repetitive a bit too quickWish it were better.....Camera - Nearly rant inducing when I first start playing but some tweaks seem to have improved it a bitCharacter Builds Vanilla Among Same Units - Nice to have customization options but it seems most units are pigeonholed into one or two roles though I may just need more playtimeLoading - Loading - Loading - Loading - LoadingWorld Interaction - My biggest complaint so I'll elaborate a bit - I think due to limitations of the Infinity Engine some tactical features that would have been great have been left out - No FLYING DEATH SMASH from the top rope for example. No Pushing/Pulling to Move Enemy Units into Danger Zones. Danger Zones (exploding barrels, launch pads, or their like) are for the most part absent. Elevation matters for ranged attacks but not melee (kinda meh on whether it should or not but worth noting). The traps are annoying and could be done better or done away to improve the experience.  Wydestone collection comes into play but feels secondary even when it should be your primary focus to advance the campaign. Personally I am a big fan of the universe of Mordheim and I have to say I am impressed with how much fun this game has provided me already. I am well over the 30 hour mark and I have yet to complete a single campaign so the value for investment is defintely there if you enjoy the game.8/10If they can ever optimize this game to cut down on the loading screens (tough to do but some improvment would be nice) I would say this game comes in pretty close to a 9 for me. If I am still playing this game for as long as I think I will be I may be bumpiong it up for that reason as well. Honestly, I almost hate this game for not having world interaction completed to the level I would prefer but I enjoy what's here enough without it. Guess that leaves room for improvement if they ever make a sequel. "

												Ok, now that I have had time to explore the final release of the game, I figured I would update my previous review.First and foremost, if your not patient, have no tolerance for a learning curve, and cant handle getting the snot beat out of you while your learning a game, run. Run far away, and dont ever look back.Now if your still reading, I am assuming your not one of the aforementioned types of gamers. So lets narrow it down again. If your the type of gamer who wants fast paced action, doesnt like turn based fare, and hates RPGs or turn based strategy games, you may want to hit the road as well.Now who's left? Ah, you. Yeah the ruthless adventurers and ambitious meglomaniac tyrants of the gaming world. My kind of people.Mordhiem is a turn based fantasy strategy game with heavy RPG elements. Its set in the Warhammer Fantasy setting, and takes place in a shattered city called Mordheim which was struck some time in the past by a big rock. And you control a motley warband scrambling against other likewise warbands (of which there are four types you can choose from...Mercenary Humans, Skaven (rat people, and I dont mean the band!) Sisters of Sigmar (the ugliest women I have ever seen!) and my personal favorite, the Cult of Chaos!) Who are out to get the rocks for your master, whenever he needs a fix. Wait, no.....They aren't crackheads. These are magic rocks called wyrdstones, which are not really healthy to be around, but since we have to pay the bills, we have to just shut up and deal with it.You start off with an ugly leader, commanding even uglier troops. But the harsh looking characters and enviroments have a flavor that fans of warhammer (like myself) are quite fond of. The game captures the essence of the Warhammer universe perfectly. As you move through the game, you can choose to partake in either story or random battles, which will reward your freaky looking band with exp. and loot. So far, I am sure all this sounds very familiar to fans of the genre.But its distinctively different in some great ways. For example, the realism. Your characters are in constant danger of not only perma-death, but permenant injuries. Not only do these injuries cause debuffs and penalties in combat but actually show on your character! So, lets say, you lose an eye, it shows, lose a limb, it shows. Get your face smashed to hell, yep....It shows. Now this feature is well done and, frankly, badass! No worries though, because every so many days, replacements show up of varied levels looking for work. And sometimes they even bring nice gear you can strip off them hehe! You will also later get ""impressive"" warriors, as they are called, which can be anything from elite warriors to daemons and spawn. And just like the injuries I mentioned earlier, wyrdstone warps some characters in positive ways as well, so when your uglier-then-my mother in law hero grows horns or some such thing, dont panic....Its all normal in Mordhiem....Also, stores have a random and limited stock, forcing you to work with whatever you have the luck of getting in the store or from loot. Not to mention enemies can also loot you! This is actually a great feature as well. And forces you to make decisions your wouldnt normally make. One example would be putting a powerful ""epic"" weapon on a lower ranked character. It will make him more effective, but then you run the risk of losing it.....And as for loot, there is plenty to be found....Weapons....Armor...Helmets....Beer that messes you up and buffs you....( Damn the Bugmans Ale). You can detect loot within buildings and on corpses in the street and so forth with a skill called ""perception"" that every character has by default. Other skills also become available as you level up....From passive skills that let you ambush or charge in a wider range, to activated skills that knock your enemy around like a red headed stepkid....(No, I dont condone knocking around kids, I just wanted to use that saying cuz its catchy) And if for any reason you get lost, scan the skies while perception is activated. A blue light will show your your ""camp"" ( a wagon with which you can store the loot you find) while a red light shows the enemies camp (A wagon where you can jack thier stuff hehe). There are far too many skills to go into detail with, but I have found a moment at this point for ALL of them to be useful. And some ""special"" skills you aquire will even let you move a hero to leader, or a henchmen to hero, boosting there stats significantly and allowing them to learn better skills!Movement is something that takes some getting used to in itself, as unlike many ""grid"" based games, its much more realistic. Yeah, you have a limited range for moving on your turn, but youll be climbing walls, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, and occasionally, falling and busting your clumsy♥♥♥♥♥haha (which always gives me a laugh as the damage is usually minimal)Speaking of damage, your going to want to build your dodge and melee resistance, as healing is very hard to come by. There are some healing draughts and poulices, and the Sisters have some healing skills (as does the globabier), but youll have to learn to minimize damage to survive. And never charge one of your guys out as a lone hero or he will get slapped stupid, unless your confident in your characters power, or your using an impressive (spawn rock hehe). Always treat every fight like life or death for your character, because it just might be. No phoenix downs HERE to save the day.The good news....Win or lose, it will give you experiance, some loot, and stat boosts. SO if you get mauled at first, replavce any who are dead or too damaged to push on, and youll eventually start to turn the tables on them.....There are only three complaints I have with the title, but I have high hopes after reading the developers forums that they will be adressed in the near future. And that is the lack of variety in Warbands and Characters (every warband is unique, dont get me wrong...And they all have thier own playstyle. But its not enough of a good thing, but I am positive they intend to address this). The second complaint is that the gear needs to look more varied on characters,and the final complaint is I feel the level cap is too low (because leveling your band is such a blast, its kind of depressing that max is reachable so quickly). Do these things keep the game down? No. They are really not enough to make the game a failure. And they are things that can be, and I think will, be addressed as time goes on. But its still a game worth every penny of its price as it is now. With those issues addressed, no other game would even come close. But its still become one of my favorite TBS games in years. Ive played the genre for about 20 years now, and I dont say this too often. And I have to REALLY like a game to write up a review, because, well, I am a lazy sonova.....HAHA! You know......Mordhiem stays very true to its source material. Fans of the table top game, or strategy/rpg hybrid fans, will love it once they have the hang of it. This is a game that truly rewards patience. I like the DLC as well, but I have pnly tried out one of the two characters, yet now I wonder how I ever got by without him haha! (Tip,if your having trouble with the dificulty, get the globadier, as he is extremely useful)The games not perfect, but they are not done adding to the rich game they have created. And yes, its hard at first, but if you learn to use skills, ambushes, and the terain to your advantage, you will be handing out can-o-whupass in no time.The variety also needs work, but if this is adressed in the future, Mordhiem will go from a fantastic game to probably the best Fantasy TBS game ever made. Yes, it has that much potential!I cant recommend this game highly enough, as long as you heed what I said about patience and the learning curve, Mordhiem will keep you entertained for many, many hours!

Early Access Review
								This is a seriously good game and very addictive, especially if you are a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy Universe.  The controls are easy to pick up and combat / movement both simple and advanced are fully explained in the excellent tutorials. Here comes the inevitable 'but'part.1.  Even though the game is centred around the collection of Wyrdstone there is little opportunity to hsrvest any once you make contact with the enemy.  You simply have to pile all your warriors in to prevent isolated warrkors from getting splattered.  It seems like the only time you can collect any is if you deploy near to a deposit or come across some on your way to link up with your warband.2. The acquisition of loot is impossible once the enemy warband routes. This means that even though you may have put OOA some enemy with really good items that you have no chance to loot them. Also, even if you win the match standing 2 meters away from the huge Wyrdstone deposit you were on your way to you get no chance to collect it and therefore do not benefit from your victory.  Maybe a victorious warband should be given 1 final turn to collect any nearby loot/wyrdstone but made to ignore and be ignored by remaining enemies.3.  At certain times you have no say in the deployment of your warriors and they end up at isolated spawn points.  Then on the very first turn, some enemies can sprint across half the map, home in on them, stun them with their first blow and OOA your warrior with the next 2 hits...and there's nothing you can do about it, you're just a spectator at this point. I dont mind hard games or getting a bashing if I make mistakes, in fact i relish the experience of playing my way back out of difficult situations. However, in my opinion, no game should arbitrarily place you in a position where you literally have no chance to influence (for your benefit or detriment) the outcome of that position.I realise that this game is still early access so my aim here is to inform, not to rant.If you like turn based strategy games and / or the Warhammer Fantasy Universe then buy this game immediately because it's one of the best you will ever play.

												Disappointing and frustrating, but there is still promise.I've been a fan of the Warhammer world for over 20 years, and that alone is enough to keep me playing this game, but I don't know if I can recommend it to others.  The missions and combat are incredibly repetitive, and the RNG and AI get frustrating at times with seeming like they are TRYING to screw you over.Standard, non-story missions all have the same objective:  kill or rout the other warband.  There are optional objectives, but these are usually best ignored.  The problem is that the best strategy in every mission is to lump your people up as tight as possible and advance in a blob like toddlers playing soccer.  Sending warriors off alone or in pairs usually just ends up with them getting ganged up on by superior numbers and killed.  By keeping everyone together, especially in missions with no time limit, you can eventually come across less numerous opponents and gang up on them, killing enough to rout the band.  Also, you really should prioritize either ranged or melee combat for your warband.  Trying a balanced approach has, in my experience, been less effective than ganging up using a single strategy.  Hang back peppering approaching warriors with a warband full of bows, then pulling out melee weapons to finish off the stragglers that reach you, or give everyone a big axe, surround your target, and chop him apart.  More frustrating though are the penalties for failure.  One bad match can cripple your entire band, with the story missions being particularly punishing with a laundry list of mandatory objectives, and demanding you either complete them all or fight to the near last man.  I've played 3 of the story missions, and lost 2 of them thanks to either glitches or frustrating randomized spawning of the literally infinite reinforcements.  Using my Chaos band I fought into a Sigmarite temple to try and defile 11 different holy objects.  Once I'd killed the guards, defiled 10 of the 11, and fortified the entrances to the temple as best I could with my surviving warriors, creating cross-supporting zones of fire and ambush lanes, I sent the hero up to the belfry to get the last object, only to get ambushed on the roof by a randomly generated hero reinforcement, who charged and killed my wounded hero, generating an automatic failure condition.  Goodbye 45 minutes of work, hello injury rolls.  Another Imperial warband did not lose a single match until the story mission, then a glitch indicated I'd found 10 of the powder barrells I needed to use to blow up a location, but could only pick up 7.  I kept looping the map trying to find new barrells or respawn the old, and the infinite reinforcements wore me down until I ultimately lost, and then half my previously undefeated warband suffered permanent, debilitating injuries such as lost hands and arms.  Easier to just start over at that point, but there went all the days of progress.			"

												I'm not sure how to start out. Let me get this out of the way first though. I like this game. Alot. Also, if you want the short review, skip to the end.Now, If you've played the tabletop game of Mordheim, you know exactly what you will get. This works pretty much the same. And for me, that's a good thing. If you haven't played the tabletop version, then this is what you're in for.Mordheim lets you control a group of fighters from various factions, out to gather wyrdstone. It's a game of tactical battles, and that is what you will do. You will battle it out on the ruined streets of the city Mordheim. This is also all that you do. Even the battles themselves are usualy the same. You do get different optional objectives to complete for each battle. Usualy gather wyrdstone, or capture the flag, or a bounty hunt on some of the other teams characters. BUT, those objectives are optional. The main thing is always the same. Go in. Kill the opposition. If their will doesn't break, you might have time to gather up some goodies. Or, if you're OP, you might get away with doing the optionals anyhow, but that is imo up to which faction you're playing. Now, that might sound boring, and for some people it will be. The thing with Mordheim however is that regardless if you win or lose the fights, you will get ""rewarded"" with experience.

												I'm not sure how to start out. Let me get this out of the way first though. I like this game. Alot. Also, if you want the short review, skip to the end.Now, If you've played the tabletop game of Mordheim, you know exactly what you will get. This works pretty much the same. And for me, that's a good thing. If you haven't played the tabletop version, then this is what you're in for.Mordheim lets you control a group of fighters from various factions, out to gather wyrdstone. It's a game of tactical battles, and that is what you will do. You will battle it out on the ruined streets of the city Mordheim. This is also all that you do. Even the battles themselves are usualy the same. You do get different optional objectives to complete for each battle. Usualy gather wyrdstone, or capture the flag, or a bounty hunt on some of the other teams characters. BUT, those objectives are optional. The main thing is always the same. Go in. Kill the opposition. If their will doesn't break, you might have time to gather up some goodies. Or, if you're OP, you might get away with doing the optionals anyhow, but that is imo up to which faction you're playing. Now, that might sound boring, and for some people it will be. The thing with Mordheim however is that regardless if you win or lose the fights, you will get ""rewarded"" with experience. If your characters get knocked out in a battle, they usualy get back up again for the coming fight. Sometimes with missing limbs or eyes, and sometimes making miraculous recoveries and sometimes even come back stronger.So. You will grow your band of warriors, both in numbers and levels, and you will get better gear from the stores, or from looting the city itself. There are also story missions. I've so far played two of them on two different factions. They bring in some different rules on how to win the battles just to spice things up a little. In short:This game is repetetive.

												I totally love this game ! Sad to see how all the negative reviews have less than 50 hours playtime in this game, not even giving themselves a chance to learn how to play it.Yes, it is difficult, it is punishing, sometimes even when you did everything right ! Sometimes you will wonder if the gods of RNG hates you and why they would want your elite soldiers to loose their limbs or life. Yes, this is not a game for the soft hearted or for those with anger managment issues, you might just end up breaking your keyboard or computer screen. But.. once you learn the basics this game is super fun !! My first warband was a skaven (ratmen) warband, But I had a difficult time managing these squishy creatures, so after some hours I moved on, tried the human mercenaries warband. This went a little bit better, still some deaths and injuries but I got by and kept progressing. After some time I decided to try the skaven again, and this time, after learning the basics, it was a completely different story. Sure there were still have some injuries and deaths, but it went a lot better after learning the basics of the game (and how to avoid doing massive mistakes that ends up killing off your troops for certain)This is not farmville, it is not CoD, it is not Command and Conquer. This is Mordheim, city of the damned, a stratergy game that punishes bad stratergies and stupid decisions. Only on very rare occations your troops suffer when it was not your own fault. It has a deep learning curve and takes a bit of time to really get into.Ive played all the warbands to level 10 (max) except sisters of sigmar and cult of the damned. The most enjoyable has been skaven and witch hunters, with the ratmen having a very good all around team and amazing henchmen (warpguard is by far the best henchmen in the game IMO), and the witch hunters having insanely good heroes and leader. In both these warbands you want to go for the optional leader, not the standard one. I dont have a single witch hunter in my witch hunter group, but rather a warrior priest with born leader and a couple of templar knights kicking♥♥♥♥♥ If you are having a hard time with the game try this out, the templars never die, and the warrior priest makes sure to keep them healthy. From my own experience heavy armor and shields with one handed weapons generally works out for the best, accompanied by perks that is useful for people who does many attacks each round, for example ""quick insicion"".Anyway, the game.. it has nice maps that always change up, every time you enter a match the map is different created ""random"", the main story maps are very enjoyable, the skill customizations and how you want to build your group is entirely up to you. PROS:Fun and challenging game!Always a new map. You are in the city of mordheim so the theme of the map is often similar, but in fact the map is always different.Huge character skill and setup customization.Active devs ! Every time I was thinking there was some issue with the game it got patched soon after to fix those issues.CONS:It is difficult in the start, this is definetly not a game for noobs or impatient people. Your troops will die and you have to decide if you want to ragequit or figure out exactly why they died, because 95% of the times things go bad it is not the RNG fault, it is your own fault because you did something stupid, perhaps got too greedy grabbing that far away wyrdstone away from your group, or you tought your archer was standing in a good spot when soon after realizing he gets trapped on that balcony he was standing on and chopped into bits because you put him in overwatch stance. I also wish there was more appearance customizations of all the troops. There is usually plenty of colors to choose from, but not a lot of other customization options in terms of how your troops look.Sometimes the AI go full retard, especially the impressive (huge elite unit), but it has been upgraded/patched and is now a lot better, they rarely do stupid stuff anymore.The game used to have more cons, like very slow loading times and some annoying bugs, but as far as I can see all those are fixed. Every time I encountered a bug in this game it was just after a new release and it got patched in less than 2 weeks every time.-----------------------------This is an amazing game for anyone who wants a challenge and is bored of many of the ""fed with teaspoon"" games made nowadays that holds your hand trough the entire process. Sometimes you sit there for a match or two, sometimes you sit there all night playing and tinkering with your troops, thinking about how you wish to build them. Tons of replay value and tons of fun once you get into it. A very fine stratergy game indeed !			"

												This is my Favourite game of all time.  Its the most satisfying Turn based strategy game ever.  I have been playing games workshop, and other table top games for over a decade and this game is fun and is probably better than the table top game of the same name.  The background story for the game is very cool, you can pick one of now 5 warbbbands to get into the action with.  In this game your main duty is to pick up wardstone and kick some♥♥♥♥♥while doing it.  Getting wardstone is a rush.  When I see a Cluster it gets my mojo going, and filling my pockets with it is soooo satisfying.  Leveling up is very cool and will keep you coming back for more.  The hours just fly by when I play this game, and the more you play the easyer it gets.  Its got a leveling up system that gives rewards by picking skills that carry over to new war bands.Difficulty level is challenging and one of the best parts of the game is that every move is final you cant take nothing back and theres no re loading to save some ones life.  In this game if you go down (and that can happen on any hit) its permanent.  Henchman can loose arms and legs on any given hit they take.  Which makes this game a bit of a rush while playing.  10 /10 - best game ever. "

												The games been on quite a journey, from a very poor early access period through to an entertaining late access period with a lot of promise for things to come when they finally release all of it.Now it's been released, and seems the late access period really was all they had, the only additions to the release were voice-over actors and an intro video. While in early access one can forgive the fact that the AI bugs out in every mission, bugged mechanics, and that it's missing 11 of the official warbands. You can even forgive the fact that a game which is at it's core a multiplayer community game which was almost always played as 1v1v1v1 or more only has 1v1... and you'll almost never see another human to play against (hell it was early access, how many people were playing?).Post release, these things can't just be overlooked. It can still be a fun game, but if you don't bring your own people to play against, don't expect to find them already on there (it's 2 day's after release, I've seen 1 public game all day). You can play single player and bug out the AI all day... but it gets boring.			"

												Do you enjoy building a customized party of badass adventurers? Do you enjoy leading that party into glorious turn based battle? Will you realize you are bad at strategy, watch your merry band be ripped to shreds by rat men, and hang your head in shame? If you answered yes to all of these you are a lot like me! I am really bad at this game. But I still really enjoy this game. Just come in expecting to die horribly and enjoy the ride. Thats kind of the overarching theme of Mordheim. It is very fun but stays true to the source material and its insanely high levels of difficulty. Don't say I didn't warn you.			"

The game is visually great and a lot of time has gone into making it an enjoyable experience.  Is it a perfect? No but it is getting there.  There is still some bugs that they need to get rid of (loading times, PVP having very few people, impressives getting stuck in buildings) but overall, if you understand the genre and how to play the game, it is a great game.

												We've probably all grumbled playing Xcom and missed on things that seems like a given. We've also all probably muttered ""Xcom proves there is no god."" Your only half right. God existed but he was devoured by the old gods of mordheim.  Very steep learning curve on this game because the systems / stats are not clearly explained. But when it clicks, when you've been demoralized so badly you figure it out. You got that sweet spot. Your warband is a legit force to be reckoned with.  That's what makes it worth it. I've never had such a rewarding experience, recently, in gaming that was starting as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cult band to becoming a total monster. There is a lot of customization in terms of stats, abilities and builds that it has tons of replayability. Sure your leader got downed for the first time ever and is permanently dead. Hire a new schlub and get back in there. Personally I love a hardcore strategic game, and this does it. A lot more planning and end game scenarios than other games. My one issue is that some mission types start you at a severe disadvantage, in terms of randomness. A 40k version of this as necromunda? ♥♥♥♥ yes.			"

								Eh....I know its still early release but the price is too high imo. Only 4 teams(which I'm sure will change), only game mode right now is skirmish which is basically a practice mode. You don't earn or get xp/money/injuries/warpstone/loot/etc. It's on the map, but after the match everything resets which makes it kind of bland and repetitive after a while(more teams released would at least offer some more play styles).  I'm also not sure how i feel about them going with hitpoints over wounds (ex my Demon has like 240hp or approx instead of 5 or 7 wounds he'd get on the table top game), the loading time on fantastic settings was pretty bad(but the graphics are good)The magic system could be better. Again, since you dont gain xp, you don't see many spellsThats the negative stuff.The game has a really good Warhammer feel to it, the Dev's definately took with time it.Tons of battlegrounds, all very interesting and fun.The game play is alot of fun, but tricky until you figure out the controls.Lots of potential and upcoming content including a campaign mode(hopefully soon)So overall, I'd say too much $$$ for what it's offering unless your a diehard Warhammer fan. I bought it on sale for around half price i think, which was TOTALLY worth it.			"

												Good game which makes you invest in your characters and really care about them.  Unfortunately, it's also a fairly repetative game without a lot of variability in the settings or missions.  I was warned to skip the ""scattered"" missions which led to them being even more repetative.  It would have been nice if it allowed for character stat respec as I had several that were max level and one stat point away from being able to get certain skills and spells.  I did enjoy the main story missions.  All said, it took me 75hrs to complete the storyline for one faction.  With the difficulty level associated with perma death and lasting injuries, I did play conservatively.  I'll probably take a long break and come back to play through other factions.			"

Early Access Review
								Now that the game has left early access and been out for a month, it's time to update my review.First of all, most bugs have been fixed. There's still some that pop up now and then, but rarely anything that will impact your gameplay in any major way, and they will presumably be worked out too. Now the two major points: RNG and difficulty. A lot of players complain about the RNG. Not because it's broken or rigged, because it's not (several have tested it and confirmed that it's working fine). No, they complain because they either do not understand how RNG works (it's a ""Random Number Generator"", and a big clue is in the ""Random"" part), the gameplay mechanics or do not like it when they lose. First, for those not understanding the gameplay mechanics, here's how an attack works:-you attack a target, and a ""Hit Roll"" is made (based on your Hit chance)-if it's a Miss, you miss-if it's a Hit, your target gets a Dodge/Parry roll (if they are in Dodge/Parry stance)-if they pass their Dodge/Parry roll, they Dodge/Parry the attack and take no damage-if they fail the Dodge/Parry roll, you deal damageSimply put, you need to first Hit, and (if they are in a Dodge/Parry stance) they have to fail their Dodge/Parry roll. That's where a lot of people get confused or frustrated. The hit chance displayed does not take into account Dodge or Parry, only your chance to ""Hit"" (or not Miss) the target. So you'll find a few individuals claiming this makes the Hit chance shown is wrong. Yes, you can potentially miss 3 hits in a row when you have a 95% chance to hit. And yes that can happen in a short span of time. But over the course of 10,000 rolls, a 95% chance to hit is a 95% chance to hit. Conversely, sometimes you'll also manage to hit 3 times in a row with a 5% chance. And it's exactly the same for the AI. I can't stress this enough: the AI has no hidden advantage to it's rolls! Streaks will happen on all sides, both good and bad. If you can't accept that sometimes RNJesus will screw you, then you can't stop reading. You will not enjoy this game, and I highly recommend against buying it. Then there's the difficulty. Is it a hard game? Yes. It's hard in the same sense that Mario Bros. was hard. Make too many mistakes and it's Game Over, start again. But if you look at most of the negative reviews, they are form people with very little time played. Few have more than 50 hours and the majority seem to have less than 20 (even as low as 0.1). And there's a good reason for that: This game takes time to get into properly. It's not a ""Jump in, kill some things, log off and have a biscuit"" game. This game requires a certain amount of patience. You'll most likely fail spectacularly with your first warband. Maybe even your second and third. It really can be a punishing experience at first.But when you start understanding the mechanics and taking some time to plan your warband and unit builds, things suddenly get a hell of a lot easier. Those mobs you needed 3 units to take out first time around, you can suddenly take on 2 at a time with only 1 unit. And the more time you spend planning and choosing your stats, skills and equipment, the better your units get. And then you get screwed by RNG, and your favourite unit dies. And when I say ""dies"", I do mean that the unit is dead and gone. No medical kits. No Revival spell. No Phoenix Downs. Your treasured Hero is lost forever. So you buy a new one and make him even better. That's how the game works. Your units are always replaceable, and you will replace them for better ones. Managing to get to Rank 10 without losing any units (not to mention without injuries) is supposed to be an achievement, not the standard. So in the sense that there's always a chance you'll lose units, or even your entire warband, all while trying to make sure you can fulfill shipping demands, it is indeed a hard game. Personally, I find it a nice change from the way more common mechanic of not actually losing anything if you fail. The Arkham series is a great example of that. Fall to your death? Nope. Automatic Bat-Grapple to a ledge. Get shot or beaten to death? Nope. You simple resurrect at the last Auto-Save. Nothing wrong with that type of mechanic, but it is not what you'll find in Mordheim. There are no backsies here. Consequences are permanent. It's certainly not for everyone, but I like it. Makes things more exciting when you know you can lose something. So, the positive things about Mordheim: CotD.-Warband and unit customization is vast and can keep you occupied for hours and hours. -The 4 warbands play very differently, and themselves be played in very different ways.-Single-Player is large enough to keep you occupied for a long time, with both random missions and 8 Story mission per warband. There is no end to the ranomd missions, so you can keep improving your warband as long as you like. -Multiplayer is really fun and engaging. It offers two different versions, one with consequences (injuries, death, loot gained, etc) and one without (no loot gained and no injuries or death). In both cases the match can be heavily customized to suit your preferences. -4 mission difficulties (Normal, Hard, Brutal, Deadly) let's you choose what kind of risk vs reward you go for.-Random monsters can appear and attack both sides, but are restricted to Brutal missions above rank 5 (so if you don't want to meet them, you don't have to). -Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together, so you can rank up your warband vs the AI then go fight other players.-potential for expansions (maps, warbands, etc) is huge. Now for the negative parts. -Multiplayer, while great fun, is lacking. No servers means no rankings, matchmaking or anything. There's only a lobby and inviting others. It can make finding matches a tedious process. -AI is dumb as a brick. As soon as you learn it's behaviour, you can easily beat it. -Visual customization of units is a little lacking. -Singleplayer and Multiplayer are tied together. Yes, it's also a negative, because it limits a lot of tweaks and additions to Singleplayer because it would affect multiplayer too. A ""PvE only"" option where you can Save at any point (or restart macthes), or ""PvP only"" where you can't buff up fighting the AI, are two highly requested features. Overall, I'd recommend this game to those who enjoy strategic and tactical games where you plan ahead, and spend time with warband and unit management, as well as fighting. I would not recommend it to players who want quick-paced action or easy games that don't require much thought. Just be aware that things take time and will not always go your way.			"

								I recommend this game to anybody who likes tactic based strategy games. It's like seeing the tabletop game come to life right before your eyes. The strategy system is rather deep as you can lay ambushes for your enemy to run into, place yourself into a dodge or parry stance giving you a slight advantage in 1 on 1 combat, or block the enemy's path with your units. Winning does feel very rewarding as your units will level up and get stronger, but losing can be just as punishing because you can lose those valuable veteran units if they die.			"

I recommend buying this game but not quite yet.Is the game fun?Yes the game is quite fun actually it just has some issues and camera angles that suck at times but the overall game is fun. At the moment there isn't any of the special features such as getting damaged and having it remain the next time, gaining skills/experience, or even saving your characters yet.

												MY First impressions: I hate&love the ""thrown in without much explanation"" approach. There are 4 ambiguous choices between which race I you want, which will effect, EVERYTHING. so no pressure. Then, there is something about grabbing all the stones, Killing the other three other choices you didn't choos and then the game throws everything on your plate.It's nice enough to restrict some things you don't need yet but I feel a sense of dread that I already ♥♥♥♥ed something up with the few choices I had, and not enough knowledge of what my actions actually will do. on top of that I don't like being made to spend resources without knowing what the value is cause it implies I might need them later for something better.On the other hand it implies, that none of that really matters and with hope I can pick up on mechanics as they become relevant so fingers crossed for the first mission...Mission overview: got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. two dudes got hurt, and my mage lost his staff so... Restart. If you buy the game, I strongly recomend you look at the controls, cause the game doesn't explain anything. easy enough to learn, but it doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if you are just starting out. it's glove off from start to finish.

												A must have for any fans of Warhammar Fantasy and turn-based RPGs, Mordheim came as a pleasant surprise. The tense feeling of never knowing if the next round will be your last (or even if your next move will be the last) is really making this game worth playing and you really feel satisfied after a perfect mission.Building your own customized warband with different types of units and skills is great.However, the learning curve is quite steep and the RNG is sometimes frustrating, and the so called story missions can be somewhat confusing at times. Not for all gamers. I'm very excited to see what the developers'll do with Necromunda after having done a great job with Mordheim.8/10 "

								If you were to ask me to recommend this to someone, I would say either to grab it on sale if you REALLY like the tabletop Mordheim and or multiplayer. Or keep looking if your not into  rogue like games with permadeath and things where you have to restart numerous times to end up at the same conclusions based heavily on luck.Having said that, this isn't a terrible game. Its in fact very impressive as far as its system implementation and battle system. If you enjoy multiplayer you will like this game. But that is where this game would shine and ONLY would shine is in multiplayer. Me personally I'm not big on multiplayer. I'm giving it a negative as a single player perspective.With all Games Workshop games, in my opinion is based (around 60%) on luck. Other being strategic planning. This game is no different and it doesn't give you a whole lot of options as to how to strategise battles when the enemy AI just seems to bum rush you everytime and then it just becomes a dice rolling game. Some battles won, some battles lost but overall a pretty meh feeling after 10+ of these battles.Coming from someone who dislikes multiplayer in every sense of the word, I have to admit that this should be a multiplayer only game as the enemy AI is just too dumb to do anything but a dice rolling and stat comparing game (which they always have more then you, to make up for its lack of intelligence)I know people enjoy this game and I totally respect that, because in fact it IS very well put together and for a small group of devs its promising. I just can't personally recommend a friend paying for it knowing these faults. I would recommend it to someone into multiplayer games.			"

												Started the game as the Sisters of Sigmar. Didn't have the best start but things were looking up on day 3 as I cornered the enemy leader in the first move, and got a successful charge to chunk him to half health. I decided to cast ""Sigmar's Might"" to make it more likely to finish him off with the next attack... Leader takes 9999 damage from a failed spell cast and instantly dies. My whole warband proceeds with similar luck and wipes without managing to kill anyone. Start again as the Mercenaries, first match is against Skaven and things are going pretty good. I lose my Hero and the Rat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steals his halberd, but I chase him down immediately and finish him off with a clean charge which causes them to route... Wait a minute, where's my Halberd? Oh right, after killing the rat I didn't have the movement left to pick up his loot which means even though I won, I still lost my weapon, and the Market doesn't refresh for another 7 missions.I want to like this game, being a warhammer nut, but the consequences for failure are too extreme. I don't mind consequences, I don't even mind Permadeath as long as you are reasonably able to avoid them, but it is nearly impossible to get through the first few days without some crippling loss beyond your control. For me what ultimatley defines a game as trash is whether or not I get unreasonably frustrated/angry while playing it and struggle to find enjoyment, and I have not rage quit a game so quickly since Chrono Cross.With all that said if you're not easily frustrated even by obviously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics (Not intended as a Jab against Mordheim),  and you catch the game on sale for 70% off or something it's probably worth picking up, but only if you're a fan of Warhammer Fantasy.

								Played the table top with a mate back in my uni days. So far the game is really capturing the feeling of what it was like to play the table top game. I played a few rounds with what is already there and I know the game is in good hands, I don't want to touch it again until full release. Looking forward to the final game!			"

												This game has its problems but it is fun and exciting. You can build your warband and history of it the way you like. The game can be harsh. But there is nothing like having a rough missen and just watching your warband come back and crush the enemy and live. If you don't like games that is high stake probably not for you but if you like the games where you can be the underdog and come back with a knock out then you might enjoy it.			"

												FOR PEOPLE THAT LOVE CHALLENGING GAMES (Dark Souls for example) this is most likely an interesting game to buy.If you're a Warhammer fan, you have to buy it, what so ever.Very steep learning curve, unforgiving AI (props to the devs). In the beginning I often thought ''well the AI isn't going to punish this, can't be that smart) and then it did exactly that. Probably one of the best AI's I have ever played against, you don't even have to play againt other players. The veteran mechanic where your soldiers can get permanent wounds or even die and get removed from your party makes every single game nerv shattering and very exiting.The 4 DLC heros the devs added are very creative and add new aspects to the game, so if the devs get some more time they will do wonders.Every Race plays differently and even within each race evey warband is different. Extremely high replay value.I have never been addicted to an other game other than Dark Souls, but this one is a gem. "

												I like to think I'm an easy-going person. I've never actually given a game a negative review. But I guess that changes here.To say this game is brutal would be an understatement. This game loves to poke you in the eye and then keep pushing with its finger. Now, I don't mind a challenge. In fact I usually relish it. But this game takes it to a new level of frustration to the point where any semblance of fun goes out the window.After about a dozen battles, I've lost three warband captains. Sure, I can hire new ones no problems, but the enemies I face only get progressively more difficult, meaning the guy who's supposed to be the anchor to my party has to hide in the back and avoid even thinking about direct combat, because if these later enemies even sneeze on him, he'll explode. And captains are mandatory to actually fight.I could forgive the game's lack of polish, the mediocre graphics, the absurdly long load times (upwards of 2-3 minutes to load a skirmish with an i7 and SSD!), the little bugs, the glitchy interface, even the random crashes and framerate drops I keep experiencing. At it's core it's still a fairly fun system.But just when things actually seem to be looking up and I win a few matches, I find it's just a lull of false security. I go to look at the day's available missions. Both are labeled Hard or Deadly in difficulty, and with non-optimal deployment setups (I've found that if you don't start with your warband tightly placed, you WILL get slaughtered). I use some of the few gold I have left to send out scouts and find another mission. Nope, still Brutal difficulty with sub-optimal deployments. Well, maybe I can skip the day and refresh it. But wait, I have a wyrdstone shipment to complete, and if I don't get it sent out the game is gonna shove its finger in my eye again.So I grit my teeth and go to the lowest difficulty mission available. Of course my warband has to be scattered across the map. Of course the computer player actually knows where your guys are, even if you're not in LoS. Of course the weakest of my three teams is almost immediately ambushed before I can group up properly. Of course they're scoring critical hits left and right and of course my guys are largely missing, even with 80% or greater chances of hitting.Which brings me to perhaps my main complaint. This game straight-up cheats. There is NO WAY a properly programmed random number system should JUST HAPPEN to wind up with the overwhelming majority of my attacks and dodges, when my displayed chance of success is 80% or higher, being failed rolls. Sure, even with a 95% chance some attacks are going to miss. But I shouldn't be whiffing six or seven times in a row with those odds.Anyway, I think the breaking point for me was the last fight I was talking about above. I'm getting slaughtered, but grouping up and actually starting to turn it around. Strange how the enemy troops ALWAYS have ""room"" to disengage and flee, but I'm always blocked in. I'm trying to run down one of these guys, I just need to hit him one more time and he should be out. My guy traps him in a room and attacks. 84% chance to hit. It shouldn't be any surprise at this point what the result was. Then the AI guy makes a counter-attack, scores a critical hit of course, which stuns my guy, and next turn he gets two full attacks to kill my guy.In frustration I slam my fist on my desk. My Black Mesa coffee mug, which I've had for over four years, bounces off and shatters on the floor.This game all but literally destroyed my favorite piece of diningware. 0/10(And yes, of course several of my highest-ranked warband members were permanently maimed after the fight)			"

												Alrighty, let me start by saying my quarrels with the game. It is slow. It is unforgiving. It is not unfair like everyone who is writing a bad review says so.It is slow in  how the battles unfold. Almost in a good way, because you do need to strategicly place your units and you have to crunch numbers on your risk/rewards. The beginning of battle usually consists of scattering your units to loot before you need to regroup in preparation of the actual battle.It is unforgiving in which to say YOU NEED MORE THAN YOUR TOP PLAYERS! It is almost like a rogue-like. Anything with permadeath and injuries should be taken that way. So train who you can, in all fields, or you won't easily be forgiven in being stingy.Now here's the class session on how the numbers work, because the misunderstanding is giving a B average game a bad name.-If I roll a d20, each numeral corresponding with 5% (1= 5%, 2=10%, 3=15%, etc.) with an 80% chance to Successfully SWING (Not hit) then all I need to do is roll a 4 or higher. Easy to hit right? No.-Now the opponent rolls to see if the Successfully Dodge (granted I met the swing roll). Let's say they are in dodge stance for a 50% dodge rate. If you successfully swing, the opponent gets to check for an 11 roll or higher. If they do so successfully, tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thats how checks work.-Normally in games like this a critical swing is only dodged by a critical roll as well, if at all. So really, an 80% hit chance is a 40%. Or a 42ish% if critical swings bipass dodge rolls all together.Anyways. My point is, don't buy into the ""RNG is broken and unbalanced"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t everyone is complaining about.In terms of strategy: 8/10RPGness: 8/10Difficulty: 9/10Overall: 7/10Only brought down by the otherwise unappreciated slow pace of how the entire game draws out. But if you have patience with it, I'd say its a solid 8. 9 even if they add expansions.			"

												I think I would enjoy this game a great deal more if it was even minutely less 'hardcore.'  Such as allowing saved game files after completed missions, and reloading to those saves after those successful missions.  Or, I don't know, maybe a way to remove the permanent, random, and absolutely brutal injury penalties units receive faster than most people can blink.Being a completionist, I find many of the game mechanics infuriating, not least of which is the steep learning curve with ZERO forgiveness for accidents, mistakes, and inattention.  I play games to relax, and this game.  It is not relaxing.If, however, you like the Fantasy Warhammer setting, and the 'uh-murs-uv' atmosphere it actually manages to achieve, then this game is for you.			"

												I love this game for the fun feel of building up a party. While the perma-death/Ironman feel may turn off some, It feels a bit like a fun little miniatures game down at your local game shop, circa 2001-2007.  Only thing that could have been better is a persistent enemy force, so you could face the same groups over and over, developing rivalries, that ONE jerk you want to put down, etc...As it is, the enemy parties are just random, or static.  Neither gets across the feel of actual consequences to your enemies, only to YOUR team.So, I recommend it.  Wish It was mod friendly or I knew how to code., because that's where so many minor little problems could have been solved.			"

												Being a veteran of the Table top Mordheim, I decided my life would not be complete without the Video game version. And let me tell you, I regret nothing from my purchase. This adaptation of the Table top game has me coming back to the fight just to continue the story of my Scaven Warband led by none other than Master Splinter himself.Mordheim: City of the Damned is not a easy nor forgive game at all. One wrong placement of your henchmen or your leader getting mobbed on by the sisters of battle and... you're done. If you enjoy an EXTREME challenge, then this game is perfect for your disturbed mind.  "

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a tactical, turn based strategy game inspired by Game Workshop's tabletop minataure game of the same name. The game itself is beautiful, in as much as any game based in a city torn apart by plague, cthulu-esque dark gods and magic, and skirmishing adventurers can be beautiful. The designs for the maps and the members of each warband are well designed and suit the 'feel' of each unit type. The A.I. whilst at time prone to bugs and occasionally being incredibly derpy is for the most part well rounded and intelligent. Each unit has it's own specific feel and then is reflected in the A.I. with Skaven swarming as much as possible and often retreating incrdibly early. Chaos are glass canons, hitting hard and constantly coming at your band with very little self survival instinct but dying fairly quickly compartively. Mercenarys are from the little I've experienced long range specialists with a good well rounded unit structure and the Sisters of Sigmar are tanky, with large amounts of hit points and heavy armour- charging into battle and hitting like frieght trains, but falling underneath swarm tactics fairly quickly. All in all the difference in unit types, attitudes, playstyles and structure mix in to create a well rounded and appealing game. The mechanics themselves are interesting and certianly appealing, if at times being a little slow to react. But considering the map sizes, the warbands avaliable at the fact the number generator for everything is a true random number generator I can forgive a few misinterprated actions and slow load times here and there. The only advice I would give to anyone considering is buy it, choose a faction based on your specific style and if a skirmish or campaign takes more than 3 minutes to load close the game and restart it.

												@eawelcome to mordheim...my hero rat (skaven) lost a leg on his first day... now he have a peg leg...seriously... this isn't a ""wannabe hardcore"" game... this is hardcore.hard to learn, impossible to master.there is tons of stuff to learn, you need hours of hours to skill and equip your warband just to lose them anyway. permadead and permasave ftw.so this is more a warning...you need time... lots of time, to get into this game. however, it is deep and rewarding if you have the patience to read tons of stuff ingame & learn the hard way. if you one of these guys who switch games every week anyway, this is not for you... really it isn't. every battle is intense and you can lose lots of your progress if you fail... for example, if you think darkest dungeon is hardcore, this game will teach you a lesson what hardcore really means. recommended for people, who wants to ""work"" to get into the game... all other should stay out of mordheim... play something where you can save the world and be the overpowerd hero. in mordheim, only death, frustration and insane awaits you...still here and reading ?fine! well, this game is ... amazing. the third person action perspective and running around like an action game is... fresh and innovative for a turn based game. for a ""die hard tatical gamer"" who played games like ja2 or xcom to death on ironman, it's a new perspective and a ""must have"". the handling of the game is fast and easy, but like i said before, there are tons of information and stuff to consider, tactical deepness included.still curious ? give it a try and you will see... mordheim awaits you.@ releasenothing changed, everything is fine.

												After reading many of the reviews, I was very sceptical about Mordheim, having played a lot of the table top Mordheim . In the end I did bought it and --- I was pleasantly surprised by the game.The story line is captivating.The user interface and controls are a bit getting used to, but it works.Warband management is fun.AI is not always very smart, but that's ok.Loading times are quite acceptable.The waiting time when enemy models move can be long. If I have to find an area where the game can be improved it would be this.In short, this is the best game I bought since Skyrim.It is perfect for the casual gamer, who, after a day of hard work and when the kids are asleep, wants to have a good game to play for a couple of hours. Not sure I would recommend this for a die hard gamer who spends 10+ hours of gaming a day.			"

So many money grubbing companies dont seem to realize that they cut their own throat's while  trying and make a dime this way. I have many table top gaming friends who will not buy this game due to that, as a matter of fact if i knew they would do this i would not have bought it.Look what happened with sword coast legends...held back content in order to sell it to us and ended up with a lackluster product that could have been GREAT. Serves um right that they went out of buisness, i wish that on every company that does this. Again fun game horrible HORRIBLE marketing.			"

												I feel compelled to write a review based on how many negative reviews with low play time I am seeing showing up.This game will frustrate you while you learn the mechanics this is a given.  Even with 300+ plus hours in when I screw up and 3 Skaven jump out after i moved a little to far and take out my leader and i know i'm going to have an injury roll I will panic.  But i have to say that is what keeps the game interesting and fits the setting.  Mordheim chews up people and spits them out eyes, arms, legs your sanity all are on the line when you head into the city of the damned.  Having a real risk is what helps keep the game fresh as you have to replace your megolmaniac wizard because you though you could send him an extra couple doors down the seemingly empty alley to pick up some wyrdstone.The main point is i don't even think I knew what i was doing until 5+ hours of playtime and wasn't even doing it well until maybe 10-15+.

												Tough. ""Unfair"" in an RNG kind of way; but if you've played real tabletop games, with real dice, you know how hard the dice can be. That said, losses are fairly inconsequential. I recommend it, but be careful in your movements during combat, and hold off onto the quest missions until well after they show as ""normal"" difficulty.			"

								The game is good and well done even for a EA is realy realy well done, don't remember any ea polished and stable as this one.The dev keep in touch with the players(they answer if you ask on the forum) and are honest on waths going on ( a lot of other dev can learn something from those guys, i'm looking at you cyanide but someother too).The game itself has all you expect from this genre, difference race to choose from, every race is different but you can also personalize them a lot with a good amount of equip/skill choice.In the strategic aspect you have your band of man to manage plus the possibility to choose the mission you will do, you will get randomized missions every day ( the repleability of this game is almost infinite).On the tattic part, well... you have to succede and keep your man alive if possible!If you like strategic/tactic turn based game this one CAN'T MISS IN YOUR LIBRARY!

												Definitely a great game.Strategic, stylish, hard, a game you would like to play by time to time. It is not common in modern games.Pvp would give it lust to a sort of ""end game"" after you trained a group for a while and maybe the IA gets boring (I'm on 300+ hours on it).Vote: 9Cheers!			"

												I feel compelled to write a review based on how many negative reviews with low play time I am seeing showing up.This game will frustrate you while you learn the mechanics this is a given.  Even with 300+ plus hours in when I screw up and 3 Skaven jump out after i moved a little to far and take out my leader and i know i'm going to have an injury roll I will panic.  But i have to say that is what keeps the game interesting and fits the setting.  Mordheim chews up people and spits them out eyes, arms, legs your sanity all are on the line when you head into the city of the damned.  Having a real risk is what helps keep the game fresh as you have to replace your megolmaniac wizard because you though you could send him an extra couple doors down the seemingly empty alley to pick up some wyrdstone.The main point is i don't even think I knew what i was doing until 5+ hours of playtime and wasn't even doing it well until maybe 10-15+.

												Been playing this game as it has evolved from a small flame to a great blaze of a game. The game can be overwhelming at first with the difficulty and the amount of information you are given right away. What warband to play, what skills to take and what to do when your favorite warband member gets his arm removed from his torso.With some experience with the game you will develop your own playstyle so don't worry too much about knowing it all at once. The developers managed to translate the experience of a table top game into a video game. It still needed work before this last update that makes for it's official release, but the game has moved in the right direction to keep me coming back again and again.  "

Early Access Review
								Definitely a lot of potential here, a fantastically charcterful and good looking game, but I have some frustrations about it:-Clipping on scenery is a pain. Sometimes it takes an unnecessary amount of walking to get around a corner. I've also had henchmen get inside a building, then not be able to get back out, as there was a slight clipping issue with a piece of scenery (rubble) just inside the door.-Warbands look superficially different, but statistically behave almost identically in battle, there is very little differentiating between the different troop types and playstyles, even having a massive two handed weapon has the same effect as having a weapon in each hand.-AI tends to rout a bit too easily, meaning you dont get to loot their wagon or corpses (although I believe you will be getting access to all the remaining map loot in the full campaign).-Magic and missile weapons are a bit underwhelming, considering the extra effort to use them effectively.Some of these gripes are bugs that will (hopefully) be ironed out by release, but some are game mechanics which make the game less interesting to me. I still think it's a fun game with a lot going for it, and a lot of potential to be even better, and recommend giving it a go.			"

												Great game TONS of depths! Most of the reviews you see are complaining about difficulty in the game. This game is extremely unforgiving and the AI is smart. I HIGHLY recommend if you're a fan of strategy and tactics then you need to pick up this game just be warned that this game is unforgiving it will punish you extremely hard for making a mistake, like loss of troops *perma death or injury or having to restart your game.*Now with that being said when you buy, I recommend that you look at what warband would be good for your play style and possible pick up that dlc, I prefer the undead/Vampires. Pro:Difficulty :Tactics and strategy :Map layouts and variation of objectives::Tons of different warbands to choose from:Fully customizable troops and heros:Warband management's beyond combat   Cons:DLC DLC DLC:RNGI got the game on sale and when all the DLC were on sale.Over all if you love games like:Xcom with Iron Maiden mode turned on then this game is for you.If you hate games that:Wont hold your hand or tell you what to do or let you turn down the difficulty then this game is NOT for you.

												Sadly i found this game to be extremely unbalanced and just downright boring to play since you kept being slaughtered and since your war-band gets negative buffs things only got worse and worse and it feels like the developers are going out of there way  to make the game feel unplayable for  a new audience.  I really tried to get good on this game but when you constantly get surrounded every single game when your war-band gets places randomly across the map and your enemy are all assembled and are going to pick you off one by one ( since the AI does not care about the in game resources). It is not a good kind off balancing when you keep getting screwed over and since there is little to no tutorial you cant know what you are doing wrong so you can learn and therefore get better. What would make this game much better would be a hint page in a corner that tells the player that they for example should aim to get better armor and so on. Right now i would only recommend this game to those players who have a high tolerance for BS and like to learn by losing and get better that way because this game is real gorgeous and feels like a warhammer game.

												Mordheim is a game about making the best out of a bad situation, this the first message you receive when you start a new warband and is worth repeating here, at the beginning.TLDR: This is the best squad-level turn based strategy game I have played. It is brutal, your guys will get injuries, they will die; but they are just tools in your warband, replacable when they break or wear out. That is the beauty of this game, there is risk which adds tension and makes the reward actually have value. A battle can be won multiple ways through killing your enemy, objectives, or looting. The best part of this game is the multiplayer, In order to enjoy the multiplayer you have to join the Permaleague, where players only play a given warband in league games, look for ""experimental permaleague"" in steam groups.Full review:The mechanics of the game are an adaptation of a time tested tabletop game by Games Workshop, aka Warhammer franchise. You control a group of warriors from 1 of 6 factions as they adventure into the city of Mordheim (the fantasy version of a post apocalytic metropolis) in order to collect valuable resources scattered throughout. Each of your warriors has a limited pool of action points and offensive points and employ them to accomplish various things such as taking cover, charging, ambushing, fighting stances, and special attacks. At the beginning of the game, these choices are fairly basic but gain complexity as the warriors you control gain experience/skills. This is not to say the game is easy; equipment choice, unit positioning, and balancing the tasks of gathering resources and defending yourself while accomplishing mission objectives takes time to master. When yours or your enemies units are removed from combat by having hp reduced to 0, they must make checks to determine if they were permanently injured, and if so to what extent: warriors can loose arms, legs, eyes, and so much more!Injuries can be painful, and certain injuries warrant sending the warrior 'off to buy the farm'. Other injuries are perfectly managable; after all when you arrive at the grave, what does it matter if your a little busted up! It really depends on the goals you set for yourself, if you want to beat the single player campaign with a faction it doesnt matter if some of your warriors are beat up at the end. If your goal is to create a team to play online, your soldiers are going to get killed, a lot, at the end of the day its about the resources you collect, you can always recruit another Johny Swordsman. Another great thing about this game is you can have a battleground loss and a tactical victory meaning you completed the objective but were routed from the field, or loose both on the battleground and tactically and still feel like you came out ahead because of the resources collected; or because you lucked out and all your injured warriors recovered and you got some experience. There are multiple ways to assess a battle's success.With regards to the single player campaign; starting can be hard and you will not have enough money at the beginning to accomplish everything. Dont worry about training skills on warriors until they have a few levels on them and you have added to your coffers. The story missions can be fun, but can also be frustrating because as its turn based you sometimes have to wade through a whole round of activations in order to get to the one guy that has the objective item.The veteran point system in the game is also great. As you play through the single player campaign you can complete various tasks much like the steam achievement system. However these points can be spent in game to give you some additional perks as you play and carry through into any new warbands that you start. Because they also carry through to multiplayer warbands, this is the first game I have played where I actually care to complete achievements, as they mean slight perks when creating your multiplayer warbands. But its additional motivation to play through all the factions.Which brings me to my final point. The multiplayer in this game is where I've had the most enjoyment. However you wont find anyone in the games public matchmaking system. In order to get a good multiplayer experience you must join the Mordheim Permanent League, (experimental permaleague in steam groups). In this league players create a new warband and exclusively play that warband in league games. This makes it so nearly all the resources you accuire are contested by another player, making those resources actually feel like they have value because of that. The league rules are set up so players match warband experience levels in multiple ways so play is never terribly lopsided.If you enjoy turn based strategy, have the gumption to take one on the chin in a bad situation and keep fighting, are a fan of Warhammer tabletop, or best case scenario all 3, then I can't recommend this game enough!

												i love warhammer in general, and played the table top game (and Warband before it) which is a good time and close to this, but i dont really have much fun with these random number generated pc games anymore.  Just always feels like the ai gets what he needs every time, and i get borked.  also visibility is just a headache and not something that was in the tabletop obviously, and will lead to some disasters that have long term implications that the ai doesnt have to deal with.  I dont mind perma lose, but the feeling of getting forced into it when you shouldnt otherwise was just a bit frustrating for me. game has decent graphics and mechanics otherwise, the missions can be fun, altho if you dont know what the objectives are ahead of time you are going to get hurt which can be particularly painful after doing it perfect, then having to run around looking for an objective for hours then the ai spawns all over the map and wipes out your whole party and kills multiple members for good that have otherwise never made a mistake.I keep trying to get into this game, and just playing through my loses, but when you start feeling jacked and the problem starts compounding because you are now missing a vital element from your team the frustration just increases exponentially for me especially when combined with the problems above.also the object of the game is slightly more confused in this format, and not really digging how they did the dlc's...

Early Access Review
								7 hours into the game. Honestly, I think this game has huge potentials, but right now I only seem to get trashed on by every other faction. Even when I'm at an advantage of 4vs2. Example: 4 of my warband have a 77% chance to hit, ALL of them. Even with such a decent chance, they miss, EVERY, SINGLE, TIME. But then again, it's early access. I don't use the hit chances as a reason to write the negatives, especially since I know this game will be great when it'll release. But I have to say, this game made me rage-quit more than the Russians on CS:GO. Still recommending this game.Positives:- Great models for different factions- Great environment, feels like you're really in a ruined city.- Lots of various ways to level up your characters- Customization (Personally think this is a huge deal)- Fair 'economy'- Passive objectives (Objectives that come back after a while, but always the same kind)- Various weapons, lots and lots of weapons.- Huge potential- Updates happen frequently- Fair amounts of damage given and taken- Too many options for customization, which I personally see as a good thingNegatives:- 'Unfair' chances to hit (My experience)- 'Unfair' amounts of movement for other parties (Sometimes they just run 50 metres without giving a damn)- Not enough hair models and beards (I want more beards)- Limited amount of factions (Would be nice if there were a little more options to choose from, my opinion)- Getting stuck on some of the surroundings even though you're not even touching it or even getting stuck.Early Access score: 6/10Potential score: 9/10With other words, I'd buy it before the price goes higher, this game has potential like no other.

In all fights your opponent is stronger and most time you have no chances to make the second goal of a mission, unless you sacifice some of your hard trained troops...But the rest of the game is awesome.

Early Access Review
								Really, really, really wanted to enjoy this game, but there is just way too much RNG, everything is RNG. I love the fact your characters can get injured and you have to manage your warband, not just throw them into repeated combat and I don't mind having rolls on my attacks, my dodges, my spells, the things that I understand mordheim and games like it are all about but in a game where having a small advantage will win you the game having character placement down to RNG is just insane. Start the game with a character a little too far away or a little too close to multiple enemies and you've immediately lost before you've even started, sure you can fight, try to group up but the point is that tiny bit of RNG completely influences the rest of the game. It feels as if any choice I make is overall irrelevent because the match started with me a player down. The RNG on routing also drove me crazy, multiple games I have played now where when it comes down to it I was the obvious winner, but my team surrendered because a random henchman in no tactical position at all who I pretty much sacrificed to ensure me the overall victory died. I've had teams rout when they're still a player up, 3v2 with higher health and better equipment than their opposition. Theres just far too many RNG influences in the game that take the overall result away from the players control, it feels as if no matter how good or bad you play the result is mostly decided from the initial starting positions, if I get the jump on the enemy I'll win, if I don't I'll lose. That wouldn't be so bad if ""getting the jump"" involved pulling them into an ambush but it doesn't, it involves getting lucky enough to start in useful positions. TLDR: If you're the kind of person who doesn't get frustrated by losing a game down to a couple of bad rolls in the first few minutes of gameplay then this game is probably going to be enjoyable for you.

												Terrible UI. I cannot stress this enough. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥iest UI i have ever seen. It is so♥♥♥♥♥♥that playing RTS games on a console would be enjoyable compared to this♥♥♥♥♥♥Then there is the arbitrary looting system. You have to loot stuff while you are in combat because when your enemy is defeated your team decides to go home. Oh hey we have killed everyone that opposes us, better not loot anything. It is crap to enforce a system like this to impose feigned difficulty when it makes no sense. You have to leave enough enemies alive to loot their dead comrades. Makes. Perfect. Sense.The AI cheats. Big whoop: 6 misses in a row on an 80% chance to hit? No problem! Said enemy then goes to succeed ""all alone check"" and kills two guys. Oh and this is not a one time thing. It happens pretty much every second mission. The AI also always knows exactly where you are at all times.The game is also glitchy. Full of nonsenseical ""mechanics"" that really seem more like bugs than features. The collision detection is bullcrap, you get constantly stuck on edges. The camera glitches out of view. I could go on...Did i mention that the RNG is crap? Have i said that the UI is the equivalent of playing a driving game with only a mouse? Have i said that the game masquerades as ""hard"" by having really ♥♥♥♥♥ty design?There is one more thing. You are stuck in third person mode, you can check the map but the third person view handicaps you severely, you cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game would actually be better if they scrapped the graphics and you only played from the top down map.Do not pay money for this DLC cashgrab ridden pice of crap.

												Gets the dark and twisted atmosphere of the Warhammer world just right imo.

The progression and customisation system for the warbands is great, but be prepared for permanent injuries including missing limbs...			"

												This is a.... weird game. After more than ten hours of play I still can't decide if I really like it or not. Party management is a lot of fun and quite compelling, but the actual combat in missions (which is what's going to take up most of your time) is kind of boring. Especially in the early game combat is just a slugfest to see how the RNG likes more, once you start getting skills and spells it changes a little, but it essentially still boils down to a melee slugfest 99% of the time. The races don't feel distinct enough, they have a short list of 6 unique skills (3 active, 3 passive), their own spell list (none of which will make you go WOW LOOK AT THAT MAGIC!), and skaven and sisters have a few unique weapons. Other than that though all races share basically everything, I think the devs missed a huge opportunity by deciding that every race should have a warband of exactly the same size, which is one of the biggest deviations from the tabletop game. Only having four races too gets boring to play against.So I think in the end I don't know if I can reccomend this unless you're a big fan of the old tabletop game and are willing to give up some concessions to have a video game that's fairly similar to it. Someone looking for a deep tactical game would probably be better served looking elsewhere at something like Valkyria chronicles as the RNG is the sole determinant in combat and it can be INCREDIBLY swingy.  The party management is great, and if you're super into that kind of thing you might like this game, but it does feel very, very grindy at times.			"

												Short version? it's fun, and a definite buy with friends to play it with.Long version, Mordheim is a game that really tears me up, on one hand, the emotional side of me gets attached to each character, you can customize each one with a flurry of options and even write your own biography for them.  On the other hand, if you actually use them and they are put out of combat (happens pretty often by the way, even if you're experienced a bad RNG for a match can still ruin your day.)  then they could get brain damage, lose a limb, an eye, get a permanent wound, or even straight up die, which really breaks my heart when I spent so much time making them into a real character and then firing them because they got hit so hard they don't even remember where they are in the next battle.So, if you like emotional heartbreak and aren't afraid to use a little imagination, definitely a game for you.While the RNG can be a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times, its usually fairly balanced and you'll get an extremely good game for each extremely bad one.  The game plays A LOT like XCOM, just in a very different setting.  To make things even more fun, it plays like XCOM does on ironman mode, with autosaves aplenty and no save scumming (or at least minimal) so what you do actually means something.So, if you like XCOM, and want a challenge, go for it.But maybe you really hate the fact that there's no progression in XCOM, that every game means you lose all your previous progress, well well well,  Mordheim's got you covered.  They put in a ""Veteran System"", which basically means the more you play, the better each new warband you make gets, crazy stuff right? So if you like progression throughout an entire game and also through each one of the warbands you create. you know what to do.You like choices?  Well, there's a few.  Sure, four warbands may not be a ton of choices, but like the rest of the choices in game, they actually matter.  Each different warband actually has an entirely different storyline, that's baller!  I mean, that makes the game like, 4 times more replayable, at least!  Not to mention each warband looks and plays distinctly differently.  You may play your sisters of sigmar like tanks, and your skaven like rogues, or you could do it the other way around, I don't judge.So if you like choices, yup, this game is the way to go.Maybe you hate difficult games, well then this is tough for me to recommend, but I'll do it anyway!  In fact, you should recommend it too!  Grab a friend, name a warband ""The Salvation Army"" and feed your friends to your heart's content!  Easy mode has never been so, well, easy!Want something easy? Yeah, mordheim even has that.Or maybe you wanna show off the greatest warband that has ever existed.  Can't get enough of rubbing it in your friends faces that you wreck everything, but don't want all your grade A units to come back from a battle beaten and bruised? Oh man, guess what?  Yeah, morheim's got you.  In exhibition mode you can crush your friends warband without actually destroying it for real, proving you're the king of the city of the damned (for whatever that title is worth.)Like to brag?  Do it.I guess it wouldn't be a review without a bad section though, I'd like to see coop 2v2 warband matches, I think that'd be cool.  Then you could mix up your strategies and build warbands around support, I'd love to see some straight healers supporting another warband, it would bring a whole new perspective to the game.  The item interface is mildly annoying, the fact that you can't drop items and cant get rid of anything unless you put it in a chest is really inconvenient, especially on missions where you have to pick up certain items, but I suppose you could always just consider it another resource management tactical choice ""should I pick up this nice item? or use this character to go get the quest items?"" Finally, impressive units are insane, I have to push my whole team on one to even attempt to fight it, and if its friends are nearby they wreck me.  It's not even about luck at that point, they are just entirely too good at both offense and defence.  My whole team can barely take one out (relatively early game) and then they get to have 3 swings on my characters?  It's like the game is trying to wound my warband.So, get this game, and also, if you don't have friends, just add me, I'm game to feed you whenever.			"

								Every patch this game just keeps getting better. Even though Skaven are unfinished, they play like Skaven, and are fun as hell to work with. I have only ever won 2 matches, because of the incomplete species, but I refuse to play anything else (I have tried them!).The controls take a little getting used to, but they work very well. The camera issues are slowly getting worked out in each patch and new content is being added at an extremely reasonable rate.The graphics are beautiful, the weapons are perfect, and the whole concept to implementation makes this my #2 Games Workshop PC game (Sorry blood bowl 2 wins here I am too biased....).Buy this while its on offer in pre-release and you won't be disapointed.

			Mordheim City of the Damned - Ep 1 - We start a new warband of human mercenaries and join the treasure hunt in the city of Mordheim. This episode also explains the gameplay mechanics and tutorials.		

 The good thing about Mordheim is the atmosphere, graphics, dynamic feeling turn based combat, customization of your warband and RPG elements. The bad things are the clunky UI, poor AI and horrible long loading times. However, if you like games like Xcom and other squad based games don't miss out on Mordheim - It's still a great game!			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. This game is insanely difficult, and if you're a working adult like me and your hardcore gaming days are gone, then you don't have the time it takes to slog through this. More importantly, the level of difficulty makes it un-fun for me. But If you're a huge fan of the Warhammer universe like I am and you just need to get this, get it when it's deeply discounted.This game follows recent trends towards making incredibly difficult games where one setback can actually derail the entire campaign. Lots of people seem to like that level of difficulty, and so what I see as negatives, fans of this style of game will see only positives. There are two aspects to the game: squad-based tactical combat and a long-term metagame. First, the combat. Yes this game looks great, the environments are all impressively detailed and the cramped urban environments make levels with a wide-range of tactical choices. But your squaddies miss too often, even when they have 80%+ to hit. The enemies never seem to have problems hitting, however, and you can check the community page threads for people having similar complaints with the RNG. I don't enjoy games where RNG can f*** everything up if you've taken steps to get in a good tactical position. Why/how do 4 attacks miss on a skaven which is surrounded? Combat is brutal and troops which get KOd require expensive treatments and healing time before they can return (or they can just permadie). It's so easy for your troops to get KO'd that you'll spend a lot of your gold getting them treatment, which means you won't have gold for other stuff.And on that point, the long-term meta-game is also too hard. You'll have money problems like I said when you have to provide treatment for troops who get KO'd because they missed all their 80% to-hit attacks so they can get critted to death in return. The main objective of the meta-game is to collect wyrdstone (during the combat levels)  to deliver to your faction. It starts out OK, 75 for the first shipment, 120-something for the second. But then it quickly ramps up to unattainable amounts--I say unattainable because selling surplus wyrdstone is how you make gold to pay for treating injuries or training skills or spells. So on the 3rd+ wyrdstone shipment, you have to decide between making the money you need to keep your warband running, or saving up for the faction delivery. Because it's so easy for your troops to get hurt, it's also easy to fall hopelessly behind in the meta-game of wyrdstone deliveries, which dooms your warband to failure, because missing one delivery adds a fee to the next one. One mission that goes bad can screw your entire game, because having troops in recovery means you go on less missions, which means you're getting less wyrdstone, and you have no hope of making the deadline. Some people like the type of game where one setback can send you all the way back to the start. That's fine, but many of us don't enjoy that and I feel like that was properly advertised. Luckily for me I grabbed this when it was early-access *and* on sale at the same time. I know that I won't finish this game, because I don't have the time necessary to slog through it. Which is a shame, because the world of Mordheim that these guys built really comes to life (ironically enough) and the graphics look awesome, and the maps are great. I hope (and I know this probably won't happen) that they make a 'normal' mode which is less painful for non-hardcore gamers.  Any of these ideas for a 'normal' mode would be welcomed by many players, I'm sure:-Lower the current increases in required wyrdstone for each shipment after the first. Example: Ship2=~120; Ship3=~220, about 100 more wyrdstone required within the same time-limit (!)-Make Wyrdstone more valuable on the market, and/or reduce the cost of training skills/spells.-Reduce the cost of treatments! OK, maybe that wouldn't mesh well with the setting of Mordheim in the Warhammer IP. How about increasing the value of wyrdstone instead? -Nerf the enemies stats and/or RNG (only when playing the game in 'normal' mode)-Make it so that you can recover from a major setback. This is the one thing that absolutely needs to change. Make wyrdstone more valuable to allow a player to have the resources he needs to be able to survive and recover from a major setback.			"

												Punishing. Demanding. Grueling. I feel like reaching a point where the game isn't constantly stressful and extremely difficult will never be within my grasp. there is nothing that pulls me to play as the only victories i can achieve are when bugs prevent my enemies from jumping down or climbing and losing just means i lost all my gear/everyone is injured so a fresh new warband would be stronger. after playing what was reccomended for new players, the standard reikland soilders for hours and making it partway through their storyline all the things that excited me about this game have faded away and i regret my decision to put this on my wishlist and wait for it to go on sale (as well as buying all dlc except undead). i had a really good feeling about this game and enjoyed the first few hours just the amount the enemy increases in strength compared to the amount you decrease in strength with every loss is rediculous as well as the quest diffuculty rating. a ""normal"" mission that has a chaos spawn that can kill over half my warband single handedly is kinda rediculous			"

												Mordheim attempts to recreate the experience of tabletop gaming, and somehow manages to do so in a way that reminds you of all the worst gaming experiences at once. From the abysmal loading times, to the long periods spent waiting for your opponent to complete their moves, to the incredible frustration of your actions success being so completely random, you wonder why the entire results aren't just automated.The gameplay experience is hampered by the complete lack of difficulty settings in the game, and what appears to be a strong AI bias in chances of success. Frequently you'll encounter opposing AI warbands who have managed to position their entire force around your single guy.On the positive side, the game has gorgeous, thematic graphics and a complelling soundtrack, however this isn't supposed to be a movie that you watch but a game that you play. Would not recomend this game to anyone.			"

												Just bought this game.  Love the concept.  Love games like Xcom which can be brutal.UPDATE:  Just Sold all wyrdstone gained, about 2600, spent 1600 upgrading skills, leveling fools, etc. Rank 3 - 4 warriors, rank 3.75 warband.  Previously 90% success rate.  Went to campaign mission I-II Difficulty: NORMAL.Right.♥♥♥♥ this game.  Merga ambushed Ogre, missed, was countered, crited, and stunned.  85% attacks missed 7/8 times.  70% spell chances missed twice in a row.  Ogre slaughtered 3 other melee chaos guys with 2h weapons (and Merga, my super leet chaos ♥♥♥♥♥ I get to use this mission)  by himself.  Missed him 10 / 14 times with 75% hit chances.  Archers had 46% chance to hit AN OGRE standing 15 feet away.  Bloodletter (Chaos) in Human (Empire) stongold. Ambushed my Magister after he turned a corner, Magister was stuck due to awkward positioning (nothing I could do about it), couldn't disengage.  Due to hallway couldn't get anyone else into melee.  Mercilessly beat down, 70% dodge worked 1/8 times.  Archers had 45% chance to hit, and hit for 13 damage (LOL) it had 250 wounds.6/8 out of action, took 1 of them out.  R4 Magister, dead, R3 Melee dude, Dead, R3 hero, Missing Limbs, etc etc.Just...so...stupid...			"

												RNG is what you will be up against.  Almost Xcom, yet without the polish, entertainment value, and a save feature.  The game forces you to deal with auto-saving only, so be ready to deal with missing attacks with 95% chances to hit!  2 / 10			"

												This is a good game. I just wanted to get that out of the way first. BUT. And this is a big but that I think anyone who has played more than one or two Games Workshop games can attest to. There isnt enough... This isnt Warcraft. There isnt only three factions. You have told us you are making a Mordheim game. So naturally people are like f*ck yeah I cant wait to see how different it is playing Undead as opposed to Dwarves. Or play as the old Mordheim favourites the Carnival of Chaos. But wait...? No Undead? No Dwarves? No Carnival, Orks or Witchhunters? Poor show Mordheim the video game poor show. So asides from the cop out level of completion the developers thought acceptable for a game with such an enormous set of histoyr and lore I have to say its a great game. The play style is really interesting and helps make a game that while completely different to its board game counter part is very fun. It could do with more varies missions and maybe a little voice acting but the main game is enjoyable. Permenant injuries and deaths add some excitement and can help make your warband feel very treasured and unique. The Warpstone shipment system also adds another element of much needed pressure during the campaign but I tell you nothing feels better than making that shipment and having a few days to recover.There have been a few lacklustre DLCs released for this game but nothing that makes up for the frankly insulting number of factions. You dont make a Lord of the Rings game and only put Humans and Elves in it. You CERTAINTLY dont make a Warhammer game and only put 4 factions in it. Sort it out dudes.			"

												I love this game, but at time of writing this review I have to say that it is very deeply flawed.For the most part a faithful and enjoyable adaption of Games Workshop's specialist squad-based combat system, City of the Damned is a wonderfully dark, gritty, tense and tactical experience...... once you actually load the damn thing up. My PC is not exactly what you'd call slow, but it takes phenomenal amounts of time to get past the game's loading screens. Considering that you need to go through that ordeal every time you want to fight a battle, and that battles are practically the sole focus of the game, this detracts massively from the overall experience. And while I call the game ""Tactical,"" this only really holds true playing against other human beings. The AI in this game is competent - clever, even - but nine games out of ten are almost guaranteed to have some kind of bug, whether that be running against a wall and never getting anywhere, not reliably counting as engaged in combat when fighting on or around stairs, or trying to get somewhere they simply will not fit.Despite this, however, the management and progression systems are well polished, the skill and equipment mechanics deep and interesting enough that you can spend hours customising your fighters to fit the roles you want, the injuries show up in all their gory detail on the character models, and the array of mutations available to Chaos warbands is a thing of absolute twisted beauty. I feel entirely satisfied by the breadth of customisation available in this game, and overall it does a superlative job of capturing the essence and character of the Warhammer universe.But when considering this game always bear in mind that I wrote this while waiting for a scenario to load.Edit 09/02/16: It bears mentioning that loading times have now been much improved. I would say that it's even quite quick, now, often finishing before the excellent loading screen voiceovers finish doing their thing.			"

								Looks to have potential. I am excited about playing this game as of Sept. 27 2015. It has a very good feel to it. Like playing one of the Games Workshop minature tabletop games. You can change a ton of bits on each model and paint it several different colors and schemes. The game is almost like the table top game as well with the item selections, the spells, skills, attributes, and perks all adjustable and customizeable.  There is now progression and consequences, in my first battle my hero was surrounded and defeated, in the after action report it was revealed that the hero had been mortally wounded and lost an arm. The model was forever afterwards missing a limb and could not hold a shield anymore. There are objectives during combat and the AI isn't terrible at ganging up on you and isolating single units. (not certain at this time if the AI will complete objectives of it's own or if it has them) but the game has a sense of RPG to it now.Money well spent as the developer keeps pushing out new content and seems to be working on something that could be unique in the Games Workshop videogames; a digital version of the table top game. 4 races at this time and hoping to see undead, orks, and elves, but a very solid game at this point with most bugs stompped out regularly as they creep up. I would recommend this game to any GW fans of the old mordheim and inquisitor games.P.S. I would love to see skins and maps for Inquisitor/Necromunda using this engine, all the mechanics are similar enough to make it a fantastic 40k experience.			"

												This is a great squad tactic game. Lots of fun with good risk vs reward. Squaddies can die, so be careful on placement. Just be sure not to loot too many things, as the game's resource is more valuable than weapons and especially bounty items, which should ONLY be picked up if there is an optional quest for them. When looking over your sucess roles it can be confusing as I believe the number you rolled should be a different color or something to make it stand out and better understand what you rolled.			"

												Mordheim - City of the damned. I bought the game with low expectations - expecting a Xcom style game but with swords and bows rather than guns and lasers. I haven’t played anything since. It's addictive and challenging which is a breath of fresh air from all the other 'hold your hand' titles pushed out by other gaming developers of late. Warning...! Before purchasing this game note that Mordheim is not for the weak of heart. If you’re a player that generally plays games on easy or normal difficulty and loads a prior save point whenever one of your guys dies... then this game is not for you, This game has but one setting - ****ing hard. If you’re a player who is looking for a challenging single player strategy game (which also has the option of multiplayer), enjoys building a warband - where the stats you level up, the equipment you find and the skills (or spells) you teach can make the difference between a victory or a defeat and is not going to rage when your brand new (expensive) wizard, trained in the arcane arts of magic, steps forward, arms outstretched and starts uttering the mystic words to cast a lightning bolt at some stinking rat in the distance.... but somehow gets the spell wrong and instead self-destructs in a magnificent fashion - killing himself instantly (much to the horror of your warband) then this is the game for you.

												So what IS this game exactly? Well it is to Blackguards what the new XCOMs are to the old ones. So it's a 3D tbs. But it's designed to be pretty hardcore from the outset and this actually works because it stops you getting too strong too soon and retains an addictive quality where you just don't want to accept defeat. In this sense, then, it actually has more in common with Blackguards than any other game I can think of. The same moments of feeling absolutely robbed by the RNG and the same crazy difficulty spikes. I can understand why some have downvoted it for this reason because it can be very frustrating and it constantly autosaves so, much like a roguelike, there's no getting around failure with scum saves. I read a few reviews where people criticise the AI but, to be perfectly honest, the fact that you are outnumbered by superior forces 99% of the time means that if the AI were any better you would always be crushed. The warbands are just about different enough to be worth multiple replays and overall it's a very rewarding experience for those who can stick with it.*edit* As of the introduction of the latest DLC warband - The Undead, this game is now more well polished and well rounded than ever. After almost 170 hours of playing, this is, in my opinion, on the shortlist for one of the best games ever made.			"

												I really enjoy the art style and concept  of this game, but it has a few kinks that need working out.  The AI is really lackluster, and generally he hardest enemies to fight get caught on obstacles due to poor pathing, which makes for anticlimactic games in general. I haven't tried my hand in multiplayer yet, mostly because no one ever seems to be on, and I'm not going to wait around for half an hour in matchmaking to play a game. The Ui is a bit clunky, and could really do with some streamlining. It honestly seems like they designed the controls with consoles in mind. Having the ability to tie active skills to hotkeys would be really nice, and better skill navigation in general. Overall though, this game is really enjoyable and its very easy to get caught up in the story of your warband, and there is a lot of room for tactical depth. It is like a renaissance xcom with more options. I would recommend this game if you have time to burn and like turn based strategy in small unit engagements.  8/10			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim has come by now a long way and it can keep up with many AAA Titles I saw over the years, it came a far way and I can tell you it was a joy of a ride to see the game growing together with the community. It has its flaws, but these flaws are what makes the game charming to me. ---RNG---The RNG can be very brutal like in the old X-COM games where a critical hit just keeps missing, but the moment when you still manage to pull off a victory despite the odds can be so much more rewarding. ---Difficulty---The difficulty of the game is very high and it affords a lot of tactical thinking to make progress, your warband will get injured, insane or might even die on your way of progress. In this regard it keeps itself a bit more roguelike that you progress in a veteran System to permanently unlock feats for existing and future Warbands. ---Fun---A big part of the Fun to me comes to me from the difficulty and so does the rage I feel in some moments, but let me tell you it is glorious to do. The Atmosphere is certainly there being in the dark grey alley's of Mordheim and to see the destroyed buildings and Chaos influenced area's all around. To build up your own Warband from Scratch, seeing them rank up and life or die to tell their own stories really makes this game to me. I have a little Skaven (Verminkin) named Nirk that lost his arm in the first Mission I set him into. But this little Henchman survived up to the point of writing this review and pulled himself through despite so many times where I thought him lost. He won a special place in my heart and I will cry the day he won't make it home. You will get easily attached to your Warband and mourn the loss of your favorite Units, as you customized them with 4 color and 2 skin variations on each body part, as well the several skin tones to choose from. The Campaign Missions are brutaly hard and very fun to play in my opinion, something anyone who enjoys a challenge will love. The Development team is small and for their size of 20 dev's what they created here is truly astonishing and you can tell by my review that I'm simply in love with the game and wish them only the best for its future lifespan!---Recommendation---I recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge like in the old X-COM games and loves the rage enducing nature that RNG can have with your plans. The fact that the tide of battle can shift in one moment to the next will keep you on your toes throughout the battle, while you scavange for loot and wyrdstones to keep your Boss satisfied and rank up not only your warband but also in the Veteran System and Factions to unlock Units and other Bonus. The games difficulty is certainly not for everyone, but if you love a challenge and don't mind the game being Early Access, in the current state it is one of the best I played in the last year. It easily happens that you find yourself at 3 am wondering what happened to your time, as the ""one more round!"" is very present in this. - Old Review from September 7th 2014 - With Mordheim I had more fun than many AAA games I played during the Years. The Dev's are very active on the Forums and I love their responsiveness to the matter. Many changes have already been made in way of balance or gameplay, regarding to player feedback and THIS is the reason why they have my support. The game is already good and fun to play despite it's buggy stateas well the gameplay looking already quite smooth. The Kind of open development they offer with the Roadmap on their front Page, gives everyone insight on what is inside and what is to come. The obvious bugs and frustrations that an Early Access can bring, your getting the full game at a discount and able to help and bugfix a great game to be!All I can say is that I'm in love with the game and I gladly recommend it. Though if you prefer a finished game I would recommend to wait, as it's unfinished in it's current state.			"

								I have been watching and waiting. I finally bought the game once warbands, loot, and presistance was implemented. And, at this early stage. . . I can already say this is the best dambned startegy game I have played in a long long time. Maybe even ever. It hits all my additcion triggers in a good way.			"

												Great game with lots of risk and rewards.Only 2 things I really dislike about it are:-The looong and I mean looooong load times when loading a mission-The cheap hp boost that the AI gets. I understand it is not as smart as a real person but I don't yet understand the logic behind the boost, makes some fights unfair even though it's the same units fighting on each side.Otherwise I would highly recommend this game			"

												Mordheim : The City of the Damned is a pretty complex turn based squad game where you are managing a warband fighting and looting in the streets of the city of Mordheim.A lot of people will complain the RNG is unfair or rigged due to simply not understanding the mechanics. As this is one of those games that even after a 100+ hours you occasionally will still learn new things about how to best deal with your opponents, how to minimize the effect RNG has on your success and failure.The game is in a similar genre of game to Xcom, though to be fair it has a lot more complexity and stats going on, which can lead to a lot of confusion and frustration for even the most seasoned turn based tactics gamer.This in no way makes the game worse once you get the hang of the game and how it works, it can however lead to a frustrating early experience, especially if you go into the game without understanding how it works to at least some extend.Veterans of the game will consistently have warbands with a 95%+ win rate against the AI, some of us even 99-100% win rate on majority of our warbands, which is a clear indicator that in the end, RNG is not the determining factor majority of the time.Are there times where RNG can completely mess one or two of your dudes? Yes, but you will maybe at most lose one out of a hundred matches against the AI Purely due to RNG, if you are losing more than that? It's cause the player is doing something really wrong.Now don't get me wrong, the game has its flaws, such as a reversed difficulty curve and by this I mean that due to how little control you have with a level 0 to 3 crew and the low amount of income you will have while learning the game, which can definitely make the game hellish difficulty wise the first few warbands you build until you get the hang of it.But take the time to learn the mechanics and build your warband and trust me it will pay off in the end.Should you buy mordheim? It depends, it does take a certain mindset and a lot of patience, in addition to that it requires that you accept your own mistakes as a player. It is a hardcore experience that will take a lot of dedication to master and due to that I can't recommend the game to a more casual crowd of gamers.However if you are in for a challenge, willing to accept blame for your characters horribly dying (not blame RNG) and the dedication to master the mechanics of mordheim? Well go get it already! Cause you will be in for a wild, gut wrenching ride that might just make you the richest warband of the streets of mordheim.			"

												As one who has fond memories of this game so many years ago, I'm thrilled to see it in a digital format.  It's still in early access, but already it seems very promising to truly fulfill some hefty expectations.  The fights grow ever challenging, the nostalgia is there, and the tactical turn based combat I love is well delivered.  A great game for Mordheim fans or turn based fans alike!			"

												This game has everything!! from screeching battle harpies (sisters of sigmar),chaos loonies,OP skaven and an RNG that'll leave you bald,depressed,insane and angrier than a demon who's just been castrated This game has severly p****d me off numerous times,first of all it IS a fair game,my previous experiences with Blood Bowl has hardened me somewhat to these kind of games,some of you may know exactly what I mean.NEVER (if you can help it) Go up against any foe alone, always outnumber them and flank them.NEVER try to go for wyrdstone and attack the enemy at the same time,As soon as the AI finds you, they will send all their forces at you, you'll find yourself quickly outnumbered,Tied up in combat and having to abandon all hopes of the lovely green stuff.Even sending one guy off alone to flank/steal wyrdstone while your forces are commited is risky, especially if they are caught alone, as the AI never fully commits all their forces....I found this out the hard way :(			"

								I have never reviewed a game before, but as a Warhammer Fantasy fan, and a Mordheim table top fan, this game was a dream for me. Now that it is here, I can't stop playing it. I haven't had this much fun with a video game since Skyrim first came out. Completely different games, but same level of enjoyment. I am not the most veteran PC gamer, in fact you might say I am pretty casual so my references are limited. This game is not without flaws, but the company creating the game has been very good at addressing the community's issues. There is so much more to say about this game, like that this game feels like Final Fantasy tactics all grown up, or that it is without a doubt the best Games Workshop video game to date. Anyway, as a novice commenter I hope this helps. If you like turn based strategy rpgs and dark fantasy, I cannot recommend this game enough. Kill-Stab the Man-Things!			"

								I never wrote any reviews but this game deserves one!It´s the best roundbased tactical game i´ve ever played and I played XCOM and some various games like Blood Bowl and Conquistador, Wakfu, etc.. To stay short:- Better RP elements than most of some hightrated RPG´s. (Items, Progression, Wounds,etc.)- Complex but easy to learn. Chapeu to the developers to invent a game like this. I know it´s a tabletop adoption but hey  I never heared of any roundbased game, that doesn´t reduce the enviorment and your movement to square-fields or hex-fields. In Mordheim you can move free in 3rd Person but it´s roundbased!- Best tactical game i´ve ever played. If you like XCOM or any CQC based games on squadsize, you have to get it, even if the medieval warhammer fantasy setting isn´t yours.- I had bought it on march this year but started to play around one month ago. I played several alpha-status games and this is the first I do not feel betrayed. As far as I see, the developers do  what they are promissing and they do when they say.10/10 "

												As a longtime fan of the original Games Workshop tabletop 'Mordheim' game from roughly a decade ago, it warms the pit of my bitter, cold heart to see such a fantastic digital translation of the game. If anything this version of Mordheim is richer than the original tabletop game, with many more options for customisation of your various warbands, and a bunch of campaign scenarios to battle through as well as random skirmishes.Great to see the recommended specs aren't that high either which means it'll work on most graphics cards from the last 5 years or so. Workmanlike graphics, but nice models for the warbands, who also reflect the wounds they get along the way - scars, and missing limbs appear on the game models.People complaining about the 'random number generator' aren't paying attention to the basic mechanics of the game as there's a roll to hit, vs roll to dodge by the target system in play. Means even with an 90% to hit you can still miss if the target has a good dodge ability.Not a game to be played lightly, as you'll get thrashed unless you apply intelligent use of your warband by flanking and ganging up on your opponents. Never fight 1:1, always gang up on the enemy and Mordheim will reward the unsportsmanlike warband!			"

No options (balanced or not) for multi-player. Considering how long each match takes, this might be for the best, but still something to mention that the option isn't present whatsoever.-rng injuries/battle system is fun for some, but not fun for others.-not enough customization options to make the warriors truly feel like ""your own"". Presets can be quite annoying to work with.-LOOONGG loading times. even on SSD and cranked up computer.-Occasional multiplayer D-syncs which makes playing contest matches a bit risky.keep in mind, at this point, for those more focused on the narrative, there is a ""contest"" mode which allows injuries and such to take place in multiplayer, but no way to set up leagues, multi-player matches, or other features one might expect when trying to do those old-classic crazy matches like you can when huddled around a mordheim tabletop.for 40 bucks, the quality of the game is a bit low.

												I played 20 hours in my first weekend with this game. So, it's safe to say that I'm enjoying myself.The turn-based combat is fun, challenging, balanced, and only iron-man style saved games. The artwork and world are warhammer of course, so no problems there. The rpg elements and the numbers behind them are all out in the open, and the options for customization and skills are varied, but not too overwhelming.Your soldiers can receive permanent injuries from being knocked out in combat, which comes with visual changes like scars, lost eyes, peg-legs, etc...The style of any given type of weapon is customized to not only the faction, but also the type of unit within the faction (e.g. 'helmet' not only looks different for, say, sisters of sigmar vs mercenaries, but also for hero champions vs henchmen warriors within mercenaries).There's some recycling of map assets, but there are enough different layouts, orientations, and starting points that you don't really mind, and the story missions add some interesting variety on top of the standard 'route the enemy while collecting wyrdstones'. Also, the reason you can't collect all of the wyrdstones after the battle is that a) you auto collect some and b) lore-wise your soldiers are withdrawing from a dangerous area after some of them were wounded, so they don't have time to scour the whole place (the more are alive after the battle, the more stones you get). Although, I will admit that it is an imperfect solution.I find that the UI in battle is pretty intuitive, and usable with only a few buttons, but i see that others have criticized it. to each his own i guess.Some cons:a little too much waiting for animations and two clicks where one should do. Also, sometimes I wish I could get one unit past another in a doorway, hallway or some other narrow space.Some of the 'impressive' units are kind of lame. I don't really like the artwork on the ogre, for instance.I'm not really sure what it is all building towards, and sometimes it seems like the story missions are too few and far between as compared with the normal missions.face textures can be pretty bad, especially the youngblood mercenary, who has a 'punchable' facetoo often i have like a 95% hit chance that misses twice in a row, what is that a 0.25% chance of happening?theres this animation of throwing both arms back and opening the mouth in a silent scream that happens with almost every action or stance change that feels like a placeholder that should have been replacedi wish i could move/deploy units from the overhead map modehard to tell topographic info from the overhead mapthe ai is fairly easy to beat once you figure them out, although i only choose the 'normal' difficulty missionshaven't found much of a good use for the warlocksome tedious, minute upgrading after each battle, and some skills and traits that seem worthlesssometimes RNG is annoying, but that goes with the territoryall of my guys are waiting on me getting enough money for their skill upgrades, which isn't going to happen. I have a dozen guys, each with a few skill points to spend by now, but it costs either 100 or 200 gp to buy each one, and after paying upkeep, medical, recruitment, and equipment costs, i can afford to buy like one skill for one warrior every wrydstone shipment request period (like every 10 game days, during which I'll probably do 5 missions, or like 3 hours of gameplay about)repetitive loading screen messagesA lot of these cons are the sort of number tweaking or minor adjustment type things that could be done in a single patch (e.g. fix RNG percent chances, drastically lower skills gold costs, speed up or get rid of some animations, write more loading screen quotes, make some better face textures, allow deployment from tactical map, etc...), and I'd like to hope that they will be fixed in an upcoming update, although I have no idea about that.The comparisons to XCOM are inevitable, and generally unfavorable to Mordheim judging by the other reviews, but for what it's worth I played XCOM 2 for a couple hours before getting a bit bored/frustrated and moving on (temporarily, I'll give it another try later), but I played 20 hours basically straight of Mordheim the first weekend I fired it up, so take from that what you will.This is one of those games that is flawed, but very fun and keeps me coming back, like mount and blade, rome total war, and men of war (i don't mean that it's like those mechanically, of course) "

												As I dig this wyrd tick from my skin with the tip of my rusty dagger, I ponder why I traveled to Mordheim in the first place...nearly everyone I traveled with to this blasted city has died or disappeared. The weather is nearly as tempermental as the food and I've faced horrors I never wish to speak of or think of again.It seems whenever we strike a find of wyrsdstone or long lost gear, we lose someone to some thing. It is completely unfair...We hired an ogre once, Four-Tooth Tubbygut. We thought things would ge easier...we were wrong. The blasted bellower just attracted worse things. I remember that day well, I lost an eye and Heinrech...lost his life and let me tell you, losing a man while you're staring down the blood red, dead, eyes of a vampire is something you quickly won't forget.Sure, Ace McTwirlystache may make a shot that cripples one of those vile mutants allowing you and the gang to cease its diabolical existence but those moments seem to be so few and far inbetween. Everytime I look up to our leader Maximillion I realize it's Hubert Steinbor-...no wait it's Von Drakham, no wait it's someone fresh.Ha! Fresh blood in Mordheim, the only constant...again I ask myself why I first agreed to sign up for this damned company. Gold? Glory? Riches?Now that I think about it...I remember exactly why I signed up for this.*Thus ends the ramblings of Emrich the peg legged, one eyed, one armed wyrdstone gatherer*To the point. This is a brutal game. It is unforgiving and the odds are stacked against you. I would say this is less of a ""RNG game"" than it is a ""how you adjust and react to a problematic situations"". I say this simply because you will be faced with many rough situations.It's similar to Valkyria Chronicles with movement and the actions use a action point system in a sense as well. Many who jump into the game never come back because it's tough, it has a steep learning curve but just remember the Warband is what matters.Do not get attached to characters. They. Will. Die. They will get maimed and nigh useless. You will be forced into making decisions where their is no ""good"" outcome but ""which is less worse"".The warbands, and their are 6, play differently and have a different feel. Weapons balance is wonderful because a daggr can be just as useful, if not more so, than a halbred. A bow better than a handgun, it is up to you to figure out when it is best to use a certain weapon as well as how to build a character around a certain weapon. This game requires you to laugh when things go bad and to learn so you lower the chance of making the same mistake again (because honestly you will make that same mistake again).The story missions, which each warband has their own, are tough and should be tackled after you spend a decent amount of time learning the basics and gearing your warband out. They aren't amazingly done and honestly, they can be quite frustrating but they do break up the normal gameplay of warband fights and wyrdstone hunting.The AI is adequate and even though they do one of the largest pet peeves I have with video games (artificial difficulty by giving the AI stat buffs, depending upon the difficulty) it's fun. The AI matches its warband to yours, so if you bring a big guy they do, if you don't they don't. This way you can't rest on your heels with an all decked out warband, the opposing warband will always be a threat.Ultimately, the game has some flaws but I believe it is a game worth playing for a certain type of gamer. One that tackles a challenge expecting to learn something. Those who go in as an underdog who appreciates when they make a 30% hit 2 times in a row. Those willing to take chances for a big payout, at the cost of possibly suffering complete failure.As with most games, I recommend getting it on sale.			"

												A truly immersive game that will get you attached to your warband quibbles and injuries included any and all commanders will get a true sence of responsibility for their troops not wanting to put them into a no win situation. good AI that will predict your move and will try to outwit or flank your warband.A must have game in my library that I look forward to playing more and more and more 10 / 10, (especially when dwarves are added).Good customisation options for warbands, variety of weapons and tactics, good range of skills. Unfortunately there are still some long loading screens but when taking into account the sheer amount of information, detail and variety between maps this is at worst expected and realistically insignificant and understandable.

												Mordheim is pretty impressive I have to say. A wonderful turn based strategy game, where you build up a warband of adventurers. Taking to the streets of this doomed city in pursuit of the ultimate treasure; Wyrdstones. A mystical magical element that is somewhat of a byproduct from a cataclysmic event. A bit like Aspertame being pooped from E.coli. That sort of thing.As a paper and pencil RPGer (in my youth) and having to deal with stats upon stats. This is a veritable wet dream of numbers and calculations. All required just to make sure you don't trip up over your boot laces while swinging heavy chunks of sharpened (or just blatantly heavy), metal around. Usually in the direction of something nasty. And there are plenty of bad guys to go around. Though this is a Warhammer based game, so who is good and who is bad is usually down to how many different shades of grey you are willing to tolerate. Each of the four factions (plus some more available as DLC), have their own agendas and each will be pitted against you one at a time as you rummage through the ruined city, seeking your fortune and glory. But beware, Mordheim is not an easy game. It is no doubt as harsh as it's tabletop counterpart and just as unforgiving. I  started my first campaign with the Sisters of Sigmar. A sect of violent battle NUNS with big hammers and even bigger thighs. And by the end of the second mission, three out of my five starting units had been hospitalised. My Hero unit had been laid up with internal bleeding. Then I had one lesser unit down with a shattered jaw. Good thing she wasn't a magic user, as she won't be uttering any incantations any time soon, if ever. And finally one poor lass got her leg chopped off and is now hobbling around with a broomstick shoved where only an orthopaedic surgeon would dare to go. And that was just the first TWO days (gametime), of their campaign. However, a few hours of gametime later. My nearly dead one-legged zealot (Oussia""Peggy""Praseck), has grown to be become one of my strongest units. And can dodge around on her up ended broomstick, faster than any other unit in the field. Like some sort of crazed holy paralympic ninja.... With a hammer !I didn't hold out much hope for a successful outcome during the first few hours. It all seemed so hopeless and against all the odds, yet I had a total blast with it. and stuck with it.  The strategy elements are functional enough and it's about as near to any tabletop simulation that as you can get. And although excessively tough on beginners. Once you have some gear and more warriors to field. The more smoothed out and even, the gameplay structure becomes. The background simulation is completely RNG based and as a result you have to prepare yourself for a beating. Though to be fair, the game does warn you regularly that it's more about how you cope with one atrocious situation after another. As opposed to being a total wargod and beating everything, all the time. Winning is a luxury and Mordheim reminds you of this constantly. With the high price of blood, sweat and tears that it takes, just to get the smallest of victories. However, if you are patient, keep your squad together and play smart. There is quite a bit that you can do to lessen the impact of injuries and fatalities. Neither of which are an absolute certainty, should any of your team come a cropper and be knocked out of the game. You can get lucky and have some just walk away from the ordeal with minor cuts and bruises. Again, this will be randomly decided at the end of the match. And is something you will be hoping for, considering the alternatives (Broken bones, severed limbs, amnesia or even permanent brain damage etc..). Which will result in that particular unit being forever handicapped in some way. Sometimes to the point of being rendered completely useless. But it's OK. Should this happen, you can always fire your crippled units as any decent humanitarian commander would.It could do with a little more ""oomph"" in the graphics department (Though I did come to this straight from playing DOOM. Which as you may or may not know, is glorious to look at. Even if the game itself is a bit rubbish). So Mordheim may appear to lack a bit of polish on that front, but it looks well enough and does feature some well designed characters / monsters. Other than that, it's just a really good game. With stacks of options and an excellent selection of customisation for each individual unit. If turn based strategy is your thing. And you want a challenging TBRPG that would give even The Darkest Dungeon a run for its money in toughness. You won't go far wrong with this one.Brilliant 8/10			"

								This game could be decent. It's somewhat faithful to the tabletop game. The graphics are okay, not great. The camera is very, very clunky, and a lot of the action shots suffer because of it. It has a lot of potential, but it is by no means a finished product and will require a lot of polishing. Personally I hope it gets done well, because a lot of Games Workshop video games tend to look promishing in alpha/beta then end up as turds upon release.			"

												Replaced Incubation (classic squad based strategy game) as my all time favourite game. I love the genre and really don't get why people bemoan the AI and difficulty so much. I read one review talking about how the only tactic is hiding in shadows which is utter rubbish. My standard is just to front up with a few tanks (parry and dodge so i can allow for the annoying wars that cant be parried) and hit them hard from distance too. All whilst one of my quick moving guys runs round and grabs all the goodies. Take advantages of the flaws like climbing up to a surface with a ranged char and standing on the only way up and enjoy picking off the AI warband with your pea shooters.Brilliant game and now i can't wait for the fact they are due to release a necromunda game.ps is it just me or is it actually good to be punished for your mistakes rather than mollycoddled so much. I love berating myself when wrong and just enjoy relaxing with a nice glass of port watching a well thought out strategy play out the way you intended			"

												Very much a positive surprise. While I knew I liked the concept (I was a big fan of Necromunda back in the days), a smattering of bad reviews seemed to indicate that there was little strategy involved, and it was all based on luck. I should have known better. Ofcourse there is randomness, but there are almost always options, and as in many of the best strategy games it is a matter of adapting to bad luck and equally important to be ready to exploit good fortune.However, if you cannot cope with permanent loss of virtual people and goods, this is probably not a game for you. For me though, the higher the stakes the more I enjoy the game.			"

												I love Mordheim but this i'm not so sure.I was SUPER excited for this when I first heard of the computer re imagining!Eh but where to even start...  Well first thing the C64 tape deck like load times are slightly annoying but I can for the most part ignore this IF the game was worth playing in its current state.Looks and plays really neat once you are in game, the viewpoint when its the opponents turn is a little odd but not sure how this could be changed and sometimes I feel it is a little disorientating switching guys in 3rd person but only minor.Glad to see that ranged attacks have been tuned down as when I first played this at launch it was VERY strong.Not sure why the devs have gone with the obscene Health totals instead of models having a wound total? Changes things a lot as in the final tutorial mission the Plaguebearer has 350hp from memeory and my guys on a successful hit are only doing 20ish dmg? Makes no sense to me why life totals are so high and i'm sure this is how its staying at release. I would like to see a more faithful alternate system/mode so it is more like the TT version with dice rolls and normal wounds, somewhat like Bloodbowl having traditional mode and weird blitz mode that nobody plays.Only play single player if you love screaming at the screen and cursing RnG.

												Fairly enjoyable adaptation of the classic Mrodheim table top game, though missing a lot of the core game content (mainly war bands and a lot of merchant items) I’m sure they probably already have plans to implement these as updates and dlc packs as they did with Blood Bowl. It does have notoriously long loading screens, poor game optimization and an insanely unforgiving difficulty but if you're a fan of either turn based strategies or cult classic table top games you'll like this a lot. Still a bit confused why they didn't go down the Necromunda route myself but a good call non the less.			"

												First of all let me say that I am not familiar with the lore or Warhammer at all, really.With that knowledge I enjoyed the game but it has some very large issues which makes you want to uninstall it or smash it frequently. These include the random nature of it (95% chance to hit and I miss three times? Not DODGED, flat out missed). The bull♥♥♥♥♥♥actions the computer takes (I am in Ambush stance, the computer moves a guy perfectly along my threat area just enough to get behind me and hit my weak guy I was protecting with the ambush). Various other things like not being able to climb a ladder because one of your guys is too close to it, which I mean he is 5 meters away but I cannot takes within his aura. This includes looting, climbing, etc. I have put a lot of time into this game and about 40% of the time I hate and the other 60% I enjoy it. My absolute largest complaints are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""balance"" the game does. No matter the difficulty the computer always has a stat advantage just because it's the computer. Not to mention the computer matches your own loadout. I bring three heros? They bring three Heros. I bring a leader, an impression and nothing else, they do the same thing. Rather than code some thought process into it the game just copies you. "

												This is a first impressions view point, I'll update as I play further.This game is awesome! It's like vermintide and xcom had a baby. An evil festering baby! Its the only strategy game like this I've ever seen with WSAD movement controls which guarantees you can put your characters where you want them and wont have any of those OH #$%^ moments like you do in Xcom when you think you click behind that cover and your character instead jumps on the roof and dies!The rich lore of Warhammer is here in all of its immersive goodness. Currently with 4 factions, several different unit types for each and an arsenal of weaponry.A campaign that has some rogue like tendencies. IE once you unlock certain progressions the bonus applies to all of your armies from there on.My only complaint so far is that the % attack chances seem to be off. An enemy can frequently dodge repeated 70+ % attacks which can make for a rather frustrating experience when that easy minion you'd planned to finish off and then turn to assist your other unit becomes a complete route instead.That being said the game is new and I expect that one complaint to be rectified soon.I've included almost 2 hours of stream footage of the battles for those needing a bit more info before making a purchase. All in all a solid game!

												The reason I would not recommend this game is because of the random number generator the game uses for the various tasks your characters perform.  I am not sure if others have had the problems I have, but at least for me, during each and every mission there would be streaks of terrible luck.  There would be six to seven tests in a row where the ""80%"" or higher chances would fail.  This was not an occasional thing, this was an every mission thing, and almost always took me from having the edge in a mission to either just succeeding or failing miserably.  I played dozens of missions, and these streaks would pop up in every single one.  In addition, though I always equipped my leader with the best parrying weapon and shield combo I could find, I did not make a single parry test the entire time I played, despite there being a ""50%"" or higher chance to block... and again, I will state that I played dozens of missions, each of which my leader would be hit multiple times while attempting to block.  I do not mind difficult games, I enjoy a challenge, but this did not feel like a challenge.  This was me being (rightfully) punished for tiny mistakes I made, but then being screwed over by the random number generator when I was doing everything right.  I would make tactically sound decisions only to have them blow up in my face- not just occasionally, but EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION. I. PLAYED.  Again, I am not sure if others have this problem as well, but from my experience this game needs either a re-work of their random number generator or a more realistic statement of the odds on a given action.

Early Access Review
								UPDATED REVIEW:In spite of my initial review of the game being rather negative, especially with regard to the random number generator and other random aspects of the game, I have to say that the game kept me playing.  I've been playing the last couple of days, steadily working through a new campaign, and I am absolutely loving the game now.One thing that isn't very apparent when you start out is the fact that, in the early stages of the campaign, the game is brutal.  This is largely because your warriors don't have any skills, gear, or money to acquire new gear.  Similar to other campaign-oriented tactical games, like Darkest Dungeon, X-Com, Blood Bowl, etc., if you persevere with the ""darwinian"" nature of the early game--and simply understand that warriors will die--the game eventually 'opens up' as the warriors that do survive slowly acquire the skills and gear necessary to become even better.  As additional hero/warrior slots and types unlock, and the money starts flowing, things get better and better.The RNG can still be frustrating at times (most tactics games are like this), but as your warriors become more skilled and powerful, the chances for really bad streaks of 'bad luck' tend to be mitigated somewhat.  More than anything, with the right gear and/or stat increases, your warriors don't seem quite as fragile.At this point, if I could change anything about the game, I'd perhaps add a little more information to the in-game tutorial.  While it goes through the motions of showing you a handful of common things you can do, it doesn't really expalin why you would want to do said things.  For example, learning how to disengage from battles and drawing the enemy into ambushes is extremely important, especially in the early part of the campaign, when your warriors are weak and can't trade blows for very long without being knocked out of combat.  Keeping your warriors 'alive' is also vitally important, as rout tests are based on the morale/number of warriors you have on the field of battle.  Therefore, if you have a deeply wounded warrior, sometimes its best to run him back to your cart (or some other safe area), and just let him sit out the remainder of the battle (instead of being knocked out).The other thing that the tutorial doesn't really explain very well is the smuggler's den.  This part of the campaign game is extremely important, as it funds pretty much everything you do wtih your warband.  Without a fundamental understanding of how the smuggler's den works, you simply won't have the gold necessary to buy additional heroes/warriors, or pay for training, treatment, wages/pay, scouts, etc.All in all, I'm having  a lot of fun with the game now.  The initial hurdle of getting through the first few battles, and coming to grips with how each of the game's campaign systems work may have taken more than a few hours, but I have to say now that the game is really fun.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:This game has a lot of potential, and I like a lot of what I am seeing--however, that said, I can't find myself recommending this game (yet) for one simple reason:  The hideously random nature of the game is just too ridiculous.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not just saying this in a ""kneejerk"" kind of way.  I understand perception bias (that sense that you're ALWAYS getting bad dice/percentage rolls, when you really aren't), and I can appreciate the fact that the game is difficult (sometimes brutally so).  Having played many games in which the RNG is a major factor to your success, I am well aware that streaks of good and/or bad luck happen.   But the RNG is just the tip of the iceberg, and when combined with all of the other randam ""elements"" of the game, it just makes for an extremely frustrating experience.When you're not getting a string of bad rolls (say, five or six 75%-83% success failures in a row ... while the enemy team seems to never miss), you have to deal with unlucky positioning and/or creature spawns as you move your team around the map.  Because all movement is turn-oriented, and based on an initiative order, you're commited to your movements when you have no idea what's around the next corner.  In a general sense, this is fine, as it's all part of city-fighting.  But frustration sets in quickly when nearly every other mission spawns neutral creatures (like horrors, daemonettes, etc.) that utterly rip your team apart.  You make one unlucky move, and *bam* two of your warriors are dead.  You can't disengage.  You can't flee.  You're just dead.  And these aren't even ""Hard"" or ""Brutal"" missions--this is on ""Normal"". I played one mission where a daemonette murdered nearly the whole enemy team (they had two members left) as I strategically outlanked both the enemy team and the daemonette, while I raided their wagon.  Pretty cool.  But even with only two members left, the enemy team would not route.  And then the daemonette, apparently wanting to ""share the wealth"", ran all the way across the map to where the rest of my team was, and proceeded to murder one of my warriors.  After which, my team suddenly routed, even though I still had my leader and one more member than the enemy.  I instantly lost the mission.  While it was kind of 'interesting' and cool that I could ""play"" the daemonette to kill the enemy team, in the end, the totally ""artificial"" way in which the daemonette just ran across the map to murder my team and randomly cause a route was highly annoying.  Which leads me to my next issue:  routing.Routing seems completely random.  I can kill the enemy leader and half their team, and nothing happens.  But if my leader gats taken out, it's almost a certainty that my team will be instantly routed.  Route tests seem to happen without any kind of discernible indicator, too, besides some text.  One turn, everything is fine-and the next you simply lose.  LoL.  The concept behind being defeated by route testing is fine, but the implementation is poor and rather unsatisfying from a gaming perpective.  Which just about sums up the entire experience of this game.On its own, the RNG is fine.  In other games, like Blood Bowl, or Talisman, it's an integrated part of the gameplay--because you can either strategize around the randomness, or the game is simply driven by the randomness and centered more on making choices.  Mordheim is neither:  you can't strategize many outcomes because positioning, encountering and randomly spawed creatures of ridiculous strength ruin any ""game plan"" you might have; and at many times the combat does seem very driven by the randomness while not providing anything even resembling an interesting choice to make.  More often than not, you have to just sit there, selecting the same thing you've selected for the last three rounds, while you slowly watch your team get ripped apart by unlucky circumstances and dice rolls.I really want to like this game, but it just really seems to be missing something.  The only feeling I have while playing this game is one of intense frustration.  Which is really strange, because I absolutely love randomness and replayability in games.  Mordheim just doesn't have the right ""mix' or synergy yet between randomness and game mechanics, and it's for this reason that I simply cannot recommend this game at this time.  That is not to say, however, that, in the future, this game will not be good.  As of now, the game is still in early access and many of the balancing and/or frustrating aspects of the game may still be tweaked.			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review - As a fellow Games Workshop employee, and Mordheim being my favourite GW game on record, I was a little nervous to try out this game, but I bought it, and it has been the best purchase I have made on Steam since Skyrim. The Game is exactly like the table top game was, rules are the same, warbands are the same, and the customization of your warbands is amazing! I can not wait for the developers to add more warbands to the mix, I would like to see Witch Hunters, and Beastmen!I can not say enough about this game, do you have what it takes to brave the City of Mordhiem?

												Casual gamers go home!Pro: Your desicions, goood or bad, REALLY affect your characters and game.Genuine feeling of accomplishment on victory.Con: No matter how good you are RNG can set you back hours, even days.High # of design choices neither smart nor fun. read: BATTLE LOOT BROKEN.TLDR;So much to love about this game. In fact I think it may be one of the highest achievements for it's genre (open world tactical RPG) alongside say XCOM 2:TFTD. The problem with both games? They aren't just mind bogglingly hard, they are also excruciatingly long. I also get off on this sort of gameplay (until I don't anymore) where mission after succesful mission you know you are beating the odds, that your luck and skill are leading you down a path far more pleasant than your peers. And then you lose, and it messes up your team and you lose harder, lose your gear, your best guy and you see the snowball looming, see all the hours wasted!Definitely not for the faint of heart, those with other responsibilities, jobs, etc. For the rest of us? Dig in! "

												Pretty much everything I could ask for from a turn-based tactical RPG. If you liked Darkest Dungeon, XCOM or anything related to Warhammer you'll probably like this. The only complaints I have are related to the poorly designed interface, which may be good on console but is annoying on PC and the fact that the skaven warband is under the clan Eshin. Are you actually telling me that you couldn't do better than Eshin's rat ninjas? I mean, Pestilen would have been pretty balance. A DoT focused warband would have actually been interesting. You still have a hint of that, with the DLC hero(which, thank Sigmar, is clan Skryre), but it's just not the same as having a poison resistant warband, that melts the flesh off their foes.			"

								Not without it's flaws but this game is already ton of fun. Customizable bands of monsters duke it out with one of the more unique TBS systems I've seen. I never played the tabletop game but this feels like I'm moving minitaures around the way it's set up.Can't wait until there's more customization. RIght now that and a steady matchmaking system are all this game needs to make it great. Knowing they're adding all that and single player campaigns means this will be one to stay with for a long time to come.			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a fun game which is set in City of Mordheim, tactical rpg games are rare and this game is very good addition to the genre but main problem of the game I can say after playing it for a while like Xcom another tactical rpg type game is it's difficulty as many other gamers said, the actual problem isn't game beign hard. It is not fair even on normal difficulty which shouldn't be also there are ridiculus outcomes of actions usualy like first Xcom game when you are flanking an enemy or attacking behind with a percentage % like %75 you miss the attack or enemy dodges or parries, like in one battle in Xcom my soldier missed with %100 attack in Mordheim enemies can hit you when you miss even in a balanced fight, they evade ambushes and damage more in battles, so because of unfair and sometimes ridiculus battle outcomes you can lose a battle even when you think you are winning and your warriors gets injured and your plan ruin, again problem isn't the game is difficult it is unfair and in campaign mode enemies have the advantage and you lose battles ofthen not because of your strategy but game's fault and unbalanced battle system. It gets annoying after a short while, so this game could be grate but because of it's problems it's only a very good game with potential. Hopefully in near future they will fix the problems and balance the battle system to be fair and it will become a great game.			"

								I typically play grand strategy titles but picked this up on a whim. I am glad I did. The game strikes a very good balance between challenge vs. playability, emersion, risk vs. reward, progression, etc.. I absolutely love the 3rd person point of view and feel of the game play. It gives you the illusion of playing out a mini adventure, each time you start a new mission. There are quite a few naysayers out there who exclaim that the game is too hard or unfair. This is a thinking man's game. You must plan out your actions carefully and execute. Do I risk splitting up to gather more reward or play it safe so that I have strength in numbers? If you like a challenging game that affords you the opportunity to imagine yourself as the leader of a small band of brothers (or rats, sisters, etc..) and enjoy advancement and progression, you will like this title. I am not crazy about the Warhammer universe, but the gameplay has me addicted...there is always one more thing I want to do before putting the game down...good mix of tactical play, overall strategy in mission deployment, warband management, etc..ProsImmersive Gameplay: You identify with your merry band of warriorsNail biting: Many missions will come right down to the wireChallenging Gameplay: Rewarding to those that want a challenge. Feeling of accomplishment. You earned your victory!Varied Maps and Mission set Ups: Every mission will be a bit different than the one before.Point of View: Refreshing 3rd person perspective that plays out before your eyes. It doesnt seem turned base...you are almost watching an action movie.Fog of War: What's in that house across the street? Should I risk going in and getting cornered? What about that treasure chest that's in there?Customization: Moderate character customization options. rename and tailor the look of your warband.Pick and Choose: though not really a sandbox game, you have some flexibility in picking the missions you want to play.Fun: I just enjoy playing the game. I cant put it down.ConsIron Man: No combat saves. For me, this adds to the game tension (risk vs. reward) so is not an negative, but the game is unforgiving. You will live with your mistakes (or die by them).Finesse Required: You must learn the tactics and how to play the game to get good at it. (Hint: Stay together!)Luck: There are some situations that amount to dumb luck (good and bad) that no amount of tactics will overcome. This hasn't occurred too often, but it does happen.Customization Options: what is available is good but wish there was more.Repetitive Missions: though I have not tired of the missions, they are similar in scope and style, save for the four story missions. Could become ""grindy"" for some.Review based on the solo campaign. I have not played the mulitplayer portion of the game.			"

								Let me start by saying that I bought this game a week ago, and I now have over 35h played; says a lot!If you are looking for a punishing (hardcore) turn based strategy game with Warhammer setting & lore, chances are you might love this game!There is a small learning curve (however tutorials will greatly help if you take the time to go through them) and controls & mechanics may take a few hours to master, but once you do, the game really becomes fun & immersive!Basically you create a Warband, customize it (for each member you get to choose its weapons, armors, skill points / attributes, spells, etc...) and then fight skirmishes against the AI or players. Shall you emerge victorious from a mission, you'll accumulate xp & loot/gear; however if a soldier falls in battle, he may become permantly injured (suffer from stats reduction).If you take the time to get inot the game, you will get attached to your warband, curse at your monitor when your captain/hero takes a few big hits, and celebrate when you finally overcome the enemy and see him routing.For a long time I have been looking for a PC port of Warhammer tabletop games, and it's finally here! I started playing Mordheim in October 2015 (early release), and I can say that at this point the game is quite polished. Sure, there's is room for improvement, but overall the game is definetly enjoyable in its current state.I cannot wait for offical release, and am keeping my fingers crossed for the addition of new factions. Would definetly love to see some greenskins (orcs & goblins), elves (dark, wood, or high elves) and dwarves!While I acknowledge this game may not be for everyone (its a turn based strategy game), personally I must admit that I've been having a blast! Hoping to see you on the battlefield, and looking forward sending your warband to the hospital xDMy score: 9.5/10Bull			"

								In 1999 I was 14 and very much an impressionable nerd. My friends were interested in Warhammer Fantasy and one of them got the 3rd Edition 40k starter box. I had a look at his White Dwarf magazines and Mordheim jumped out to me. A role playing games based on end-time conspiracy theory set in the WHFB universe. Of course in 1999 we had the whole year 2000 prophesy nuts going beserk.My first warband was the Cult of the Possessed, followed by the Witch Hunters. My friends played Skaven, Undead and Orcs, the last of which was released in White Dwarf magazine. My friend who played Skaven let his brother use the mercs from the starter box, and my own brother got the starter box and used mercs as well. On top of this, the table-top club we went to had about half a dozen guys also buy the starter box. In up, we had at least 12 people playing all different warbands every weekend for about 3 years.Around 2003, I moved away from my home town and stopped table-top gaming for a while. I picked it up again however in 2009 and started playing Mordheim again until 2011. Life was a lot faster and I couldn't play as much as I used to. When I heard about this game coming out, I immediately jumped on board the band wagon because of my teenage passion for it and rekindling the fires of my youth.Now for the game itself.I feel that the game could use a little spit and polish to improve a few graphical and sound issues (as well as some dodgy camera angles), but overall this game captures the feeling of playing the tabletop game. The music and visuals are incredibly atmospheric and the turn based nature of the game works well as a translation of the table-top to the PC. Would I change any gameplay elements? Not really. The only real thing i'd like to see added is the ability to play a multiplayer campaign against friends or with jump-in games to mix things up a little bit.			"

Product received for free
												I've tested it during 3 day free trial.TLDR: Good idea for a game, balanced mechanics, but with some frustrating little inconsistancies, bugs, and too little content per race. Try it, for a few warband levels, if you like it, buy it, if not, you probably won't like it in the future.Pros:+ tutorial explains the basics, however there are some rare situations, when I find myself wondering what will happen if XYZ... and those situations are unexplained...+ combat mechanics are good, well balanced (except 2x1H weapons:( - they should change that for sure), charge, ambush, dodge, parry stances are all OK, however they should add a contant reminder for begginers, what costs what, so you can plan ahead, instead I've found myself lacking 1 movement or attack point, that could be spared if I knew it beforehand...+ looting, equipement and RPG elements for every one single unit is very good, XP gains are slow, but not too slow. you get points to distribute, when you get each 1/4 of a level.+ each of the unit, have many stats, that are clearly explained, so you know what you must do, to get better at what you want.+ game offers a decent challange regarding difficulty... some missions are harder, some easier, some you can win without losing a single unit+ good number of maps (12 i think is the number now), that have numerous types of deployment rules, with random wyrmstone gems and chests to scavenge for. Also i think there are seperate maps for campaign special quests but im not sure. also the side quests, are quite interesting and valuableCons:- you cannot change armor/weapon proficientcies for any unit, so if you want to make an archer from a meelee fighter, you can't... also you can't for example use hammers for warrior that uses maces. so you're stuck with those weapons that devs set up for this specific unit.- there are for every faction only: 1 leader, 3 hero units, 2 henchmans, and 1 giant unit (counts as 2) to choose from... so it lacks diversity in regards to units (not factions). At one time, you can only have 10 units on the battlefield, and thats a good number, not too high, not to low.- skills are too expensive, so for the first 20~ games, youre stuck with generic units, even if you got ability points to spend. you will lack money, or you will not want to waste precious warrior in next few battles, to instead learn a new skill in X days.- equipement picked up, and then dropped by your dying unit, dissapears after winning game, unless you pick it up, by some other unit... wich is quite annoying. also you only get a very small percentage of whole loot on the map, after winning, so sometimes you find yourself stalling, and scavenging instead of killing the enemy right away.- some sidequests in campaign are very hard to do, and others are very prefered. you always get 2XP plus additional 3XP for sidequests, where for a win, you get only 2XP. so a mission without a completed sidequest is worth 1/2 of the other one... again you sometimes have to stall to get the side objective done- there are some UI issues, that should be handled... it feels like a console game with control scheme and hints. however there should be some options added that would help to orientate, for example: overhead unit icons, and maybe custom icons for each unit... also scavenge and wyrmstone sites are marked on map, but when its inside a 3 story building, you must run thru whole of it, to find it. mark it clearly OR just disable those markings, and add more of those points to collect, so you must find it yourself, but its easier. also only recently I've found out how to check, wich specific unit is in the initiative queue next (shift and then E/Q)- shop pricing is quite strange... warband lvl 1, can only buy white basic items (swords, shields, bows, clothing etc), for about 10 gold. but there are also rare enchantments available for 300 gold +. they shouldn't be available for lvl1 warband, or they should add some small enchantments for low lvl warbands.- you cannot skip nor speed up the animations- there are some combat inconsistancies... for example: enemy charged my unit on stairs, he attacked me, but I couldn't attack him back (I couldn't move becouse of being engaged in combat with another unit)... example 2: I could charge at enemy, so i did. but my character got stuck, and run for few seconds into a wall, then stopped at this place and I couldn't attack the enemy, so i was forced to end my turn. example 3: archers are engaging meelee characters, so if you attack an archer, you must disengage to move, even though they cannot attack you, and they have no attacks of opportunity... ALSO example 4: stunned enemies also keep you engaged in combat, so you cannot move away... wich is stupid in my opinion. there are some strange movement inconsistancies, for example, if an ally unit, climbs the wall, and ends their movement there, you cannot climb it with any other unit, even if you could move after that climbing. tutorial says, that sphere of influence around your character, lets you run though it, but you cannot stop your movement there, and thats true, but only on flat. next: ambushing near corners: when you setup an ambush stance very close to a corner, and enemy will enter your sphere of influence, before your unit sees it, the ambush doesn't trigger. and when you setup an ambush stance on a climbing spot, the enemy can climb, but it wont trigger the ambush (again because he entered sphere of influence before your units sight... ) PS: you cannot ambush enemies from above:(offtopic... things I would like to see: ambushing from above / below, more items (random item generation?), horseback riders, flying units, maybe some mortars or other artillery types, traps that you can place on the ground, more casters and spells, 'pets' or other uncontrollable small monters or animals that fight alongside, movement abilities (grappling hook, magical bridges, etc), other gamemodes: CTF?, defender/attacker?, 2v2 games?, coop campaign?

												This game makes me do something that I haven't done in a long time. Shake my fists in fury at the screen and shout at it like a child ""The Game Is Cheating!"". In all honesty though every time I think I am getting ahead in the game on campaign mode I just get smacked down, by either my scouts failing to see an enemy warband leading to my guys getting ambushed, or just not being able to land a strike on certain opponents. It is infuriating but also fun, A diabolical mixture that these folks at Rogue factor have put together, that shreds my patience while making me want more of the short lived thrill when I overcome some ridiculously  stacked odds. I definitely recommend getting this game and familiarizing yourself with it. I have played this game for a decent amount of time and still enjoy it. The only things that would make it better for the time being would be some sort of supported multiplayer search, and some more TLC from the Devs. Over all a fun and somewhat time consuming game.			"

								Firstly, I only own this game. I have been a fan of Mordheim from the TT days. When I read on Rock Paper Stone that Mordheim was about to be turned into a PC game, I instantly upgraded my rig, and created a Steam account.I purchased and have not looked back since. I joined the community {basically The Gentlmen of Mordheim} and participated in this EA - there have been issues, desyncing and invisible blocking and the attacking through walls etc.That said this game is REMARKABLE the translation from  TT is not faithful or prefect, but what Rogue Factor has given us is a beautifully rendered visual experience, accompained at times with sublime gameplay. Let's pause a minute and discuss the visuals. The City itself really captures the menace and threat of all the literature I have read about Mordheim. The streets are barren and forboding. The architecture exactly how I imagined it should be. The skies are dark and full of ominous promise. The whole vista is a sight to behold. I can't wait to see the finished article.The modelling is exquisite - the Skaven have been captured magnificantly, not only the detailing but also the character. RF's Skaven are simply a work of art, easily imo unstriping the attempts at Rattyness that Vermintide is showing us.Watching a rat socerer cast a mist is a joy to behold. Or the way they run, with their arms out to the side, clutching a pair of Warplocks and their cloaks flaring out is WONDERFUL!The way the Sisters raise a Sigmarite to the heavens when invoking a blessing is spot on!I could go on and on...All of the Warbands look fantastic - RF should win an award for their creativity and sheer brilliance!The gameplay can be riveting - so many tactical choices to be made. Placing a unit in front of a trap and waiting for an opponent to attempt a charge, and getting stopped by the trap is a particular fav of mine.Setting up a sheildwall and halting an enemy in it's tracks and then using ranged to slowly dismantle the enemies ranks, is another joy.Now with Progression this game has reached new heights. Apart form all the incredible management options the Hideout now affords us - the arrival of progression makes the choices of where to put the points even more important. The injury system really injects, tension and drama - I have two rats with only one arm each!! I could go on and on - but this game is a MUST HAVE for any fans tactical/turn-based strategy games.ROGUE FACTOR BE PROUD VERY PROUD!!!BUY-BUY YES-YES!!!!!10 out of 10 and it isn't even finished!!!!

												A genius conversion of tabletop game Mordheim. What else to say. for GW outsider.... X-COM, man, with wyrdstone harvesting - if you love it, buy this without hesitation. It has it own set of rules but basically same turn based system with initiative, strategy, various classes and weapons. Technical point - it gets tweaks, patches, new content and so far has very reasonable DLC policy ... quite unseen nowadays. + Great classic turn based RPG elements+ Narrating, story, misions for all four warbands+ Graphic and technical processing+ Steady learning curve, very unforgiving dificulty when you just start+ Mutation chaos events, injury and permament injuries system. Loosing an eye wil affect your hero both graphically and for stats and issues like hit rating. Quite like this! Crack their heads to force stupidity checks!+ Rout system+- RNG- AI is stupid, really. The high dificulty is just made plainly by higher stats, numbers, sheer advances of their weapons and armor. Still, it's still on ok level but if you got two brain cells, you will eventually beat it... guess this game makes sense more for multiplayer :)- No option to change dificulty. Prepare for hard ride especially in the beginning!- Tutorial is rather confusing, mix of level playing and just texts with pictures. Had to elaborate myself the veteran perk system issue ...- Unlimited enemy reinforcements in story misions. If you loose some precious turns, you will get swarmed (especially if your party is not proper prepared)9/10  I claim to be affected by my love to warhammer world so deduct at least two point if you are not :)  "

								This game has potential to be a very good strategy game, back the development team & buy early access. Your feedback & recommendations will help shape the game into something really good. Really enjoyable experience, love the real time moving of units & using in order of initiative. The main area for improvement is the AI, too easy at present however have posted feedback & developers confirmed looking to improve. What more could you ask for in terms of taking on board feedback?Also this game has been funded therefore will be completed as advised.For those of you concerned about replay value at early access stage; if you select a campaign, choose your map, you can then select from 10 different scenario types. These range from ambush, you can choose to be ambusher or ambushed, to scatter, units are spread over map, etc. Enjoyable variations that mix the challenge of the game up.			"

								Finally I can recommend this game. After joining early access one year ago I was mostly dissapointed with some design choices and complete lack of content.But in the current state and especially after the last content update including warband progression it finally feels good to me (being a veteran of tabletop mordheim).If you want to join early acces, now is the time :)			"

								For Early Access the game handles very well, should be amazing once finished.  Fans of Warhammer Fantasy Universe will like it, Strategy gamers will like it, people who like putting their personal touch on something, customizing, leading their own little group will like it.It's very engaging, I've currently played 50+ hrs, and I only started out of mild curiosity less then 90 hrs ago.  (I almost never play games before full release, so this is pretty exceptional)			"

												My only complaint is that the success estimates for attack/dodge/parry are not accurate. I'm not harping on the random number generator -what I'm saying is that it's obvious the estimates do not take all modifiers for both parties into account. It's common in Mordheim to miss 5-6 times in a row with a 90% hit chance, or to get smacked 3-4 times in a row by an Impressive even though you're in dodge stance with 95% dodge rate. The odds of these bad runs happening should be one in a hundred, one in a thousand, or worse. But you will see one or two each skirmish at higher level play. It's quite frustrating.Other than that, the game is fantastic. Check out Valkyria Chronicles if you're looking for similar mechanics wrapped up in JRPG window dressing.			"

												I have very fond memories playing the original tabletop version of Mordheim, so I was a bit nervous when I first tried out this adaptation. However, after a bit of a learning curve, I can say that it holds very true to the original and is a blast to play. Let's be clear - this game is brutal. There is no, ""oops, I'll just reload a that save point"" here. But that is something I love about it - you have to live with what happens to your warband, and a a story develops to explain the various skills and ailments of your members. This is something very unique to this game.			"

								After buying this when it first came out, The game was really barebones, No campaign, smugglers den, only little customization on the terms of equipment. But after visiting it a few months later, the game has vastly improved, They now have a working campaign and the options that come with it. They have character customization, its limited but it's still something. Overall the game has improved so much and fills that original board game experience very well.			"

								Being a fan of Warhammer for year, this looked like an interesting puchase.  I read up abit about it, and discovered that the game was a turn based stratagie game, which is right up my alley.  So I ended up purchasing it.  One of the best purchases I have made in years.  The gameplay is great, customization is fantastic, graphics are great and really gives you a feel for the Warhammer Universe with real injuries that can be permenant and a fantasic plethora of skills and spells.Don't get me wrong, the game is not perfect but the devs are really listening to the players.  I look forward to the final release and eventual DLC for new warbands.  Hope everyone finds this review insightful and gives the game a try.  I highly reccomend it.			"

								In one of the earliest version I wrote a rather negative review and I deleted it.This is the kind of game where you spend a lot of time polishing your warband, you name them, you give them a biography, you make them as you want them to be, and then, days later, maybe weeks, you make one mistake, and you loose one, and it actually makes you feel really bad, and you can't undo it. So you make a lookalike, someone you call his son... and it's never the same. that void, it always remains.The game is emitting so much love from the dev. team. It's not a rushed commercial project, every detail cries out pure love for their game. And the gameplay proves it, it's awesome to play. I highly recommend you give it a go, it's worth every penny and more. "

												This is not an easy game. Not a casual game. If you thought the likes of Xenonauts or other micro-management games caused you anxiety and a sense of overwhelmedness, this just ups the quotient. There is no hand-holding in this game. In fact, the tutorials are just as likely to end with you defeated as with a victory. Which is a good thing. It confirms to you just how unforgiving it will be when you actually engage the gameplay. Everything you do is tracked from the word go - the only semi-casual element would be the skirmish mode where you can play free of consequence to your warband. Otherwise, all actions and consequences follow you from the git-go.This is a tough game to recommend. Am I happy to play it? yes. does it feel fun? yes. was it easy to crack the ice that surrounds it like a diamond shell? no. But get that crack and it begins to spread and reveal the gem I hope to continue to find it to be.And while I know this dates me as the less-than-young man I am, a game like this truly makes me pine for the days of game manuals that were hundreds of pages long. A nice heavy book to occupy your mind and time AWAY from the screen and equip you with the tools and skills you will most benefit from when you set to playing.  Just an observation, but I do miss those days.A few more missions in and I must say this is just incredible. The damage/reward system is very crucial to optimizing your experience. upgrading is not easy to come by, but so very pivotal when you have the chance. And the RPG elements of equipment management also lend a very fine touch of color to this fantastic tactical strategy gem.  major thumbs up			"

												Only pick this up on sale. I really enjoy the basic gameplay but am dissapointed by the severe lack of customization options, ugly character models, and poor animations. Considering the turn based nature and lack of action oriented gameplay it should be rather easy to create nice pre-canned animations, but instead they remind of an mmo decades past. Minimal effort put in. The animations for ranged attacks are the worst of the bunch because they don't pitch up or down. For the price they normally ask for this product and considering when this was released I expect much better. Edit: It is also worth mentioning that the graphics advertised are not what I have actually experienced despite system specs which can handle the game twice over and having all settings at maximum the game looks quite poor and more like a 2009 release. This may be due to the fact that I have AMD and apparently this game has trouble with AMD. So beware of that if you too have an AMD card. Highly frustrating not being able to enjoy the graphics. The DLC is a complete ripoff and incredibly lazy in it's implimentation. They could not even be bothered to create one faction specific unit for each faction so two of the four are shared between factions. The new Witch Hunters faction is incredibly ugly, their primary units are so despressing to look at, yet if they could be customized to a greater extent this could perhaps be forgiven, but it seems this newest faction has even fewer customization options than the others. Hope you like having anorexic, half naked, self-flagellation obsessed old men as the backbone of your fighting force! I get that it's cannon, but the execution is quite poor. It's the lack of variation in appearence and the fact that the vision the developers had far exceeds religious flagellation and takes a turn into chaos level self mutilation. It's overdone. Also there's no hounds... no ♥♥♥♥ing hounds.Edit: The dlc is even worse than I initially thought because any army of order can use the human dlc heroes and any army of destruction can use the skaven and chaos dlc heroes. The joy of a game like this is the asymetric balance, letting units move from one warband to another kills that and it really makes me never want to take part in pvp. So despite owning these special units I never use them because it cheapens the experience and breaks immersion. Why they could not develop one special unit for each warband and release it as one character pack is beyond me, but if many more units are added in this way you'll start seeing primarily mercenary warbands in pvp that have little connection to their actual warband. Already too many wolf priest builds going around as it is. Really really bad design choice on part of the developers. Asymetric balance is key in a game like this and every deviation from it will kill the experience a little more. The gameplay itself is pretty fun and does a decent job capturing the feel of a tabletop game for the most part. Unfortunately it's bogged down by a grind oriented campaign that has you doing the same thing over and over and over. There are a few different scenarios, but that merely changes how you deploy, not the objective which is to eliminate or route the opposing team. Story missions change it up a bit, but not enough to make it feel fresh. And while there is a pvp component that ought to be fun, it's just more of the same. It lacks the fun social element of a tabletop experience. Also playing the pvp mode that enables injuries and looting is a huge risk considering the intensive grind that goes into getting decent units, and the safe mode is without risk or reason to play, though you may learn a trick or two. I like the hardcore element, but leveling up is far too arduous. I think the most frustrating element is that you can rarely complete secondary objectives for their xp boost because the enemy team routes and essentially ends the round. Thus any unclaimed salvage, unclaimed loot, and unclaimed wyrdstone dissapears. Sure you get a few bones for a victory, but it's pitance in comparison. Furthermore this makes no sense. If they ran away, why not let me get everything? What's stopping me? Why make me game the system and spend three hours emptying a map only to realize that doing so is insane and a total bore. Fixing this issue alone might go a long way towards making the game feel less like a grind. The game needs some fresh ideas and a strong multiplayer component if it wants to have any real staying power, right now it's one of those titles you buy on sale, play for a week or two and then forget about. It's a real shame too because this game does have potential. The underlying mechanics are sound for the most part, but everything built off of them needs to be reconsidered. Bottom line: If you are interested in this title and enjoy turn based gameplay then snag it next time it drops below $20. However you'll most likely regret spending anything more than that.			"

												This game is really fun, and extremely enjoyable. However, expect to get frustrated and absolutely hate this game at times. That said, you might find yourself lucky and absolutely adore this game. The reason why I wrote the love/hate mix is because although this game is a lot of fun, at the start you'll struggle. Then again maybe you won't. You'll experience bugs from time to time, some minor, others major. For example, there's no timer at the moment, or at least there's no timer that I'm aware of. So if the enemy bugs during their phase, you'll find yourself stuck in the game ""waiting for your opponent"" and you'll be stuck waiting for the B'stard forever untill you decide to leave. Now, you can't leave without taking punishment as if you lost. This happened to me, one of my Warband *party* died, and the other lost his arm (he was my archer!). So because of this bug, a bug which I experienced when I had only just started a game, two of my warband were seriously hurt/killed. Bummer I know.I haven't had any problems with bugs for a while now, but I'm sure they're waiting for me. I'm also finding the right pace to play at for me. When I first started playing I died a lot, I'd make and break warbands because the game frustrated me. But then I started to think more, plan more. I haven't lost in a while now, sure a few lost hands and broken feet but you can't expect to come out of each game without a scratch.This game was hard, is hard, but I'm slowly getting better, stronger, and I'm having much more fun. You might follow this pattern, you might not.9/10 I would tell my friends to buy this game, but I wouldn't tell that one friend (we all know one) who would tear out his computer and throw it out of a window. Be patient and you will enjoy this game!			"

As it is still in early release, dont expect too much at this point, but once you see the potential of this game, you will hunger for more. I just hope that one of the races released will be Undead, but as with any game, all the races are sure to have thier own stregnths and weaknesses.

												Game has been steadily improving with updates.Sigmarite Greathammer is a nice addition, would be nice if it had a unique model and texture though because it currently looks exactly the same as the regular Greathammer.It's nice that they added a new war band and new units as DLC, and I hope they add yet more in future.I would really like to see a Night Goblin war band with Squigs and Loons, and a Chaos Demons war band that actually lets you field the demon units in the game. I want to field a Daemonette :P the model is reeeealy nice.It's way more optimized and stable than it was.There are still long pauses during the AI turn while you wait for the enemy units to move around the map. It would be really nice if they could figure out a way to speed up enemy movement when you cant see the units anyway, this game has allot of downtime when your not really playing, just waiting.It's hard to find good srpg's, and this one is actually not too shabby.Good lore, good atmosphere, plenty of grimdark, and nice music thats appropriate to the game.For all it's flaws this game is getting better, and I hope the developer continues to improve it and add to it. It already has a special place in my heart as there is nothing else quite like this out there.			"

												You know a game is good when it keeps you playing for long. That is certainly the case with this game.The movement is clunky, you sometimes get lag when you attack enemies, your actions and enemy actions take long to perform and you miss so much that the battle lasts at least 1.5 times longer. The sub-objectives in various missions can't be completed fully because the enemy either runs out of units, you miss a lot or you don't have enough SP to get all the resources, When you pick up some of the resources your units run out of space very quickly and the only way to get more is to go back and forth between scavenging locations and your treasure chest.You typically get to do one or two actions per turn on one unit at a time (for example, on low SP unit you attack and then use a stance). It starts to feel monotous after a while.I'd enjoy the game more if the tutorial explained things in more detail and if you could do more in battle each turn.			"

												This game certainly won't be for everyone, that much I can say.It's difficult and unforgiving.  You will get frustrated.  You will also get excited, scared, anxious...it's the type of game that causes tension because you know a mistake, or just some bad luck, could erase one of your party members permanently.  You know, that guy you're real proud of that's been kicking♥♥♥♥♥and taking names?  Yeah he's dead now.  Or maybe he just lost an eye if you're lucky and his stats are crippled in some way.You never really feel safe in this game.  Every time you venture out, even to missions you feel ""good"" about, bad things could happen if you don't pay attention.  If you get impatient, push a little to far, or if you just have a run of bad luck.But that's what makes the game great, because everytime you go out and come back alive you feel like you've achieved something.  Even the ""junk"" weapons you bring back are, at least for me in early game, a boon.Truth be told, I still haven't even completed the first story mission.  I have a warband (party) put together that I've been playing with for a good five hours, and I'm not 100% sure what to expect...so starting that mission might be pushing the reset button.  Or it might be glorious.Guess I'll go find out. "

The sub-objectives in various missions can't be completed fully because the enemy either runs out of units, you miss a lot or you don't have enough SP to get all the resources, When you pick up some of the resources your units run out of space very quickly and the only way to get more is to go back and forth between scavenging locations and your treasure chest.You typically get to do one or two actions per turn on one unit at a time (for example, on low SP unit you attack and then use a stance). It starts to feel monotous after a while.I'd enjoy the game more if the tutorial explained things in more detail and if you could do more in battle each turn.			"

												This is a great conversion of the tabletop game - not exactly the same, but it captures the look and feel of Mordheim incredibly well.  The battles are intense and deadly, the environment hostile (sometimes frustratingly hostile - forget that at your peril - perfect for Mordheim).  The warband customisation is very satisfying - you can easily spend as long tweaking your warband as you spend fighting battles (just like the tabletop game).If you know and love the tabletop game you should love this game too.  If you do not know the tabletop game, it is good enough to stand on its own merits.While the game feels complete, there is plenty of scope for the addition of other warbands and individual heroes - bring on the Undead and especially the Witch Hunters!

												This is a hard game, it can be fun. This game is more designed for people that have played the table top version. I do like the dark atmosphere, I just don't care for it being so difficult, yet I am hooked and keep playing, it has a steep learning curve and is not a D&D clone. Maybe some better tutorials would help. I can't say this game is for everyone, But I am so glad I got it!			"

There is a button to view the map with markers for enemies and items in sight, but I wouldn't use it, spoils the combat. :) Still in early stages but shows great promise and progress so far.			"

												Great Strategy game where you get to manage your own squad of warriors. Good amount of story telling in their journey. They can get injured and lose limbs, eyes, and more. If you like xcom then I'd definitely give this a shot!I would like to see some more weapons and gear, the current selection is a bit limited. Some may find the game play repetitive, but I personally love it.Would love to be able to equip battle scarred warriors with things like hooks and eye patches.The RNG may make you rage, but ultimately a clever leader will regularly bring their war band to victory. Yes you will lose people, sometimes for stupid reasons that you couldn't control, but such is war.I see some people hating on the game for RNG. Personally I like the challenge and honestly it's not a super hard game I win like 90% of the time and only lose people every 7 missions if that. Yes I do rage at the skaven when they triple dodge my swings but I get them in the end. I will say this, if you're looking for a walk in the park game where you can just beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of enemies this is not that game.I will levy one bit of criticism against a particular RNG element in the game.The smite or ""magic kill debuff"" is really unecessary. In the game using any spell has a chance of giving your spellcaster one of a variety of debuffs or negative actions. Some examples are:-turn ends immediately-reduced accuracy for a couple turns-other stat debuffs like hit chanceOne of these negative actions in response to ANY spell cast could be a smite which deals 9999 damage to the caster and thus insta kills them. This can happen to your casters or the NPC team casters and I've seen both. Ultimately it's too strong a penalty and I think it stronglty discourages using casters. The other debuffs are one thing, but the insta kill is too much. Why have a caster when you could just recruit another melee hero who has no chance of dying on an arbitrary action? It already takes a ton of money just to teach them spells so why bother?This is the games biggest weakness in my opinion and I wish they would remove it. Even when it happens to the opposing team it's usually not a big enough deal that it changes the tide of battle and if that is the point of it, an RNG mechanic that can change the tide of battle, it can be done in a lot of other more interesting ways.

												Quite a nice tackle on one of the gems of the pre MMORPG offline gaming epicness.What I expected: A somewhat DoW2 influenced brawling game looslely tied together by the mordheim theme.What´s actually in the game: A careful adaption of the tabletop game. The one thing that I imagined beeing a flaw in gameplay was the Action point system, since I´m quite a diehard fan of the tabletop I feared that it wont ""feel""like mordheim. Boy was I wrong :DShort explaination: Your fighters can use their AP to move arround, reclaim AP´s by simply going back the path you used. So you are able position them tactically and set up traps, find nice sniping spots... But be careful of the chaotic infestations on the ground, walls and in corners, they will interrupt your movement if a charater gets too close and set´s it off. This will end a movement substep, and a char cant reclaim the AP´s he used till he hit the trap.The experince system is a bit different, as well as the attributes. It´s heavily influenced by the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay system and it works really great!The procedural map generator is really cool, and the campaign special scneraios bring a lot of flavour with them, and you´re able to field the dramatis personae of your warband to the skirmish.resumé - If you like turn based tactical games you really should consinder the game, even if you haven´t got a tabletop background. If you like the Warhammer Universe and especially the Mordheim theme, it´s almost a must buy.			"

												Neat idea but poorly executed.My biggest beefs:Loot is visible on the map but you have no idea what floor of a building it's on so you'll waste turns looking.Battles suddenly end if you happen to kill the last mob or if the mobs rout, preventing you from collecting loot to improve your party.The UI is rough, you'll have to click things multiple times or move the mouse off and then back over to get it to register.The difficulty in this game isn't the AI outsmarting you, it's the uninspired tactic of making the human land 20% of their attacks while mobs land 80% of theirs.  Invisible walls.Graphics are sort of blah.I could see a sequel to this game being successful if the devs took the review section to heart since there are a lot of common complaints here.			"

												I tried to like this game I just can't1. Mercs have no spellcasters until higher level and comes into play with weak spells.  by the time you get him tha spell that gives people in an area a -5% to hit, dodge and parry will help very little.2. Skaven are the best in balance with a good dodge that can help you early in the game and Chaos and the sisters have spells that can help you in the game throughout combat.3. Sisters are overpowered to the point where if I'm randomly scattered and I am against them I abort as soon as I can.4. Potions are pathetic and virtually unusable in most cases.  A 10% increace in armor protection will not outweigh the 100% loss of stun resistance, especially when you have a skill that can give you a good chance to stun early on.  5.  Armor is supposed to help absorb damage, not make you a punching bag to the point where you hesitate to put armor on a charachter and just risk it with a weapon and shield.6.  Setting abushes against the NPC's just have them immediately stand off and go into ambush mode themselves at least for a couple of turns.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I bought this game expecting an experience similar to the tabletop classic, but his game simply doesn't match up.First of all, the ""permanent injury"" system makes any prolonged campaign pointless as all your characters will be crippled to the point of being useless in a fight. Despite the plentiful access to magic, there is apparently no way to fix these ailments.If you're playing Solo, be aware that the AI is far from being usable. Most of the time, its entire strategy consists of running towards you until it dies.Multiplayer mode is infested with cheaters, since the devs can't be bothered to implement a working anti-cheat system. If you're planning to play PvP, don't even bother buying this game.All in all the game looks nice at the first glance but it's completely broken.Instead of fixing any of the dozens of bugs, the developers just push out one DLC after another.

												I think the game is great, I have been plaing a skaven warband for some time now and it is very satisfying to take out another warband, hopefully they suffer more deaths then I. hahaha....evil laugh... die die..I feel that the upgrading of the troops and their stats/skills dont actually follow the Mordheim board game as such, which is a shame really and a little confusing as I loved the board game alot. (It just doesnt feel like warhammer with out the good old stats...M,BS,WS,S,T,I,A,LD etc) but is not too much of an issue.I do wish there are  more types of warbands as fighting the same 4 does get a bit boring at times, maybe there are plans for others, witch hunters, dwarfs etc. the more the better.Overall I would Recommend this for anyone that is a fan of warhammer fantasy and Mordheim and i am sure this game will get better over time.

All you have to do is simple:- Move together, do not spread out, you might not want to incur RNG god wrath.- Make choke point and gang up on enemy. The AIs are idiot, they can't flank!- Pray to RNG god.I have made 15 win streak easily following this stupid routine.Seriously, why did I buy this game? The only saving grace is the graphic it brought(and Witch Hunter, my favourite). But several minutes of playing can make anyone frustrating because of RNG.			"

Early Access Review
								Mordheim: City of the Damned is a turn-based, squad-level tactical game set in the devastated city of Mordheim. You begin by choosing a warband - the current choices include four different warbands with (what is currently) a basic variety of units, spells, and abilities. You manage what units from your warband you will take into combat within Mordheim. Some are more capable than others overall (heroes) and their inherent unit statistics vary leading to variety in capability - in other words, units with higher agility have higher dodge and hit chances, higher toughness means shrugging off damage, intelligence affects spell-casting, so on. The unit statistics can be viewed from your warband management screen, along with equipped weapons, armor, abilities. Currently you can only change armor and weapons (from some basic choices with differences in combat effects) and swap out your warband units. The plan is for your units to gain experience as the game's development progresses, thus making your units more powerful (and mitigating some of the RNG effects). Most units can currently carry two sets of weapons for tactical variety. Weapons such as swords allow the user to parry while halberds hit hard but suffer an accuracy penalty. Some weapons apply debuffs when they hit enemies (poison blades, warplock pistols, etc.) that can stack and ruin someone's day.Each unit has two types of points - blue points for movement actions and red points for offensive actions. Blue points allow your units to move, climb walls, jump down ledges, reload ranged weapons, flee from opponents, swap weapon sets etc. Red points allow you to attack, cast spells, etc. Some actions require combinations of both (for example, safely disengaging from an enemy without provoking an attack of opportunity requires the use of both types of points, or taking full aim with a ranged weapon).The turn order for units is displayed at the top of the screen but since units of the same type utilize the same icon the information provided isn't as useful as expected. Turn order is determined through initiative based on unit statistics. You can also zoom out from a unit by pressing the LALT key, giving you an overview of where your units are currently stationed, any visible enemy units and previous known locations of currently out-of-sight enemies (marked with a ?). This is extremely useful as Mordheim's devastated and maze-like city streets can be difficult to navigate otherwise.Action success is percent-based, so you can clearly see your chances prior to performing any action. This is of course where RNG effects can be extremely frustrating, but again, once experience gains are implemented stronger units should help mitigate this. Like a lot of turn-based tactical games with these mechanics risk management is an extremely important aspect of the battlefield.There are lootable points on the battlefield and dead enemy soldiers will sometimes drop 'special' weapons (in other words weapons with different statistics, or essentially 'magic' weapons). You can't permanently keep them in your inventory at present but in the future this should impart a sense of unit progression and reward the player for succesfully defeating opponents.Graphically the game is well-done - on the highest settings the game is crisp, runs smoothly and has nice effects. The music is suitably dark considering the setting and lends an appropriate 'doomed' quality to the atmosphere. Those who don't enjoy the Warhammer universe's grimdark grimdarkness might have to overlook these items to enjoy the gameplay.There's quite a bit more to be done in Mordheim. I personally am looking forward to unit progression and the loot system. As it stands the game provides you with one-off skirmishes between warbands to give you a taste of the game's combat and gameplay. If you love games such as X-COM, Xenonauts, UFO: Afterseries, or essentially any squad-level turn-based game you'll definitely enjoy this. Keep an eye on it - if they don't fug it up this could be great.			"

												As a avid player of the tabletop mordheim and a player of Games workshops other games (Warhammer, W40k ect.) I find this game is a true homage to one of it's first true tabletop experiences, without (Well mostly) the obsessive power creeping that has come from it's latest instalments of tabletop games Setting Mordheim, as the name is stated, is played in the once great imperial city which is now just empty corridors and frigtening manisfestations of chaotic energy. And Mordheim the video game doesn't dissapoint. The city itself is well presented and offers the true tabletop experience, baring a few things that tabletop players are farmiliar with such as a birds eye view of the battlefield and no fog of War.In a way this makes the game feel more like a discovering city fight than the all omnipotence view we as tabletop players come to expect, that is there are no way of knowing where your oponent is unless you take the energy to find them. I was genuenly surprised when my character walked out of a door to suddenly come face to face with a Rat Ogre. Boy did that make me a bit paranoid for open doorways and back alleys.Overall The setting is what you would expect from this game, it hits the spot with not only a pinpoint nail, but also the flying hammer behind it. Gameplay Let it be known that the games i enjoy all have one thing in common, and that is not how pretty or how vibrant the world is, I am not a gamer who thinks of such trivial things so zealosly. Instead i find that the games i enjoy all have mechanics that are both easy to pick up and hard to master.Mordheim is no different, it's mechanics very farmiliar to my knowledge of the tabletop game, with a few good exceptions. The Combat sequences do feel like they have that tabletop feel to them (Such as the no guarantee of doing a stance such as dodge or Parry), this is a good thing. It shows that the developers reseached their source material well. However I did notice other things in game which vary way differently than their tabletop Counterpart. These features were noticeably different and feel more on the side of a computer game than a tabletop. And result in things that are rather alienating compared to it's tabletop counterpart (Which is a suggestion of you shouldn't believe everything that is being portraiyed in this game as it's tabletop counterpart) other than the few things that felt like they didn't feel right I had no quams with the system as it was hitting pretty close to home Extra Features Mordheim doesn't really feel like mordheim until you add the one core component from it's tabletop edition into the game, if it didn't have this it would just feel like a city fight of Warhammer Fantasy, and i would say as a person who has playedc both, they are SOO not the sameInstead the introduction of the persistant warbands and the campaign system trully make this a very well made recreation of the tabletop game and make every fight and every warband that much more investing to the player. It's not a simple matter of making a dream warband and proceeding to curb stomp every opponent out there but rather seeing your characters become the warriors they are from every bloody battle you encounter. You as a player pour your time and effort to make your characters an extension of yourself, which makes it all the more harder when those same characters lose vital parts of themselves or even perish from your roster permanently.Mordheim the tabletop game was unforgiving to it's players and made them that much more invested in the survival or their warband, Mordheim the PC game delivers the same hit, time after time. Verdict Overall, I feel  that this game is truly a great extension of it's tabletop counterpart and it makes due of it's promise to give you that genuine tabletop experience. If you are a veteran of the tabletop game i would highly invest in this. For those who haven't played a tabletop game i would suggest you try this out. The concepts and mechanics can help you get through the trial stages of learning this remarkable and addictive game.9/10			"

												Ok, was a big fan of this game. Played almost 200h, bought all DLCs. But seriously, this ambush mode is just purely unafair. My 10 lvl  Skaven warband, which after God knows how many missions still was injury free and was finally all geared up in purple got wiped out. Every warrior got some horrendous injury and some equipment got lost. Starting the turn surrounded, on deadly difficulty and watching all of your most valuable warriors getting gangbanged isn't fun at all. I like the challenge, but this is just unreasonable and broken.Still recommend this game as had much fun until now. However, not sure if I will ever launch it again at this point.  "

Early Access Review
								As was the case with The Long Dark, Mordheim: City of the Damned is in early access and will be reviewed as such. At a later date (when the game is officially released) we will come back and update our review of it. The score we will give at the end of this review is the score for the game as it is right now. And, on that note, let’s get rocking.I – Story [8/10]Mordheim: City of the Damned is a turn-based strategy game (with some RPG elements mixed in) from Rogue Factor. It is a digital adaptation of the tabletop game Mordheim from Games Workshop. Set in the city of Mordheim (part of the amazing world of Warhammer) a comet has crashed and turned the whole city into a horrific battleground for bands of mercenaries from across the land. The prize? Fragments of Wyrdstone that came from the comet and that are scattered throughout the city.It’s not the most intriguing of stories (and, let’s face it, this was originally a tabletop game), but I rather liked it. Not to mention the gorgeously morbid setting in an absolutely immersing universe.II – UI [5/10]There were very few things I didn’t like about the user interface as it sits now. Accessing individual unit stats and action menus is easy as can be, but (again, this is still in early access and will hopefully change) the lack of functionality in the tactical overview map is disappointing. It is often times hard to plot out your strategy on the overview map and then attempt to put it into action in real time. A minimap would definitely alleviate this problem to an extent, but increased functionality of the overview map should definitely find its way into a future update of the game.The really troublesome thing about the user interface is the incredibly awful camera angles during your opponent’s turn. I can’t stress enough how annoying the camera angles are during action phases that are not yours. Sometimes you’ll be looking at a unit in a completely different area of the map that has nothing to do with what is currently happening and that is if you get lucky. More often than not, you’ll be looking at some scenery. While that isn’t necessarily a bad thing in and of itself (the environment is fascinating), it gets obnoxious in a hurry.As far as actual action animations go, the camera angles need some work, but the animations themselves are pretty nice.III – Gameplay [10/10]I love the gameplay in M:CotD. I’m a newcomer to the Warhammer universe for the most part, especially the fantasy side of it, but M:CotD is genuinely fun.There are currently two modes of play. The first mode, “Battleground Only”, is essentially a deathmatch. The object of this mode is to either kill all of the enemy’s units or cause them to rout, effectively forfeiting the skirmish. This (alongside the tutorials) is a good way to become familiar with the mechanics of gameplay.The second mode of play is “Extra Objectives”. In this mode you can win the skirmish in the same way you can win a “Battleground Only” match or by being the first to complete a secondary objective. There are three secondary objectives: “Marked For Death”, “Crush Their Will”, and “Wyrdstone Rush”. To complete “Marked For Death” you will need to kill specific units of the enemy’s warband and collect their belongings as proof. To complete “Crush Their Will” you will need to steal the Idol of the enemy’s warband and stash it in your chest. To complete “Wyrdstone Rush” you will need to gather a certain percentage of all the Wyrdstone on the map. Also, your team and the enemy team could have different secondary objectives or you could have the same one. It keeps things interesting.You also have the ability to alter the roster of your warband. Other things you can manage is what equipment certain units have and how their skills are being developed. You gain experience the more you play with your chosen faction. IV – Content [7/10]For M:CotD to be in early access, it has a fair amount of content already. There are four playable factions to chose from currently (Empire Mercenaries, the Cult of the Possessed, the Sisters of Sigmar, and the Skaven Clan Eshin), four playable maps, a good diversity of units for each faction, and a good smattering of items to equip your warband with. As it is now, is there enough content to justify the price tag? Probably not. At least, not quite yet. There is still more than enough to keep you going for a good long while though.V – Visual [10/10]Now we’re coming to the aspects in which M:CotD really shines the brightest. The graphics are beautiful; both character models and the landscape. Everything is dark and gloomy and the atmosphere is to die for. Every unit is intricately detailed and wonderfully animated. The environment may be the best part about M:CotD. It might be Hell on earth, but it is an unforgettable place to visit.VI – Audio [10/10]We have now reached what I consider to be the greatest part about M:CotD: the music. The music in this game is perfect. It really sets the feel for every single battle and incursion into the cursed city. Not only this, but the sound effects are incredibly well done. As far as sights and sounds go, Mordheim should be your next tourist destination.VII – Overall [8.3/10]Overall, Mordheim: City of the Damned is off to a great start. This one has serious potential and I cannot wait to see where it ends up in terms of it’s completion.			"

												Bought this game as a pre release the game needed lots of work that was a year ago. Since those guys turned it around, the game is great, love the hardcore perma death perma injuries system, great rpg stff. There are a few flaws some mechanics could be polished. Download times are abit long but worth the wait. All in all this game is great for people who like the original board game or people who like turn base skirmischs. Good GAME.			"

Early Access Review
								At the time of this review I've only got about 14 hours of play time with it and it is in early access.  This game in general is pretty awesome, and the development team keeps updating it.  What more could you ask for from an organization?If you enjoy a turn based strategy game that actually requires you put more than 2 seconds of thought into what you are about to do, and you don't mind playing it while in Early Access, then this game is absolutely for you right now.  Pros:I enjoy the amount of customization that goes into preping your warband.  I like the fact that I can select a style of weapon or type of armor, and I can cutomize those items by putting runes in them.I like that I can chose which skills I'm going to use based on how I spent my attribute points.  The development team listens to the customer base, and actively pushes out patches.  This alone is just awesome!Cons:  At this time I can't say they have any.  How is that possible right, all games have faults?  If you re-read my last pro comment, it speaks volumes as to why I can't say this game in its early access state has a con right now.   If the game was in it's final state, and the development team wasn't actively engaged in making the game better, then this review would have some cons.			"

												Not a bad game. Might even call it very good if it weren't for my main issue with it (explained below). I wouldn't even call it as rough as others say. Sure the looting is harsh, since the percentage that you get of what you couldn't pick up is low, random and based off the number of standing warriors. Your units also tend to die fairly often. Which, frankly, them actually dying isn't so prevalent as others make it sound. It's not exactly a bad thing for what this style of game tends to aim for in having losses mean something. It's also something you're warned of fairly well up front. Makes the reward sweeter in the end.The atmosphere is nice. Graphics are decent. Models are very nice. Animations are just a tad stiff in some instances. Sounds are pretty good (unlike other players, I did like the narrator). Music does overpower dialogue in most instances, so be ready to turn that down. The overall feel is kind of like a mix between Nosgoth and Xcom. Good number of skill choices and customization options. Mechanics overall aren't unenjoyable either. Being able to customize your individual warriors was also a nice touch.However, I don't appreciate how you are massively penalized just because of a 2 (or more) units vs 1 fight. Already at a disadvantage (or not...see further down) due to numbers, then the mechanics say you essentially lose by proxy when it saps all of your move and action points from being pinned between two (again, or more) enemies. Your unit is forced to stand there.Oh, I'm sorry, I should mention that there are units who are immune (very few) and a slim chance of passing the check. Which allows you one turn worth of retaliation in an already unbalanced fight? Yeah no. I'm sorry, that's too cheap for me. Games can be made hard without saying you lose, in a situation where you should be able to have the chance to turn things around.Fear and terror checks from some units and abilities that actually make logical sense? Sure. I actually find that appealing as well as an additive to the more intimidating units, and I think it should actually be more apt to initiate a flee scenario. This particular mechanic is far too broad and encompassing of nearly every combat scenario, though. Why do I say this? Because even if you have allies standing 10 ft away, even if you overall outnumber the enemy in a group fight, if there's an enemy between your unit and them? Then this mechanic apparently says you're 'alone'. Yes, in a 2v2, 3v2, 3v3, 4v4 or other combination mob fight, you can have units tagged as alone and unable to do anything other than sit there and take it.I played two warbands, tested, and tried to prove this wrong, but it happened almost every time. I'm sure this could be exploited and I did do so once or twice. To me, though, it still feels cheap. I prefer to win by skill use and the chaos of the RNG rather than something that I, frankly, put on the same scale as a game breaking glitch.For that reason, I don't and can't recommend this game. Is it awesome? It doesn't rate as great as some other far more pricey titles. I also don't regret playing it for free. I have enjoyed getting into it and tried my best to overlook this issue. If I'd paid money, though, I'd be asking for a refund. So past the promo it's likely coming off my computer. Hopefully others have better luck with it. Cheers.			"

												Is it a good game? Depends what your looking for.If you looking for cassual, turnbased strategy game this isn't it.If your looking for gritty, unforgiving game that cuts of your head and takes dump in your windpipe this is it.Game itself is far from flawless, many places its clunky, tutorials are wanting, and some obvious mechanics and information is obscure at best. The maps, and gameplay can get repetitive too, would have liked to see alot more customisation options for the warriors, alot more maps and alot more variation in armor and weapon skins. Also more diffrent scenarios would not go amiss, instead just routing your opponent... as only starting positions and conditions change.The story campaing is atmospheric as is the game as whole. Also the fact that the game MAKES you learn stuff to be successfull instead of patting your head even when in defeat for ""giving your best"", instead of everything you got. Constant strategic aye and positioning is needed to win even the most ""normal"" missions... that is unless enemies bug in walls, carts etc. and you can just pick em off at range. Difficulty really is unforgiving as losing a key member of a team will hurt early and destroy you later game, but there is no more rewarding feeling when you manage to flawlesly execute a mission, twice so when your about to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you and you manage to still win the mission by mixture of gritt, skill and pure bleeding luck.Clunky, unpolished and lacking in some aspects as it is I like it never the less.Its all fun and games until your ogre loses an arm.

												The gameplay hook of search for loot, fight some dudes and then manage your warband is pretty addicting. I am super biased as I used to play Mordheim on the tabletop back in the day and loved it. Its pretty faithful to the feel of the original game too which is great. There are a lot of long load times and when your team gets larger the downtime while your opponent is running around can be pretty long/annoying but I've still had a great time with this game. As such it gets a thumbs up :)			"

												Possibly the greatest existing example of game developers hiding a unfinished, poorly executed game onto the market. The AI in this game does odd moves, ignores objectives, stares at walls, yet will B Line to your weakest guy and try and swarm him with no regard for the battle. It does this to simply inflict permanent damage on your warband, while its crew are just randoms that are totaly expendable. After investing a ton of time into developing a warband, 1 battle where the AI seems to stun your guys with every hit, never miss and somehow do damage that seems impossible, all your time has been wasted because of the overly harsh injury system. 1 armed archers, leaders with stupidity, game ending stuff.  The skill tree in this game costs so much yet delivers mostly marginal effects, maybe a %5 increase onto an ability. Only to see your investment wasted when your guy ends up with a headwound that turns him into a potato. Replacement guys are vastly overpriced for a measly 1 or 2 level character, and because they are the weakest , will be targeted by the AI and go down faster then a crack ♥♥♥♥♥ .  Yet this games most offensive, and just plain insulting aspect is its totaly broken and deceptive Random Number Generator. Stare in disbelief as attack after attack at %95 misses (not parried or dodged). Gaze in awe as the AI lands powershot after powershot on your warbands leader who had a %80 dodge enabled. From what I have observed in 300 hours of game on several accounts, the AI gets a %25 bonus and you get a %25 penalty. So go through mission after mission of danger, builld your followers up, only to watch them die . There is no end point to this game,it just grinds you down. Win 100 battles yet in 1 bad battle where the AI pulls♥♥♥♥♥♥from its♥♥♥♥♥♥and stuns on near every hit, and your main guys end up with game ending wounds. Wish a decent company had worked on this game, instead of this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥brick muppets. They know exactly the problems but cant be ♥♥♥♥ed fixing it.Now up to near 700 hrs and all the issues still remain. One last detail Ive noticed, story missions are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ overly complicated, repetetive , and full of enemies that somehow appear from rooms or areas already cleared.  I have a new idea for a mission, go to the docks, find a barrell,♥♥♥♥♥♥in it till full, find game devs and drown them in it.			"

Posted: February 9, 2016
												Definitely not recommended. This is not a ""broken"" game. It is a game that is extremely poor by design. It will not ""get fixed"". Will highlight some of the -obvious and terribly cynical- design decisions taken, in order to artificially lengthen the game as well as creating a need for ""DLC investment"". The importance of the latter in the game's ""strategy"" became very apparent with their recent launch of laughable content (two extra options for characters - paid).There are many shortcomings but the following are the highlights:- The combat design is ridiculous. The whole concept of side objectives (which are necessary to meet to have any chance of progressing through the game, as the rewards are intentionally pitiful) is awful. Makes sense from the developers' point of view though. This is a game where the only plausible strategy is to keep formation and gang up on enemies (1:1 you will die most of the time. Outnumbered you will die almost every time - levelling up does not help; see below). The side objectives are aimed at just one thing: Preventing you to keep formation and ganging up on enemies. You basically only have two options. Go after side objectives and fall to statistics (hugely abused by this game, as a ""bonus""), or win battles and get next to no rewards - so lose on the ""strategy map"". The whole loot system as utterly attrocious. Everything about it (when you can collect it, the fact that you essentially lose most of it when you win, the storage system etc). It is all aimed at one thing: Destroying rewards so you stay longer in the game, particularly through the crappy ""veteran system"".- Strategic progression and the ""veteran system"". This is where your warband progresses, in a poor excuse of what Mordheim is supposed to be. Coupled with the ""Veteran system"", which is supposed to earn and track rewards from multiple warbands fielded by the player over the course of ""playing"" this game. Neither works.Skills are so incredibly expensive that you cannot pay for them, as the rewards are too puny. You will watch your warband's characters accumulate skill points that you cannot afford to spend. There is a work around here, which is obviously intentional. Kill enough warbands, waste enough time mindlessly, and you will sllllllooooooooowwwwwllllyyy inch up the veteran system's ranks. One of the ""benefits"" is that it lowers costs and increases starting gold for warbands. See what they did there? That's an example of how the game is artificially lengthened, without any challenge or reason to engage in it.Until you get to that sweet spot (which requires many, many hours of extremely boring grinding and killing warbands), you actually get PUNISHED for levelling up. Whenever you are matched with an enemy warband, it is roughly scaled to yours. However, their characters, of any given level, come complete with the skills you never afforded for yours. With every level you add to your characters, they get markedly worse than their upskilled opponents of same ""rank"". Clever.- It has been a long time since I have seen a game that so cynically and obviously rigs the dice throws. It is getting a bit of a reputation for this and it is actually well deserved (Which is not the case in most incidences when this accusation is levelled at a game). Yes, I know how statistics work, yes, I know about the law of large numbers and, no, I am not ""impressed"" by some fluke throws that did not go my way. I am a 40+ post grad engineer; not a frustrated teen. Will not go into great length of what I tracked and for how long (it would mark me as OCD if I did). Believe me or not, but what they did is just stunning. It is now actually easier to track as (obviously in response to the aforementioned reputation), you can see the modifiers for each ""roll"". The transparency has made the rigging even more obvious and easier to measure.This old staple of lazy and cynical programming is usually nothing more than a nuisance - another artificial way of increasing difficulty and lengthening the game (both very important to marketers, in the age of DLC). Basically, it usually means save-scumming or pay for extra ""power"" to overcome the handicap. In a game with permadeath it is a complete dealbreaker.  Could add considerably to the list. Overall, a highly negative experience and a huge let down for a Games Workshop and Mordheim hobbyist who paid for this piece of junk from pre-release (an extremely rare choice for me - at least it taught me a lesson).

												I can't reccomend this game in it's current state. It says the game was released in November of 2015 but the game holds the quality of a game in early to mid-beta. The UI (as in every Game's Workshop game) is horrible. Engage-ranges are ambiguous and often leads to the AI or your friends edging walls and slipping past your defenses. Ambush works 50% of the time, where line of sight does not seem to matter (that is; if you stand around a corner, often the enemy will see you before stepping into your ambush range and just avoid your attack alltogether).A lot of these problems coupled with an unforgiving-post skirmish system makes this game a frustrating mess. If these problems would be resolved, I would call the game hard but fair. Atm, it just feels cheap when you lose because of technicalities. ""Yay, my leader is now blind on one eye and has a maimed hand, because there were 5 centimeters between the area my guards threatened and the wall."" If these issues are resolved, I'd reccomend it. It has potential.			"

Early Access Review
								I feel that the game is just too unfinished to be playable. The menu is very complicated and unexplained and made me use trial and error and a few youtube vids just to be able to play the game. Along with this some of the tutorials do not do a good job of explaining the game. The combat I feel is terrible. I played against computers and all the game would be is using your units to 4v1 group a single enemy unit hoping that you get a crit on them and they dont crit you. It takes forever to kill a unit unless you are the computer and you have units that can hit four times before ending their turn. For seasoned pros this game is perfect. Like the tabletop version? Then I am sure you will like this aswell. I myself never played the tabletop version and felt very lost in how this had strategic value. Too much is broken and not enough is in the game. I felt that the advertising on this is just a bit too good for its actual gameplay.			"

												It says something about how poor the game design is, that the Devs have to jack up enemy warband difficulty to insane levels just to make the game workable.  I just got done doing a normal difficulty mission with a rank 10 warband, and literally every single one of my henchman was crit on the first swing of the match, stunned, and then promptly dismembered by the massive damage increase that the enemy warbands get.  What gives devs? Still using ""Our AI coding skills are bad"" as a crutch excuse for artifical enemy warband bonuses?			"

												I want to like this game, I really do, but the ""chance"" aspect of this game is so ♥♥♥♥ed that its hard to call it a tactical strategy. I think a couple stories will describe this nicely.First imagine your magister, high level and very powerful. You take him into a normal difficulty mission that goes fairly well. The enemy has very low moral and is expected to break soon. As you go to cast a spell, you read that the success percent is nintey and so you cast it having action points to spend. After casting it, your magister is cursed. He takes 999999 damage (instantly killing him). Him bieng slow the round ends after his turn. Your warband then breaks and you lose the battle. After battle, your magister dies, perminently. You then proceed to delete that warband and almost the game.Next, imagine your winning a battle, all looks well. The enemies turn has just ended so you proceed to issue attack commands to your warband as combat is near. You miss every hit that round, and the next. Every percent chance says ""seventy"" or ""eighty"" but you miss, everything. After two round of bieng slaughtered your warband breaks and a majority of your party members suffer wounds.And I know, mordhiem is based on a tabletop game that comes down to dice rolls, but as someone who (once, age of sigmar is a thing) played warhammer fantasy, this game is not near as deep strategically, and I have a hard time understanding why it is considered a tactical strat. game when so much of it comes down to chance. What skill does it take to have your party leader die to an enemy scout because he cant hit him on an ""eighty-percent"" chance?			"

												EARLY ACCESS REVIEVED FIRSTLY ON 20th OCTOBER 2015. (Update 8, Patch 4, EA rating - 95/100)This is an updated review after full-release. Changes are written with capital letters. (Release 19/NOV/2015, v. 1.0.4.1).My overall rating for Mordheim: City of the Damned: 100/100Another adaptation from Warhammer universe, this combines elements of real-time strategy and RPG genre. Decent atmospheric settings full of horror and merciless battles, that is what this game promises you. Add a management of your warband, improvement of skills and a decent portion of strategy with luck and you have, what it is really called. War over cursed city, which we will look into further in details.GAMEPLAY+ Good design and performance+ Strategic map+ Variety of actions and reactions (most of them are responsive)+ Good tutorials+ Warband management+ Commented objectives, stories before and after the mission+ VOICED STORIES AND INTRO ADDEDo Complex control- Four factions only (may not be negative at all)Gameplay is a decent part of the game and it is very well balanced. Now there are only four factions, but tactics, randomised elements on map and also important luck factor are creating a formidable game experience. Turn-based strategy is very well combined with RPG genre, so you have to improve your warband, change the position and disposition of the troops, after that, you have to fight your battles on the battlefield.Battles need another strategy guidance, you have to rely not only on your warriors, but also to environment and luck. Everything is possible in war, so also here, even the weakest unit can disable or rout the strongest enemy with the right conditions and events happened.Commented objectives, intros and outros to the mission are adding a great impression to the atmosphere of the whole game. Player can feel himself/herself like the biggest general and strategist in the world.VISUALS+ Excellent graphics+ Art style+ Cam view+ Wounds have influence on characters' appearance Visually is Mordheim stunning. Perfect set of backgrounds, various part of Mordheim, nice details on units and many features have a wonderful impression on a player. Also your warriors may suffer wounds and injuries, which are visible then, so you can tell, who is a novice and who battle-toughened veteran.SOUNDTRACK+ Well composed+ Theme for each faction, map+ RELEASED AS AN EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR ALL PLAYERSSoundtrack adds points for Mordheim: City of the Damned, themes are adequately changing, underlining both nature of each faction and sinister atmosphere of cursed city of Mordheim. After full release it was added and automatically downloaded to game folder (link specified at store page).MULTIPLAYER+ Balanced+ Various modso Seeking by rating (adjustable)Multiplayer also provides another possibilities for your warband to perform, you can choose of plenty modes and community is fair and friendly. There is also ""Exhibition"" mode, where no penalties will remain after ending. For other, experienced units are recommended, because loss can disrupt your precisely build warband in one unlucky mission. Though you can seek the enemy just to suit your rank, so it is compensable and you do not have to have an elite unit at all.SUMMARYThis title is a very wonderful adaptiation of Warhammer universe, yet in the process of perfection through Early Access. Also turn-based strategy and RPG combination seems very promising, though there might be some bugs and people should be aware of that and considering this during their reviews, written or spoken, does not matter what. Developers are working fast, communicating with community and releasing patches regularly, each with huge balance.About the price, game is complex, replayable, I understand that 39,99 EUR might be expensive for some players (Early Access costed 31,99 EUR), but it is worthy, singleplayer for sure, multiplayer experience are giving also points to this title. Though it is very similar to late Early-Access phase, it has those improvements, which exactly were needed to be done.The game is recommended for Warhammer fans, turn-based strategy, RPG players and also players outside this genres. Each of us has a bit of dark fantasy within us.			"

								I hate turn based games! I think its so boring and♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay. This game still needs alot of work to add more strategic values to the game, since thats the number one reason for these games. This game is looking so good and they update the game a tone. Since the last update the game went from messing around fun to actually playable for so many hours and the best thing is its hard and challenging and if they add more missions and elements to the game you might want to take a month off work :PEven a game like this, i would still respect even if i didnt like it, there team has worked so hard.So buy the game, you will like it and if you dont? The way they work, in 3 - 6 months you will 100% like it, if your not loving it.			"

Early Access Review
								So I am going to try and be as informative as I possibly can with this game.The game has four factions each one with unique units that can wield and use varieties of armor and weapons. To start the game you are going to choose one of four factions, the choice of faction is crucial to your play style. Once chosen you are going to begin leveling, and yes you level everything, even the poor little meat shields you hide your damage dealers behind. This entire game is based on leveling, accept that fact and youll be perfectly happy with the game. Now the key detail of this game in my eyes is going to be resource management in the warband screen. EVERY MEMBER of your warband must be paid, and you must send wyrdstone to those who request it, miss four shipments and its game over. Inside your camp you can almost fully customize your characters (this is a detail of the game that i want more improvement on) by changing the styles of their gear and equipping them new armor and weapons, also training them over days in spell casting and skill use.now once outside of your warbands camp youll be placed on the campaign screen (the newest update added this finally!). Once on the screen youll be given a variety of missions to choose from, all with varying difficulty and loot. Once you get your warband high enough you will be given an end of act mission. These end of act missions have objectives that must be completed such as placing sanctified hammers on statues, and cleansing the corruption from holy artifacts.The actual gameplay is a turn based strategy format. Units take turns based on their initiation, this is lowered by heavier cumberson items and armor/weapons. In many ways I have found that the weaker glass cannon units go first most of the time, and depending on your faction you may or may not have any of those. Now one thing this games combat does very well is its implication of stances. there are many stances in this game including ambush dodge and parry, being the primary stances. Combat can be very difficult at times because your units move spaces may not get you in a proper postion to attack, and often leads to bottlenecking through doorways or over bridges. Each mission you recieve has a primary objective of killing all enemies or causing them to retreat. Retreat is caused by you forcibly removing morale from an enemy by either surrounding them and causing fear, or the killing of their units. (im not sure about this but it seems like killing enemy heroes and leaders causes a deeper impact on morale)One thing to be wary of is any kind of % chance, as this game is still in Alpha I will go back and change this review as needed but as of now a 78% chance of climbing over a wall seems to have only a 30% success rate, and yes I have tested this by losing over 3 units to trying to climb one wall.All in all this game is amazing, definitely a must have for any warhammer player, and a must try for any strategy enthusiast, this game will punish you through crippling soldiers or even permanent death though. So if you do decide to try it watch for ambushes, and stay away from charging Daemons! Enjoy!			"

The game is visually stunning, it clearly loves its source material, and it is constantly being updated with massive changes and fixes that only serve to fix and add features to this already solid product. Mordheim is worth the price and has solid multiplayer. Find a friend and mess them up, It'll be great. Buy this game.			"

								Great game, feels very down and dirty and reminds me alot of excom (which i played in ironman mode, ofc.)  Although i do believe a difficulty setting should be added for those who are not up to the challenge, and for 1v1 battles against your friends to actually give you rewards,  it is a utterly fantastic game that can be EXTREMLY stressfull at times, but it also has moments that not many other games have.  Those moments where you have 3 units dead and all the rest but one are on 10 health, and you have to use the one with the low health to bait out an overwatch shot in order for your units to attempt to run up to your objective, and then you realise that you left an important item behind and have to go fetch it in order to succede while your men are under-fire but you somehow manage to pull it out and succede.  This game gave me a sence of pure joy that I have not had in gaming for quite some time.  An utter joy to play.			"

								I was incredibly excited when I heard about this about a year ago cause I've always loved the table top game. When I first played it a year ago, however, it was just an incrediby glitchy skirmish game. Sure, it was set in the city of mordheim and had the right feel to it. It just wasn't mordheim to me without a campaign and progression. So, it sat in my library unplayed and unloved with me checking occasionally on the updates. It was encouraging seeing the constant support they gave the game over the year, but I wasn't truly happy until this week when I saw they had finally added what I believe is the heart of mordheim. and from what I've played, its amazing. Though, stats and skills work pretty differently from what it is on the table top, I believe it is amazingly done. The game was pretty easy to pick up and the matches themselves made sense and felt seamless. IF you enjoy turn based rpg combat this game is perfect for you. I can see theres a lot of depth to this game and I can see my social life suffering for the next few weeks while my skaven raid the city of mordheim for glory.			"

								If the multiplayer and magement/team progression aspects are thougtfully implemented I think that this will be a very successful game. There are a some bugs, such as camera issues and a few invisible walls, but this comes with early access and I'm sure these will get ironed out in time. I'm deffinitely Looking forward to the next update.REVIEW OF PROGRESSION - update 8.The game at the moment is very entertaining, slightly addictive, and requires some skill to keep your team going. There are small issues with balancing, enemy warbands seem to level more quickly and have +40% health, but again this is merely the beginning of testing progression; which will hopefully be perfected in the near future as this is what will affect replayability.   There are still some bugs floating around, the old invisble wall, but they are steadily being fixed by the developers. The only concerns I have as of now for the game are small UI things; the placement of buttons, perfecting icons such as those on the map; that reduce submersion into the game. Fingers crossed for the next few updates. Hopefully everything will come together seemlessly and the optimisation phase will make everything run a bit smoother and bring the loading times down.			"

								This is a game I have waited for for a long time. I have finished playing the tutorials and played 1 skirmish and here are my current observations:The game is Mordheim! It has the real feel for the setting and feels like I am playing the miniatures game. Once the RPG elements of the game have been implemented this will be brilliant.I like the more dynamic move options instead of your standard turn based grid style of movement. It gives you a chance to explore different movement options and makes it feel more realistic.The camera views in the game need work. Nothing that breaks anything, just every now and then you get an angle where you cant see whats going on.There are points in the game that need graphics optimization...I am currently playing on the ""Simple"" Graphics configuration and in the main menu screen, my cards fan is screaming. During normal play its fine.To summerize, the potential for this game is huge and could be a really big hit once they get the game further down the road. Thank you so much for making this!			"

												Its a difficult and fun turn-based strategy game with minimal tutorials, but very frustrating most of the time since a string of three bad rolls can be devistating to your favorite minion or even lose the entire match. Each match takes a long time (40 to 60 minutes plus) to resolve as the maps are massive and the enemies are hidden.  You are always the underdog and must skillfully maneuver your minions to win.  You must also get both the primary and secondary goals if you wish to keep pace with the game difficulty progression (hard to insane) and the economic demands (warpstone & coins) of growing and equiping your warband.  I use a laptop and my original computer was not quite up to the processing burden of the game, but my new intel core 17 laptop handles it fine.			"

								so far so good. obviously units are preset with varying weapon combinations to allow for playtesting but allows no real focus on a certain play style, which although takes away from the specialisation of a faction, does lend itself to a general pleasant playing experience. as a tabletop Mordheim enthusiast, love the initiative ladder. waiting around for a full turn without doing anything gets boring. loved the climbing and jumping down functions in the game, although laughed a little when a unit attempted to jump down, failed and fell to the ground, but next frame ended at the top again. surely a failed jump down makes you land on the ground regardless... would kill for dark elves but know that they'd be far, far, far off. would love to see the regulars undead and witch hunters but unsure if they'd be a little too similar to mercs, especially since the mercs get a warlock. great start so far so congratulations lads. keep up the good work			"

												This is a good, engrossing, strategy game.Very deep mechanics, strategy from the start, and very unforgiving. Your warband will be slaughtered as you learn to play, go into this thinking of your characters as disposable and you will have a better time than if you get attached to them. Eventually, you will figure out how to survive and grow some powerful ones, but early on expect a lot of pain and (kinda) starting over.While the focus is on your warband, you are leveling your leadership in the background and this gives bonuses to new warbands you start, in effect, the game gets (ever so slightly) easier every time you are decimated, broke, and starting over.Game is only iron man mode, meaning no save loading when you mess up, be prepared.Due to the stakes being high, every match I play is full of ""WTF?!"", ""CRAP!"", and ""OH♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; moments as well as ""♥♥♥♥ yea!"", ""WHOO-HOO"", and ""RIGHT ON!"" moments. Highs and lows....Who could ask for anything more?			"

Early Access Review
								I played the tutorial and some skirmishes, and was impressed even though it's in very early access. I have never been so impressed by such a raw and unpolished form of a game in fact. The gameplay is fun and rather quick, and yet deep. One false move can see your downfall. Once they add warband management (which is actually going in later today) and a campaign I can easily see this game becoming one of my all time favorite games. Don't screw it up rogue factor. I'm counting on you.			"

												For fans of Warhammer Fantasy, and the Mordheim boardgame in particular, this game is fantastic. You couldn't beat the PC game scenery on a tabletop. The game isn't easy what makes it very rewarding if you do win and makes your heart ache when one of your beloved characters in which you invested time and gold, dies... A very involving game, true to the Old World, true to the boardgame mechanics. A pitty the character customization isn't a bit more expanded, I would like to see more different faces in a warband, they all seem to be siblings.. Undoubtedly one of the better PC-game versions of a Games-Workshop game.			"

												Fight with skavens in the noble quarter. Perfect fight, just before morale test one lucky ratmen  critshoted my captain. Bah ... he´ll be fine ... but he wasnt. Died next day and whole warband was out of money to hire a new one so tough luck and strart again ... just like tabletop version.As a old player of tabletop Mordheim, I am bit distracted by transformation of classic warhammer dice rules to percentages, but hey we use D6 mainly because they easy to count and keep track of hits and misses ... if computer do the whole counting I dont mind. Ranged weapons are less deadly than in original, there are no slings (incredibly powerfull, low cost weapon that even nuns could use)I have played the game for a few hours and its solid. Worthy buying in when is below 20€.			"

								Did you ever play xcom and think to yourself 'this would be better if it was set in a medieval fantasy land and instead of losing my beloved troops to instant death, they suffered a slow and agonizing series of injuries that crippled them to the point where usually you yourself have to make the decision to fire them even though said injuries were received under your command' - Well then this is the game for you!

												As a former player of the tableetop version of Mordheim, I feel that the computer version has captured the feel of the tabletop version.  It is not a port of the table top version and I think that it is better for it.  There are moments of frustration, as your men can not hit anything or you leader gets his arm cut off in the second mission, I speak from experience, but I can not help but enjoy the narrative of my warband, as they grow,  develop, and sadly die.  I have become very attached to my one arm one legged archer who can no longer use a missile weapon.Now, there are issues, the AI could really do with an overhaul, a few more different warbands, undead, dwarves, pitfighters, would be nice.  The game would also be better if it had some more maps.  All that being said, I enjoy the game and think it is worth giving it a go.   "

												I love this game and recommend buying it.Three great things in this game :- the world of Warhammer and the Skaven- it makes you worry for your men (they accumulate xp through missions and you can chose a variety of skills)- and it constantly teases you to take risks (trying to get more money, at a higher risk).There are no saves and losing a mission feels really painful : your men that have been put out of combat have a small chance of actually being uninjured after the mission, but usually get some kind of permanent injury, which make them powerful/less usable - and I just got my 3 best men (incl. my boss and a hero) actually DEAD in a single mission ! (all right, I confess I was greedy and tried a ""deadly"" mission, which turned out to be a mission against sisters... mental note: don't do it again)But actually, aside from the ""psychological"" side, losing is not as damaging (in game terms) as you could think, because the difficulty of most missions depends on your strength.Going for a ""normal difficulty"" mission is a bit easier with a strong team than with a weak team, but not that much. (it's still a bit easier with a strong team because as your teammates level up, you can chose skills and usually, we humans are better than the AI at building ""consistent"" characters (with skills that work well together)).So I my opinion the game is great because it feels unforgiving without being actually completely unforgiving.

												These are the big pros to me:- The atmosphere. Graphics and sounds support Warhammer world very well and I like the narrator voices too.- ""Roguelike"" elements (injuries, deaths, no savegames) fit very well into a dark fantasy setting. A couple of injuries to a favourite character gives him/her actually.. more character :)- Asymmetrical factions make game more interesting.- Many kinds of viable builds for warbands.- Meaningful tactical choices in combat.The only bad thing I really come up with is the AI - a point that is relevant mostly when playing the single player scenarios. This is what I have to say about it:It is a popular complain that the AI REALLY sucks and that it is easy to win games using choke points. And it is true - except when it isn't. The scenarios also start with deployments that try to screw you up, like spreading your warriors alone across the map and enemies rushing towards you and engaging you when you haven't even had the chance to react. So while it's true that the AI is stupid and you can ""farm"" it, sometimes it's so much opposite that it's unfair (and it's kind of realistic and in the game's genre it is acceptable). And sometimes it's something in between. I admit it's by far the weakest part of the game - Luckily the game does it's best to minimize the effect.I haven't played multiplayer yet, but of course there the situation isn't the same.Overall this game gives me wonderful moments in a grim dark fantasy world.

												Amazing game, just excellent, but it is very very very hard, just brutal, you really need to know the mechanics like dodge/parry, sticking together, NOT picking ""both team scattered"" missions and managing your red attack points to do well. You WILL lose warband after warband while learning the ropes, but it is worth it, great game.			"

Posted: March 23, 2016
												I have a love/hate relationship with this game, but I can't bring myself to rate negatively. I will, however, be leaving a lengthy review explaining my opinions of this game.First of all its one of the best tabletop to video game conversions I have ever played. The play mechanics are superb and feel refreshing for a turn based strategy game, aside from the RNG. The overall look and feel of the game are excellent, it is a great blend of horror and strategy. Great graphics, awesome artwork, cool noises, amazing voice acting, and genuinely creepy.Yes the game can be immensely challenging and unforgiving, but that is one of the best parts. Real true consequences that you will be feeling the effects of for a long while to come, so play smart, be cautious. The downside of the game is really that the AI, although incredibly tough, is incredibly stupid. Every match is basically a Zerg rush. The AI will throw everything it has at you (aside from one guy who will wander around aimlessly) right at the start of match.The goal of the game almost entirely revolves around collecting this precious green crack called Wryd Stone. The AI is not at all interested in doing that. Instead they will mindlessly pursue you like ravenous zombies.If they could improve the AI, wherein they actually cared about collecting the Wyrd Stone, as the game implies they should, and used some genuine strategy instead of 'walk straight at the closest enemy and kill' strategy it currently uses then this game would be huge win.Another sore spot is the RNG. I suggest you keep a pillow close by to bite on because you will be getting royally ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥ The RNG seems to purposely want to cause you to smash your computer in complete rage. I have lost numerous battles, where I overwhelmingly had the tactical advantage, simply because my team would continually miss attack after attack and take every incoming hit right on the chin till they where all decimated.There is little to nothing you can do about the RNG except pray and pray. It completely sucks the idea of 'being the smarter tactician' right out of the game. They should add in some fail safe so you can only miss so many times in a row or something along those lines because it seems no matter how likely your odds of landing a hit are its always a 3/10 chance you will actually land the hit... especially when you really really need to land that last freakin hit!Lastly, I absolutely love the fact this game has multiplayer support. Although it is neigh impossible to find a match unless you join a community group that host pvp tournaments. It may have been the saving grace of the entire game if not for the fact that multiplayer is not balanced at all.Every faction in multiplayer has some super cheezy tactic or advantage that will make them OP depending on what lvl your currently fighting at. Early on the Skaven move so far and fast they can easily swarm, poison, and kill half your team before you even get to move. Later on the Sisters will drop comet after comet, after comet, after... you guessed it more comets on your head till you have two guys remaining that they quickly surround and flog to death. Late game the Mutants if played right, will have uber mutations giving them more strength and health than anyone making them a wall of flesh and claws that will pound your face, body, and soul into the ground.If they where to improve AI, add a more forgiving RNG (so the game is more based on tactics than luck), and tweak the multiplayer balancing this game would be absolutely amazing. For now I suggest if you like tabletop games, turn based strategy, Warhammer, or are a masochist get this game next time its on sale.I'll be looking forward to updates... if there are any.			"

												So much wasted potential. I like so much about this game, but have just gotten completely sick of the flaws. You will get stuck in buggy missions where quitting causes your whole party to take permanent injuries and lose critical equipment. You will get trapped in RNG hell where the AI crits you over and over while your elite warriorf flail impotently at the air. You have no way to respec your party members, so if you pick the wrong skill (or your chaos troops mutate in a way that negates that skill you spent precious points and gold on) then you have no way to change it. Your enemies' turn in the initiative order, something that is CRITICAL to planning any sort of strategy, will alter itself wildely with no imput or action by either warband. While I enjoyed alot about it, my overall experience has been mostly frustration and now disgust at how much time I've wasted with it.			"

												This game is probably the most hardcore experience you can get if you are a Warhammer - Mordheim fan, as punishing as should be, withouth casualisation that is so common nowadays, you will get your chars crippled temporally or forever, you will get them killed, you will feel the pressure of the task of getting Wyrdstone and gold, heck, if you are new in this kind of games you will get wiped in the first escenario, also is one of the few modern games were you really need to check the tutorial.Pros+Challenging and complex gameplay+Skaven models are sweet+Graphics are good for an ""indie"" title+It gets the Mordheim/Warhammer atmosphere right+Gritty+I really like the musicCons-Lack of customization of your warband-Some models looks ""ugly""-Not as much music variety-It needs more blood and goreIf you liked Valkyria Chronicles, Xcom or any turnbased strategic game don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a truly good game.

Early Access Review
								Picked it up today and haven't stopped playing it all day. It is definitely in early release stage but by far one of the better early release games on steam. At this point it's more playable than most fully released games!Being a big fan of the Warhammer series from everything to lore and the table top (both Warhammer fantasy and 40k) I was really excited when I first discovered this a while back. Most of the games made with Games Workshop are usually the 40k space marine type or Dawn of War. This was obviously a delight because it looked like a “real” attempt at the fantasy style instead.I was a bit hesitant to pick it up at first mainly because of the bad wrap on early releases lately and from everything I read it was meant for a console and was still pretty rough for PC users. As I watched it though it went from “mixed reviews” to “Mostly positive” the developers were releasing some awesome new content and watching some game play on youtube it looked like it might actually become a real game instead of another early release disappointment (here's looking at you Day Z). The game play itself is pretty solid. You have the 4 factions all of which are pretty balanced and at this point pretty simple. At this point in the game you really on have the tutorials (4 of them which really do cover all the game and take less than an hour) and skirmish. You create a map and choose the opposing faction if it's against AI or you can randomly pair with another person for some PVP. The unique thing I liked about setting up the game were the vast options for starting locations or scenarios. For example you can can do standard set up (both teams start at opposite corners) you can do Ambush (one team starts all inside a building and the opposing team is surrounding the building) Fog of War (Both teams are completely scattered across the map) and the list goes on and on. The maps even at this point are impressive and I love that they randomly generate so you hardly ever get the same map twice.  The combat is pretty simple which might be a down point for some, but personally I enjoyed I. It keeps the game play fast and allows you to focus on other strategy rather than micro managing each character during their turn. You basically have two types of points for each unit Strategy Points and Offense Points (SP and OP respectively) your SP points allow for movement and your OP allow for combat which you can see pretty decently in the game play video. Depending on the skills or spells your unit has you are allowed to cycle through your available options each turn  by hitting Q or E. This helps make the combat smooth and quick. Most of the strategy is in placement of troops and sight. Much like in the tabletop game the first few turns are setting up your units in defensible areas or in getting the enemy in line of sight. This may seem tedious for those who want action but it is incredibly fun to run around as an Ogre or Cultish Wizard looking for positions of advantage. Outside of the match you do have the option to micro manage your troops which was also fun from a looting, leveling, and buffing standpoint. You can customize your squad with gear which can be looted from battles and eventually purchased, you can spend points and level skills, spells, or abilities, and you can enchant your weaponry (Hammer of Sigmar +5 awesomeness). This makes you invested in your war band but keep in mind this game also has perma-death so don't get super attached to your beloved hero. Some awesome things that stand out:The overlord view during a match that allows you to plan and scope the whole map was really a cool idea and works very well.In game log for all actions so you can see why you missed that hit or miscast a spell.Dark fantasy art and feel is seriously awesome as hell. They did a fricken epic job making Mordheim seem like a city of dark magic corrupted by chaos.Lore (though limited) is all accurate and pretty intriguing. It will be appreciated by fans of the genre and at the same time new players won't be confused or lost without background.9/10 would run around for an hour as a Skaven assassin again.This would be an amazing game for just an RPG in the style of Fable or Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning. Give me this city as an open world map and let me build a character and I would pay an A list game price for that. "

												Awesome. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. One, for example, complains about not getting to take scavenged and looted items back when the warband member carrying them falls in battle. Suffice it to say, there is a strategic, practical, no-cheat way to minimize that kind of loss. It's just a bit more risky and time-consuming. *HINT*: It involves the team carriage. ; ) Otherwise, just preferences holding their sway, I guess.Top-notch TBS action, with nice visuals, good storyline, and great concepts fleshed-out in an interesting, dark world.

Please ignore this if there're some.-Musics / It's a boring loop, if they can add some epic pieces that will improve gaming experiences. In my opinion, turn based games really needs good musics.

												Very promising and reminds a lot of the old cult classic tabletop game. So far only 2 warbands, Skaven and human mercenaries, but they will add a lot more over time. Mechanics are fun, graphics and sounds are good. Overall a fun turnbased experience with a very interesting new take on action points, and how they work.Update: With the full release here and 4 warbands instead of two. They added Sisters of Sigmar, a hard-hitting band of religious nutcases Warhammer style as well as adding Cult of the Possessed, which is a Chaos warband, with all that that brings. Mutations, weird way of thinking and just plain barbarism.With over 100 hours logged, I have this to say: The game is very unforgiving, and at times extremely frustrating. Very long load times, which seems to be something the company can't fix because of how the game is built. it has a built in anti-rage quitter system, meaning if you quit during any mission or skirmish, it treats it as if the warband got routed and EVERY SINGLE WARRIOR in the fight will have to roll on the injury table to see if they suffer any injury or lose any equipment. This is very harsh, especially for single player where you don't really hurt anyone by abandoning a mission that goes really, really bad (considering the loss of one skilled warrior can set you back around 10 hours of game time). it doesn't help the AI is dumb as bricks, and pathfinding for large units really is an issue. More than once, I see them stuck by a door and just can't move.Still, even with its flaws this game is very addictive and I stand by my early access opinion, the game is great.2nd and last update: Loading times has been fixed, it now loads very fast. Gone from over a minute of loading time to around 15-20 seconds. (I use a SSD).They've added 2 new Warbands: The Witch Hunters, a warband of Witch Hunters (think the psychos from the witch hunts in Europes history) and their cohors: religious nutcases (Flagellants and Zealots). Their impressive unit is a very large human with the suiting profession of executioner. He likes to set his enemies on fire. While they're alive.The second new is Undead, set to be released tomorrow as I write this (the 25th of october 2016). I can't wait. Vampires. Zombies. Dregs. Necromancers. Crypt horros. Oh my.			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a great game based off Games Workshop's Tabletop skirmish game.  If you're looking for a direct translation, this is not the game for you.  If you want a great tactical skirmish and management game, this should be on your wishlist.The important part is to keep both sides of the game in balance: tactical and management.  Your Warband can quickly find itself out of money if you lose matches, or get your Warband members skills without a cushion.  Adding Wyrdstone shipments to the mix, and you have an adequate representation of life in Mordheim.  It may not be true to the game, but it has Mordheim's spirit down.While playing against the AI is fun, it's even better when you are playing against a human opponent... although one might be hard to come by at tmes.  You can do both with the same game, switching back and forth as your friends hop on, or playing against the computer to get that last bit of Wyrdstone in before the shipment's late (miss three and the game's over).There is one piece of advice before playing against human opponents: get used to playing against the computer first.  The game is frustrating when you start out, as you don't know the lay of the land that well.  True to its namesake, Mordheim is merciless when someone doesn't know the layout of each map as well as their opponent.  You will find yourself flanked, and a great skirmish game will find itself shelved.Manage your Troops.  Manage your Gold.  Manage your Time.  Manage your Temper.  Do all these things, and you might survive Mordheim... for a while.			"

												Mordheim is a rather challenging turn-based squad management RPG set in the Warhammer world, with unforgiving rogue-like qualities that won't be to eveyone's liking. To be quite frank, people who head in thinking Mordheim willl be akin to XCOM will probably be rather let down. This is primarliy an old Games Workshop board game brought to life with all the idiosyncracies this entails, and it therefore has far more in common with Blood Bowl than regular turn-based titles. Don't let the 3rd person gfx trick you into thinking otherwise, that's basically just a way of getting scenary and elevation changes to work (something that wasn't needed with Cyanide's Blood Bowl conversion). The Blood Bowl comparisons continue through to the front-end, which is about as user friendly as a casual headbutt. However, perseverance with the steep learning curve and the obtuse management system does start to pay off. Trying to keep a fledgling warband afloat by selling everything and fielding guys with smashed up legs only to find you've then got no spare weapons for your next raid is the kind of experience you'll either like or despise - luckily for me, it's right up my street. I tried PVP in beta and it had a lot going for it but I've just been doing campaign stuff since I fired it up aagin and I am genuinely impressed with the solo experience. The meta actually has a lot in common with Darkest Dungeon (this is a good thing, DD is wonderful). Also of note is that the Xbox pad works nicely, meaning I can get my tactical on from the armchair.Mordheim has developed nicely into a game that now offers a fairly singular experience, though undoubtably rather niche. If you're looking for a mixture of Blood Bowl and Darkest Dungeon then look no further.			"

Early Access Review
								Decent game, Crashes at times but what did you expect from Early Access?The main problem is that WHEN you crash it counts as a loss in the game and since there is no save function at all (to stop people from saving during their turn and then loading when they know what the enemy will do/loses a unit) it leads to horrible damage to all your units and sometimes you have to start all over because half your warband died in a crash and the other half lost legs and arms (which is a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to use shields or bows) and you just dont have enough money to buy a new one.If you ever need to leave in the middle of a game you are ♥♥♥♥ed since leaving is always a loss and there isnt even an ""pause this ♥♥♥♥ing battle and just let me return to this exact same point in the game when i start it again"" function.The only safe time to leave is between missions and even then im scared.Another minor problem is that all skills cost a minimum of 100 gold to train (good ones cost 250) while a new level 0 unit costs 15 and all the things you sell (basic stuff which can be found in heaps all over the place) sells for 1-10 gold.Combine this with the fact that you have to pay around 5xNumber of units you own in salary after every mission and you might never get enough gold to get skills after a while.The campaign has only two missions at the time but they are hard as balls and require you to farm and level up all your characters and units (and all farm comes in either the same strength as your warband or stronger so there is no way to just farm lvl 1 slimes over and over until you get strong) to hope to survive them.Nonetheless with the customization tool, unique turn based strategy with first person control of all your units its worth the money for the entertainment and endless campaign.11/10 would play Khorne Sorcerer protected by his Slaneeshi tank, Nurglite Archer and Tzeenchian barbarian again.

												Update - I'm having more fun then before.  I've found more bugs and the story missions can be confusing sometimes.  But, the epic feel of survival is great.  I'm not one to complain that I miss a 95% roll.  I don't believe that game is broke or cheats, I believe I just had a bad roll.  I also hit the other day when I had a 7% chance on a shot.  It is random and it happens, but games like this are built that way.  I don't want to know exactly what is going to happen every sword swing that would be pretty dumb.  The injuries don't bother me.  I don't ever deploy my own troops, I always let the computer deploy them for me.  I like the difficulty.  I have a Human Merc warband and we've struggled and also dominated.  Nothing better then getting smacked around, scrapping together after the fight and going out and deciminating your enemy next time.  Yes you can do that.  This game is simply fantastic.  There are minor issues here and there and some odd graphic glitches.  But, overall the game requires thought and planning.  But, I think it captures the warhammer world very well and handles the mechanics of the boardgame.I wish it had multiplayer servers and warbands were stored online for online play.  Some kind of ladder or online campaign would be great as well.I would buy additional warbands as DLC.  I would also pay for multiplayer.  It is a great merc sim and really has been the kind of game I've been waiting for. Well done, Well done indeed.  9.0 out of 10.  Would like multiplayer ladders, servers, clans etc...  Also multiplayer campaigns.  I hope this is game is a hit and they look at funding or kickstarting some of those features.  We also need more custom options for faces.  All my guys look the same and that is annoying.  Make it so people can mod.			"

												Its kind of hard to properly mark this one since its yes or no. I'm giving it a slight yes in regards that it can be pretty fun when things are going properly. RNG is wickedly against you in this game as it is with most tactical combat games. You will miss quite often on 80% chance to hit moves and even on 95% in the same vein as XCOM would make you miss with a shotgun at point blank range. The game is unrelenting in its difficulty giving you no way to save and the fact that the AI will land impossible hits for incredible damage and when surrounded somehow rarely if ever break and run. You will feel scared to death nearly every battle of one of your men going down in battle because that mutant you've been leveling up since the start with all the shiny upgrades in gear can suddenly be dead because a gutter rat got lucky.Strangely enough this turns out to be fun if not frustrating as all hell. Battles are always tense especially when you really need that wyrdstone to keep your boss from kicking you to the curb and ending your campaign and a severe wound can put your best soldiers out of the fight leaving you scrambling for new recruits to piece yourself together until they recover. Missions that scatter your warband across the entire map can really suck when you got one guy on his own and he gets ambushed by the entire enemy team leaving you to desperately run for your life to try to save your poor doomed soldier. The main complaint I have is the loot and objectives. Many objectives require you to loot a certain amount of wyrdstone and you need to finish these or you lose out on bonus items which can save your life. Only problem is as soon as you break their warband the mission ends and you gather only a small chunk of whats on the map. I will gaurantee you that you will only finish maybe 1 out of 5 bonus objectives every mission until you have a godlike meatshield to hold the enemy while you go loot. Because they will always find you and then die and end your mission screwing you out of the objective nearly every freaking time. And the fact that you can't spend maybe 2-3 turns after they have retreated looting makes this game have a fake difficulty that is far more frustrating than fun.So..I could only recommend this if its on sale. If not, until the needless frustration of wasted time trying to finish objectives and huge amounts of lost loot due to the suicidal AI bumrushing to your location no matter where you are its not worth full price. A very hesitant recommendation to anyone who enjoys unrelenting difficulty and cussing at their screen.			"

There is a very good reason why people put so many hours in, it is a very hard game to stop playing and in a good way. Since multiplayer games have spoiled me with the competition of playing against live players I've had trouble enjoying single player games as much as I used to, but that thought doesn't even register when i play this game.

								Seriously, the developers are cramming out so many bug fixes and improvements on a regular basis that I'm amazed. It feels as though every week there's a new update fixing several bugs and improving the UI, adding new features that improve the experience, or simply add new content. The gameplay is solid so far and I'm eagerly awaiting the ability to play Multiplayer matches with injuries, xp & loot.UPDATE: Booted the game after having a hiatus of roughly one year. Game is still enjoyably challenging and mistakes are punishing so it's not for impatient or careless people. After you figure out strategies it gets kind of easy due to how you can exploit the weaknesses of the AI but multiplayer can solve that if you have friends to play with. Haven't looked for any random skirmishes so I wouldn't know if there's any community or not.			"

								Wow has this game really blossomed into something amazing. If you hadn't tried this since its original inception over a year ago or less than I would definitely give it another go-round. So much has been added and changed and best of all the campaign with progression is in place. Leveling up your warband and outfitting them, customizing them, and making sure they don't die or get maimed in the course of battle is where it's at! Only thing left I can't wait for the multiplayer permanence and progression. At that point I think it will be personal...GAME ON!			"

								Just writing this as a fan/player of the old boardgame and of this early access. I've been in the EA for almost a year now. To start out it was very bare bones and glitchy, kinda what I expected. The constant updates are perfect. They iron out all the problems that I've noted/reported. The game looks great (graphically it's not the best, not the worst) thematically. They nailed the atmosphere of the boardgame/lore! Now with the addition of the continous campaign/warband!? This is the game I've been dying for!!! I absolutely love the advancement and the customization options. Not to mention the fact that I can take my exhisting band and throw it online against another person and keep all the loot/xp for my single player campaign (and vise versa) not to mention the possibility of losing one of my leaders/followers for good! It's the perfect platform for the RPG and TBS fan!I'm really enjoying this game now, and with the addition of the campaign I recommend it to anyone whos a fan of tactical turn based and roleplaying games!!! Can't wait to see where they'll go next!			"

Early Access Review
								To properly review this game I think it's worth that I explain  a situation that occurred in one of my latest games as Sisters of Sigmar. My warband was battered during a story mission and I was certain I would lose the battle and pay dearly with tonnes of injuries, probably ending my run as this warband. Instead the Mercenary Ogre who was about to kill the VIP I had to keep alive missed three time in a row against her whilst she was stunned. The level 0 henchman Novice I had with her managed to land a critical hit, stunning the ogre, which led to my spellcaster calling a comet down from the sky and crushing the ogre where he stood, winning the battle for me.Now, this game is a beta. Like all betas, it comes with the ""don't buy if you rage easily at faults only a game can do."" Case in point: three quarters of my game time so far has been with my Mercenary Warband. I go into their fourth story mission and the games bugs out, the enemy I was facing never ends its turn, probably a unit I cannot see moving about  endlessly trying to reach one of my guys. I was forced to abandon the mission, and all of my warband was injured. All three of my heroes died, two archers lost their arms and would have to be fired, and my leader became a simpleton. Needless to say, I wasn't too pleased.Despite this, the game is immensely fun and satisfying if you can get over its rocky starting out phase. The interface tells you nothing on the surface when in-game, requiring you to be out in warband management or to go into a seperate menu to find out what ""Righteous Fury"" actually does and why it always misses. The payment and treatment system gets in the way a bit too, you will often be forced to fire and replace henchmen and heroes to keep your warband at fighting strength. However this can often be wasteful, the game seems to force you to pay for treatment and upkeep before you can fire any warrior in the warband, which seems utterly bizarre to me.Despite these negatives, the game shines on premise alone. The way characters are controlled is similar to turn based tactics games like Valkyria Chronicles. With the RPG elements of the tabletop Warhammer Fantasy Battles game, like the original board game was intended to be based around. The amount of customisation, stat variance, spells, skills, weapons, armours and trinkets in the game at present allow you to make your warband however you desire. This makes for some great innovation as people try to find the best possible set ups for your heroes and henchmen, but due to the diverse choice of loadouts, you can very easily counter these ""metas"" of soldiers should you want to play online.Multiplayer is not why you will buy this game mind you, the game's AI is not stupid, but can be exploited once you have figured out pathing, who it will target, etc. You will often find times when your spellcaster is near to death and hide them behind a shieldwall of heroes, and the AI will sooner run the length of the map for another attempt at that spellcaster than fight into your men. Ledges and cliffs are often exploitable too. Sisters of Sigmar come with no ranged weapons besides their spells, and the AI will refuse to use shortcuts like climbing and leaping, this results in very easy missions that are labelled ""brutal"" just because you stacked 5 archers on a cliff and put your captain and hero with a high parry chance in the way of the stairs up, leading to a Turkey shoot for your men.Overall, I would say this game has btrought me hours of fun already. I've been frustrated with how the game can♥♥♥♥♥♥you over sometimes, but that's just how these games go. XCOM fans who enjoy the iron man difficulties will find a passioniate love for this game. As it takes XCOM's ""lose a man and that's it"" style of gameplay and turns it up to eleven, with a whole host of mental and physical injuries that can steal your level 7 Champion from you in the blink of an eye. Needless to say, I do love this game.			"

												Very promising and reminds a lot of the old cult classic tabletop game. So far only 2 warbands, Skaven and human mercenaries, but they will add a lot more over time. Mechanics are fun, graphics and sounds are good. Overall a fun turnbased experience with a very interesting new take on action points, and how they work.Update: With the full release here and 4 warbands instead of two. They added Sisters of Sigmar, a hard-hitting band of religious nutcases Warhammer style as well as adding Cult of the Possessed, which is a Chaos warband, with all that that brings. Mutations, weird way of thinking and just plain barbarism.With over 100 hours logged, I have this to say: The game is very unforgiving, and at times extremely frustrating. Very long load times, which seems to be something the company can't fix because of how the game is built. it has a built in anti-rage quitter system, meaning if you quit during any mission or skirmish, it treats it as if the warband got routed and EVERY SINGLE WARRIOR in the fight will have to roll on the injury table to see if they suffer any injury or lose any equipment. This is very harsh, especially for single player where you don't really hurt anyone by abandoning a mission that goes really, really bad (considering the loss of one skilled warrior can set you back around 10 hours of game time). it doesn't help the AI is dumb as bricks, and pathfinding for large units really is an issue. More than once, I see them stuck by a door and just can't move.Still, even with its flaws this game is very addictive and I stand by my early access opinion, the game is great.2nd and last update: Loading times has been fixed, it now loads very fast. Gone from over a minute of loading time to around 15-20 seconds. (I use a SSD).They've added 2 new Warbands: The Witch Hunters, a warband of Witch Hunters (think the psychos from the witch hunts in Europes history) and their cohors: religious nutcases (Flagellants and Zealots). Their impressive unit is a very large human with the suiting profession of executioner. He likes to set his enemies on fire. While they're alive.The second new is Undead, set to be released tomorrow as I write this (the 25th of october 2016). I can't wait. Vampires. Zombies. Dregs. Necromancers. Crypt horros. Oh my.			"

												Awesome. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. One, for example, complains about not getting to take scavenged and looted items back when the warband member carrying them falls in battle. Suffice it to say, there is a strategic, practical, no-cheat way to minimize that kind of loss. It's just a bit more risky and time-consuming. *HINT*: It involves the team carriage. ; ) Otherwise, just preferences holding their sway, I guess.Top-notch TBS action, with nice visuals, good storyline, and great concepts fleshed-out in an interesting, dark world.

												This game is probably the most hardcore experience you can get if you are a Warhammer - Mordheim fan, as punishing as should be, withouth casualisation that is so common nowadays, you will get your chars crippled temporally or forever, you will get them killed, you will feel the pressure of the task of getting Wyrdstone and gold, heck, if you are new in this kind of games you will get wiped in the first escenario, also is one of the few modern games were you really need to check the tutorial.Pros+Challenging and complex gameplay+Skaven models are sweet+Graphics are good for an ""indie"" title+It gets the Mordheim/Warhammer atmosphere right+Gritty+I really like the musicCons-Lack of customization of your warband-Some models looks ""ugly""-Not as much music variety-It needs more blood and goreIf you liked Valkyria Chronicles, Xcom or any turnbased strategic game don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a truly good game.

												Mordheim, a game I have been playing on and off since early access, is a nice game turn based tactical game - resembling x-com, bloodbowl and other games where you have movement points and fighting points. You will get to know the characters of your warband, develop them and style them. But futher no real stretegic support of your party. You can insert character history and slighty modify their looks. I always like building up. However... the game is also quite merciless. My brave band of imperial mercenaries is led by a one-legged captain, assisted by a one-legged hero; covered by a archer with a permanent open wound; I have to admit. In other games I might have saved my sacred band of brave warriors and my twin-sister smugglers quite often and would have reloaded the missions time and time again to cheat my way out of the leg-losing and thus would have prevented the limitation of the range and actions of my beloved Captain Kenrick and his sidekick the couragrous hero Havok Sparrenschild. I would have re-loaded to avoid the loss of fighting points for my carefully contructed 6th level sharpshooter 'Lars Genade'. But alas. The loss is forever and final.... So much better this paralympic approach to find the green magical shards that are scattered throughout the city. Ofcourse you have to like the warhammer world to like the game, which is sometime a bit repetitious (but I didn't mind). If you can't stand skaven and ogres... don't buy this game. But if you feel like rampaging with blunderbusses and warhammers through a rotten, deserted, corrupted and decaying city (the artwork is quite nice): it is worth buying. Just be aware that you have to seperately buy the DLC.  That might be the true curse of Sigmar's comet.			"

 Mordheim: City of the Damned is an infuriating, venom-dripping, and chaotic experience. However, it is an altogether pleasant experience and game. Mordheim: CotD is a turn-based video game adapation of the tabletop Mordheim game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, where the goal is to survive a hellish landscape in order to gather a rare, and dangerous, material known as Wyrdstone, known for its chaotic influence and ability to enhance magic. Being set in the more turbulent era of Warhammer Fantasy history, there is an abundance of weapons to use that are unique, magic with consequences, strict limitations and possible firing zones with ranged weapons (of which there are bows and firearms), and mythical races of characters. While this game does not have all of the races from the older Mordheim, the four chosen are very different and give a very accurate (read: grimdark) feel for the setting. The four races in CotD are the Empire Mercenaries, Skaven, Cult of the Possessed, and the Sisters of Sigmar. These races are divided into Warbands, consisting of (as time goes on) one Leader unit, up to three Hero units, one Impressive unit, and five Henchmen units. Following will be a generalization of each race, their purpose, and then a general playstyle (though this game is nearly limitless with how you create your Warband, and how you play them, especially with injuries being added into the mix). Spoilers will be placed for storyline, although only very vague information is given.The Empire Mercenaries are a warband of human mercenaries from the proud coalition of human factions. The Empire Mercenaries are part of the Order alignment, implying good intentions and care for the world.The mercenaries are sent to gather Wyrdstone for their employer. They do not care about his reasons.Mercenaries generally rely on tankier melee units and higher damage ranged units. Amazing in a team, this warband has issues if separated, for a ranged character is helpless if ambushed in melee, and will die from a few hits, while a melee character lacks the damage to best his opponent, leaving them locked in combat for several turns.The Skaven are a race of greedy and cruel humanoid rat-men, particularly from Clan Eshin, a clan of assassins.The Skaven are part of the Chaos alignment, working for selfish intentions and care little for anybody but themselves.The Skaven warband is attempting to gather Wyrdstone, which they call Warpstone, in order to increase personal prestige among the ranks of the influential Murderlord.The Skaven are low health with high Initiative (order of who goes first per turn) and high damage. They generally rely on quickly swarming an enemy (one of their racial skills, appropriately named Swarm, gives bonuses for every Skaven attacking the same unit) and wiping them out one or two at a time. Lacking any tanks until they get their Impressive rank warrior, they rely on Dodging and Parrying even more than the other races. The Cult of the Possessed are a faction of mutants and chaos warriors with no regard for life at all.The Cult is a Chaos-aligned faction, willing to murder and betray, and even mutate their own bodies, for more power.The Cult is attempting to obtain greater and greater power from an entity known as the Shadowlord, in exchange for Wyrdstone.The Cult is generally a more melee oriented unit, though they have a Magician as their Leader, and rely on overwhelming power to kill their foes. Lots of buffs, decent health, and high damage make them a force to be reckoned with, especially in the scarily narrow streets of Mordheim.The Sisters of Sigmar are a zealous group of religious fanatics, similar to Paladins from other games.The SoS are aligned with Order, hoping to combat evil and to spread the message of their god through face-smashing.The SoS are attempting to gather all of the Wyrdstone simply so that it cannot fall into the hands of evil.The SoS generally rely on powerful and high health units to completely destroy their enemies in combat. However they are slow, and have a very difficult time dealing with multi-level attacks.Mordheim is a very dangerous place often causing injuries to your Warband ranging from a simple experience loss, to amputation, and death. The game is very unforgiving, and you may make two or three Warbands, having them be crippled and ruined one after the other, until something finally clicks and you surge ahead, destroying your opposition and doing SO good until your main warrior loses an arm, and can no longer use that bow/halberd/shield that you relied on, and you scream into the night, causing dogs to bark, and you fume and pace around your room trying to decide if you should get a new Leader, make a new Warband, or accept the 20% dodge increase from losing an arm, and you just keep rambling and crying and pout... sorry, that hit a little close to home. As a game of incredibly high risk though, the RNG is downright out to get you, and you will often miss attacks you had an 85% chance to hit. Twice. This may seem unfair, however it is more accurately tied to the tabletop game where you'd roll upwards of five die per attack. Yet, even with an AI you swear is cheating, your best warrior being taken down by a stupid ambush that you totally weren't in range of, and RNG causing you to lose your best tank because he missed a 97% parry chance, victory is insanely addicting. Mordheim: CotD, despite being brutal and unfair, is one of the few games I've played in a long time that really made my victories feel hard-fought and well-earned. I'm addicted to finding out what I could do, and could have done, better. 8/10TL;DR: Hard game, lots of customization, game literally hates you, you may want to amputate your own limbs (I mean, hey, 20% bonus dodge chance!). Awesome.			"

												Update - I'm having more fun then before.  I've found more bugs and the story missions can be confusing sometimes.  But, the epic feel of survival is great.  I'm not one to complain that I miss a 95% roll.  I don't believe that game is broke or cheats, I believe I just had a bad roll.  I also hit the other day when I had a 7% chance on a shot.  It is random and it happens, but games like this are built that way.  I don't want to know exactly what is going to happen every sword swing that would be pretty dumb.  The injuries don't bother me.  I don't ever deploy my own troops, I always let the computer deploy them for me.  I like the difficulty.  I have a Human Merc warband and we've struggled and also dominated.  Nothing better then getting smacked around, scrapping together after the fight and going out and deciminating your enemy next time.  Yes you can do that.  This game is simply fantastic.  There are minor issues here and there and some odd graphic glitches.  But, overall the game requires thought and planning.  But, I think it captures the warhammer world very well and handles the mechanics of the boardgame.I wish it had multiplayer servers and warbands were stored online for online play.  Some kind of ladder or online campaign would be great as well.I would buy additional warbands as DLC.  I would also pay for multiplayer.  It is a great merc sim and really has been the kind of game I've been waiting for. Well done, Well done indeed.  9.0 out of 10.  Would like multiplayer ladders, servers, clans etc...  Also multiplayer campaigns.  I hope this is game is a hit and they look at funding or kickstarting some of those features.  We also need more custom options for faces.  All my guys look the same and that is annoying.  Make it so people can mod.			"

												Awesome. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. One, for example, complains about not getting to take scavenged and looted items back when the warband member carrying them falls in battle. Suffice it to say, there is a strategic, practical, no-cheat way to minimize that kind of loss. It's just a bit more risky and time-consuming. *HINT*: It involves the team carriage. ; ) Otherwise, just preferences holding their sway, I guess.Top-notch TBS action, with nice visuals, good storyline, and great concepts fleshed-out in an interesting, dark world.

												This game is probably the most hardcore experience you can get if you are a Warhammer - Mordheim fan, as punishing as should be, withouth casualisation that is so common nowadays, you will get your chars crippled temporally or forever, you will get them killed, you will feel the pressure of the task of getting Wyrdstone and gold, heck, if you are new in this kind of games you will get wiped in the first escenario, also is one of the few modern games were you really need to check the tutorial.Pros+Challenging and complex gameplay+Skaven models are sweet+Graphics are good for an ""indie"" title+It gets the Mordheim/Warhammer atmosphere right+Gritty+I really like the musicCons-Lack of customization of your warband-Some models looks ""ugly""-Not as much music variety-It needs more blood and goreIf you liked Valkyria Chronicles, Xcom or any turnbased strategic game don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a truly good game.

								Just writing this as a fan/player of the old boardgame and of this early access. I've been in the EA for almost a year now. To start out it was very bare bones and glitchy, kinda what I expected. The constant updates are perfect. They iron out all the problems that I've noted/reported. The game looks great (graphically it's not the best, not the worst) thematically. They nailed the atmosphere of the boardgame/lore! Now with the addition of the continous campaign/warband!? This is the game I've been dying for!!! I absolutely love the advancement and the customization options. Not to mention the fact that I can take my exhisting band and throw it online against another person and keep all the loot/xp for my single player campaign (and vise versa) not to mention the possibility of losing one of my leaders/followers for good! It's the perfect platform for the RPG and TBS fan!I'm really enjoying this game now, and with the addition of the campaign I recommend it to anyone whos a fan of tactical turn based and roleplaying games!!! Can't wait to see where they'll go next!			"

												This game is fun.  Once you find the warband you like and figure what they do best, the next step is to just pound face while you level up.Leveling up is easy, training new skills is tough because gold is scarce.  I think this is OK though, in a game you need to make tough decisions...Another skill for your all star leader, or spread the love to some underlings.  The injury system is awesome too.  Some warband members just never die, despite loss of limbs.  Others die their first time out.  It's also hilarious when the enemy warband has obvious injuries.  Ironically the enemy with 1 arm is tough as nails, haha.			"

								To properly review this game I think it's worth that I explain  a situation that occurred in one of my latest games as Sisters of Sigmar. My warband was battered during a story mission and I was certain I would lose the battle and pay dearly with tonnes of injuries, probably ending my run as this warband. Instead the Mercenary Ogre who was about to kill the VIP I had to keep alive missed three time in a row against her whilst she was stunned. The level 0 henchman Novice I had with her managed to land a critical hit, stunning the ogre, which led to my spellcaster calling a comet down from the sky and crushing the ogre where he stood, winning the battle for me.Now, this game is a beta. Like all betas, it comes with the ""don't buy if you rage easily at faults only a game can do."" Case in point: three quarters of my game time so far has been with my Mercenary Warband. I go into their fourth story mission and the games bugs out, the enemy I was facing never ends its turn, probably a unit I cannot see moving about  endlessly trying to reach one of my guys. I was forced to abandon the mission, and all of my warband was injured. All three of my heroes died, two archers lost their arms and would have to be fired, and my leader became a simpleton. Needless to say, I wasn't too pleased.Despite this, the game is immensely fun and satisfying if you can get over its rocky starting out phase. The interface tells you nothing on the surface when in-game, requiring you to be out in warband management or to go into a seperate menu to find out what ""Righteous Fury"" actually does and why it always misses. The payment and treatment system gets in the way a bit too, you will often be forced to fire and replace henchmen and heroes to keep your warband at fighting strength. However this can often be wasteful, the game seems to force you to pay for treatment and upkeep before you can fire any warrior in the warband, which seems utterly bizarre to me.Despite these negatives, the game shines on premise alone. The way characters are controlled is similar to turn based tactics games like Valkyria Chronicles. With the RPG elements of the tabletop Warhammer Fantasy Battles game, like the original board game was intended to be based around. The amount of customisation, stat variance, spells, skills, weapons, armours and trinkets in the game at present allow you to make your warband however you desire. This makes for some great innovation as people try to find the best possible set ups for your heroes and henchmen, but due to the diverse choice of loadouts, you can very easily counter these ""metas"" of soldiers should you want to play online.Multiplayer is not why you will buy this game mind you, the game's AI is not stupid, but can be exploited once you have figured out pathing, who it will target, etc. You will often find times when your spellcaster is near to death and hide them behind a shieldwall of heroes, and the AI will sooner run the length of the map for another attempt at that spellcaster than fight into your men. Ledges and cliffs are often exploitable too. Sisters of Sigmar come with no ranged weapons besides their spells, and the AI will refuse to use shortcuts like climbing and leaping, this results in very easy missions that are labelled ""brutal"" just because you stacked 5 archers on a cliff and put your captain and hero with a high parry chance in the way of the stairs up, leading to a Turkey shoot for your men.Overall, I would say this game has btrought me hours of fun already. I've been frustrated with how the game can♥♥♥♥♥♥you over sometimes, but that's just how these games go. XCOM fans who enjoy the iron man difficulties will find a passioniate love for this game. As it takes XCOM's ""lose a man and that's it"" style of gameplay and turns it up to eleven, with a whole host of mental and physical injuries that can steal your level 7 Champion from you in the blink of an eye. Needless to say, I do love this game.			"

This was a failure on my side. People complaining about RNG just dont get the rules. People complaining about difficulty are not up to this kind of hardcore fun (Grow some ...).

From what I see so far though, I hope it's like breadsticks at Olive Garden... only I'll pay for them to keep making more of it.I've done only one mission and I'm lusting for endless levels, phatter loots, more races to experience it all with, and more ways to experience it. If I had perfect vision and knew exactly what I wanted I would have asked for a game very close to this.			"

Early Access Review
								Decent game, Crashes at times but what did you expect from Early Access?The main problem is that WHEN you crash it counts as a loss in the game and since there is no save function at all (to stop people from saving during their turn and then loading when they know what the enemy will do/loses a unit) it leads to horrible damage to all your units and sometimes you have to start all over because half your warband died in a crash and the other half lost legs and arms (which is a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you want to use shields or bows) and you just dont have enough money to buy a new one.If you ever need to leave in the middle of a game you are ♥♥♥♥ed since leaving is always a loss and there isnt even an ""pause this ♥♥♥♥ing battle and just let me return to this exact same point in the game when i start it again"" function.The only safe time to leave is between missions and even then im scared.Another minor problem is that all skills cost a minimum of 100 gold to train (good ones cost 250) while a new level 0 unit costs 15 and all the things you sell (basic stuff which can be found in heaps all over the place) sells for 1-10 gold.Combine this with the fact that you have to pay around 5xNumber of units you own in salary after every mission and you might never get enough gold to get skills after a while.The campaign has only two missions at the time but they are hard as balls and require you to farm and level up all your characters and units (and all farm comes in either the same strength as your warband or stronger so there is no way to just farm lvl 1 slimes over and over until you get strong) to hope to survive them.Nonetheless with the customization tool, unique turn based strategy with first person control of all your units its worth the money for the entertainment and endless campaign.11/10 would play Khorne Sorcerer protected by his Slaneeshi tank, Nurglite Archer and Tzeenchian barbarian again.

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a great game based off Games Workshop's Tabletop skirmish game.  If you're looking for a direct translation, this is not the game for you.  If you want a great tactical skirmish and management game, this should be on your wishlist.The important part is to keep both sides of the game in balance: tactical and management.  Your Warband can quickly find itself out of money if you lose matches, or get your Warband members skills without a cushion.  Adding Wyrdstone shipments to the mix, and you have an adequate representation of life in Mordheim.  It may not be true to the game, but it has Mordheim's spirit down.While playing against the AI is fun, it's even better when you are playing against a human opponent... although one might be hard to come by at tmes.  You can do both with the same game, switching back and forth as your friends hop on, or playing against the computer to get that last bit of Wyrdstone in before the shipment's late (miss three and the game's over).There is one piece of advice before playing against human opponents: get used to playing against the computer first.  The game is frustrating when you start out, as you don't know the lay of the land that well.  True to its namesake, Mordheim is merciless when someone doesn't know the layout of each map as well as their opponent.  You will find yourself flanked, and a great skirmish game will find itself shelved.Manage your Troops.  Manage your Gold.  Manage your Time.  Manage your Temper.  Do all these things, and you might survive Mordheim... for a while.			"

												Mordheim is a rather challenging turn-based squad management RPG set in the Warhammer world, with unforgiving rogue-like qualities that won't be to eveyone's liking. To be quite frank, people who head in thinking Mordheim willl be akin to XCOM will probably be rather let down. This is primarliy an old Games Workshop board game brought to life with all the idiosyncracies this entails, and it therefore has far more in common with Blood Bowl than regular turn-based titles. Don't let the 3rd person gfx trick you into thinking otherwise, that's basically just a way of getting scenary and elevation changes to work (something that wasn't needed with Cyanide's Blood Bowl conversion). The Blood Bowl comparisons continue through to the front-end, which is about as user friendly as a casual headbutt. However, perseverance with the steep learning curve and the obtuse management system does start to pay off. Trying to keep a fledgling warband afloat by selling everything and fielding guys with smashed up legs only to find you've then got no spare weapons for your next raid is the kind of experience you'll either like or despise - luckily for me, it's right up my street. I tried PVP in beta and it had a lot going for it but I've just been doing campaign stuff since I fired it up aagin and I am genuinely impressed with the solo experience. The meta actually has a lot in common with Darkest Dungeon (this is a good thing, DD is wonderful). Also of note is that the Xbox pad works nicely, meaning I can get my tactical on from the armchair.Mordheim has developed nicely into a game that now offers a fairly singular experience, though undoubtably rather niche. If you're looking for a mixture of Blood Bowl and Darkest Dungeon then look no further.			"

												Played the Free Weekend, will buy it next sale most likely,Feels Good to win, havent lost a whole Battle yet, but had some charackters die, some because i died stupid stuff, some because of a streak of bad luck. Can be a little unfair sometimes, had a charackter knocked out before i could do anything, at the start of the battle. The optional objectives are either something you want to do or not, sometimes they are done by accident but often you have to decide to do them since they arent on the way of knocking the other Warband out. Since the Enemies scale with you, it lacks a bit of reward, if you get stronger faster your opponents get stronger faster too, if you get slowly stronger they also will get slowly stronger. But overall the Game is entertaining.Pros:+Atmosphere+Sound+Customization (Active and Passive Skills)+Warhammer Fantasy+""Difficult"" if you like it (opinion based anyway)+Different Warbands (Factions) that look quite different and probably play more differently (just have played 1 Warband, but had to adjust the tactic against the other Factions)+Different every time you start againCons:-UI (scrolling through every action instead of just being able to click the one you want in Combat)-the Combat Mode feels slow, would love to be able to speed enemy movement that i cant see-sometimes makes you feel horrible for just having a streak of bad luck-			"

												This game is great, if you know what to expect and how to play. First of all, its as much strategy as it is gambling (which makes it that much better- you gonna cheer every time that sigmar-♥♥♥♥♥♥ misses your poor ratkin on 10 hp and curse when you fall climbing 2 meter wall 3 times). All you realy have to do is learn how AI works and act accordingly. Few pointers: most important thing is your survival. Do not overextend, dont go alone. Read the mission scenarios.Alwyas place your warriors by yourself. Study map, plan where you want to defend yourself, dont treat green stuff as a priority- you get some even if you dont gather it if you win. Take advantage of choke points.Rest, you must figure out by yourself. Key is the attitude. Oh and dont get used to your first warband. Treat em as an experiment. Thats it! Great gambling-strategy, only civ5 beats it for me. Get it on sale and buy globadier expansion! well worth itEdit; There are two things that i'd really like to see in that game: more character customization options, and possibility to deploy your guys from tactical view. The last one would save so much time!			"

								Unforgiving and cruel, succeeding in this game is very satisfying. The possibility of permanent death or a debilitating injury adds flavor. has occasional bugs but remember that this is not yet a finished product.			"

Early Access Review
								Although I never got to play Mordheim as a table top game I am still a massive fan of gamesworkshop in general. For an early access game I was expecting a tonne of game breaking bugs, 3 hours of playing and the only thing that came close to it was I had to restart the game because one of the AI glitched and started walking into a wall. Although I really enjoyed the game I wouldn't buy it unless you have a passion for these kinds of games at its current point in time. The only thing I dont really like is how long it takes to load, but ohh well you can't have everything.			"

												So far, this has been a good game to play. I like the dark mood and the strategic and tactical elements of play. There are a few quirks, though, such as awkward deployment of warband members at start (why not use a point and click feature?), looking for and picking up small objects on the playable maps, and struggling with assigning warband attribute points when the miniature rotation arrows are placed next to assignment arrows. But what game is perfect?This is an enjoyable game if you are a fan of challenging turn-based strategy games.			"

												Hi Mordheimers and filthy skaven folks like me.First of all, an advice: This game goes the oppositte of anything i´ve tried, so, don´t think what nice tactic you would use, think ""¿WHAT IS THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN?""... and then plan a tactic for that... :)Seriously, as a big old-school-hardcore-tabletop-player i think this game is worth playing, because of its difficulty, and its rawness. You can loot other players and even die without doing anything wrong? Prepare for banging your head against the monitor, because it would happen...At first, i thought that this game could be much better with an isometric view of xcom and the literal translation from the tabletop like bloodbowl... but I think that Rogue didn´t go for the easy, and they did a very good game.Still a few issues, but this is truly addictive and the developers made a huge leap since early access.You want to see your hands shaking? Praying to gods you don´t believe? Saying ""please miss"" involuntarily? And then cheering all by yourself shouting ""Yes, yes, ♥♥♥♥ you Sigmar scum!""? Well... this is your game then...			"

Early Access Review
								Lots of potential, but I can't reccomend a game based on potential only. Right now you can test the game with preset warbands but there is no campaign and no form of progression whatsoever. Progression is also not slated for the next major update. I'll pick this up again in a few patches when it's a bit more polished. The game currently is quite stable though I find the system of scrolling through abilities one at a time archaic, they should be hotkeyed 1-10 and placed on the bottom the the screen IMO. The map needs a zoom/scroll feature. Right now it is very hard to tell what's where on the map. A legend would also be nice. This game is still fairly early in development and as such I cannot currently reccomend it.			"

								This game is just pure strategic, and a lot of fun.. and it's still just  a Early access.There is a lot of awesome aspect to talk of, but what we need, is still improvement so it can be a better game and just kick♥♥♥♥♥later :)First of : It could be great later to add different level of difficulty for AI. Go throught beginner to challenging game, for the one who prefer solo games rather than playing against someone else.Also, sometimes the action camera get in the scenery and glitch (like through the wall), and that make me easy to spot ennemy I havn't spot yet. Also, when I attack, sometimes I don't see the attack itself because the camera show me the wall instead of the attack. I'm sure it can be fix.Also, I don't know if it's me, but add some customisation option, like sensitivity of the mouse and other. I like lower sensitivity and it was hard to play with a higher mouse sensitivity. I might skiped it in the option, but it could be a great idea to add that aswell :3 Thats all, but really great game, I highly recommand it!!			"

												More frustrating than fun. Wanted to like it like many others, and their are elements I do love, but it leaves a bad taste after a few failed warbands get slaughtered by unholy bad luck. At least in other difficult games there is a feeling that when you lose it's becuase YOU failed, not becuase you got a streak of bad RNG or unlucky placement. Also, getting better at the game is not fun, and the time and effort into getting more experienced feels not at all worth it (at least to me anyway.) Those that like, or don't mind, a more punishing tactical game with gambling elements may find more to love.			"

												I've had great moments in this game, even though at the time of writing this review, the game is far from complete. But I can see myself playing this game, until it is complete and allows me to manage my troops through an evolutive process. Mordheim is a game in the spirit of the many Warhammer themed games that already exists. The World of Warhammer is a grim world where life has no value and everyone, from the greatest hero to the lowest of the low, can die in an instant. It shall be the same with your troops. They will get hurt, light and grave, they will die. You will loose your Champions, but if you play your cards right, you will prevail ... at least that's how I hope the game will shape up to be ... like its tabletop equivalent, up there with tabletop Bloodbowl !Edit: I have now come back to Mordheim: City of the Damned after its launch. This is the game I expected so this review remains positive ! I'll give you my pros and cons:PROS:- Turned based epic fights- Character progression coupled with injury/death system that can be ruthless if you really are unlucky (your favorite hero/leader might die or have permanent injuries each time they are put out of action ... of they might get lucky and miraculously recover) ... don't put all your eggs in the same basket and you might want to wait until your characters are better equipped before training them for this 200 gold skill ...- The maps are fun. There's a lot of terrain to cover and you'd best remember to manage movements tactically.- Warband progression is, overall, very slow but I consider this a pro since it rewards long term planning and strategy. Bad luck can really mess with your plans ... but we accept that as one of the reasons we play such a game in the first place.CONS:- Long loading times. I understand the scale of the map and that warband generation is a complicated process but ... I can't imagine people at minimum requirements not ending up losing patience.- Random numbers generation (dice rolls) is weird. This game gives us percentages but I feel like it rolls d4s in its tests. It's come to the point where I started rolling dice as I made my throws for a couple games, to compare and I wish I could play with dice ... they never gave me 6 misses in a row twice in a game on 84% chances to hit, my dice respect statistics a lot more than the game seems to be doing. I mention this only because I'm usually very good at risk assesment in such games but I'm now almost convinced I have to threat a 75% chance of success more like a 40% chance of success when taking decisions. Is that only me ?- The user interface and user experience could easily be vastly improved. Menus could be arranged differently so that there's no counter intuitive stuff such as a list of incoming events in the Mission Selection screen (there could be a ""general information"" menu for that and other informations spread around different menus). The ""Warband management"" menu where you pay for treatments and characters upkeep is a button just like other buttons. It could have its own menu or be a bit more evident, since it opens a menu which is different from the menus opened by other similar buttons in the same page. I'm sorry that I didn't bother suggesting that before the game was released.- A lot of randomness which you cannot influence. For example, sellswords and shop inventories. I don't dislike the current system, I just wish there was a way for me to have a way to influence those. At times, my progress was slowed or my warband subefficient simply because I couldn't find anything good in the shop or because available sellswords didn't fit what I needed (when I could afford them, sometimes I had kickass sellsword worth 40 gold !!! Other times, I have over priced leaders who really aren't worth the price they ask ...)- Hard to navigate the map, to gain knowledge about it to better strategize. Sometimes I wish I could get out of my characters' perspective to inspect something he can clearly see even if the range was limited (it would have to be). I always have so much trouble finding building entrances ...- I wish there were more different warbands to chose from. DLC !Overall, this is the game I hoped for with longer loading times. It is a challenging game, but also a rewarding game. Don't get frustrated at your losses, learn from them ... and if you lose again tell yourself you can't win them all. Bury your warband, remember them and start a new one.Good hunting amongst the damned !			"

												Very difficult right from the beginning. Slow turns while you sit and wait for the AI to move. Deployment in the game view rather than in birds-eye. Help boxes you can't turn off. The graphics are nice though, but it's a shame there is 0 variety on character models. This game still feels very unpolished to me.

												This game proved to be far more fun than I originally thought it would be.  I had gotten this as part of the HB Monthly and decided to go ahead and try it out because there was really no point in not doing so.  What I found was a rather impressive take on turn-based strategy that was wholly unexpected.While the game seems simple at first, the tutorials leave much to be desired and make things a bit more difficult than they have to be as a result.  The tutorials never really tell you how to loot or pick up items, though I was able to figure it out once I completed one of the tutorials.  The learning curve is a bit steep, since this game does things very differently from other strategy games I've played.What's Different?First of all, you get to customize a faction all your own.  While you choose the starting race and type of characters you'll play, everything beyond this is pretty much up to how you want to go about things.  You'll start with a small team of 4 characters:  your leader, a hero, and a couple of henchmen, and go out into the ruined city of Mordheim for loot and wyrdstones.  While the customization isn't great, there's enough there that you shouldn't get bored with setting your characters up.Character movement and actions are handled with a variety of points.  This allows you a bit more freedom with how you can take your turns, but means you have to strategize a bit more.  Henchmen are pretty weak and you don't really want them to rush forward and get slaughtered by a potentially powerful enemy you were unaware of.Characters can receive lasting/permanent injuries over the course of the game.  Fortunately, this is fairly balanced and doesn't happen too frequently, but when it does, look out.  You may need to retire that character and recruit someone to take their place.  Some injuries are minor and others can be outright crippling, so make sure you pay attention to the details; they are important in this one.Unlike many strategy games, it isn't necessary to take out all of the enemy to win.  Each mission has a variety of means that you can win, typically, such as routing the enemy, killing a specific character, or acquiring a certain number of resources.  So far, routing the enemy has been how I've completed most missions, as your inventory space is at a premium.Pros:  Customizable faction, time is a factor on what you do between missions (such as healing and training), lots of variety of weapons and equipment to allow you to further customize your team and how you play the gameCons:  A steep learning curve, and tutorials that leave much to be desired.In Conclusion:  A fun game with a lot of nuance, if you like the idea of strategy games where you have to plan a considerable amount more than you may be used to in other games and have a lot of customization options, this is probably the game for you.  If you aren't into learning a new way of playing strategy games and want to stick to the tried and true methods of other games, you may find this one quite frustrating.			"

												I am both surprised and not surprised to find this game has mixed reviews. What's more surprising is that a lot of the negative reviews are from people familiar with the tabletop game it was adapted from.I was a big Mordheim fan in my teenage years despite not having much affection for Games Workshop's more popular products. I loved how it mixed role-playing, which I was a big fan of, and war games. It really felt like a tabletop XCOM.I hate to say that people nixing this game are playing it wrong, but they are. Your warband is not meant to be eternal. While I think it's a bit of a design hiccup to add a campaign mode, thus the illusion of progression, but the Mordheim I remember isn't about that. It's about seeing how far you can get before you run your warband into the ground. Once you've done that, you're meant to roll up the next warband.You're not meant to form any kind of bond or attachment to your individual actors. They're tools. In time, they will wear out and break. If you have the gold, you replace them with fresh tools. If you don't, you go out of business. It's that simple.And while there really isn't a lot of variety to the combat in the early stages of the game...generally it pays to bait the AI into an ambush then gang up on them before help arrives...I don't mind because that's generally how Mordheim always worked. Your individual fighters are so brittle and weak, and risking them can be very costly, combat is all about managing the risk/reward of individual engagements. It's about setting up kill zones to lure enemies into where your best assets are covered by henchmen and efficiently knocking enemies out of the fight.I only wish maps were either larger or the AI a little less aggressive so that it would be possible to grab more of the wyrdstone and treasure on the map. Unlike the tabletop game, most of your income comes from items collected during the mission rather than rewarded after the fact.In all, if you enjoy games like XCOM but want something a little more brutal that requires a bit more patience and time to learn, I wholeheartedly recommend Mordheim.

												I've thus far only played one of the factions as a warband, but I have to say I am impressed by this game. It's well thought out, the maps are solid, and I haven't found any issues to have concerns with. It is a time-sink of a game however, there's no such thing as a ""Quick round before work or bed""... but that's what their auto-save is for apparently.I'd highly recommend anyone who enjoyed the recent X-COM games to Mordheim. It plays a lot like it, except the camera is based on each individual character you're controlling, so it's more of an over-the-shoulder, fantasy based X-COM game model... if that makes sense.			"

												Ridiculously difficult.  And by difficult, I really just mean the RNG system sucks.  I think it's just a bad mechanic at this point and doesn't have a place in modern vidya.  Missing three times in a row on a 75% chance to hit is not fun.  Enemy difficulty also seems to scale very badly, and you can easily build your squad ""wrong.""  As in there's a ton of non-viable builds possible.  There's no point in that being a thing unless you're trying to actively make the game frustrating to the player and not fun.  Seems like pretty linear progression until you're just ♥♥♥♥ed and there's nothing you can do about it.Great artwork, interesting random map generator, good VO and music.  The factions are distinct and interesting despite 3/5 of them just being different groups of humans.I'm not obsessed enough with this game to ever beat it by doing a bunch of math and finding out what the system exploit strategies are.  I shouldn't have to.  Early on in a campaign it's really fun, but that enjoyment shouldn't drop off so dramatically as you progress and get further and further hindered by permanent debuffs, drained of funds and forced to take rush missions.

												As a pro gamer of rts, tactical, turn based and not that much of warhammer fan in mostly of my gaming time i say for the early access stage that this game is as campaign is added with real nice way inthe mordheim city, now it is worthy of getting it mainstream players. I have the game since the early stage and i didnt advise mainstream players to get it  back then so they  wontget bored of waiting butthistime is over, now its the time to let loose yourselves into this game which is  like xcom enemyunknown in style only Mordheim is way better, you dontget bored at all in fact it causes a lust for missions. It has many unique winning conditions and the game is unpredictable until it actually ends, crushing the oponent, epic comebacks, fight toe to toe are intheir full meaning. This game requires strategy and planning than unecessary level of micro. It has a good amount of maps and additional winning conditions adding to the main winning condition and also it will gave way more factions than those already in game it will never tire players by being a repeated action with different ""skin"". Its like reading a book which will be one of your favorite books even if you dislike literature and that book becomes a movie at cinema which wont let down your expectations. Great graphics and atmosphere combined with good gameplay. Its a kind of game you want to exist for each type of game. /NOW THE GAME IS READY ! GET IT WHEH YOU CAN !p.s. the chaos cultist models and leader look like g@1 persians better change the models.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has a lot of potential, but as a very early access title it's lacking a *lot* of content at the moment. The base combat system is easy enough to grasp (though the keyboard controls feel clunky at times) yet still hints at a lot of depth in gameplay. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with the single player campaign/warband progression. The game captures the world and atmosphere of Warhammer Fantasy quite well with good character and level models/textures. I did notice that a failed climb-down animation using a Sister parted her torso from her legs a bit and exposed the nothingness inside, but it's early access and that's only a small visual bug. The only gameplay bug I encountered was on the Temple of Sigmar map, skirmishing against AI and playing as the defender in the siege scenario. It took me a few turns to realise what was happening as I had no idea where the AI team was - they were trapped outside and didn't seem capable of getting in (which I think required climbing) so it would have been up to the defender to exit and engage the enemy. Given the newness I have no idea how good (or bad) the company is at updating and sticking to schedule etc., so can't comment on that yet. Looking forward to playing more as the updates come. The game is definitely worth keeping an eye on even if you're not interested in playing the early access (which I usually avoid, but I'm a fan of WHFB so I couldn't wait for this).			"

												A solid game, it’s hard to get going on this one but once you build up your war band it gets a little easier. This game makes you want to look after your warriors due to the perma death/injury system every decision you make counts. After 60 hours of game play I can say I would defiantly recommend this game to fans of the warhammer universe.RNG is a huge part of this game I would be lying if I said it did not matter how lucky you are, you will find times when you are about it attack an enemy and all you will be thinking is please hit! Please hit! and…… Swing and a miss! But that’s the game if you can deal with stuff like that you will have a blast.Anyone who knows what this game is about or even reads up on it should know what they are letting themselves in for it is not a friendly game, but by god once you get into it you don’t want to let go.I play Skaven it was hard going at first but I love my little warband now, you can even customize the colouring of the armour I mainly use it so I know where my hero’s and leaders are, the weapon rarity and choice leave a little bit to be desired having only 3 tiers of weapon quality. Its fine but I could think of better ways to do it. (not going to go into it in a review) the stats system works well and is easy to understand, the single player campaign is all I have played since release and I can say it works well and is very fun the campaign missions are nice and add a lot more depth into the game. The voice actor for the Skaven campaign did a great job, I have not played multiplayer since the release but I did play it during early access, it is just as fun as the single player IMO, a little harder depending on your opponent.8.5/10 from me for this game.

												I was on the fence, wether to recommend this game or not. Something between Walkyria Chronicles and XCOM, in a dark fantasy setting. If you love the setting, that should be a no-brainer I think. For others... I just don't know. Than again, it may be about 6/10 for me score wise,but I wouldn't just say to stay out of it.It is, in fact, a good game, but with a ton of things that irritate me.First of all, the game is hard. Which is not a bad thing in itself. First time I ran the game, did the first tutorial,fully customized my first warband and... I died almost instantly.So I read some tips in the Internet and also armed with my previous experience... I created a new warband and never lost yet. The game has an AI that you can exploit easily. In fact, just playing it slow and carefully is enough for the AI to not know how to tackle you. It promotes slow movements and usage of the choke points. Anything else is just inviting the punishment it seems (though If someone says I'm not doing it right, I won't object, maybe I didn't figure out other tactics).After that, it eventually gets repetetive. Shipments feel much more of a chore than fun, but it seems that they are the one thing that forces you to try and explore the map in search of resources.On top of all of that, the game is slow. Yes, it is a turn based game, but it is not slow because you have to think much, it is slow because you click end of turn and wat... And you wait more than you play. And you wait while it loads. It might be not fair to judge the game based on such a thing like this, but in the end - it affects the satisfaction you get from the game. Visually... There are not many models to choose from. There are plenty of color skins though, so I am on the fence here. It's ok, but it could have been much better. I think that customization and sticking to your characters with their backstories is the huge strength of the game.I see the potential in this game. It could as well turn 6 to 8 out of 10 if it is going to be worked upon. Otherwise, hard to say.			"

												THE BEST PC GAMES YOU NEVER PLAYED (AND SHOULD) REVIEW SERIESOne the best games out there if you are into turn based games and or Warhammer fantasy world setting.The average person will get about 200 hours out of this game along with the DLC already available. And you will want the DLC. With witchunters, the smuggler, and the poison globe skaven being my favorites. Even if you dont buy the DLC's they will still show up in your game as enemies. So really its all free unless you want to play them yourself.This game is unforgiving and brutal. The learning curve will have you swearing and pulling out your hair. You can not manually save and if you screw up, your warband will pay for it in crippled or dead troops. You can manually cheat and save your games, but id suggest not as you risk corrupting the save file and losing it all. If you are used to save scumming and just taking back all your mistakes, then you will be rather annoyed with this game. AT least until you learn its generally ok to take a beating and unless you totally bite it three times in a row, then you can recover from a bad round or two.Some quick hints for new players:Keep your band together, dont try to one on one fight the enemies. Choose missions where your warband all starts around your wagon.Choose early on to what defense type you will use, being either dodge or parry type and seek out skills you can learn later on that allow you to use these defenses twice in a turn.Its ok to skip a day to let your team heal from injuries or train skills. Its not the end of the world to skip a day.Story missions are impossibly hard, well so it may seem. Make sure you are ready before diving in.This game has a good selection of warbands right now, but it really could use more. And hopefully there will be more ASAP. The table top version has so many options and in comparison the PC version feels a bit lacking. But 7 like the game has now is a decent enough selection of warbands. And they all have different play styles which makes it even better. But personally i wouldn't mind 14 of them, with each main warband re-skinned in a slightly different variant.The leveling system is addicting. The loot is just varied enough to be addicting, though i wish there were more to choose from on some warbands. Some warbands use rather specialized gear and it can be hard sometimes to find upgraded versions of it from all the random drops. The wolf priest being the prime example, i have never once found an upgraded version of his enhanced weapon of ulric.All in all this game will give you your monies worth. And hopefully in the future DLCs will up the ante even more. Its a total buy and if you find this game on sale and dont buy it, THEN SLAP YOURSELF! cause youre making a huge mistake not getting it.(also available on consoles if that is your thing)			"

								Hey guys and gals this will be my second review ever.Mordheim:City of the Damned.what can i say about it? well until recently i woudl say it was a good single player skirmish game against an AI opponent...as i said Until recently.Recently there has been an update that saw to a little bug that would cause the game to go into ( cue ominous movie trailer voice )INFINITE LOADING SCREEN. this had cause many people to avoid the online portion as fear of being stuck thinking it was loading.Now with the recent update it would appear that the bug has been seen to...but then again im only going off of 1 online match so far... >.>;;As of RIGHT now there are only 2 warbands available while you can fight against 2 other in the tutorials you cannot access them as playable or contestable AI.The 2 warbands are the Humans and the RatMan race known as the Skaven.These two warbands are rather entertaining in the EA build but i do feel some of the fun in making a warband isn't there because as of right now it is premade warbands.( this is just for E/A) ( i also hope that the types of units will be expanded upon later hopefully AR (After Release) if not the ability to buy specific units ( which will Definitely be added later on in the E/A) might make for interesting play.The city of Mordheim is a Dark Fantasy Locale. When I say dark i mean DARK.  im nor one hundred percent sure if it's implemented but when i have tried to use a daylight setting in my games it still feels like night ( i think it may have to do with the everlasting storm over Mordheim ) there are some camera issues which are being adressed by the dev team. these issues, at least for me, mainly consist of the view going behind a wall and not being able to see your attacks.these are minro things that are being adressed.now you may ask then why bring them up? because i wanted to shwo you how in touch with the community this dev team is.lets get down to it then for you TL;DR peoplePros+Setting and atmosphere+ sound+ fun gameplay+ fun features to be executed at a later date+ Dev team that is in touch with the communitycons-Atmosphere can seem kind of stale ( when day and night don't appear, to me anyways, to be any different)-camera issues at current stage of E/A- E/A so not all features are availableSuggestion for youIf you wish to be part of a community that is iving feedback to the dev team and having their voices heard buy the game nowif you do not wish to have the E/A version hold off for a few months until it is farther along and purchase then..final suggestion...

												Here is a list of reasons:Please note, I do enjoy this game, but with the current price it just isn't worth it. If you really want it, wait for a sale. Please note that this game is till being updated, so in the future you could buy it, after bug fixes and the game is more nicely ironed out. (Also note that this review may quickly become outdated. The bugs and other things I complained about may have been fixed.The game can be quite glitchy, for instance, one time one of my warriors randomly fell through a floor (Which by the way should not happen) and was stuck underneath a building for the entire game. There are many other glitches as well.The game is quite unbalanced, the skaven, for instance, are very unbalanced, instead of adapting the board games way of balancing it they decided to change it. See, the skaven in the board game are very weak and dull, but they come in great numbers. In the game however, they are very strong and almost impossible to hit. They have little health, but hit stronger than the sisters of sigmar, and your lucky to hit them.Oh yeah, and the game is based entirely on chance.I also feel that some of the impressives should be stronger, specifically the Sisters of Sigmars impressive. She's pathetic. I got into a map and I saw a skaven players rat ogre. So, I charged her at it because it was exposed and there were no skaven near by. Then she missed all of her attacks, and was killed in two turns by the rat ogre with help from another skaven who ran across the entire map, because, oh right, the skaven are also incredibly fast.If you want to win multiplayer battles, just play as the skaven!Just to clarify, I like this game, but it should still be in early access. This game is just so broken and needs lots of fixes and patches. The price tag is ridiculous considering how broken this game is, if it were in early access it could be excused. But I can't let this game escape from my talons. So I will say again, FIX THE GAME. (And lower the price.)			"

												This has been masked as a 'hardcore' experience and that 'difficult is good' but that poorly considered term is so inappropriate for a game governed by dice.  It is simply issued as a means to excuse an appallingly negligent hi-lo RNG that is geared simply for that - you will fail an abundance of reasonable rolls because this lazy♥♥♥♥♥♥programming has been PR'd as hardcore.  ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ more like.Too many issues that still need fixing and I mean from the ground up, ambush, overwatch, dodge, placement etc etc (even picking up wierdstone, which is kind of currency, it auto selects to pick up the smallest quantity first, when there are more than one in your area.  COME ON!).  With a game with such a small catchment bracket, (I had never heard of this and bought it because I like the Dawn of War series) its further expansion from its original hardcore fans would require it to be successful in the combat, strategy stakes.  It fails so badly with one of the worst RNGs I think I've seen and that's after a recent RNG 'revamp'!!!3/10  and that is only because the baroque scenery and sound effects are, admittedly, very good but that's of little consolation.20.12.16  I have given this game a really good go and I'd take a refund in a heatbeat.  I wouldn't listen to any of the gaming review websites who have given this a score over 5, they either haven't played it, are drunk in the workplace or are the worst kind of chums.  This is ♥♥♥♥ing dire and is uninstalled (slap to the face).  A real shame as the underlying concept looks to be pretty good.  GW do this for a living, not sure if Rogue Fuctor can be accused of doing the same.10.02.16 Tried it again, after the recent patch and I take it all back. This game is a game of a winner. Winners who should offer a refund. I will grudgingly accept.  Seriously give me a ♥♥♥♥ing refund, you♥♥♥♥♥♥programmers.18.02.16  Tried it again, again, after apparently another rng tweak after some amateurish programming started killing saved games.  One plus before I get into it - the map has improved and although it's not for most I like the unique method (if you zoom in, you can tell the levels you are looking for for a shooting point etc).  Now, giving the opposition lesser weapons is not an rng tweak it's just lazy amateur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, built by a business that put all it's accumulative intellect into the business name.  One glaring problem from the very start is that when you fail an All Alone test,  you will run and get chopped down, when the AI fails they skip a turn.  Just so laughably♥♥♥♥♥♥  Everything I've said already about this farce holds true.  This game is dead in the water and the programmers have nobody but themselves to blame.  I've a feeling it's only going to get worse for them, silly little people. They've even brought out DLC for this s#hit.  Talk about delusions of grandeur.  Make a game people willl want to play, make sure it works, make sure it isn't a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, give it difficulty levels so that people can play at their own pace, give it saved game so people can reload instead of having to restart and give it an ironman setting (although Xcom is still too buggy for that and this is far, far worse).  Don't, DON'T♥♥♥♥♥♥on the punters' tents and tell them it's raining with this hardcore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, when you're too ♥♥♥♥ing lazy to put a decent RNG together.  If you can do the above then you may last.  If you can't - find another ♥♥♥♥ing job, one that you're actually good at and give me a ♥♥♥♥ing refund so I can get this♥♥♥♥♥♥off my library.I'm seeing a lot of flaky RNGs of late (this, the god awful Shadowrun series and Blackguards), all TBS and all being simularly criticised for just♥♥♥♥♥♥poor RNGs.  Is there a market to buy RNGs so you don't have to dev them yourself?  If so then these 'devs' really need to check what they're buying because such poor RNGs and subsequently poor games (as the RNG is the most important component of a TBS, where relevant) can kill a studio, before it's even got off the ground.That said, ♥♥♥♥-whit Home interactive have published far too many♥♥♥♥♥♥games.  One wonders if they have an agenda of publishing really♥♥♥♥♥♥games.  If so, then their business model is working out well.  Too many ♥♥♥♥-whits about.  Will have to see about this.09/09/16  OMGG.  This is how amateurish Rogue Fuctor is?  Now I know why no saves or difficulty levels were incorporated into this game.  They have no multiplayer support!!  They attempted to convert a TT game that relies on gang warfare for the streets of Mordheim, where each player's warband tries to topple the current top-dog and take turf from all-comers.  The most interesting part of the game and they're not able to actualise it.  Instead they have a farcical  mish-mash, where players grind they're warbands against a ♥♥♥♥ed AI and can use said warband to have one-off skirmishes, with no context or attachment for the players.Wow, you guys are dire.  Would still take a refund.One wonders if ♥♥♥♥-whit Home Interactive and GW are such a negligent bunch of ♥♥♥♥s that they throw their projects to the cheapest possible company, regardless of their capacity to make a competent, let alone good game.

												Call this more for a first impressions review as I played 10-15 missions.Negatives:Game needs more storyline added to it.Needs more races to fight against.Needs more race (warband) choices for players to play.Graphics or okish.Tutorial depth is very much needed as info provided lacks.More options for appearance needs to be added.Needs different style of maps included.  Feels relatively the same running between 2-3 maps.  Maps are randomized terrain settings, but still feel the same.Needs more weapon options.Could use more scenarios!Positives:Turn based.  I do like turn based games more than most other styles.Relatively easy to navigate when upgrading/building your warband.  Only takes a little bit of looking and fumbling about to figure or remember it.I do like the idea of randomized terrain, but not at the expense of less maps in which to do it on.Overall, this game should have stayed in beta until they added depth to it.  As it stands right now, there isn't much for appearance options, races, missions, storyline, and maps in which you fight on.Haven't really tried out the pvp as the visual on the game and the options that are available don't seem very appealing or varied enough to make anything unique to your warband.  So i didn't bother with it.At best, for me, it is a game I will or may play every once in a great while.  I mostly play storyline games so I can be partially biased. However, such games as Blood Bowl I do play because of the pvp aspect. Might have to try pvp out and hope the matchmaking doesn't take long.As of right now though, there just isn't enough in this game to keep and hold my interest for long with a lack of...well...everything I guess.

												I love this game when I can play it fluidly.  The level load times are what they are, and I can live with them.  However if you play more than 4 or 5 missions in a row you can end up with animation load times that are so long (1+ minutes) that rather than slit your wrists, you kill the process, which penalizes your current warband.  I was also playing with a friend, encountered a bug where the game never came out of an ambush and one of us was forced to forfeit- which penalized the 'offending' party's warband.  This should not be a full release game.Do not buy this until they get it into a state that is worthy of a full release.  As far as I'm concerned this should still be pre-release.			"

												I read a lot of negative reviews for this game but after several hours of play i can happily say that the majority of those negative reviews are just mis-informed as to the game mechanics. The RNG is not terrible as they would have you believe, it's just that you not only have to hit the target, but also they have to fail their parry of dodge (whichever stance they are in .. not both) for a successful hit to do damage. The same mechanics work in your favor as well. The game is difficult, yes. It's not a game where you can roflstomp the opposition without thought. You have to use strategy and tactics to be successful but there is a huge sense of achievement in victories and even defeats are not the end.All in all, love the game anf highly recommend it to strategy enthusiasts.

								 This game comes at the highest recommendation. I found this game back in December and was so excited that I had playable Skaven in a game for once! Yes, this game is in Early Access, so expecting this game to not have an issues or bugs is just absurd. Also, this game isn't a direct port of the table-top version which isn't a bad thing and I feel wouldn't be a very fun game to play in a video game version. The game has only been out for a few months with a lot more development ahead and I'm extremely happy to be on this journey.			"

												The computer cheats, obviously and often. Rolls are heavily weighted towards the AI, with players missing 80% hit chances 5 times in a row and the AI hitting 60% chances every single time. I particularly hate it when a single hit would finish off a surrounded enemy, but you miss with 4-5 blows because the AI cheats (then it passes its all alone test and proceeds to hammer my sisters). I have no problem with the permadeath/wounds. I love how every warband tells a story as you play (usually a grim one), but I expect a fighting chance, not this blatant cheating by the AI.			"

												A good idea with irritating execution. I appreciated the playstyle, but found it to be incredibly frustrating in the long run. Early game is incredibly punishing with your opponents being significantly better equipped and, of course, managed than your own troops. The tutorials are great for explaining things, but useless for practicing the scenarios that come up in a real mission. Nothing like having three greatsword wielding Empire troops suddenly show up and all gang up on one dude. Hilarious.If you can get through the early game frustration, it might be your thing.

												After starting and constantly re-starting campaign after campaign, using all four warbands, it's safe to say that whoever coded the RNG in this game has a hard-on for making gamers rage out. Look, I get it. Games should be difficult, they need to be, otherwise they get boring. Darkest Dungeon, another RNG game, has a very steep learning curve and it is difficult. However, this game makes DD look like a walk through a spring meadow. I've had battles where the enemy crits every hit, and can kill each of my henchmen with one roll through. Say what you want about the game already having been nerfed, but ♥♥♥♥ that. Re-code the AI so that's it's more balanced, and less unforgiving to new players. Sure, ratchet up the difficultly later on, but dont expect us to give you a positive review when you're dropping AI on us that can kill us in three turns. ♥♥♥♥ YOU DEVS.			"

												Nothing like playing for 4 to 10 hours to ruin it all like X-Com. It's just X-Com Baby - but seriously, This game is not for people who hate to lose. I myself, have both loathed and loved the crappy chance dice rolls and dark humor alone. If you Survive hell you can survive X-Com and if you can survive that, Survive this!			"

												I've played and enjoyed many challenging and difficult games in my time, but none of them come anywhere close to the butt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this game dishes out.That alone wouldn't turn me off to the game, but what makes it completely inexcusable is that no ammount of planning or caution can guard you against it outside of taking advantage of the terrible AI. It all comes down to horrible random roll streaks that the AI suspiciously doesn't suffer while still having WAY better stats... Way to take the intellegence out of game design Rogue Factor.What's so sad is there is a lot about this game I like:• deep RPG progression• loot system• unit variety• dark gothic themeProblem is none of it comes even close to making up for the unavoidable absolutely horrendous punishment you're going to take.But the bad doesn't end there:• incredibly repetitive missions. It's almost always the same ""kill or route all the enemies"".• horendous AI. Either charge in or in the case of the large units, get stuck on collision• devs' attempt to balance terrible AI: give the enemy WAY better units and stats.• way too punishing and permanently crippling to be completely dependent on randomizers. You'll find yourself missing or falling flat on your♥♥♥♥♥over and over again as if those 90% likelyhood of success ratings are just there to force failure on you despite perfectly laid battle plans.I normally enjoy a challenge when a game like Dark Souls does it right. They make difficult challenges fun and rewarding because if played perfectly, you can succeed and do well. This game however punishes you severely for failing rolls out of your control over and over again and right from the beginning. I fail to see why the developers seem to want to♥♥♥♥♥♥their customers off. Where's the fun or success in that?So as much as I wish I could recommend this as a deep and rewarding strategy game, unless you're a masochist, don't even think about buying game. Find something fun to play instead! :D			"

												I have enjoyed this game since early access so to me this game has only gotten better but i'll break it down into positive / negative things there are to look out for so you can decide on your own if you would consider the same things positive / negative.Negative:- Still has some optimization to do- There is a chance you will find an invisible wall or an invisible wall will be created because of something in the map- Has a relatively high learning curve if you have not played anything like this before which can be overwhelming and may need to be taken in more than 1 session.- Has no multiplayer unless you find a friend to set it up with or get very lucky some random person around your warbands lvl is looking for a game.- A total of 4 races -> humans, Chaos, Skaven and Sisters of sigmar is a big issue for some even though i once again am fine with this number since i don't jump between races a lot.- Most common complaint i can think of is the variation in missions (all missions are optional. Main objective is always to beat the opponents warband or make them rout before you lose or rout)    -> Wyrdstone Rush where you collect typically 45% - 60% of the wyrdstone in the map to complete the OPTIONAL      objective   -> Marked for death where you have certain targets from the other warband normally between 1 and 3 specific people you need to kill and take an insigna from   -> Crush their will where you are tasked with retrieving the opponents idol and bring it back to your own cartI completely understand why some people would consider this a too small amount of missions even though i am completely fine with them.Positive:- They have done a great job at making your warband feel like they matter giving you that classic fear of someone getting killed or sustaining a permanent injure like an arm or a leg that has been severed.- The insane number of different abilities both passive and active you can gain through the lvl up system- The ability to equip your mercenaries with different weapons and armor to suit your playstyle not to mention the rarity difference from common to epic quality- The depth they have put into the lvling. You are able to lvl up your warband, your mercenaries and give them stat ups, the different wyrdstone collecters and you can in a way lvl up the game with their veteran system.Some of these make very little difference but make a nice surprise sometimes while others will be looked at as a goal to obtain after 1 - 2 missionsSummary:I think the game has things to work on and i completely understand some of the concerns some might have but the most importent thing to me is the fact that the game runs well and provides a lot of things to do when you are not on a mission and a great tactical experience when you are in a mission. It is very easy to look at the game at first and think of it as unforgiving and very hard but once you get the hang of it the game becomes very interesting and i will absolutely recommend this game.

												Great game with some bafflingly stupid design decisions. The developers have done an admirable job imitating the feel of the classic Mordheim miniatures game. The systems work well and there's some interesting decisions to be made once your warband gets past the first couple of missions and gain a few skills. Persistent injuries, forced ironman and your main income being what you scavenge in the middle of combat makes the campaign compelling even though it's mostly random missions. If you wanted a 50-50 mix of Blood Bowl and X-COM, this is it.What pulls the game down is 3 things:- Less-than-stellar (read: bloody stupid) AI. A big no-no in a strategy game- Obscene waiting times. Maps take ages to load and if 3-4 enemies have a turn in succession you may as well tab out and watch a youtube video- Godawful 3rd person camera and WASD movement. The game is practically begging for an isometric/eye-in-the-sky view.If you can live with that, this is a solid game. Especially if you play it against people instead of the easily cheesable AI.			"

Early Access Review
								I really want to like this game but its just to unfinished at the moment, the base gameplay is decent, but there's really nothing to do unless  your freinds own the game too. Otherwise theres no one online usually and no quick match option. On the plus side the graphics are good and the characters are well designed, I love the world and lore. I will  probably come back once the game is offically released and see if theres significant improvements. I hope they can improve match making and the online player base. As well as add significant singleplayer content.			"

												Originally the Warhammer Fantasy equivalent of Necromunda, the miniatures game came out in late 1999 if I remember correctly. It is a skirmish game based on gang warfare in the ruins of the doomed city of Mordheim.All of the basic bands from the core rulebook (Human mercenaries, Skaven, Cult of the Damned and Sisters of Sigmar) are represented in the game, and the rest (Witch Hunters and Undead at this moment, more probably coming in the future) are being released gradually as DLC. The look and feel of the tabletop game are well adapted, without the inconvenience (some may not view it this way) of having to modify the miniatures when some of your warriors inevitably get mutilated or mutated by a wounds/mutation dice roll, or without having to keep an extensive array of scenery in the closet to prevent the games from becoming boring brawls.Also, the tabletop's ruleset has been well adapted, better than the original IMHO, as it allows for greater granularity and slightly reduces the luck factor from the original (and the power differences a single point in a stat could imply in the tabletop game, but I'm talking from old memories). Graphics are more than good enough for their purpose and don't have huge requirements.Regarding the gameplay, it fits the grimdark atmosphere of the source material - you hire a bunch of mercenaries to set up your band, and go fight other bands in the ruins of the city for a few fistfuls of wyrdstone, which is fantasy plutonium. Playing the full tutorial is recommended in order to understand all the nuances of the tactical part of the game and the band management part of the game, or you will probably lose hard early on. In line with the grimness (and the darkness) every time a critical strike is landed on someone, or someone is knocked out, a roll is made after the battle and there's a chance that character will end up maimed (this happens to the NPC bands too, and when you encounter them again you will be able to notice the effects of your handiwork on their bodies and minds). Some people get lucky and make a full recovery (or you can get a bunch of one-eyed guys with PTSD or mangled hands - most of the time not all at once). If your guys get knocked out, your enemy can steal their gear, and if you lose a battle you don't even get a booby prize - winner takes all. It's a hard life out there in Mordheim.If you ever wanted to reenact ""Acción Mutante"" in a ruined medieval city, play this game. And if you don't get what the hell I'm talking about, go watch ""Acción Mutante"". You'll enjoy it too.In short, buy this game. Buy it for your friends, too.			"

												My review of Mordheim: City of the DamnedI believe a rating system of 1-5 would be better than the binary yes/no Steam uses.  Overall I would rate this game somwhere near 2.5.  Since there is not, I would have to not recommend this game.The pros and cons:Pros:Immersive worldGood musicWarhammerGame-to-game advancementCons:Based mostly on randomnessShallow gameplayPoor balanceTo summarize, Mordheim is a squad-based game in which you complete missions to varying degrees of success in order to loot the remains of the city of Mordheim.  The game feels fairly tabletop-ish with most mechanics based on measures and die-rolls.  There is an advancement and permanent-ish injury system which leads to unique gameplay situations.  Overall I found all this as appealing, particularly considering this is set in the Warhammer universe.  Going game-to-game and playing for not just the moment but the next several as well in a post-apocalyptic warhammer world.Why I cannot recommend this game, however, is disappointing.  There are 6 factions available right now including DLC.  Considering the majority of missions revolve around one side retreating, these factions are not close to balanced.  The game has a definite hierarchy of concerning the difficulty of factions.  At the top, the easiest and therefore toughest factions are the Sisters of Sigmar and the Undead.  Slow but physically dominant factions.  In a rough order following those 2 are the Skaven, Human Mercenaries, Witch Hunters, and Cult of the Possessed.  Worse now, is that there are minimal differences between each of them as the game progress.All factions consist of 1 leader, 3 hero options, 1 prestige class, and 2 henchmen.  All classes have their own attributes, proficiences (which dictate gear), spells, and somewhat different skills.  Skills are mostly shared across all classes and are based on statistics.  Attributes are capped based on class but not that significantly.  Spells are the most significant difference between classes as either you have access to Divine or Arcane or neither.  The combination of these 4 facets differentiate classes.  This means that through advancement most classes can match others.  I find this rather undesirable as a caster can be as proficient physically as most melee classes.  This lends itself to the Sisters and Cult being rather better in the longer-game.  I have the Cult lower mostly because they start as the whipping boys that you are glad to see as your opponent early in campaigns.  Not to mention the fact that the devs somehow thought that giving the Sisters a normal-sized prestige class was somehow balanced.I bought the game on significant sale which made it mostly worth.  Hopefully further content will be released which expands upon variety.  I wouldn't spend more than $20 on it as it currently stands.  I feel most people looking for a challenge will end up at the same point I am at.  The game is either too easy or unskillfully difficult which leads to boredom.   "

												This game could have been great but they have made it too hard. I've had several runs at this game with different races, I got as far as the first 1-1 mission, gathered the barrels, killed the boss, only had two barrels left to place and mission done. (which took me a while to do) Well every turn it spawns more random enemies, so one of my warriors dies and oh team routes... no save point to load, can't do a quicksave, can't even load the mission from the start and try again. My warriors all in the medbay, no more money to hire more. TOTALLY ruins an otherwise interesting game. Why not give people the option to go hard or normal or easy mode? Many games do that but no, the ego trip players with big mouths and no lives who want to have a rediculously hard challenge (more because of badluck than skill) and spend all day experiencing what amounts to one hours worth of content. Some people don't find hours worth of gaming time, thrown away because of rediculous gameplay mechanics, fun. I bought this game a while ago, have kept waiting for improvements etc but instead of doing that they are now releasing dlc too?If you want to make a game only for 10% of gamers who don't mind wasting huge amounts of time doing the same thing over and over until they eventually get ""lucky"", then you are basically annihilating your potential profit, and for what? So that ego tripping hardcore gamers can feel like they have a game noone else can play?edit - ok so ive been cheating and copying the save game file to a folder, and then restoring if i get screwed over. its making me able to actually play and at least see the content i paid for. its still super annoying when insta death from divine wrath just trying to cast a mini comet... ive only been saving inbetween missions but might start saving it before every damn magic spell i try to cast... i really do like the mechanics behind this game, so original and it is a bit of fun. then you die from some dumb thing and ugh ruins the whole fun experience :P. why dont they have an easy/normal/hard/nightmare options its just silly. people should be able to play a game at the difficulty level they want imo. (without getting winge at for not playing a game ""properly"" by the ""hardcores"" with more ego than life.)			"

												This game has been in a number of states over its development but at the moment is still poor in many of the base mechanics and now is unbalanced. I've played a fair amount of tabletop and this is nothing like it, a brave move but one that i think didn't pay off. In tabletop you fight the battles and then afterwards did the exploration phse for wyrdstone. The game combines the two, this sucks as 1. the exploration phase was one of the best parts of mordheim and 2. It feels every time you go looking for wyrdstone you run in to someone else's warband making it feel like there's a warband in every house, not a deserted city. The mechanics have a lot of problems as well. First of all guessing measurements, AI getting stuck on doors and a number of other problems with the janky movement suggest to me at least a rough grid system would've helped massively. The map design doesn't help one bit with plenty of bits for the AI to derp around on and design that can leave each warband just wandering around collecting bits for several turns with no reason to fight and slowing down a system that drags on anyway. The recent addition of undead and witch hunters have unbalanced the game significantly. WH are fine but the undead are massivley unbalanced (dregs were designed in tabletop to help exploration and not much else where as here they're equvilent of merc champions) Zombies have a ridiculously high initiative and the same pace as regular humans. The vampires themselves could do with a buff however as again they only really have the same stats as a human captain, a bit disappointing for whats supposed to be a supernatural killing machine. Overall I as a long time fan of Mordheim am very disappointed with this game and while its fun for a while frustration at the issues sets in. I'm still hopefull they might iron this out and it has come a long way from the early days but all in all still not a good game quite yet			"

												Its game breaking-ly frustrating. I have just failed a mission, keep in mind that when a mission is ‘deadly’ it is un-winnable, which has left me with no leader. I didn’t earn any coins so I can’t pay my war band. I don’t have enough coin to purchase another leader therefore I can’t play any more missions. Therefore all the 9.6 hours ive put in is now in vain as I cant progress any further.On a plus note, I haven’t experienced any frustrations with the RNG.I couldn’t recommend this to anybody because it really feels like you are playing a game that has no real objective, the character customisation is fairly pants to be honest, there are also only a handful of weapons. How many different pieces of armour would you expect in an RPG with ‘deep character customisation’? I would say at least 20, perhaps more? In Mordheim there are 2, light armour and heavy armour. If you want your war band members to look different then I would look for another game, the customisation is sooo limited that each member will look almost the same. "

												Well done game.  It appears lovingly created to capture the atmosphere and feeling of tabletop Mordheim while making reasonable changes for PC gameplay.  The balance between being cautious to keep important characters alive, capturing warpstone, and moving in for daring kills is a wonderful experience - much like tabletop.  The skill options are quite varied and I've now had about a hundred hours of fun just playing through one campaign carefully all the way to the end.  Despite the unforgiving nature of hardcore mode, I found the game balance to be quite good.  On my first playthrough I was able to complete the campaign, so don't be scared off, though I did have a few years of tabletop Mordheim experience under my belt and I do regularly play other strategic turn-based games like X-Com 2 and the like.  In all, what makes this memorable is its flavor.  In a world where Age of Sigmar now dominates Warhammer Fantasy tabletop, and the PC experience either provides the harried pace of FPS titles or immersive rpg titles, this occupies a special niche full of loving attention to traditional Mordheim flavor.

Posted: January 2
												While I wanted to like this game, I cannot help but feel there are some serious underlying issues under the hood.First off, I would say I am a big fan of games that are difficult. I enjoy a challenge and don't mind if the AI has a leg up on me to compensate. However, unlike X-com or even Darkest Dungeon, this game fundamentally seems to think that introducing arbitrary hardness to every encounter while offering the player very little choice in how to face it is somehow the same as providing a genuine challenge. First off, there is very little in the way of tactical decision making available to the player once they get on the ground. Despite the AI often having an advantage in unit power, it is usually easy to cheese by bottlenecking a corridor or just massing your units into a single large group that roams the map and turns each battle into a tedious chore of mopping up the stragglers. Given the AI's advantages, what this means is that hoarding your units into a massive group and slowly roaming often guarantees you a victory, while one-on-one fights are usually losses for you (assuming you are fighting with equal units). In theory you are supposed to treat each match as a scramble towards gathering wyrdstones to support the upkeep of your warband, yet you can usually grab enough in your slow trot across the map from the enemy corpses that grab them first. There is simply very little incentive to seperate your units. As such, each match feels tedious and very much like the last.That said, there is the rare time where the AI may still manage to get the drop on you, and this is entirely due to the aforementioned arbitrary hardness. Like X-COM, you are given a percentage to hit chance that usually seems to border anywhere from 60% to 90%, yet I assure you that you will never hit this much, especially not starting out. Whether it is true that the RNG is genuinely, deliberately stacked against you or not is unknown to me, but I can see why so many people feel that it is.  This persists in to the later stages of the game (I have more playtime than steam is showing) and continues to enforce the notion that the game is deliberately making itself mechanically biased against the player to make up for its shortcomings in AI. Gradually your units do manage to feel competent and varied, though starting out is quite painful. There is not a ton of variety or customization offered in the appearance of your units which was a bit of a bummer, but its good enough. Yet, I never really felt attached to any of my characters like I did for my X-COM soldiers. Not much else about the game is particularly noteworthy, good or bad. The graphics feel pretty rough albeit fitting to the universe, and the UI is wonky but not unusuble, unlike what some reviewers have said. The campaign voice acting is nice and the sparse amount of lore building we get is enjoyable for me as a long time Warhammer fan. That said, don't expect there to be any kind of a real ""story"". The line of sight system definitely could use some big improvements but again, I feel the RNG is the biggest pitfall of this game.In summation, this game tries to present itself as being a hardcore tactical strategy game, but often comes off feeling like the devs ran out of ideas on how to actually provide a challenge for the player and instead decided to just rig the system to make it 'feel' difficult. The lack of any real strategy outside of hoarding your units or bottlenecking the enemy turns each encounter in to a slog against an obnoxious RNG system that feels like a cover-up for the AI's lack of intelligence. At some point, it stops feeling challenging, fun, or risky, and instead simply becomes a frustrating chore that loses its appeal for the player to continue onwards when they know that there is little in the way of strategical decision making open to them.All of this said, everything I have seen from the developers seem to imply they are open to feedback (albeit quite unlikely to fundamentally change anything of note at this late in the game's life) and do intereact with the community a lot still, despite the relative age of this game. DLC continues to trickle in and even though some are not fond of the pay model, I don't find the DLC prices all that bad. There does seem to be a small but active community built up around the game, and I imagine multiplayer may relieve some of the game's shortcomings. Still, the bulk of the game is single-player only, so I have to ultimately say I cannot really recommend this game to anyone unless they can overlook the wonkiness of the AI and the short comings of a purely RNG style of gameplay.

Posted: February 8
												(NOTE: Hours in game is inaccurate by ~10 hours)Unfortunately, I can not recommend this game for three main reasons. First and foremost, as has been touched on by many others, this game employs a Random Number Generator as a core combat mechanic which, in and of itself, would not have been terrible had they not disguised various factors which affect your characters chance to hit. For example, your Hero may well appear to have an 85% chance to hit, but that 85% is not factoring in dodging etc. Whilst 'get good' might well be a valid argument in some cases, it is insanely disheartening to nearly perfectly play a series of moves to corner and outnumber an enemy, only to have them last through 2 rounds of your 4 combatant's attacks, in time for their own team to arrive and seriously hurt your odds of winning.The second issue flows on from the first, in that the game becomes mind-numbingly repetitive. After around 10 battles, you have seen all there is to see. You do not control your characters in a dynamic sense, only instigating the start of their attack animations whilst moving them around like chess pieces on a board. Once again, this is not an inherently flawed game mechanic, but instead was butchered in implementation. Instead of having suspense, tension and thrills come from, say, an emergent story within the combat wherein your characters evolve through the things they do, the feel of the game is very much, 'move animatronic doll here, whack or miss, rinse, repeat'. This is compounded by the fact that the game very much funnels you into one mind-set; gang up on a single enemy until you kill them, giving you the numbers advantage. Nearly all battles boil down to the same core ideology: gang up on them before they gang up on you. Once more, after a certain amount of battles, you've seen every attack, spell and movement animation your faction offers. The third issue conveniently flows from the second issue; the atmosphere, whilst very, very immersive, is ruined by the combat mechanics in that the overly-punishing RNG elements detach the player from the game, disallowing immersion as the player is dragged out of the Warhammer universe and into their room, study or basement of choice, becoming a spectator and interloper to the combat as opposed to an active participant. It's hard to feel invested in the characters when you are little more than some omnipresent grand-strategist whose actions have a somewhat open relationship with the gameplay itself. Often I was too focused on not having my squad obliterated to take in the sights of the maps, with their little idiosyncrasies which culminate in what is a rather aesthetically pleasing visual design. In summary or TLDRThe game is pretty, sporting a rather nice visual design yet shallow game mechanics ruin all immersion and result in slot-machine level frustration. Also, this DLC model is: overpriced, over-reaching and underwhelming.			"

												There's a lot I like about this game but there's a few infuriating sticking points that made me not enjoy it as much as I should. Things I liked:-The harsh difficulty level-The graphics-The main skeleton of the game.-The controlsThings I didn't like (there's a bunch of them but many are small so it looks like they outnumber the good points but that's not really true)-Even though the Wyrdstone gathering encourages exploring the fact is it's usually too risky to go ham on farming Wyrdstone. The fog of war means you can rarely tell where is safe. The enemy combs the battlefield and once they find you it just descends into a battle. If you try and send out lone guys to find out of the way loot pockets they will most likely get taken out.-Buildings don't usually make sense. You can't open doors or shoot out of windows. Often you can't jump down or climb up where you want to. You can waste a lot of time messing with scenary with no benefit so it's usually best to not bother.-Not enough character model options in customisation mode.-Consumable items mostly suck to the point where I don't usually use them. You can't tell who you're fighting beforehand so taking anti-poison or anti-fear items is a crapshoot as you may not even need them.-Not being able to get past your own guys in choke points.-The thing that made me quit in the end was set mission I-III for the human mercenary faction. If you're going to make a game where combat is deadly and consequences of injury are permanent and dire, please please please avoid using a teleportation maze with one-way teleporters. This game is really not suited to missions that require trial and error to find the way around. It's not fun. Not at all. I could have persevered through the rest of the little niggles but this level was too much.			"

I love Warhammer, there are some great video game adaptations of it but this is not one of them, at least not in it's current state.			"

								Several updates in and I still can't make my own team. Personalizing my warbands by buying my heroes, henchment, weapons, equipment and hired swords and then taking them into the ring was one of my favorite parts of the table-top game. Playing a preformed team that can freely swap weapons without any cost is lame. The game looks okay but, until there's a management element, I'm really unimpressed.			"

												I could write a lengthy review of this game's superb atmosphere, its punishing, challenging yet compelling gameplay, its myriad options for character builds which encourages experimentation, or even the fact that it lets you take a half-crippled amputee into a sword fight. Instead, I'll just say this:This is the first game for quite a long time that I dearly wish they'd make more DLC for.I think that's probably the highest praise I could give any game.			"

								I was enjoying my adventures through the Damned City for a while, having hired and trained up a pair of Warlocks from youth while leading a human warband, because their lightning strikes are dazzling. It was the first time a man went down in a while, as one of the mages got downed early on in a recent encounter with Sigmar by an unlucky stun, while the other blew himself up in an unavoidable spell backfire effect known only as Tzeentch's Wrath, causing him to lose consciousness instantly, in the same encounter as the first. Although my Ogre and leader pushed back the Sisters of Sigmar, I feared I would have to gather wyrdstone without the Warlocks for a while, but they both ended up with mental scars... Megalomania, meaning they could not cast spells ever again. An unrecoverable psychological illness, they might as well have died in the service of the empire, so I sent them into an early retirement.Making matters worse, this could be the end of my warband. With a pressing wyrdstone shipment deadline and not enough good men left to survive an encounter with the wandering demons, recovering resources to hire good men is out of the question while I muster up the courage to drag inexperienced henchmen into battle, training them up from scratch.This story is why Mordheim has potential -- I cannot wait to lead other bands of warriors into battle, but I would like to bring a medic for long-term treatment of the most insidious afflictions.

												The new campaign mode is every thing I was hoping for! I love a tactics game that allows for random non-story line missions that can be done as often as desired! The game is challenging and you are just as likely to take a loss as you are to push through to victory! I highly recommend this game and am so looking forward to more to come! UPDATE 11/21/15100hrs into the game and I still love it just as much as I did at hour 1. I have already suggested this game to many of my friends. As a turn-based rpg fanatic I love the way the game plays and the unique abilities for each warband. The permanent injury system is a nice touch, if not heart breaking at times (your star hero gets swarmed by skaven and ends up losing an arm). The maps are great, have a very Mordheim feel to them and pleasing to the eye. Some suggested improvements:*In-battle equip system. On the occasion I've accidentally sent my warband in and my warrior only has a dagger after getting robbed the last battle. After killing a rival, I can put a sword in my backpack but not simply hold it in my mainhand. I'd even be cool with the action costing strategy points to equip, etc.*Skills are way too expensive for the amount of gold you are able to make. I literally have an entire roster of warriors with 2-4 skill points because I simply cannot afford to pay for all of them to skill up and still meet the constant demands for wyrdstone shipments. Average low skill is 95 gold (and I have the scholar veteran skill too), the higher level skills range to upwards of 280-300 gold. Even after completing a 259lb wyrdstone shipment I'm only able to pay for two or three skills before I'm in danger of not being able to pay for treatments, equipment loss, and upkeep. I suggest perhaps a separate currency system for skills? or a lowering of their price, or an increase in wyrdstone shipment payouts? Or maybe even just dropping the gold cost as you already require skill points themselves?*Wyrdstone shipments come at regular intervals with increasing amount required and it is a great idea. It gives you a huge reason to harvest the pesky green crystals. However, the demand is a bit strenuous. It would be a lot easier to pay for skill upgrades and my warband in general if the demands weren't so constant. I love the system, but maybe a reprieve between shipments would help tremendously? Sometimes being able to send small shipments to one of the side smugglers helps out a lot, but then in doing so puts me behind the 8-ball on the next demand that comes within a day or two of the last completed.Love the game, keep up the good work. I've got three open games going so I need to get back to my mercenaries. Look forward to updates and hopefully more warbands. (I'm looking at you Dwarves, Undead, Orks, elves (both kind), Witch Hunters, and *hopefully* lizardmen.)			"

								I really want to like this game, but damn this game is tough. Game gave me some early wins, but then decided to pull the carpet from under me. Went with 4 straight losses due to what can only be luck. Once fight was a 3 vs 1 he made every single all-alone test and then proceeded to kill 2 of the three. At the end of the night my 7 man crew was down 4 heavily hurt members because multiple injuries were the roll of choice. Such a cool game but even with decent strategy the amount of dodging that the AI got over my own crew was unbalanced to say the least. "

												From what I got to play, It seems like a fun game.I find the learning curb to be kinda high in the beginning when it comes to initial party comp and what I need to gear them with. Hopefully with more game time, I will get a better grasp and youtube vids.Graphics are really good and I love tactic driven games. It being in the warhammer universe is a huge plus also when it comes to the different factions to play as.I noticed that my new characters miss a lot... like when you get those moments like omg, if I don't get this hit, I'm screwed ... whoosh! miss. ""F**K me!"" I noticed that I been saying that a lot within the few hours i've played.Overall, if you like tactic driven games in a dark grim world of warhammer with a lot of variety, you should get it.			"

												This is a great game. a lot of people are complaining that a turn-based game shouldn't be first-person, but to me it seems like they just can't think outside the box. once you get used to the gameplay you'll realize that there's a great deal of strategizing to be done. Example: I hide one of my men behind a wall and set him to ambush stance while having another run out in the open and shoot an arrow at an enemy. I then leave the archer out in the open as i am out of movement points. the enemy runs towards my archer but when he passes the wall my warrior attacks and locks him down.The graphics are fine and i have yet to encounter a bug. the difficulty appeals to me especially the fact that the game auto-saves whenever you finish a battle, leaving you no choice but to press on and feel the consequenses of each battle.While the game is great, it could do with a little polishing and i won't recommend buying it unless it is on sale.

								At this stage of its development, I have to say I am thoroughly enjoying the game, the graphics are great and I think the city itself is quite atmospheric.  Navigation takes a little practice, but after a while any awkwardness sort of fits the twisted nature of the place.  Gameplay is good, game speed needs refining but I am sure the developers will iron things out as they continually make well thought out improvements.  Really impressed so far and am happy to have parted with my cash.  Character development is also fun - you may find that the peg leg, one eyed survivor of many a nightmarish encounter will still be in your team long after he may have wanted to retire.....I think this is worth a blast, but be prepared to have plenty of time to complete some of the main campaign missions as no saves in game (at least that I could find) mean a long session unless you want to force your team to retreat in order to turn the computer off and get on with real life!

								Great game, but there are some things i really hate.1. Characters will have to make all alone checks even though there are friendly characters 2 ft. away from other friendly characters.2. stupidity checks from skull fractures completely destroys a chrarcter's usefullness. my warlock has a 14 intellegence, is lucky to pass a stupidity check 20% of the time. tone down the difficulty of the checks.3. exiting the game causes the match to be a rout and all of your characters take injuries. ive had it where i had to exit the game because the game crashed and when i turned it back on, 3 of my guys had missing arms. i shouldnt be punished for having to turn off the game. i realize that the devs dont want players to exit the game when their warband is being beat, but there are better ways. XCOM EU had the ironman mode. the game would save whenever a action is completed. that way players couldnt just go back and redo past actions.4. Blue items get lost on characters way too often. i beat a warband decisively and only had 1 casualty. the captain comes back without injury BUT somewhere along the lines, he lost his blue shield, sword and helmet. thats insane. blue items seem to get lost more than white items. maybe its just me overreacting, but those blue items are insanely useful when it comes to fighting stronger warbands or doing story missions. losing them with the frequency as I have can have terrible effects in the long run. i dont want there to be no chance of dropping them, just a little lower chance of it. maybe add in a perk that makes it impossible (or extremely unlikely) for them to drop a designated item?5. Not being ablr to leap across a gap because there is a enemy 1 story below you. i dont think this was intentional. probably just a glitch.I really REALLY like the game, but its a really frustrating game. A lot of it comes from the RNG, but thats just the nature of the game. i really hope that the devs listen to the players and tweak the game for the better.			"

Also bashing a ratogre to the ground with the hammer of sigmar is great (especially after failing to climb a wall 3 times in a row).			"

								I am really enjoying this game! It is an accurate re-creation of the table top game I use to enjoy.THE GOOD-Unit movement is really simple. Exploring the maps is easy and backing up when you make an error is not an impossible task. - Units seem varied and that lends unique character to each warband. THE BAD-Wish there was a simple command list. I walking through the tutorials it can be hard to remember all of the keystrokes to do everything. If there was a function key that listed all of the commands, that would be very helpful.-The overhead view of the maps is sometimes confusing. Sometimes the map breaks up. I cannot tell which figure is my active one or which way he is facing. I have yet to figure out it there is a ""north"" orientation. This, combined with the facing issue sometimes makes orienting on the map difficult.-Load times are crazy long (but worth the wait). Overall I am pleased, but I really hope the map difficulties get worked out for players to really bring in new blood.BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!!			"

								(Early Beta Opinion) So far I've enjoyed what I've played, it's still early so not all the bells and whistles are there. Having played the Table top game and this, It's a good representiation of that. The same company is doing the Blood Bowl games and understands  the core concept of Games Workshop games and takes great care to follow that. Looking forward to a completed game.Basic concept:you build a warband to enter the infest evil crawling town of Mordheim after a WarpStone comet hit there. a few different game modes take place.warbands range from Humans, skaven, chaos and more.take out your opponent with no mercy because none will be given to you.units grow and become stronger just as much as they are crippled or killed.See that guy over there? leveled him up huh? well too bad he died.do you have what it takes or are you a scared little wimp?

								If you have even a moderate interest in tabletop war games or any tactical squad level combat game get this at once! One problem I've had (especially when playing similar factions against each other) is determining who's an enemy from a distance. Also an overlay map ala Diablo would be nice to quickly determine enemy/friend proximity. The current overview is okay, but I don't know how many times I've run in the wrong direction due to it being somewhat confusing.The 3D modeling is great but would it be possible to not have all of the combat in that mode?Climbing and jumping are also difficult as falling accurs far too frequently. These are supposed to be warriors and my grandma can climb and jump better.All in all it's still in early access but shows awesome promise.

I have only found one bug so far in this early access stage with the fat ogre dude getting stuck in a door frame while trying to ambush something. Was funny to watch for a bit, but had to reboot game so he could get his backside out of that space.There is no career progression or looting active just yet, but without it the game already feels like it has great depth.TIP: Play the tutorials to get a chance to play as Chaos Warband and Sisters of Sigmar too			"

								GW skirmish game translated to video game by the guy who made xcom ? yes please ! I love the original Mordheim  and i loved xcom and this game is looking great so far. The warbands have to right look and character. The tactical and strategic play work well. When they add warband management, customization and perma deaths it will be even better. Fans of the tabletop game , xcom or turn based strategy in general should give this game a look.			"

								Great adaptation showing a lot of promise in the early access period. With some great choke points on the maps and having to pay attention to climb points or get flanked this really could be the strategy game that keeps you craving more. Great work guys and thanks to the Dev team on this one! You have a new fan!			"

Early Access Review
								I was enjoying my adventures through the Damned City for a while, having hired and trained up a pair of Warlocks from youth while leading a human warband, because their lightning strikes are dazzling. It was the first time a man went down in a while, as one of the mages got downed early on in a recent encounter with Sigmar by an unlucky stun, while the other blew himself up in an unavoidable spell backfire effect known only as Tzeentch's Wrath, causing him to lose consciousness instantly, in the same encounter as the first. Although my Ogre and leader pushed back the Sisters of Sigmar, I feared I would have to gather wyrdstone without the Warlocks for a while, but they both ended up with mental scars... Megalomania, meaning they could not cast spells ever again. An unrecoverable psychological illness, they might as well have died in the service of the empire, so I sent them into an early retirement.Making matters worse, this could be the end of my warband. With a pressing wyrdstone shipment deadline and not enough good men left to survive an encounter with the wandering demons, recovering resources to hire good men is out of the question while I muster up the courage to drag inexperienced henchmen into battle, training them up from scratch.This story is why Mordheim has potential -- I cannot wait to lead other bands of warriors into battle, but I would like to bring a medic for long-term treatment of the most insidious afflictions.

								I really want to like this game, but damn this game is tough. Game gave me some early wins, but then decided to pull the carpet from under me. Went with 4 straight losses due to what can only be luck. Once fight was a 3 vs 1 he made every single all-alone test and then proceeded to kill 2 of the three. At the end of the night my 7 man crew was down 4 heavily hurt members because multiple injuries were the roll of choice. Such a cool game but even with decent strategy the amount of dodging that the AI got over my own crew was unbalanced to say the least. "

As of this post it is 'Early Access Game' so there are camera angle bugs, but dose play and feel like the real thing. *looks excited* the campain mode is alot of fun, and the perma death , and injeries, make this a real challange! its epic midevil gang RPG, simulater! its the GW 'Warhamer' RPG board game come to life. It is clear the DEV's care, and are putting there heart and soul into this game, I recomend that you buy and play it now even in ealy access! totaly worth it!!! two thumbs up!			"

								At this stage of its development, I have to say I am thoroughly enjoying the game, the graphics are great and I think the city itself is quite atmospheric.  Navigation takes a little practice, but after a while any awkwardness sort of fits the twisted nature of the place.  Gameplay is good, game speed needs refining but I am sure the developers will iron things out as they continually make well thought out improvements.  Really impressed so far and am happy to have parted with my cash.  Character development is also fun - you may find that the peg leg, one eyed survivor of many a nightmarish encounter will still be in your team long after he may have wanted to retire.....I think this is worth a blast, but be prepared to have plenty of time to complete some of the main campaign missions as no saves in game (at least that I could find) mean a long session unless you want to force your team to retreat in order to turn the computer off and get on with real life!

Early Access Review
								I purchased the early access game on Halloween after reading some pretty great sounding reviews. Just a little bit of background I don't write reviews on video games EVER as I haven't found any that stand out to me enough to warrant a review (please note I'm 21 and have been gaming since I was about 6). I am a fan of strategy games such as xcom, civ 5, galactic civ, Dawn of War 1 & 2. Mordheim as an early access game has already managed to push them out of my mind. It is challenging but not ridiculously like dark souls (which is important as at that level of challenging the game is no longer fun). I find myself attached to the characters on my team and worrying way more than I should about my characters surviving. The things I love about this game- Warband team style play offers customization for play style ergo you can use 1 hand weapons, 2 hand weapons, archers, magic all to your play style- 2 resources gold and wyrdstones which can make for some extra complexity as you have to ensure you have enough of both otherwise you'll tick someone off (not enough gold and you can't pay for treatments or pay your soldiers not enough wyrdstones and you won't be able to make your quota to your employer)- Have yet to find any really overpowered units. using 1 hand weapons for example you lose damage if you compare it to a 2 hand weapon but you gain dodge chance or you can equip a shield and be able to parry. - Magic abilities have the chance to backfire or curse characters as you use it so you can't train your mage up to be as ***kicker and use him to kill the whole enemy team (atleast from what I've seen so far). - It's only early access which means they are actually looking at reviews and bugs and game suggestions and actually fixing them and modifying the game so it can only go up from here!Things that I feel should be addressed- I say addressed as it's in early access still so most of these are just things that need to be tweaked as they're still working on the game.- the percentages for tasks appear a little skewed to me. what I mean is I'll have a 75 percent chance to hit someone I'll attack them 4 times and miss all 4 times. This get's a little irritating when you have your havy hitter who has a big 2 handed weapons that does but loads of damage but can only attack once per turn and he constantly misses. Or when you are trying to climb a wall and you have a 70 percent chance and you use all of your moves falling and injuring your character who is wearing cloth armor and is an archer (near killed him doing this). If you ask me archers are a little underpowered making them reload was a good check and balance however they do very little damage and can only attack once per turn (keep in mind they're just hitting the first skill point for me so I may be able to upgrade them down the road to be better)Ergo just off of the campaign to the first act this game is awesome! I haven't even touched the multiplayer yet! "

Early Access Review
								Great game, but there are some things i really hate.1. Characters will have to make all alone checks even though there are friendly characters 2 ft. away from other friendly characters.2. stupidity checks from skull fractures completely destroys a chrarcter's usefullness. my warlock has a 14 intellegence, is lucky to pass a stupidity check 20% of the time. tone down the difficulty of the checks.3. exiting the game causes the match to be a rout and all of your characters take injuries. ive had it where i had to exit the game because the game crashed and when i turned it back on, 3 of my guys had missing arms. i shouldnt be punished for having to turn off the game. i realize that the devs dont want players to exit the game when their warband is being beat, but there are better ways. XCOM EU had the ironman mode. the game would save whenever a action is completed. that way players couldnt just go back and redo past actions.4. Blue items get lost on characters way too often. i beat a warband decisively and only had 1 casualty. the captain comes back without injury BUT somewhere along the lines, he lost his blue shield, sword and helmet. thats insane. blue items seem to get lost more than white items. maybe its just me overreacting, but those blue items are insanely useful when it comes to fighting stronger warbands or doing story missions. losing them with the frequency as I have can have terrible effects in the long run. i dont want there to be no chance of dropping them, just a little lower chance of it. maybe add in a perk that makes it impossible (or extremely unlikely) for them to drop a designated item?5. Not being ablr to leap across a gap because there is a enemy 1 story below you. i dont think this was intentional. probably just a glitch.I really REALLY like the game, but its a really frustrating game. A lot of it comes from the RNG, but thats just the nature of the game. i really hope that the devs listen to the players and tweak the game for the better.			"

								It's harsh, addictive and all consuming. It flies true to the tabletop for the most part and the developer engagement and patch releases make a mess of AAA developers. I love this game, I love the variances in warbandsI love that my leader for one warband now walks on a peg leg. I love how awful the RNG can be sometimes.But what I love most is that the warband feels like its mine. I felt genuine saddness when my maxed out Sister Superior of my first warband lost an eye, then died the very next match.Just buy it.			"

So far, after 2 attempts, multiplayer matches seem to end up stuck in a permenant loading screen (it's not that frustrating if I'm honest, it's a pretty nice loading screen), but I'm sure this will be fixed rather soon - the game is still in early access as I type this. Right now I'll be sticking to the offline part of the game, but I don't find it boring at all.			"

Once the other warbands are released, the campaign comes out and the rest of the content is released I think this game is going to be very, very good.Multiplayer is a little light right now and the AI for CPU skirmishes is pretty dumb, but this period is more about testing out what is available and getting the mechanics locked down. The tutorials are pretty in-depth and set you up pretty well for what's available/to come.I look forward to further updates.			"

								Can't wait for the rest of the features to be added. Its a great tribute to a great tabletop game, gameplay style reminds me of x-com but with a more interesting movement and attack dynamic that gets rid of the square/hex system seen in so many other turn based games. I have only found one bug so far in this early access stage with the fat ogre dude getting stuck in a door frame while trying to ambush something. Was funny to watch for a bit, but had to reboot game so he could get his backside out of that space.There is no career progression or looting active just yet, but without it the game already feels like it has great depth.TIP: Play the tutorials to get a chance to play as Chaos Warband and Sisters of Sigmar too			"

								Played for 6 hours messing around with the maps and the two current warbands. I was never a big fan of Mordheim on the table top. I liked the grand battles of 40k, and then Warmachine, but since Infinity and Malifaux (and now Relic Knights), i've given skrimish games a second look. The game it self plays nicely, even if you can't invert the mouse?! The two warbands are enjoyable to play, something satisfying about a Rat Ogre smashing someone over the head. As it stands the only way to win at the moment is to force the other warband to rout, but the list of future up dates is very promising. I am looking forward to the progression of my warband and the collection of loot.			"

												From what I got to play, It seems like a fun game.I find the learning curb to be kinda high in the beginning when it comes to initial party comp and what I need to gear them with. Hopefully with more game time, I will get a better grasp and youtube vids.Graphics are really good and I love tactic driven games. It being in the warhammer universe is a huge plus also when it comes to the different factions to play as.I noticed that my new characters miss a lot... like when you get those moments like omg, if I don't get this hit, I'm screwed ... whoosh! miss. ""F**K me!"" I noticed that I been saying that a lot within the few hours i've played.Overall, if you like tactic driven games in a dark grim world of warhammer with a lot of variety, you should get it.			"

												This is a great game. a lot of people are complaining that a turn-based game shouldn't be first-person, but to me it seems like they just can't think outside the box. once you get used to the gameplay you'll realize that there's a great deal of strategizing to be done. Example: I hide one of my men behind a wall and set him to ambush stance while having another run out in the open and shoot an arrow at an enemy. I then leave the archer out in the open as i am out of movement points. the enemy runs towards my archer but when he passes the wall my warrior attacks and locks him down.The graphics are fine and i have yet to encounter a bug. the difficulty appeals to me especially the fact that the game auto-saves whenever you finish a battle, leaving you no choice but to press on and feel the consequenses of each battle.While the game is great, it could do with a little polishing and i won't recommend buying it unless it is on sale.

								With the release of warband progression, this game has taken a giant leap ahead. I feel obligated to also help put down some criticisms that I've been seeing on the forums. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, this game is a PORT OF THE ORIGINAL MORDHEIM game from tabletop fantasy warhammer. This game is made by mordheim fans FOR mordheim fans. The reason that there are bubbles around the characters is because of Movement Bases. The reason that you cannot loot everything on the map after youve won is because you couldnt loot everything on the table after youve won. If you want to do that then youll have to cripple the other warband and hope they dont route. The reason that there are only 4 warbands is because ........ you guessed it, in the original Mordheim there were only 4 warbands. Human, Sisters of Sigmar, Skaven, and Chaos. There were other warbands created by the community, but nothing official by games workshop. Ive been playing Mordheim for over 16 years off and on and I find todays gamers to be quite spoiled and childish with some of these complaints on the forums. Mordheim isnt for all the whiney little griefers, its for the die hard fans of warhammer and its franchises. Grow up steam community.			"

												The new campaign mode is every thing I was hoping for! I love a tactics game that allows for random non-story line missions that can be done as often as desired! The game is challenging and you are just as likely to take a loss as you are to push through to victory! I highly recommend this game and am so looking forward to more to come! UPDATE 11/21/15100hrs into the game and I still love it just as much as I did at hour 1. I have already suggested this game to many of my friends. As a turn-based rpg fanatic I love the way the game plays and the unique abilities for each warband. The permanent injury system is a nice touch, if not heart breaking at times (your star hero gets swarmed by skaven and ends up losing an arm). The maps are great, have a very Mordheim feel to them and pleasing to the eye. Some suggested improvements:*In-battle equip system. On the occasion I've accidentally sent my warband in and my warrior only has a dagger after getting robbed the last battle. After killing a rival, I can put a sword in my backpack but not simply hold it in my mainhand. I'd even be cool with the action costing strategy points to equip, etc.*Skills are way too expensive for the amount of gold you are able to make. I literally have an entire roster of warriors with 2-4 skill points because I simply cannot afford to pay for all of them to skill up and still meet the constant demands for wyrdstone shipments. Average low skill is 95 gold (and I have the scholar veteran skill too), the higher level skills range to upwards of 280-300 gold. Even after completing a 259lb wyrdstone shipment I'm only able to pay for two or three skills before I'm in danger of not being able to pay for treatments, equipment loss, and upkeep. I suggest perhaps a separate currency system for skills? or a lowering of their price, or an increase in wyrdstone shipment payouts? Or maybe even just dropping the gold cost as you already require skill points themselves?*Wyrdstone shipments come at regular intervals with increasing amount required and it is a great idea. It gives you a huge reason to harvest the pesky green crystals. However, the demand is a bit strenuous. It would be a lot easier to pay for skill upgrades and my warband in general if the demands weren't so constant. I love the system, but maybe a reprieve between shipments would help tremendously? Sometimes being able to send small shipments to one of the side smugglers helps out a lot, but then in doing so puts me behind the 8-ball on the next demand that comes within a day or two of the last completed.Love the game, keep up the good work. I've got three open games going so I need to get back to my mercenaries. Look forward to updates and hopefully more warbands. (I'm looking at you Dwarves, Undead, Orks, elves (both kind), Witch Hunters, and *hopefully* lizardmen.)			"

												As an old-school tabletop mordheim player I was curious but full of doubt when I first saw this game. But after release, playing a couple of hours I find it immensly fun, true to the tabletop roots the game has and can just recommend to try it.I still think ranged weapons need a buff and miss several of my favorite warbands but will continue to enjoy this game for hours upon hours			"

												There is a ton of potential here, but the thing that turned me away was that it combines hardcore perma death with constant missing mecnahics. You can avoid missing with initial attacks but once you get a unit locked into a fight it's 90% missing. I had my best warrior die to a weak enemy just because of stupid unlucky rolls. More shoudl be put on stratigy and less on randomess. Aside for that, I think it's a great game. I recommend to at least try it out.			"

												Free Weekend Review11hrs over the weekend, i followed this game since early access i decided to finally purchase the game now that its been released and i was given the free week end to test it out. im not a fan of most games workshop games i think most are cash grabs and dont capture the table top essence which made all these types of games enjoyable. Mordheim does for me feel like the table top, which is very important as i want that feeling, i want to feel like each game is something i can easily imagion being played out on a table top in front of me. ive only played 11hrs so my experience is quite limited ive completed the tutorials and spend the rest playing about 11 games as a choas warband. i love the gameplay there just aint enough good turn based strategy games atm which i like so finding one that i enjoy is a blessing. ive only played solo so cant say anything about mp. Well done devs a gameswork shop game that feels that the tabletop its based on instead of just using its name to grab some cash! hats off to you!PROStabletop feel ( feels like Mordheim)customizing your warbands (i name all my warriors and give them unique apperances)depth ( im only 11hrs but it seems like mastering this will take some time)ai seems ok atm ive only seen a few stupid moves, but then again i only played the table top against friends and we all made quite alot of stupid moves so i cant complainbasics are easy to learnruns wellhas some intense momentstactics are importanthas me shouting at my screen ( i like games bring out emotions)flashbacks, which mainly seem to be of me making terrible dice rollsconsgraphics are abit slack in places, especially some of the human faces, but who careswould like more detailed info on battle reportsneeds more different map types and layouts, we used to make some silly stuff with this game, or better yet, creation kit? has no dice roll animation, my biggest h8 maybe theres an option ive missedtraps could be more interestingatm its all 1v1, maybe later game has it but i want some 1v1v1v1 actionlike i said limited review only 11hrs but i love it!

												An interesting take on Mordheim, pretty damn true to source.I'll reccomend it because I had a lot of fun playing it. Pros:Lore accurate representation of settings, characters, races and abilities.Reasonably well balanced matches, rarely are battles impossible or very easyDeep and interesting character levelling and equipment progression systemsYour warband develops real character naturally over the course of a campaignCons:Graphics are not up to par for something this recent. I'm the first to say ""Graphics aren't everything"" but also they are not to be ignored.Random deployment missions are often skewed to be impossible, edge case scenarios in rare circumstances make certain battles unwinnable. Some injuries should not be permanent. High level units can be injured and permanently lose all value, forcing you to replace them with rookies and play another 20 hours to level them up, or be satisfied with a perpetually sub-par warrior. I understand the injuries are also a great aspect of the game. Peg Leg Grunhir the giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the halberd was one of my favourite warband members, and I don't want his leg healed by any means. We have magic potions, we can teach people spells and enchant weapons. Can we really not send Rolf ""Basically Legolas"" Murnheim off for a week to have some mojo done to reverse his brain damage? It was just a concussion bro. Get over it.  "

												Very engaging strategy game focused around building up your units. Lots of variety in advancement options and lots of possibility for permanent injuries and even death that keeps things challenging and realistic. I legitimately worry if one of my important units falls in battle. Comparable to Blood Bowl in these respects and warband management does parallel a sports sim in many ways.Combat can get a little bit repetitive. Not a lot of story mixed in, unfortunately, but good background and setting. Ability to customize units' appearance is good, but being forced to do so for each one as they all start off looking identical (instead of randomized) isn't ideal.DLC nickel and dimes you to death, as with anything Games Workshop related.

												This game is a hard sell, and honestly not for everyone. but, if you like perma death and an AI that wants to take your stuff more then it wants to beat a map, its for you. Custimization is good, and once you learn the ACTUAL game ( the tutorial is full of it ) then you can start to actualy enjoy it. Protip: dont get attached to henchmen, hand him a number instead of a name and keep your hero and captain alive. Sure 6 just got gutted by three rat people and 37 went toe to toe with a Chaos spawn and lost a few bits, but they did there job and let the commander shoot at them from a safe distance, and let 65 gather the wyrdstone needed to get that XP buff hes going to forget again because he was hit a little to hard in the head by a Sister of Sigmar.

												This game has given me PTSD!I bought the game knowing full well that it was going to be challenging, with perma death, warband management and no obious advantages in a match. when i started the game i went through  all the tutorials and studied the character management screen and noticed the change name and write biography screen.so i though to myself this could be fun and started naming them all and giving them a back story. my mercinary warband was lead by a captain in the old city watch and his son was the youngblood hero i had with him. i had a pair of brothers who were hunters from the forests of the empire and a swordsman who had come seeking fame and fortune. They did exceptionaly well until it came to the first story mission. a warband that had not suffered a casultie was suddenly in the sewers below mordheim confronted with a rat ogre!By now i had become quite attatched to my warband and i had to watch in horror as my leaders son lost a leg to the ogre, the sell sword was killed almost imediately and it was up to my leader to save the warband! He was not successful. one of the hunter brothers lost an arm so could no longer shoot and the other surrendered. my warband leader was knocked out and suffered amnesia so could not even remember the destruction of the group and  there was no money left to pay for the medical costs or even pay the wages of the troops.Three warbands later I came back to this mission and was actually worried about starting it. i had become so attached and protective of the only successful warband i had that i didnt want to risk their lives against the ogre again. this is something that a game hasnt made me feel for a long time and when these little faceless digital heroes finally brought it down (once again leader got amnesia but no other casulties) i actually felt a sence of achivement.So yes the game isnt as polished as it could be and the RNG may make you screem at the screen when your guy fails to climb a wall for the fith time but these are minor problems when compared to the joy of getting all your troops home without injury and a butt ton of loot!Would definately recomend this game to anyone willing to stick it out to the bitter end.

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is not for the faint of heart. It's tactical and relies on strategy and wit, but luck plays an important part, and it may not always be on your side. But if you're up for a gamble, then there's no denying it; Mordheim is one of my all-time favourite turn-based tactical rpg's.Making good use of the Games Workshop franchise in terms of atmosphere and looks, the devs managed to create an extremely addictive and engaging game, which will gradually suck you in until there's no getting out. It's great fun to level up your soldiers and unlock skills that will offer whole new ways of approaching each match.If you're a fan of games like X-Com (1 and 2), know that Mordheim does share a few similarities, but it's also very unique. It's much less forgiving of your mistakes, but it also feels much more rewarding when you are successful, as it really puts you to the test. If you're not afraid of trial & error, and occasionally getting your behind slapped by Lady Luck, then don't think twice and dive right in - this game is totally worth it.			"

												Best game ever! I hope they do Necromunda next!! :)Update:The game is great and theres a hell of a lot of unseen work building the databases for all the fighters and warbands. The games main problem is the AI. The enemy warband usually separates from each other and goes straight to your warband leaving themselves vulnerable as they attack one by one. Every warband seems to employ this tactic and I have yet to see the AI warband either hole up in a building together and wait like a sensible mordheim player would do or just attack you from one street like a bowling ball. This wouldn't be too difficult to achieve as warband fighters just have to stick together and attack or wait it out. The normal split up and attack tactic could be kept as well for different warband tactics.The other problem is the AI using impressives and wandering monsters. They always get stuck in the map terrain / scenary and the debris littering the streets which you would normally climb / over pass through on the tabletop. If they removed the collision boxes for those scenary models it could be fixed and clipping would only be a minor problem as they pass through. Otherwise it just breaks the AI and leaves their gang at a disadvantage. Reducing the impressives bounding box and make them avoid narrow litter strewn streets could also fix this. It just doesn't make sense for all characters being unable to move through these small obstacles and its a major part of all warhammer games that use battlefield terrain.Multiple gangs on one map would be another wish for me but the games awesome as it is. They put a ton of effort into this game and its not right to see it slated so often over things you didn't even have in the tabletop game.			"

												pro: awesome gamecon:1) very buggy2) battles can get exceedingly drawn out to a point where you're no longer having fun you just want to go to bed 3) no saves4) although it is theoretically ""possible"" to miss 2 hits at a 95 percent chance the chances are 1 in 400 and coupled with the fact that the computer will DEFINITELY hit you with many more criticals that what you will hit them, the RNG is questionable and I believe there is an undisclosed 'hardcore' element coded into the RNG rolls to ensure that you are never TOO comfortable5) when playing a skirmish game you will not get the option to save out and quit, you can only withdraw (for statistical purposes this counts like all of your guys were taken out of action) which affects your all time warband stats6) enemy reinforcements show up too quickly - there should be a counter or something on the screen that says something like ""Enemy reinforcements arriving in 5 turns"" but a fresh assortment of reinforcements arriving EVERY TURN when your warband has taken a hammering is a little too much7) not everybody likes the idea of getting forcefully bent over and ravaged in their rear which is what this game feels like a lot of the time. 8) In keeping with its 'hardcore' element, the game can overlook its enjoyment factor at times All things said, I really enjoyed the game... I've never played a game where I literally got out of my seat and started punching the air and pulling my hair... but everyone should know that this game is a HARDCORE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT EXCEPTION. NO HAND HOLDING HERE. NOT recommended for the casual gamer. But if you're the type that gets off on brutal BDSM, this game is for you. "

								Several updates in and I still can't make my own team. Personalizing my warbands by buying my heroes, henchment, weapons, equipment and hired swords and then taking them into the ring was one of my favorite parts of the table-top game. Playing a preformed team that can freely swap weapons without any cost is lame. The game looks okay but, until there's a management element, I'm really unimpressed.			"

												Well done game.  It appears lovingly created to capture the atmosphere and feeling of tabletop Mordheim while making reasonable changes for PC gameplay.  The balance between being cautious to keep important characters alive, capturing warpstone, and moving in for daring kills is a wonderful experience - much like tabletop.  The skill options are quite varied and I've now had about a hundred hours of fun just playing through one campaign carefully all the way to the end.  Despite the unforgiving nature of hardcore mode, I found the game balance to be quite good.  On my first playthrough I was able to complete the campaign, so don't be scared off, though I did have a few years of tabletop Mordheim experience under my belt and I do regularly play other strategic turn-based games like X-Com 2 and the like.  In all, what makes this memorable is its flavor.  In a world where Age of Sigmar now dominates Warhammer Fantasy tabletop, and the PC experience either provides the harried pace of FPS titles or immersive rpg titles, this occupies a special niche full of loving attention to traditional Mordheim flavor.

Early Access Review
								Of course, it's not finished and needs a lot of work. And yet, rather than strengthen play with modern technology it feels like they've attempted to engage a new audience with camera tricks. Rather than attempt to re-create the playstyle and assets of the real-life game, making use of the computer to resolve LOS issues and streamline warband book-keeping, the developers have opted for an awful 3rd person POV with a poorly implemented 'tactical map'.Which is a real shame. The original game was a joy to play, along with Necromunda. All we needed was a virtual re-creation of the physical game, with all the advantages modern technology can offer. Instead, we have a game that seems like its trying to pretend its not based on an excellent board game.While I hope things will improve I can't see the developers devianting from the core design choices already made - and those design choices have not improved gameplay but instead made it worse.

								Turn based tactical combat set in the Warhammer Universe. Based off the tabletop game liscensed by Games Worksop. Early Access, but a very strong game in its current state. Gameplay is similar to XCOM, and in a future update your characters will gain experience, loot, and abilties. However, Permadeath is a factor as well as injuries. So protect your warband, because thats all you've got. All in all, from what I've played, Im very excited about future updates to this title. Because, in its current state, It's already a strong title in the turn based strategy genre.			"

												While it needs a good nip of polish and some more customisation/warbands, this is a top notch game that faithfully recreates the GW board game, with a few new mechanics (such as not being able to see your opponents if they are not in LOS) that make it much more competitive, interesting and fun.

												This will be lengthy, as I had plenty of time to write this while I download Patch 3 slowly because my internet connection sucks terribly. Also, my computer's terrible, but that's besides the point. Anyway, hold on tight.PreludeI grew up with a game called Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat. I had the PS1 version of the game, and for some reason I only had half of the instruction manual for the game. I had gotten the game from a yard sale of a neighbor who was moving and wanted some cash, presumably to join a caravan of gypsies. When I played it for the first time, I thought I was doing well until I had to do some mission where you had to patrol and kill numerous Skaven early on. I learned that I was bad at tactics. So I had to get good.I got good... or so I thought. Then I got mauled by an orc riding a wyvern or something. It was terrifying, as I was a dumb tween when I first played this game.Many years later I came back to it and eventually beat it, even after numerous deaths. I still wish I had the half of the instruction manual that included the psychology section though.Anyway, I wrote about Shadow of the Horned Rat because this game brings back memories of my training montage of getting good at Warhammer.This GameI first heard of Mordheim: City of the Damned when I subscribed to Sheepdog Gaming on the Youtube sometime after I got into Blood Bowl 2. I saw a video about a Skaven warband, and immediately I had to watch it. I learned that Mordheim was a strategy-based game with permadeath and various other things. I decided to watch a bit more of various people playing Mordheim to get an idea of whether I wanted this game or not. Eventually I decided that I'd get it and start off as the Skaven, because I find them hilarious compared to the other factions. I eventually started at least one warband from each faction (as of this edit, there are five in total).I had to turn my settings to the lowest that I possibly could, because my PC is rather bad for gaming and I need to upgrade both my computer and my internet connection at some point in the future. Regardless of this, I can tell that the game is good looking, even if my settings make it so that my human captain has no pupils (he also went amok after getting pounded by cultists, so I could consider that a side effect of him being mentally deranged). I can also tell from seeing other reviews and noting Youtubers saying so that the loading times are pretty long regardless of my computer's performance. Hopefully this patch helps a little with this. (A patch helped with this somewhat.)Anyway, the RNG of this game does get to me sometimes, but I'm very much used to the punishment as a result of my aforementioned experience with Shadow of the Horned Rat. I've had some good RNG too, thankfully, such as being able to end certain Marked for Death battles fairly quickly with the bonus objective completed or having a metric ton of wyrdstone at a good place to screw with the AI.I have no input regarding multiplayer, as I'm afraid of losing my internet connection while playing it. I'll update this when or if I can get some experience in.Regarding gameplay, it's a pretty solid strategy game. The AI can be rather dumb sometimes, but challenges happen just as much as dumb AI activity happens for me, so I can't complain too much. There have only been a couple of occasions where the AI got stuck on corners for me, although I have also had a couple times where the AI cannot decide whether it wants to jump down or climb up a ledge, and will do so back and forth until the unit moves within ambush range of my deranged captain who wants an excuse to not flee from combat. Anyways, the AI could be worse, but it could also be better.Rating:For me, I give this game a whip designed for self-flagellation arranged in the form of an 8 out of 10. Well, it'd look more like a B, but close enough.For a general audience, I give this game a whip designed for self-flagellation arranged in a 7 out of 10. The punishment of the RNG stings a fair bit, but you feel absolved once you manage your RNG, achieve victory, and dominate your foes through clever tactics. If you're into Warhammer, strategy, and challenge, pick up this game. It is possible that the challenge may not be the sort you're looking for, so this is rated a 7 instead of an 8 for that reason.

												Honestly, this game just keeps bringing me back to it. It's easy to pick up and put down when you have time, and has enough replay and options to try that it's hard to get too bored. While not perfect, it is fun if you like turn based strategy. Don't go in expecting perfection, do go in expecting some fun.			"

												If you love Warhammer Fantasy lore and love RPGs such as this, then Mordheim's the game for you! I can see a LOT of potential with the game. The game is still new so things are still being added... BUT! Do not let that scare you off, adventurers! If Orks, Elves, Dwarves, etc were added then I can see some insane amounts of fun with that! The Elven leader could probably be ranged focused and all.A protip would be getting and keeping your warband as close as possible as SOON as possible. Skaven can absolutely destroy you if you let your people stray too far away.  Highly recommand this game. Don't dislike it because of a few problems, it's still new as I said but that just means there's things to flush out and goodies to add in!  Spell casting is also really crazy. I've seen only one time so far where the enemy caused their Magister to explode. I do NOT recommend casting a spell if you're wearing armor or a helmet. (unless either gives a strong enough buff against the curse penalty).""More blood for the Blood God! More skulls for the Skull Throne!"" Yay for Chaos!Happy adventuring!Protip: Bring ALL of your troops when you're doing a story mission, they don't scale based on your warband size and it's a GREAT way to level people up!			"

												Well...after spending 60+ hours in this game I think that I'm starting to have a clear idea of how it works.I really suggest this game to warhammer lovers, the graphic is good and it respects the background very well! The Game is hard...I mean VERY HARD, even for turn-based rpg experts and the time you need to learn the mechanics is long.You will lose games, your favoure heroes will lose limbs, eyes or will become idiots...but hey, it's Mordheim! RNG works pretty well for me and when start learning how your heroes work you can manage the bad rolls with the acquired skills.Sometime you will hate it, sometime letal games will look too easy, but it's normal, it's random, but I enjoy the challange a lot.Warbands have different play style and having few maps is not a big issue, since you start always from a different point with different missions.Developers are very present and listen to the community.The game is worth the moneys, i am very happy about it.

												I recommend this game only for hard core strategy players who agree and respect the RNGods in all their glory.  If you think I am joking you are wrong.  More then likely you have played the new Xcom (I assume Steam has send you to here from there) if you think that is a challenge or has unfair RNG .  Then this game you need to stay away from.  To sum it up, you can have a 95% chance to hit, however if they have a 95% dodge, then In fact you have a 4.75% chance to do any damage.  So keep that in mind when I say this game is The domain of the Almighty RNGods.  If you liked the old X-com however this is for you.  This game is unfair and unforgiving, and you have to abuse the system to the fullest.  That said the biggest flaw is the game-play gets stale fast.  I do like the game play, however it can get stale fast due to it does not feel like anything changes mission to mission.  Sum it up, you have to move in a group and hope you do not get in a fight before you can do the secondary objective.  Then gang up of the lone guy before their team can get to you.  Also the collection game play can drive you mad due to it is important; however tunnel vision can lead you to getting your beloved champ a third peg leg at best.  Also the game is slow.  Even AI is slow, I had one bout last up to two hours.  Only down hill in pvp.At this point I would give you the positive, but I feel that if you can get over the Beware signs then you will enjoy this game.  So giving a list of all that I like and think you may like, is pointless.  If you can get over the negatives I pointed out, then you can get a great game.  However if you have any doubts I urge you to wait for a free weekend, or just not look at this again. This game is for hardcore fans, not the faint of heart.  You have to be willing to grind, where games get repetitive fast, last a while, and rewards will seem lack luster.  Also results can turn sour fast at a bad decree of the RNGods.  If you can enjoy this; then this game is for you.  If you waver at the thought, then this game is not for you.  This game is not for people that take half measures; The majority of people will not like it, but for the population that this is targeted for, then just buy it.			"

												Love the boardgame, the digital reinvents the rules into a complex, and a bit muddled mess. Never quiet feel the value of leveling with minutae % increases in abilities, whose weight in the calcation I don't quite understand. So many numbers limits immersion and abstraction. Overall, pretty good, though tedious and a bit repetitive. Recommened for true fans of numbers.			"

												Really cool game, I like how you can customize your warband, graphics look great gameplay is pretty good. I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars just for the fact it can be insanely frustrating, Missing a hit with +80% chance 5 turns in a row after taking him down to low health and losing the fight because of it can be infuriating when they are hitting their mark almost every time, I understand it's a part of the game but nevertheless it's very annoying, especially when one of your heroes loses a limb or get brain damage because of it. It kind of reminds me of X-Com that way, when you can't hit someone a foot ahead of you with very high hit %.			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is the first game I’ve played that has so much going on! I have to admit, I seriously underestimated the sheer amount of mechanics there are to think about when diving into the city of Mordheim.Not only do you need to think about the units you’re hiring but you’ve also got to consider what types of weapons they can use, stats, paying for their upkeep, completing shipments to sponsoring groups and heaps more.The StoryAfter being engaged in civil war for years, the Empire finds itself with no Emperor. Rivalling powers were in competition for control of the throne. In the Imperial year 1999, a twin tailed comet was sighted in the sky. This comet was believed to herald the return of Sigmar and bring in a new golden age. Flocks of people travelled to Mordheim, filling the city to it’s brim. With a lack of law in the city, citizens of Mordheim degenerated to giving themselves over to personal worldly temptations. An increasing state of anarchy rose within the city and the situation became worse when even more made the journey to Mordheim. Soon, the city’s streets were plagued with demons. Chaos and corruption had long since claimed the souls of the thousands who now resided in Mordheim.When the comet fell on New Years Eve, the coming of Sigmar everyone hoped for, did not happen. Instead the comet came crashing down into the city, killing all who gathered around it. Word spread that Sigmar had smitten those he judged unworthy. Mordheim was filled with fear and paranoia. But word got out that a mysterious stone had been discovered scattered throughout the city known as Wyrdstone. This stone had all sorts of qualities and vying factions would pay great deals of money for this precious stone. Soon warbands started travelling to Mordheim in hopes to make vast fortunes by finding and selling Wyrdstone.Getting StartedTo fully comprehend how to play Mordheim: City of the Damned, it’s a very good idea to start with the tutorial. At the time of writing this review there were twelve separate tutorials branching across how to do basic things such as moving around, ending your turn, and more advanced things like ambushing opponents or dodging/parrying attacks. The tutorial then goes into how to manage your warband.Getting Down To ItEach character you hire costs an initial hiring fee and require upkeep to be paid in order for them to stay in your team. If you choose not to pay for upkeep or treatment for injuries (or can’t afford it), each day that passes in the game, interest will accrue and injuries will get progressively worse. So make sure you loot that gold!Also in the warband management area is the option to customise each individual troop. You can change the look of their head gear, skin colour, armour style/colour and more. If you’re really into role-playing and coming up with your own story, there’s the option to give your characters new names and even write a biography for them. Unfortunately the biography can only be seen by you.As you will learn in the tutorial, whilst you’re in a match, each character has their own turn and can be controlled by the ‘WASD’ keys. Movement is limited by the amount of movement points a character has and attacks are also limited to a character’s combat points.There are so many ways to plan your attack on an opponent. If you have a ranged character, find an ideal position up high so you can fire down upon your enemy without running the risk of them coming over to you next turn and beating your♥♥♥♥♥♥down. Otherwise you can just run straight in and start pummelling an opposing unit as many times as you can.Once your turn is over, depending on how many movement/combat points you have left, you can change to a dodge, parry or ambush position. Dodge will give you a higher chance to dodge, parry gives a higher chance to parry, and ambush will force your character to charge at an enemy who ends up within your ambush range. Be careful how you use the ambush range, as you could easily make up the extra gap between you and a horde of the opposition’s team, and ultimately lose a character.When a troop dies, your team’s morale decreases. If your team’s morale falls below forty percent of it’s maximum, your team leader undergoes a leadership test. Should your leader be out of action, the test falls to your team’s hero. Henchmen cannot take the leadership test, therefore if your leader and hero are both OOA, the team will “route”. Routing basically means a loss for you.If the leadership test is passed, you can continue fighting. Should it fail, your warband will route. With this in mind, if you prefer to deal as much damage as you can to the opposition, try to refrain from taking out the enemy leader or hero. Take out the henchmen first and then focus on the remaining troops who can undergo a leadership test.Don’t Panic, Chaos is at Work! AKA RNG GaloreMordheim: City of the Damned combat relies heavily on RNG (random number generator). As everyone who has played a game with RNG mechanics knows, percentages aren’t necessarily something you should get excited or disappointed over. A ninety-five percent chance to successfully attack an opponent can miserably fail… quite often as well. But then again a five percent chance to parry an attack can very likely be a success. Of course it’s all down to luck, but then again sometimes it can feel like luck is always against you but completely on the side of your opposition.RNGs can often be the difference between your team routing or winning a match, but other factors can also hinder you such as hidden traps. Scattered randomly among the procedurally generated stages are a number of hidden traps. These traps can be quite frustrating, especially if you end up running through an area that you know will most likely give you an annoying debuff, but forget, and end up doing it anyway.Progressing Your WarbandEach member of your warband gains experience for doing different things. For example, performing the attack that puts an enemy out of action will net your troop an extra bit of XP. After reaching a set amount of XP your warband members will go up a level. Levelling up provides them with points to go towards attributes. There are quite a few attributes to build up which provides even more strategic planning.Some stats might increase your chance to attack successfully, whilst others will increase your dodge or parry chance. Because of the vast range of stats to increase when levelling up your warband, you can have one troop specifically designed for long-range fighting whilst another can be decked out to become a supreme spell caster.Don’t Forget to TipYou’re probably thinking, “So what’s with this whole Wyrdstone business?”. Wyrdstones work as a currency to purchase certain things as well as a commodity to send to your “sponsors” or primary faction. Each warband has a primary faction that requires a certain weight of Wyrdstones to be delivered to them within a set period of time. Along with the primary faction are extra sponsors you can build your reputation with.However, if you leave your primary faction wanting and miss a shipment, your warband will disband. All gone. Poof in a cloud of smoke. Start again. Essentially this is game over. Game over will also occur if your leader dies from injuries, so yet another reason to horde that gold.Final ThoughtsIf you think you’re ready to tackle an advanced game such as this, Mordheim: City of the Damned is a great investment. But if you’re new to intensely customisable strategy games, but are prepared to learn, Mordheim: City of the Damned also does a great job at taking you by the hand in it’s tutorials.Read the full review[gamereviewsau.com] "

												Im loving this game so far. I have not had any of the issues that were detailed in the negative reviews, in fact I almost passed this one by becuase of the reviews. As far as I can remember back playing the tabletop version , this is just about spot on in returning that experience to me, and alot of great memories of bringing my then early teen son into the hobby. That first warband you create , use it to learn the basics, but do not get attached. Now ive got a Reiklander band and a Possesed Band and they are life takers! The only problem im having is that the urge to keep tweeking and playing my warbands is all consuming , and I have to force myself to take breaks from the game. Take the time to make the adjustments in the options to suit you and have fun ! Im playing on a HP Pavillion laptop that I got a week ago, with no issues . I purchased the two DLC heros and the smuggler is in my  Reiklander warband the "" Red Blades"". She is a badass! And often saves the day despite twice having Brain damage from combat (one of which times she had an arrow stuck in her head while still fighting, the second occurrence being when she wandered too far at my request, and got jumped by the Sisters of Sigmar, luckily I got her some help in time ) Ive yet to make a Skaven band to use the Globadier with, also Globadiers can work for possesed warbands as well. The smuggler can work for the Sisters of Sigmar likewise. To the Devs, thanks for a great game!  I look forward to the upcomming warbands !			"

												Someone finally nailed tabletop gaming.If you played Modheim on the tabletop. Or Warhammer FB/40k. Or D&D. Or any other tactical miniature game on the table you recall hours spend crafting the perfect hero, squad, army. You had dream of how it would perform on the table, visions of fantasy glory. But often the game itself would get bogged down in rules and pitched battles would take hours to complete. The Mordheim successfully captures the enthrawling character/army building process and then pairs it with a very engaging, fluid combat system. You can build, fight, die, and build again several times in one evening. The mechanics are intuitive and easy to grasp but deeply tactical with enough RNG to harken back to those days around the table when a brilliant plan went spectacularly bad or a horrible idea went astonishingly good. I would love to see more races and more units, though there is a very healthy selection of themes, tactics, and strategies available now. And I would love to see a support tournament and league mode, which would further recreate our collective tabletop experience. The bottom line is this: late at night, after my family is asleep and my adult responsibilities are done, I can load up this game and push minis across the most beautiful city of the damned ever assembled. No organization, no preplanned event nights, no massive amount of money and time invested in collecting and painting. How perfect is that?			"

I think this adds to the game.The game may be a bit monotomous, but I find it to be a lot of fun.			"

												A turn-based tactical game featuring no manual save, a Warhammer fantasy setting, heavy combat RNG, and an obnoxious inventory/side objective system.The RNG can really make this frustrating, even if you escape an ecounter with a win it can feel more like a loss when a lot of your soldiers end up heavily wounded in need of a few days resting period and money to get him that medical help.I can forgive the RNG and no manual save because the title advertises itself as extremelly cruel and punishing, but what i'm not sure I can get used to is the side objectives that I mentioned earlier, having to stall fights to send troops running around the map just to collect a bit of loot is beyond annoying, and from what i've seen (please correct me if i'm wrong) I couldn't stack Wyrdstone so you have to send someone who's inventory isn't already full and most of the characters i've gotten have about 3-4 slots to fill. Some plus sides:Great audio and visuals, the music and environments blend well with the grim dark setting of Warhammer.Lot of skills/attributes for your warband troops with a bit of customization looks wise. If there was a middle ground review option I would go with that but for right now, i'll recommend it on sale to masochists and lovers of Warhammer.			"

												So when I started out in this game I thought that maybe the naysayers had it right as it seemed ludicrously difficult, but 33 hours in and I love it.  It took me seven warbands to even get out of the blocks but that is becasue it is a learning experience.  Now I've got the hang of how to bring my squad together and focussing on preparing the battle ground that I want I can make pretty good progress.  That said it is still not a case of rinse and repeat.  If I make a mistake I get punished, and severley.  Yes the RNG can be punitive but it cuts both ways - Hero caught out in the open about to get mashed by a leader and hero from the enemy and then my lowly archer on the roof gets a stun on both bad guys in same round.  Without RNG that could never happen - I think the game gives you more extreme highs and lows as a result but I kind of like that.My biggest problem so far is that I cannot for the life of me see how I will ever amass enough cash to be able to skill up - got tons of skill points available but never have any money to be able to apply them.  Maybe it will get better in time.  Always seem to end up in combat very quickly and get a rout before I collect a fraction of the loot.I don't know the table top game or the Lore surrounding it but I hope we get DLC where I can have Greenskin and Ork warbands.  On warbands I should add that I'm not wild about the warband representations.  I've got a chaos crew who I think look the best of the bunch.  Think the Mercenaries (particularly the starting Hero unit) look like they'd fall over if you sneezed on them and why are there now mixed gender groupings?  Got to be boys or girls.That said it's got me hooked so thumbs up.			"

												I am sure with 100's of reviews you can get a good feel playing a Workshop Videos if this game is for you. It is a board tactical turn based games with a lot to like and a lot not to like. It will infuriate you and challenge you, and rewards great strategy and knowing when to equip the right items. However, since failure is deadly in this game, especially in story campaign, many will give up, especially the novice or inter. player in that their hard work doesn't pay off. You count on luck, not skill, especially early in the game.If you adore strategy games, turn base games, there is a lot graphically to like, but I caution the cons.PROSA: Like X-com wonderful camera perspective in this game. It is in your face graphics and terrific action finishing sequencesB: Simple puzzle solving and map planningC: PC controller friendly with instant switching from mouse to controllerD: Nice customization, terrific factions which I am sure more DLC factions to come, the dead and knights, and fun skills and abilities to matchE: Fun storymodes for all factionsCONS and there are a bunchA: The lack of save kills your replayablity-Your faction continues like it or not. You don't get do overs. You will get death, dismemberment and cruel ailments if you fall. Now inter. and expert gamers may love this, but novice gamers, may not. Really up to your style. A novice player will get extremely frustrated because he will feel unrewarded for properly distributing skills, armors and positioning. It is all dice rolls. B: It is simple Stratego Flag positioning, Rock, Paper, Scissors and luck. Have 95% and higher hit rates and miss which gauls me to no end.C: One of my biggest issues is armors are useless, because of Armor Penetration, swords rule and again not rewarded at all for armors. They are adjusting this somewhat, but swords still rule.D: Heavy Weapons which can do so much damage, have too many negatives to warrant use. For example, you can have this mighty hammer and have an initiative penalty, tire and get just destroyed by dual weaponry with high initiative, agility and armor penetration, no sense.  Attacking 2-3 times will nullify heavy armored units. Heck with 2 times, wait till u fight bosses that hit u endlessly you having 95% dodge. That BS I quit moment. E: Early your range members are awful. F:  The game needed more complextion in its choices, A Diplomacy section, Proper Medical Section where u can interact and have strategic value to it, strategized goals or have great scenes of resolvement to the character you invested in. In faction character interactions, treason, more inventive skill chocies etc. Adding more player choices, would have enhanced the core or rock, paper, scissors. It honors the board game but it is stuck in that mechanic. Game lacked in game depth.G: Another killer is the objectives in missions are pointless in any battle. Collecting material mid battle is a waste since all you have to do is let them collect them and kill them to get the goals. See? makes no sense. However, player vs player different story.H: Skirmishes PVP, can get one sided quickly. Novice players may feel inferior at times.OVERALL: I can only give my take on it. I would wait as I did till Mordheim is less that 10 bucks and try it. I got it a 75% it's not worth it at full price. There is a wonderful beginners tutorial in workshop and if you wanted to try it. If you love Mordheim, that is great. Nothing I will say will change your mind. I found the battles to get too redundant, and even as the party grows, it is all gang up warfare. I do think this game will be improved upon in either another version or additions. It is possible they add some missing mechanics and elements, but don't hold your breath. Also follow the system requirements, lower older machines may not handle the game well. Mordheim is a good start. So some love hate here.MY SCORE: 3 of 5 stars-passing.			"

												Game is hard which is good. I wish developers would implement weapon proficiencies... I saw one guy complained about high speed skaven warbands etc... but that's also thier strengh.. when a  skaven is clobberd by a sister with a two handed maul it also takes half its hp but im not crying about that.. Like most games the warpands have strengths an weaknesses play which ever is your style. I've enjoyed the game greatly thus far But we need more war bands!!! give the community the basic warbands in the original book pleaase.			"

												This game is a 3D Hardcore, Permadeath, Final Fantasy Tactics. You are encouraged to play slow and tactically. If you rush in your character will die. But I love this game! There are many intense moments, where you don't know if the risk that you took with over extending to pick up a Wyrdstone was worth it or not until the end of the round. Your characters are EXPENDABLE as much as you would love to keep them and in perfect health. If you play cautiously, you will die less, but get less rewards, and vice versa. Sometimes the RNGesus is not in your favor and sometimes it is. A lot of people highlight the horrible moments they had in the game that caused them never play the game again or ALT+F4 the game. I have been there too, but i get sucked right back in after im over it. This game is like Licorice or Cilantro. You either HATE IT or you LOVE IT. Much like the Dark Souls Series. There is a steep learning curve, but once you get past that it's awesome. If you are on the fence, i say buy it, then give it about 3-5 hours, if you love it, keep it, if you hate it, Steam's refund policy is awesome. Welcome to Mordheim............. City of the Damned!

												The main problem of this game is its own potential.Imagine Valkyria Chronicles: Warhammer.With custom characters, more skills and deeper mechanics. Also true in nature to the Warhammer Universe and its TT predecessor.And its brutal. Not only to you, but also your enemy. But in the end you are the one to live with those failed charges (69!)This is what this game is at its best.But be aware of its ugly side:Clunky Movement and user interfaceLacking minimap and no free camera, also no replays.Labyrinthine (and not in a fun way!) maps with lots of clipping Small Namepool!Overpriced (for what is delivered)In my  opinion pros outweigh the cons like 65/35So its a clunky hard deep adaption.This was wrtitten after the Free Weekend with about 15 hours of playtime.

												Excellent game.  There is a learning curve but this is sped up by reading through the tutorial mission.  The game ios hard at first as your warband has no abilities yet.  I notice people reviewing this poorly with 8 hours played, etc.  I would honestly ignore those reviews as it takes longer than that to really get to know this game.  The different factions all add good replay value as well as dictating how you approach missions as fighting the Sisterhood is vastly different than fighting the Skaven or the Undead.  The hardcore aspect where characters can be maimed or die adds consequence and grit to this game and adds to the feeling that you are managing characters rather than pixels.  If you are looking for a challenge with tons of play value for a very reasonable price then you can't beat this title.			"

												I dont write too many reviews unless the is incredibly bad or amazing. This game is the latter.. AMAZING. Mordheim takes the combat system of Valkyria: Chronicles, the unit customization of X-Com, psychology system of darkest dungeon, the unforgivability of an Ironman Mode and throws into a interesting story with an immersive atmosphere. As a note, I'm not a fan of 40k/warhammer etc. and have never played the tabletop.. Yet I love this game. I'd write more but I linked a video below that says it all.TL;DR -Pro's -RPG progressionGreat Combat SystemUnit Movement is intuitiveIn-game Currency/Management system is well balanced PvP is intenseReal concequencesGood StoryAmazing AesteticsImmersive atmosphereGood Customization of UnitsCons -AI is stupidSteep Learning CurveIronman ModeContinuous Autosave prevents you from taking back a mistake

There is a very steep learning curve which may put off the majority of casual players. I went through about 30 hours of loosing my entire warband (4 restarts) and having to start all over before I finally achieved a successful combination of soldiers. Of course once I learned the basics.. exploiting the AI became incredibly easy. 98% success rate on missions. Which leaves PvP for the challenge, and yes it is a challenge with real rewards and real consequences.The Ironman mode you will find yourself in is Unforgiving. If your character gets critically hit (your standard high dmg crit in any game) he will suffer a permanent injury. By permanent injury, I mean he will loose an eye and have -10% chance to hit for the rest of the game, or loose an arm and never be able to dual wield or use a 2hander. He could loose a leg and never be able to climb again (Which is really important in this game). You will find yourself becoming the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ company man and firing any worker who gets hurt lol.The movement system is amazing, just like in valkyria chronicles. You will recieve strategy points which can be used for certain types of active skills (Parry stance, climb, leap, jump down, etc.) or for movement. Each character has it's own movement radius based on his agility stats and gear equiped. Movement itself consumes 1 point giving you a radius to within, moving past the radius consumes another strategy point automatically. Early in the game you will have 4-6 strategy points while fully leveled up characters will have 7-12 points. Didnt get to the position you wanted this turn? Simply run back through your waypoints and get your Strategy points refunded.The combat system is amazing			"

												EDIT (26/10/16): A good number of the issues/bugs mentioned below have been fixed with the latest Patch 9, thus enabling the player to continue the game smoothly. Here I would once again like to thank the devs who responded in a timely manner and were able to put out a well constructed fix. As it was never my original intent to malign well designed turn based games if they do not suffer from lethal bugs, I am happy to flip this review to Recommended as Mordheim did provide me with many hours of suspenseful challenge and fun, in particular the story campaign missions.P/S - I got a message that flipping the review would erase ratings and would just like to note for the record that before this flip 9/20 found it helpful>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>This a really intriguing tactical game with good depth, many colorful classes featuring a myriad of skills, steeped in heady Warhammer lore and bearing moody graphics, which is unfortunately greatly marred by a horrid user interface that clips and hides text/figures and can even render certain story mission icons non visible in the majority of the resolutions chosen. The way in which deployments are handled: having to press A/D repeatedly to even place 1 unit properly is beyond tedious and there is no simple way to check the whole list of enchantments you have besides clicking on every enchantable slot.However the most damning thing about the game is that it still bears many horrid random bugs that unfortunately render it unplayable for the luckless. One such bug involves a random ""Round 1"" freeze where the only way out of it is to abandon battle, thereby taking automatic injury rolls on all warband members, quite likely resulting in permadeath or permanent injuries. Yes, as there are no separate save/load files, such a bug effectively completely cripples a once promising warband through no fault of the player. To add insult to injury, after such a bug, you might also find your inventory completely emptied through some form of file corruption. Another deadly bug involves a character getting stuck in a position in another character's zone of control whereby no actions may be taken and the game cannot proceed even if it's the player's turn. Once again the only choice is to abandon the battle and face the above penalties, which may well mean complete warband decimation and loss of many hours of play.Of course there are also the numerous crashes to desktop and issues with Directx 11 and many many more and all of these issues are well documented in the bug subforums here. The issues I've highlighted barely even scratch the first page of said bug forum and there are literally 1.8k threads there.There is the mark of a great game here and a persistent warband concept with hardcore leanings where mistakes are poorly tolerated and where it is fun to pick your battles/deployments well and to carefully manage your way to the top. But unless you don't mind seeing literally everything taken away in an instant because the game decided to throw you a random bug, I would suggest trying other turn based games. I reserve the right to flip this review when all these issues have been fixed but seeing as it has been nearly a year since this game has been out and had a fairly long beta testing phase before that, I doubt the bugs and UI issues are going away anytime soon.

												Unforgiving, Brutal, RNG heavy. These are the core of most complaints that I have seen, and they are all true. However if you are a fan of games like X-Com, Darkest Dungeon and Blood Bowl; This is a fine addtion to your library. The high amount of customization availible for your warband members helps to make each warband distinct and personal. If you are a fan of the games named earlier, I do think you would do well to give Mordheim a look.			"

								I Only got a chance to play 1 skirmish but already I'm hooked. At the moment there are only 2 pre made warbands but its still plenty fun and is a really refreshing take on turn based combat. The atmosphere is gritty, the graphics are great. Once everything is added, which doesnt look like it will be long, such as character progression, items, campaigns its truley going to be an amazing game.I only played the table top version a couple times but this looks like it will be a great port from tabletop to video game.It has a few niggely bugs, mostly camera bugs (looking at walls etc) but towards the end of my first game I suffered a bit of packet loss and the game never recovered and i had to end processUpdate:I've played a couple more games with a friend and its still great fun but also frustrating. Although you dont see any ""dice rolls"" you still fail at times and can do nothing but condemn RNGesus.Since they have released the warbands compendium which has explained a couple of things to me I finally managed to get ahead in a game as the Skaven. I'm ahead on kills. All my monstrous creature needs to do is kill the mercenery leader and his buddy. First turn he fails his stupidity check, the next turn he misses all 3 84% attacks and promptly gets ♥♥♥♥♥ slapped in the face. It was a total turn around.The whole line of sight system and ambush moves works really well. Watching my opponent walk into 2 tanged overwatch skavens and a melee is too satisfying. A perfectly executed ambush. I cant wait for the progression and loot system to be introduced.Another bug: My rat ogre was able to walk into a building through the doorway (just) but once he was in, he wasnt getting out :(			"

												Solid Game, Turn based, Stratagy,I have played this game for about a week now and have zero regrets in purchasing it. If you are a stratagy/tactics and warhammer fan this is a fantastic game for you. This is a thinking persons game, its not a shooter or an action game it is fairly slow paced and methodical. if you dont use stratagy and tactics this game will be very frustrating for you. The AI isnt all that smart, but it is extreamly agressive, and can be very brutal when your not prepaired for it (learn to use this against it) even on the average dificuly maps.PROS:- Solid game, very few bugs- fluid turn based gameplay- Challenging- good graphics and soundCONS:- early game can be pretty brutal- AI is agressive, but not all that smart (see above)- game modes are limited, very little variation except in story missions where you see some unique objectives- warband customization is limited (I.E unit types)- warband members can suffer permant injuries/death (as well as item/gear loss on being downed in combat) "

												One of the most frustrating, yet satisfying games I have ever played. I haven't been so addicted since the original release of ""Civ II."" I actually wake up at 5am excited to get an extra hour of playtime before the day starts. There is a lot of randomness, and you will die. It keeps you coming back to prove you can do it better. Sort of like ""Darkest Dungeon,"" that way. Turn-based combat in most games tends to have top-down views and less impressive graphics, which keep you feeling removed and God-like as you orchestrate the strategy from afar. Mordheim feels like a polished third person adventure...only slower. You only get the point of view of the character whose turn it is, and the enemy is often hidden. It's very real and the art is excellent. After every battle, you get the option to equip, upgrade, and customize your party; hire or fire new members; and sell your booty. Your skill choices are permanent and will greatly influence how effective your team becomes. The costume and character design is very well done: dark, gritty, practical, and aesthetically pleasing. I want to give a hug to whoever designed the Sisters faction. They look like real women. No ridiculous swaths of skin exposed. No gigantic boobs. The leader has a pudgy, matronly face that I adore. This game is probably not for everyone. If you don't have patience and a passion for strategical planning, best to steer clear. Personally, this is one of the best things I've ever discovered.			"

												This is, at least for me, exactly what I'm looking for in a Games Workshop game. Turn based strategy, cool level progression, lots of customization. It's close to the table top games people love. All the warbands have their own stregnths and weaknesses. I only wish there were more warbands to choose from. With the endless font of crap GW vomits up this one stands out as a gem. I'm very looking forward to Necromunda, hopefully they keep the things that make this game great. This game is quite difficult, so I only recommend it if you enjoy a challenge. Expect your first couple warbands to join the corpses strewn about the Mordeheim landscape, but the first time you actually reach endgame will feel like a huge accomplishment. Many people complain about the game feeling unfair, their guys missing repeatedly with an 80% chance to hit. However 80% isnt 100 and you will hit about 8 out of 10 times. Its all about positioning, using your tanks to block and hold units while you surround and destroy others with your damage classes. The only thing that seems kind of weak to me is the magic, you're better off equipping your mages with 2 handed weapons and actually doing damage... but then I was never much of a magic player, maybe someone else figured out how to make the most of it.Highly recommend this game. Its atmospheric and immersive, and you actually come to love your units. I recommend giving them all unique names and backstory to enhance your gaming experience. Please GW, more of this, stick with this developer, we would love it if you put out more high quality games like Mordeheim than the endless stream of garbage we have been getting.For those of you having trouble, a couple tips. Keep your warband together. Don't even take missions that split your warband up (particularly the ones that split you into 3 small groups) Make sure to keep your lighter damage units behind your heavy tanks, resist the urge to use their faster movement to take them out front. When you set up ambushes make sure that they don't end up pinching the enemy in a doorway where you can't surround them. Impressive units can be a real problem if they wind up in the middle of your warband where they can create absolute havoc. Try to use the alleys and doorways to trap enemy impressives, as the AI won't be able to get them unstuck. Above all never engage anyone alone, especially with your leader and heroes. They are too valuable to risk, disengage and run to your minions who are expendable. Don't spend money on the minons until late game, if some of your units have to die, better them than your Bosses and heroes.You really have to invest some time to make your warband great. Don't give up after an hour or two of playing the game, and really try to go for the extra objectives, as getting them will make your levels spring forward.			"

												Every update this game becomes more and more like what I originally hoped it would be. Pros +It's a Mordheim video game, and it is good. If you understand what that means, this should be an auto-purchase. +First person turn based works awesomely, I've never seen it done like this before and I think it really fits the game. The developers clearly put a lot of work into those environments (They look amazing) and first person really compliments that well.+All 4 Warbands are interesting and fun in their own way. Even the humans (Very rare for GW media)+Good variety of skills/spells, good character progression as well. It's fairly similar to XCom +Vertical movement almost as important as horizontal. Very unique to Mordheim I think, and its very fun+Fun as ♥♥♥♥. Really the most important thing.+I'd imagine finding a group of people to play a large scale multiplayer campaign (Like you could on the tabletop) would be fun. I don't have any friends though, so that's just me theorizingCons-Only 4 war bands without that many kinds of units. -Campaign nothing special (not that this is meant to be played for the story lol) collecting wyrdstone can be annoying and they make you do it-The UI is very strange and almost feels like it was designed for consoles? I'm hoping more war bands come out soon, because right now that's really the big flaw for me. There simply isn't enough variety within warbands themselves to justify only having 4 and calling this a finished game.			"

												Long story short: Solid strategy game with clearly defined factions, great progression, challenging and good lookin'. The UI and camera might be tricky at times. Might not be as polished as Valkyria Chronicles, but definetly an immersive and satisfying experience with its own flavor. The units look good, feel good, items and armor are really well made and the game opens a whole lot of tactical possibilities that only increase in depth as the game progresses. If you want to be nitpicky, go ahead, but you might miss out on an otherwise great game.Also, a lot of people complain about the RNG. People seem to either forget what tabletop games with dice look and feel like or have missed out on that experience altogether. Yes, there is plenty of RNG and yes, it can be ruthless. But then again it's not chess.			"

												Challenging without being overwhelming.  The RNG is a bit cruel, but lasting consequences add to the excitement.  Solid game, with minimal crashes in the course of over 400 hours of play.  No faction is perfect, but all six - with the DLC - have solid advantages and opportunites to make their quirks turn any battle.  Highly recommended for any Warhammer fan.			"

												This is a short first impressions after playing the game for just under 2 hours (during the free weekend). The short conclusion is the game is good and very fun showing lots of potential, with a couple of critical issues that might put off a few people (in terms of gameplay and design decisions). Longer version - the game is solid. Indepth party system where you can make your warband anything you want as the time goes on and the level of customisation is impressive. I can see that over a campaign, players could really bond with their little toy soldiers through unique experiences. Feels like this might be better done that even something like Xcom. The strategy in it is good and overall reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles (VC) without the obnoxious cutscenes, overbearing story and general animeness. The missions have an interesting way about them and you have to balance danger, party ability, demands for resources and local mission requirements making for an interesting risk reward system that relies on your ability to command. Feels very organic, though I cant say how it will last in the long run. Basically - the actual gameplay of the game is satisfying and I enjoyed it a lot.There are a couple problems here though. The UI is, in a word, crap. Mouse+keys or gamepad (I actually found gamepad more viable in mission mode due to some weird camera acceleration, but mouse in the menus) - its all really clunky. Lots of small windows with masses of stats and info. Very cool for showing all you want to know - but it is pretty intimidating at first and then its just a bit messy. This is all forgettable, however. My biggest issue, as many already have pointed out - the AI turns are dull as hell. For around a third of most rounds youll be stuck watching the back of your last soldiers head as all the AI units move about unseen on the map. This takes a long time. Genuinely - the game has an unreasonable amount of downtime between your movements and I found myself feeling as if my time was being wasted. Comparing to the peers, VC shows you all the enemy troops off the getgo and you see their moves - feels like youre part of the game. Xcom has pretty quick turns and some feedback in the form of sound waves (helped by the isometric view). Here its just ""wait for a couple minutes till the AI is done and then get back to playing"". Its annoying and actually detracts from an otherwise fun strategy experience. Finally - Im not into WH lore so I dont know about the fanbase, but the factions of offer were a bit bland and samey from a first look. Humans, different kind of humans, a 3rd kind of humans, a 4th kind of humans (now posessed by chaos) and ratmen. Doesnt exactly feel like the creative muscles were stretched there.  Ultimately - I liked what I saw so far and will finish off my free weekend with it to see further in. People who like turn based tactics games a-la Xcom will enjoy this, especially if they like the WH fantasy universe (Im ambivalent to it, but the game suits the setting well). People who are used to faster games will probably find this too restrictive. An overall thumbs up from me, but the long AI turns combined with a messy interface could genuinely make this a dealbreaker. Ive yet to see. I recommend looking up videos and maybe finding someone who already has the game to see if the issues ive pointed to matter to you. If they dont, get the game - youll have fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Still in early access, but they seem to be making pretty good progress with it.The progression (Campaign) is already in the game a bit and takes the form of running what amount to skirmish missions (Kill or route the enemy team with some optional objectives) with story missions placed in that you have to run skirmish missions to rank up for.The game is a tactical RPG, instead of both sides taking turns, each unit has an ""initiative"" score that determines when it is it's turn to move.Movement is free flowing and controlled by WASD keys. You can move a certain amount of points in any direction, with unlimited backtracking (As long as you aren't overwatched/ambushed/trapped) until you confirm the movementA loot system is within the game, and before and after each battle, you will need to deal with the warbands equipment and stats/skills.The setting is pretty neat, it takes place within an Empire city that was destroyed by a Chaos meteor that has strewn valuable Warpstones all over the city.Each of the current 4 warbands has a neat play-style and reason for being within Mordheim.Sisters of Sigmar: Heavily armored nuns that lack ranged weaponry. They are trying to purge the city and destroy the Warpstone.Reiklander Mercenaries: Medium to heavy armored humans that have an abundance of ranged weaponry. They are trying to collect the warpstone to sell to other Human nations.Cult of the Possessed: Mutants and Demons that are fairly medium to heavily armored, they lack good ranged weaponry, but make up for it with a variety of neat mutations and mechanics. They are trying to collect all the Warpstone to appease their god.Skaven douches: Light armored mostly, dodge everything, and moves all the ♥♥♥♥ing time. They want the warpstone cause they are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or something.The persistent injury system is very unique, a unit going down in a battle is not the end of the world, and very easy to recover from. Often they may not even die, but can be effected by a variety of injuries that alter the way they play.And example is my Chaos Magistrate who originally started out as a caster...well..a blow to the head has convinced him he is actually a god, and only ever uses melee weapons now...thought I should fire him, but damn, he is making it work.Any-who, I enjoy the game.

								It is really refreshing to see this game aiming to stay so true to the original Mordheim games' rules. The turn-based action in this game really brings to life the strategy that was such a part of the game in its tabletop format. The game is not without its issues and bugs, it is still in early release, but I am very excited to see how this unfolds. So far, there are only two playable warbands and you have no customization available, however, in the tutorial two other warbands are revealed and the potential behind the campaign customization is viewable. I am curious to know how they will balance offline and online play and as to whether a warband can engage in either or if it will be restricted to one. Either way, I think anyone who ever engaged in Games Workshops' Mordheim had best take a serious look at this game and even if you never did, it is a great game if you are into strategy and tactics.

												An underrated gem of a game. An absolute must-play for any fans of TBS, RPG, or the Warhammer universe. The various factions are unique in their playstyles and motivations ensuring countless hours of replayability. It is a bit of a niche title, the initial difficulty may scare some players away, but if is worth enduring the initial learning curve in order to truly experience Mordheim. I am very impressed with the story missions of the game, which add much more incentive to continue with a warband in the campaign. I am also impressed with all of the DLC to date, it all adds to the experience and is reasonably priced for what it provides. My only concerns with this game would have to be the occasionally flawed A.I. and RNG, and just a lack of players for the multiplayer base. One of those two is easily solved by buying the game and joining in on the fun, I sincerely hope the community continues to grow, I am absolutely in love with this game.			"

								This games looks like it is coming along great!  I can tell that there is much more to come and that they are spending some time on balancing.  Have played a few games with my buddy and I think the Cult are a little overpowered.  Sisters had 77% or better to hit on them and they missed all but 2 attacks in melee?  My buddy playing Skaven failed most of his climb and jump checks which just didn't make sense to me.  Overall reminded me of rolling poorly nonstop at the gamestore I used to play Mordheim at! LOL  Only question I have really is when will Sisters of Sigmar get thier whips?! =) Overall I think they hit the right feel for Mordheim.  The play controls once learned are good.

												One of the most frustrating, yet satisfying games I have ever played. I haven't been so addicted since the original release of ""Civ II."" I actually wake up at 5am excited to get an extra hour of playtime before the day starts. There is a lot of randomness, and you will die. It keeps you coming back to prove you can do it better. Sort of like ""Darkest Dungeon,"" that way. Turn-based combat in most games tends to have top-down views and less impressive graphics, which keep you feeling removed and God-like as you orchestrate the strategy from afar. Mordheim feels like a polished third person adventure...only slower. You only get the point of view of the character whose turn it is, and the enemy is often hidden. It's very real and the art is excellent. After every battle, you get the option to equip, upgrade, and customize your party; hire or fire new members; and sell your booty. Your skill choices are permanent and will greatly influence how effective your team becomes. The costume and character design is very well done: dark, gritty, practical, and aesthetically pleasing. I want to give a hug to whoever designed the Sisters faction. They look like real women. No ridiculous swaths of skin exposed. No gigantic boobs. The leader has a pudgy, matronly face that I adore. This game is probably not for everyone. If you don't have patience and a passion for strategical planning, best to steer clear. Personally, this is one of the best things I've ever discovered.			"

												This is a Warhammer tabletop game conversion into a video game. And it is amazing. Hailing form GamesWorkshop. Into the grim dark Warhammer world, this game really immerses and sets the enviromental/atmosphere of the tabletop and fantasy world. I don't think they could of done better with that aspect. The music is eerie and the maps of Mordheim itself are rather halloween gone dark.  Nothing is happy and yay, but grim, dark and pulsing chaos mutations growing on the walls kinda thing. ITS GREAT. With buildings and walkways all over the maps, it really does feel like a city gone to ghost town and believable. Choose to make a warband out of 5 possible factions. Chaos, Skaven, Empire, Sisters of Sigmar and Witchhunters.  Within each warband you get characters to make thus warband. Choose a hero and a leader that will be the mainstay and backbone of your army. You only get one of each and this is where you can really design what your warband will be capable of or designed to do in game. ( If you are going kinda ranged or melee or spellcasting )Then you get henchman. Henchman are the simple guys that you get more out of their numbers then your ''one man army'' characters. You do get to custimize names and outfits and really make the warband personal, so dont be afraid to! Also the RPG aspect of the game of leveling your warband as individauals and as a warband is there. Equipment is important and make sure you got your warband in tip top shape before you venture out!  So in Mordheim; CIty of the Damned,  you have the  controlling your warband- leveling them up , equiping them and learning skills and paying the henchmen, a shop- to buy/sell equipment for your warband, Skirmish -where you can do fights against other online warbands, Vetern-where your compiled expereince and acheivments and such, from all your warbands lets you spend and upgrade points that all your warbands gain access too. Then the two big points is the campign and your shipments. The whole point of the game and your warband is to steal, pillage plunder wyrdstone. The missions are played in tactical turn based combat style. It's extremely unforgiving and you need to make some tough dicisions. There is alot fo rolling dice going on with the attacks and defence. Extreme luck and randomness happens. Magic? HAHA well remember that things dont always happen the way you want to... Map awareness is to be learned and your warband to work together as a team. Cliche? yes, but men stay dead when they die and loot can be more vauable then life! Wyrdstone is what your fighting over and killing/stealing from the other warbands from in missions in the campign mode. All the missions are about gaining these goods so you can make shipments to your supreme leader/god/king. Making shipments and doing missions is good for your warband and the'll level up and equipment and your warbands numbers will grow. FAILURE to get your hands on the green rocks and dying in combat, makes perminant injurys to your warband and will make life harder for you to complete more missions. After failing to ship out the wyrdstone up to 4 times, your warbands and your life is forfit and die. GRIM? Well its Warhammer. The game is to be hard, and to experince the stress and toll pillaging and killing can be. For good or bad, its a tough life. SO, can you keep your warband together? Think you have the leadership to be succesful in the pit, deseased rotten Mordheim ? With creepy music and lots of screaming/blood animations in combat, this game is as dark as it goes. Referances to Dunes '' The spice must flow'' comes to mind while playing this game...			"

												I'm reluctant to thumbs-down this because there are some very cool elements to this game. I dig the character building to an extent, but it's pretty rudimentary. There's so many skills on display, but you can't access them. Overall, there's so much depth to the game, and yet it feels so shallow--why? I want to like this game. I really do. Even though I'm not a huge fan of the muddled universe that is Warhammer, the concept of this game is great.That being said, it's just too poorly executed. Mordheim suffers from a similar problem that XCOM 2 has, where the AI not only takes far too long to make a decision, but it always ends up doing the most obvious lemming-esque choice. If you're just gonna keep auto-attacking, why do you need more than a couple seconds to figure it out? To top it off, while the animations *do* look nice, they have this weird ending lag where the characters are just kind of awkwardly staring at each other after one just bashed the other in the face with a flail. Everything just takes too damn long. You know it's a problem when you feel more relieved being out of combat not because you achieved a victory, but because you're bored. In sum, though, I'll say this:PROS:* Character customization, building your own team is always fun.* Solid animation.* Cool art overall, as one would expect from Warhammer, it's a dark universe.* Playable with both KBM and controller, button callouts change as you swap between them.* Decent soundtrack and voice acting.CONS:* AI takes too long.* So much to learn, but so little to do with it.* Environments are fairly bland, but hey, it's Warhammer.* Witch Hunters are DLC, yet they stand prominently in character select, dead center, and highlighted as if they're playable. That's kind of an insult to gamers. Like, if I were to boot up Diablo 3 or something, go to make a new character, and, say, I wanna make a Witch Doctor or something--nope, sorry, you have to pay $2.99 first! That's a super special DLC character! Why stop there? Make every character/warband/what-have-you DLC!All in all, if this is your cup of tea, try it and see if you like it. The game is *almost* mechanically sound, and has some redeeming qualities, but I'll pass on this snooze-fest.			"

Each warband has its own up's and down's so you can expand how you approach battles with a different feel every time. As with every game some improvements could be done but for what the game is its worth it as no game is perfect i would recommend it but if you can wait till it on sale thats better.			"

It has all the hallmarks of the type of game that I like - turn based tactical, multiplayer - unit rostering and customisation ( both yet to be implemented) and a variety of gear/equipment (yet to be implemented).As touched on above, there is a lot of work required to bring this game to anywhere near a ready state and there are a lot of issues/bugs that exist, although none that are game breaking.  It is an alpha so you can't expect a full product of this time but the devs advise it wont be long before a substantial patch will be added.I want to believe that this game will be one of my all time favourites.  It has the potential, and time will tell.F0x			"

												This is self torture on a high scale. Everything looks promising at first, like the original Mordeheim. But you are soon covered in♥♥♥♥♥♥ The tutorials are hard and leaves you depressed. The first mission is almost impossible. Mostly beacuse all enemies always hits you and you NEVER hit them, even if you have 75%, you miss EVERY time. I rather hit myself in the head with a hammer if I want to torture myself than play this abomination.			"

												This is a really fun adaptation of Mordheim.I've been a big fan of games like this and Inquisitor for quite a long time in table-top land, and I love the Warhammer universes. However, I will do my best to not be biased here in the hopes of helping you decide if this game is for you or not!To begin, this game is tough as nails, and can be even tougher depending which warband you pick and how you set up your team. Much like tabletop Mordheim, your future success largely in part depends on how well you do in the first few missions. If you do well, rack up lots of stuff to sell and Wyrdstone, all while hardly getting anyone injured, you should get to the part where the game becomes more manageable, even if you make a mistake and fail a mission horribly. Let me say this loud and clearly though, for every new person in the room:Melee. Trumps. Range.Yeah, you heard me. In this game, you will suffer many, many to-hit penalities. You will set up overwatch shots just slightly at the wrong angle and watch helplessly as your archer gets smashed in one round. This is a game about gangs, and what do gangs do to get the advantage? They GANG UP on a smaller number of units, normally in melee, in this case, and they pound them into the dirt. In table-top, you want to swarm enemy models and roll as many dice as possible. Missing is guaranteed, hits are god-sends, and it's the same formula here. Mostly melee (of all varities - don't be that person who goes all swords/shields and then finds themselves losing because dual-wielding rats are stabbing you in the back,) with a few good ranged units. To put it into perspective, I start like this: I immediately go to the market and see if I can buy a decent ranged weapon for my warband leader. Bow/etc is -okay-, dueling pistols/warlock pistols are what you want, though. I then slap those on my hero's alternate equipment, recruit ONE archer henchman if available (not a special character - I strongly suggest taking the melee special character first,) and then fill up on melee.Next up, optimize your weapons. Bonuses to hit, bonuses to ambush damage, parry chance, etc - all great. Heavy weapons? Best used on characters who hit well on their own. Armor is also not always the best choice for every character either. Sometimes taking that 50% dodge is the best choice you can get, and the cheapest, too.If you try the above, and play carefully (be sure to give your archer two daggers or something in their offhand, too. Archers I tend to give armor asap as well,) you should be gravy. With those first 3-4 missions done, you'll be feeling good.I bet you'll even feel great.But then?The first story mission happens.And you're in for a whole new level of hell.Don't even click on that mission until your rating is closer to what it says the enemy has. You can see this by clicking on but not accepting the mission. It will destroy your life, your warbands life, and♥♥♥♥♥♥your pockets. It really will, especially a particular few races (RNG can be really rough on the humans for that first mission. Believe me.)Graphics are decent, controls take adjusting to (your first warband is doomed to death if you're like me and mess up the controls for a bit before getting used to them,) and sometimes you will get grumpy that so-and-so enemy just charged through a narrow crack between three ambushing characters.But hey, welcome to Mordheim. It's all about luck and tenacity and a whole lot of death. Do suggest, 8.5/10, needs more races with cheaper DLC (the current price model is 'meh.')Multiplayer suggested over everything else, even if you do the one where no changes happen to your warband, but thanks to the RNG and the computer's tendency to stick to the 'gang up and pound you' strategy, even playing vs the computer can be fun.

												I found the game fun but hard to understand at first, but when you get into the game it is really good although you may get frustrated at times. Each warband has its own up's and down's so you can expand how you approach battles with a different feel every time. As with every game some improvements could be done but for what the game is its worth it as no game is perfect i would recommend it but if you can wait till it on sale thats better.			"

												This game is a ton of fun, if you like tactical games like x-com, but with a fantasy theme.  This would be great to play with friends as you get to level up your warband and you can build your own narrative around your characters, do they die in the forsaken city of morediem after a battle, do they get ransomed back to your warband, after each game any characters that die have a random thing that can happen to them even losing limbs			"

												This is a Warhammer tabletop game conversion into a video game. And it is amazing. Hailing form GamesWorkshop. Into the grim dark Warhammer world, this game really immerses and sets the enviromental/atmosphere of the tabletop and fantasy world. I don't think they could of done better with that aspect. The music is eerie and the maps of Mordheim itself are rather halloween gone dark.  Nothing is happy and yay, but grim, dark and pulsing chaos mutations growing on the walls kinda thing. ITS GREAT. With buildings and walkways all over the maps, it really does feel like a city gone to ghost town and believable. Choose to make a warband out of 5 possible factions. Chaos, Skaven, Empire, Sisters of Sigmar and Witchhunters.  Within each warband you get characters to make thus warband. Choose a hero and a leader that will be the mainstay and backbone of your army. You only get one of each and this is where you can really design what your warband will be capable of or designed to do in game. ( If you are going kinda ranged or melee or spellcasting )Then you get henchman. Henchman are the simple guys that you get more out of their numbers then your ''one man army'' characters. You do get to custimize names and outfits and really make the warband personal, so dont be afraid to! Also the RPG aspect of the game of leveling your warband as individauals and as a warband is there. Equipment is important and make sure you got your warband in tip top shape before you venture out!  So in Mordheim; CIty of the Damned,  you have the  controlling your warband- leveling them up , equiping them and learning skills and paying the henchmen, a shop- to buy/sell equipment for your warband, Skirmish -where you can do fights against other online warbands, Vetern-where your compiled expereince and acheivments and such, from all your warbands lets you spend and upgrade points that all your warbands gain access too. Then the two big points is the campign and your shipments. The whole point of the game and your warband is to steal, pillage plunder wyrdstone. The missions are played in tactical turn based combat style. It's extremely unforgiving and you need to make some tough dicisions. There is alot fo rolling dice going on with the attacks and defence. Extreme luck and randomness happens. Magic? HAHA well remember that things dont always happen the way you want to... Map awareness is to be learned and your warband to work together as a team. Cliche? yes, but men stay dead when they die and loot can be more vauable then life! Wyrdstone is what your fighting over and killing/stealing from the other warbands from in missions in the campign mode. All the missions are about gaining these goods so you can make shipments to your supreme leader/god/king. Making shipments and doing missions is good for your warband and the'll level up and equipment and your warbands numbers will grow. FAILURE to get your hands on the green rocks and dying in combat, makes perminant injurys to your warband and will make life harder for you to complete more missions. After failing to ship out the wyrdstone up to 4 times, your warbands and your life is forfit and die. GRIM? Well its Warhammer. The game is to be hard, and to experince the stress and toll pillaging and killing can be. For good or bad, its a tough life. SO, can you keep your warband together? Think you have the leadership to be succesful in the pit, deseased rotten Mordheim ? With creepy music and lots of screaming/blood animations in combat, this game is as dark as it goes. Referances to Dunes '' The spice must flow'' comes to mind while playing this game...			"

												A 3D, 3rd-Person, Turn-Based, Tactical, RPG set in the world of Warhammer Fantasy. Mordheim: City of the Damned has everything that I love in a game: a grim-dark universe rich with lore, simple controls, procedural encounters, customizable characters, and a difficulty that cannot be altered or lowered. This game is hard, not because it requires skill but because every action taken by your characters, (walking is mundane and requires no actual roll), will be resolved randomly based on a percentage of your characters' skill; this percentage will be bigger or smaller from how high the skill is required to perform that action is. This means, you, as the player, have no actual control in how well your characters perform, the most that you, as the player, will be doing is moving your characters to an enemy and telling them to attack or up to a wall and telling them to climb it, all you can do is watch and hope they succeed. The player is soley responsible for strategy on the field and building up your warband to get better percentage rolls.So let me reiterate, this game is hard, and you will become frustrated when you fail but the replayability for this game is extremely high and I advise playing as each of the available factions because they each require different types of mindsets to play them, and nothing feels better than settling with a race or faction that just speaks to you on an emotional level.Anyways, I recommend this game to anyone who is a huge fan of unforgiving turn-based random number generators, meaning if you really liked Darkest Dungeon you are gonna enjoy this. I have been playing since the Cult of the Possessed were first added during Early Access so I am very pleased with how this game has evolved.Oh and I highly recommend looking up the official lore and fluff for Warhammer Fantasy, you'll be suprised at how vast the universe can really be.Thanks for reading.

Early Access Review
								This games looks like it is coming along great!  I can tell that there is much more to come and that they are spending some time on balancing.  Have played a few games with my buddy and I think the Cult are a little overpowered.  Sisters had 77% or better to hit on them and they missed all but 2 attacks in melee?  My buddy playing Skaven failed most of his climb and jump checks which just didn't make sense to me.  Overall reminded me of rolling poorly nonstop at the gamestore I used to play Mordheim at! LOL  Only question I have really is when will Sisters of Sigmar get thier whips?! =) Overall I think they hit the right feel for Mordheim.  The play controls once learned are good.  You can really tell they are trying to make it work for controllers as well as keyboard and mouse.			"

												Fun, but be prepared for frustration.Accuracy rolls in this game seem to have no bearing whatsoever.  You'll have moments where it's impossible for you to miss and everyone will fail out on you, guaranteeing that one character you barely have still alive gets killed and in the end gets you routed from a failed leadership roll.I recommend the game because it's enjoyable, but it feels like it needs some assistance in some areas and definitely still has a few bugs to work out.

												Great Game. Fans of turn-based combat will love it.The part that was ""new"" to me is the fact that you can't save your progress, in some games also known as hardcore mode. The first and only time I played hardcore mode was Diablo 3. That brought a lot of sorrows and I swore never to play hardcore mode again. But since the reviews of this game were so good I gave it a shot. And I was not disappointed. One of the few games that are worth every cent of the price.If you like turn-based combat mixed with rpg elements, then listen to me: Buy it!			"

												Pretty fun game. A little bit of a learning curve at the start, but after a few matches you get used to it. Would like it if the Chaos mutations took how you use the characters into account instead of being completely random. Should have more factions, though I've read they're working on it. Story mode is fun, though instructions could be clearer at times. Love the setting, it's really too bad the parent company is dumping it. Probably worth getting if you like Warhammer fantasy stuff.

												Initially I wrote a negative review about this game because it spanked me and I ragequit.  I've deleted that review and persisted with the game, read some articles and learned how to play it and I have to say it's a lot of fun.  There's some rich tactical strategy to be had here.  This is a game of positioning and attempting to outmaneuver your enemy.  The combat is quite savage and I think a lot of the negative reviews would go away if the developer simply let the player decide what difficulty level they wished to play at, rather than forcing the player into the way they want the game to be played.You will get no easy, normal or hard campaign.  Each mission is rated starting at normal, hard, brutal and deadly.  Right from the get go.  The AI stays about the same but the enemies get massive buffs as the difficulty increases.  Of course, you don't have to do these hard missions.  But there are better rewards if you choose to do them.  And it's incredibly satisfying when, either by skill or luck, you win a challenging mission.There's a lot of customization of your warband and it's a lot of fun naming and making your troops into characters.  Your fighters can be injured and a couple of mine are missing arms and one now has a peg leg.  There are definite consequences in this game and no save scumming.  There's no saving at all, its all autosave and you cannot reload.I'd say this is an excellent game, but it's also very hard, there's no doubt about it and if you don't like to lose you'll have to get good if you want to survive the deadly streets of Mordheim.

												Although There is no Neutral Catagory when Rating Games, My impression of the Mordheim Game Is Neutral. on the one hand It is Challenging and Requires Thinking, LOTS AND LOTS OF THINKING. and can Be Quite Rewarding. However on the Other hand, Two of the Six Warbands Are DLC and Can be Encountered in Singleplayer; Even if you do not own the DLC, One of those Two Said Warbands is completely Game breaking and overpowered. I am Of Course referring to the Undead.the Undead are the Most Frustratingly Broken Opponents to face, and from my point of view, are so powerful that they make playing the game Rather Pointless. Their Leader Is Almost Unstoppable and their Foot soldiers Far Outstretch Everyone Else. You can Have Good Equipment and Good Strategies, but the Undead are Almost Always Even better.It is Frustrating and Sometimes even Aggrivating to Encounter these Opponents, as it makes it almost impossible to play the game and NOT get the Pre-shipped DLC that you must pay for before Using. The only way you can Even the Field is with Long Ranged Troopers. and they will Immediately get Run over by the Undead's Footmen.If you are into XCOM or any other Game like it, I would Heavily Warn you before Purchasing this Game.But Aside from the Undead, the Rest of the Warbands seem to balance each other out, The Human Mercenaries are your Run-of-the-Mill Mercs. who are almost always going to Beat the Rat-Peeps, and the Cultists who are almost always going to lose to the Sisters of Sigmar.The Witch hunters are another DLC Warband that Comes Pre-Shipped with the Game, and you can Encounter them within the Game even on Single player. I have only encountered them once, So i don't have much of an Opinion on them. "

												If you like this game i think it says more about you than the quailty of the game. I personally like it  and spent many a happy hour doing not much but ask your self do you like....1. Dice. 2. Games work shop.3. Farming crystals.4. More dice.5. Very slow easy games that arnt too taxing on the brain. 6. Darkest dungeon but you played it too much.7. Odd rules that only work in board games like hero quest and space hulk.8. Perma death.9. And dice.If the awnsers to all these is ""YES!!!"" then this is for you, but evey one else is gunna hate it and no i dont really know why i like this sort of thing i just do. ok?			"

												Whilst its quite unpolished with clunky UI, its an excelent strategy game that manages to be challenging and rewarding.I cannot stress enough that it is VERY challenging, you might get on a winning streak for a while, but one bad loss can leave your veteran soldiers permenently dead or with debilitating wounds.Whilst that sounds frustrating (and is!) it creates a brilliant atmosphere where you have to constantly judge the risk and reward of each mission, often encouraging you to use new recruits as meatshields whilst your elite troops look for safer opportunities to attack.Thankfully the game comes with a progression system so that even if your entire warband gets killed, you will have earned a bunch of bonuses to any new warbands you create which helps the difficulty not feel too opressive.in short:-A challenging game of calculated risk taking, it is not a game of certainties but rather of adapting to misfortune.-Somewhat unpolished, UI is poor and controls are unintuitive.-Fairly repetetive gameplay, there are story missions with unique objectives but the bulk of the game is within familiar streets of the city fighting against roughly equal forces.-consistently creates interesting strategic situations without clear 'best' solutions.

Solid game, with minimal crashes in the course of over 400 hours of play.  No faction is perfect, but all six - with the DLC - have solid advantages and opportunites to make their quirks turn any battle.  Highly recommended for any Warhammer fan.			"

												Disclaimer- I am playing during a free weekend, but I am also going to buy it.Mordheim is a great adaption of a tabletop skirmish game. It can feel slow, but is actually faster that the tabletop version. It is turn based and random number generation, so not for everyone. I personally love how hard and in-depth that game is, and it tells you from the beginning that it is meant as a hardcore game. If you want fast and action pacted, then this will not be your cup of tea. If you enjoy in-depth tactical and  unforgiving, think Dark Souls, but turn based, I recommend you try it.			"

												This is a short first impressions after playing the game for just under 2 hours (during the free weekend). The short conclusion is the game is good and very fun showing lots of potential, with a couple of critical issues that might put off a few people (in terms of gameplay and design decisions). Longer version - the game is solid. Indepth party system where you can make your warband anything you want as the time goes on and the level of customisation is impressive. I can see that over a campaign, players could really bond with their little toy soldiers through unique experiences. Feels like this might be better done that even something like Xcom. The strategy in it is good and overall reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles (VC) without the obnoxious cutscenes, overbearing story and general animeness. The missions have an interesting way about them and you have to balance danger, party ability, demands for resources and local mission requirements making for an interesting risk reward system that relies on your ability to command. Feels very organic, though I cant say how it will last in the long run. Basically - the actual gameplay of the game is satisfying and I enjoyed it a lot.There are a couple problems here though. The UI is, in a word, crap. Mouse+keys or gamepad (I actually found gamepad more viable in mission mode due to some weird camera acceleration, but mouse in the menus) - its all really clunky. Lots of small windows with masses of stats and info. Very cool for showing all you want to know - but it is pretty intimidating at first and then its just a bit messy. This is all forgettable, however. My biggest issue, as many already have pointed out - the AI turns are dull as hell. For around a third of most rounds youll be stuck watching the back of your last soldiers head as all the AI units move about unseen on the map. This takes a long time. Genuinely - the game has an unreasonable amount of downtime between your movements and I found myself feeling as if my time was being wasted. Comparing to the peers, VC shows you all the enemy troops off the getgo and you see their moves - feels like youre part of the game. Xcom has pretty quick turns and some feedback in the form of sound waves (helped by the isometric view). Here its just ""wait for a couple minutes till the AI is done and then get back to playing"". Its annoying and actually detracts from an otherwise fun strategy experience. Finally - Im not into WH lore so I dont know about the fanbase, but the factions of offer were a bit bland and samey from a first look. Humans, different kind of humans, a 3rd kind of humans, a 4th kind of humans (now posessed by chaos) and ratmen. Doesnt exactly feel like the creative muscles were stretched there.  Ultimately - I liked what I saw so far and will finish off my free weekend with it to see further in. People who like turn based tactics games a-la Xcom will enjoy this, especially if they like the WH fantasy universe (Im ambivalent to it, but the game suits the setting well). People who are used to faster games will probably find this too restrictive. An overall thumbs up from me, but the long AI turns combined with a messy interface could genuinely make this a dealbreaker. Ive yet to see. I recommend looking up videos and maybe finding someone who already has the game to see if the issues ive pointed to matter to you. If they dont, get the game - youll have fun.			"

												This is, at least for me, exactly what I'm looking for in a Games Workshop game. Turn based strategy, cool level progression, lots of customization. It's close to the table top games people love. All the warbands have their own stregnths and weaknesses. I only wish there were more warbands to choose from. With the endless font of crap GW vomits up this one stands out as a gem. I'm very looking forward to Necromunda, hopefully they keep the things that make this game great. This game is quite difficult, so I only recommend it if you enjoy a challenge. Expect your first couple warbands to join the corpses strewn about the Mordeheim landscape, but the first time you actually reach endgame will feel like a huge accomplishment. Many people complain about the game feeling unfair, their guys missing repeatedly with an 80% chance to hit. However 80% isnt 100 and you will hit about 8 out of 10 times. Its all about positioning, using your tanks to block and hold units while you surround and destroy others with your damage classes. The only thing that seems kind of weak to me is the magic, you're better off equipping your mages with 2 handed weapons and actually doing damage... but then I was never much of a magic player, maybe someone else figured out how to make the most of it.Highly recommend this game. Its atmospheric and immersive, and you actually come to love your units. I recommend giving them all unique names and backstory to enhance your gaming experience. Please GW, more of this, stick with this developer, we would love it if you put out more high quality games like Mordeheim than the endless stream of garbage we have been getting.For those of you having trouble, a couple tips. Keep your warband together. Don't even take missions that split your warband up (particularly the ones that split you into 3 small groups) Make sure to keep your lighter damage units behind your heavy tanks, resist the urge to use their faster movement to take them out front. When you set up ambushes make sure that they don't end up pinching the enemy in a doorway where you can't surround them. Impressive units can be a real problem if they wind up in the middle of your warband where they can create absolute havoc. Try to use the alleys and doorways to trap enemy impressives, as the AI won't be able to get them unstuck. Above all never engage anyone alone, especially with your leader and heroes. They are too valuable to risk, disengage and run to your minions who are expendable. Don't spend money on the minons until late game, if some of your units have to die, better them than your Bosses and heroes.You really have to invest some time to make your warband great. Don't give up after an hour or two of playing the game, and really try to go for the extra objectives, as getting them will make your levels spring forward.			"

												This game is one of the best Risk/reward games I have ever played ever. The warbands are awesome and the level of customization you can have for each individual member of your warband is amazing. It may take some time to know which warband fits your playstyle. When you find the warband that fits it makes you feel so powerful until you play a brutal difficulty campaign mission and get ambushed and lose some offensive points in the process. I would recommend this game to people who want a real challenge from a game and can handle difficulty from games.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game!  It is very hard.  The mechanics and character leveling are difficult but fluid.  The interface is challenging but fun and requires you to pay attention when you are plotting moves.  I have quit and restarted multiple times but I am still trying so that has to say something for the game.  I am reluctantly changing my ""no"" to a ""yes"" based on the comments of someone with far more experience in the game than me.  My primary complaint is that the developers decided to make this a ""hardcore game"".  Hardcore is a relative term.  Let the person purchasing the game decide how difficult they want it to be.  That said . . . I'm diving back in!			"

												I saw all the early reviews and waited Ages before I bought this (On Sale, only reason I gave in). What a mistake! I should have bought this when it first came out. It's superb, up there with the best of them. Combat is sleek and stylish, the animations varied and detailed. If you want a quicker experience you can speed up AI movement - otherwise, you've got deep tactical combat with strategy elements. Yes, it is HARD - but only if you rush in without thinking. This isn't a never-ending-supply of Troops game - it's gang warfare with full RPG elements and it's awesome. At first you will struggle, I think the first mission I did I lost at least a couple of limbs. kind of hard to be an archer with one arm - but fkkit, I just found a pistol so he's back on board! if you like Tactical Strategic Combat a la XCom or JA2, you'll love this. If you love the Warhammer setting, you'll love this. If you can play a game that requires a little thinking and finesse, you'll love this. If you don't love it right away - play the tutorials - then you'll love it. Insta-Buy. And I'm only a few hours in.			"

												Definitely recommended, especially at the current sale price!The difficulty level is not as bad as some are saying, especially if you play the tutorial.I started with a Skaven warband, who are now level 3, and have a 90% win rate (twoof the wins were decisive victories -- doing the extra goals).I do have a couple of criticisms:Diversity of maps.I am hoping this is just my limited perspective having only recently started, but themaps feel homogenous.  I would have liked to have seen more design diversity.An eery garden/park district, a sewer (there was one in the tutorial), or ann all insidedistrict (like a palace), to name a few....If it was a port city we could have battles on corrupted ships!  =)Match ending immediately after rout.Would it be game breaking to allow one more round for the victor after the rout?Isn't it reasonable to think a warband would gather whats relatively close to thembefore leaving.  We are suppose to be scavengers after all.Anyway, thanks for the free weekend!  Now off to buy the game and the DLC.			"

												This game looks like fun, and it is fun, until a game breaking bug ruins it all for you. Was able to move a unit into a position where i could not move him back, couldnt skip turn as he was trapped in a zone of control, had no choice but to abandon mission, game killed high level hero with many hours work, stacked injuries on all the other party members, and took all my magic items. I was going to win the mission. Now the warband is ruined. Dont buy this game.			"

								Definitely a lot of potential here. Camera angles can be a real annoyance during combat, but are otherwise just fine. One complaint is the lack of any experience gained during a loss in a skirmish? Frustrating when these matches can get lengthy sometimes and there is no gain at the end. Perhaps I just suck that much :p Either way, looking forward to watching this game develop into something even better than it is now.			"

								Cant say anythin else than i like it. Tho it hasnt all content yet, but that what i could test i had the feeling ""when this is ready, i dont need anything else a while"". Hopefully rest of the content is as good as the early access, and comes fast! :) I recommend that firstimers take a good while and looks few gameblay videos on youtube to get handle of controls and how to get start, that was the hardest part. There is game manual, but there isnt a single word of controls. There is tutorial, tho, but i know there is many ppl like i am, ""no tutorial, straight to gaming"". :) But overall it was nice as much as there was anything to test and i dont feel that i put my money waste. Now just waitin rest of it.			"

								First Note: Early access so there are still bugs and balance issues.As a fan of tabletop games I find this a great use of the kind of fun these games provide without just fealing like a port/shovelware version so many adaptations feel like. Worth a look if you are a fan of the warhammer world and have some spare cash.issues mostly that i attribute to early access: guns are very OP with no market system or any format on how items are dstributed beyohnd a players want, be prepared to be shot up a lot if you dont bring any firepower yourself.bugs and crashes to be expected. The biggest fault i can feel coming up is GW holding its charicteristic unreasonable iron grip on its IPO preventing small hints or parts of the rest of their world appearing in the game			"

Early Access Review
								Just to get it out of the way, *no* the game is not worth 20-30 dollars in it's current state. It's less an Alpha and more a 1v1 combat demo of the four warbands with no campaign or warband management that made the original Modheim, Necromunda, and Blood Bowl games so fun.Is it worth the 20 dollars as a pre-order for the full game? I'd say yes.The game is fun. I wasn't sure when I first saw the original videos, but it's a lot more of a tactical RTS game then you would think. Instead of player turns you go by unit initiative turns, and map vision is 100% based on your troops line of sight. They have changed the looting system to an almost scavanger hunt while in the middle of a PvP match - You now search for the warpstone and enemy chests during the fight, instead of getting a list of rewards after the match. Looting is also a team effort as each warrior of yours has 2 open inv spots, plus 1 extra spot per 4 str. So the entire warband will need to work on gathering the loot instead of having 1-2 packrats. The movement system is really simple to get the hang of as each point of movement your character has opens up a set distance shown in a blue ring, and as long as you don't run into an enemies range, you can always revert changes and move him in a different direction at any time. Combat reminds me of Fallout - each trooper seems to have 3-5 action points, and different combat maneuvers cost a different amount of your pool. When your warriors can actually gain xp and purchase skills and new equipment I could see this system being a helluva lot of fun.I can't say anything about the magic as you basically get an attack spell and a buff spell and that's it. Again, when the warriors can be developed more I could see this system being fun, but right now it's just a fancy bowman.Multiplayer is less fun. It's a bit buggy, it's full of a lot of rage quits right now, and since there is no warband progression 99% of what makes these types of games great is missing. In a patch or two when they hopefully have the xp system working and people start forming leagues, multiplayer will be worth it. Right now, I can't say it's a selling point.The fact it's shipping with only four warbands (more will come via paid DLC I am sure. :/  ) is dissapointing as well. With all the great races and backstory the Warhammer world has, you would at least have hoped to see one of the Dwarven warband types, along with one of the Elven warband types, included in the base game. As it stands you basically get the Germans, the Joan of Arcs, Humans-but-cultists, and the awesome Skaven (rat assassins).			"

												Ok first of all, love it, love warhammer, really love mordheim. I really don't do many reviews i'm more of a silent person when it comes to that type of stuff. So lets do this!Things to note:1. Games still in its infancy theres bugs, and other mishaps2. Customization is there but its limited it will probably get better3. theres 4 warbands(for now) maybe more in the future (ORKZZZ!)4. RNG is not your friend, personaly just subtract 15 from whatever the number says and thats roughly how you should play it. I.E. you have a 87% chane to it , its more like 72 and they have a 80% chance to dodge/parry and you have a 13/28% miss chance. 5. The game is against you, take it slow. play it safe, especially if your Skaven!6. Sister of Sigmar are mean and hit hard and use magic, think of each sister as a paladin and thats roughly what your dealing with.7.Did i tell you how much i hate the sisters of sigmar? A LOT!Ok, if you read through that, then yeah man its a great game, take your time, 2v1/3v1/4v1 etc as much as you can, RNG isn't reliable so don't rely on it, move every move like your character is your child, and invest in Weapon Skill over Accuracy!!P.S. Sisters of Sigmar are pain incarnate!			"

												You will learn how to avoid, or deal with, loss.  You will make choices, knowing that there is no ""best choice.""Loss: Yes, random rolls can pile up, forcing you to lose a treasured unit.  You are fighting with other mercenaries over the ""City of the Damned"", people will die.  You might actually care for them.  It will hurt.  You may quit.  Or you may find the young replacement and swear at how wortheless they are compared to the veteran that they replaced.  It feels like a warzone, and that's what I wanted.  Learn to dodge.Choices: The optional objectives are woth more than the primary.  The primary is, usually, easy.  Beat the not so smart AI.  When just starting, I did lose a few primary objectives.  You learn to stick together, and if you don't start together, get together ASAP!  Then you start winning primary objectives.You start looking at those optional objectives.  And realizing that if you want to accomplish them, you might have to break out of your comfortable, stick together, everybody comes home safely routine.  Maybe you start taking risks.  And you like the rewards.  Then somebody gets caught alone against a swarm, or maybe just a single impressive unit.  And it hurts.  And you wonder if those rewards were worth it.Stick through it, learn.  And you can find yourself making most of the optional objectives and making it home in one piece.  And sometimes you look at the map/setup and realize it's the day to just hunker down.Those two things are why I love Mordheim.It does have some negatives. Managing inventory during a mission could use the ability to drop items. I get annoyed when the enemy routs immediately after I take down the one guy I needed to take down, only to not get the chance to grab his token before the rout ends the mission.  Deployment could be made more user friendly (selecting deployment from the map instead of cycling). The game has gotten a LOT better since it first came to Early Access, and I hope they continue working on some of those.  But the good things more than make it worth dealing with the few annoyances in the game, in my opinion.I hope they continue, either through DLC or just updating the game itself, to develop more warbands, more equipment, more customization of models and more mission types (story or procedural).  But I love the game as it is today.  I would just love to have more too :).			"

												Note: I only played for the free weekend.Negatives:- The game plays at such a slow pace, that I'm typing this between turns. Sometimes there's a long block of enemy turns till my next unit moves and it takes forever to wait.- There's a lot of loading, which coupled with the above point makes the game feel unbearable. Fighting 1 battle and returning to camp can be 30-60 minutes. - Climbing and jumping down have a success rate. Fail the former and you stay low and take damage, fail the latter and it's just damage. It makes sense in practice, but seeing cloth-wearing warriors fail to climb makes me VERY angry.- Non-story missions are repetitive. You have 1 of 3 bonus objectives, but all battles boil down to knock out enough of the enemy and force them to retreat. The one story mission I did play (First Sisters Mission) was agonizingly long. I killed the opposition, but I had to run a sister all over the map just to tag locations. I had the match won and they artificially increased the length by 5-10 turns. - BUGS. On 2 occasions I found my soldiers transported to different locations, On one map, my soldier was transported through a cart that was blocking an alleyway with no exit and no means of returning to the group. The other happened while trying to climb a chapel wall outside, and next turn magically found herself inside.Positives:- Challenge. The game feels difficult and you have to learn how to properly play. Going into a risky mission feels risky. The inability to save scum allows me to really feel the jeopardy and think strategically. Random Thoughts:- When RNG works against you it hurts. A LOT. Remember, even if you have 95% chance, that means 5 attacks will miss out of 100.- I want prettier Sisters model. Vain, I know. But I want to lead an army of heavy armored supermodels. Overall, I can't give this a positive review. Too many flaws for too little benefit.(This review was made while waiting 5 extra turns for Sister Selma Holtzman to run up to the god damn chapel to bless the god damn bell.)			"

												Morheim: City of the Damned is a turn based game where each character takes their turn based on their stats. The game is based off of a table top game so alot of the percentages that decide outcomes are based on dice roles. Each of the four factions in the game, well five with the dlc, all have their own strengths and weaknesses. Even the fifth faction plays different enough than the other factions where if you are enjoying the game and want something new it is worth getting. The other DLC so far are additional characters that can completely change how you run your warband. The reason I bring up the DLC is that even before I got the DLC I had to fight against the DLC warband. An interesting feature in the game is that any of the warbands you can make you will have to fight in the game. With how many ways there are to build a warband that makes a variety of things you can run into in the game. Also if you see an opponent in the game with an interesting build that you like it is possible to make a build similar to it regardless of whether it is a player or AI's warband. Cons i have heard are that people enter the game thinking of it as a character management game but it is a warband management game. The reason it is not a character management game is if a character gets taken out in combat at the end they can either get a minor injury, major injury, killed, or a combination if you are really having bad luck. Injuries in the game effect a characters overall stats so sometimes you have to decide whether to keep a charcter or hire a new guy to replace it. This makes it where you sometimes you have to risk the possibility of loosing a guy permaneantly for the better of your warband. In one of my warbands i had a guy loose his arm so he can only loose one-handed weapons but it increased his dodge rate. This is just one way of how a permaneant injury effected one of my characters. Also never in the game click abandon match no matter how bad things are going wait till you can either retreat or don't care about the consequences of what happens. If you click abandon the match every single one of your characters has to make the injury rolls and anything can happen.So far I have mainly been playing against the AI but have been enjoying the game the whole time. I actually enjoyed the fact that the game gave major penalties for trying to abandon matches if you didn't like what was happening. Luckily in multiplayer you pick whether you want a friendly match or competitive (not sure what actual titles are called). In a competitive match if you loose you can get the permaneant injuries or have your gear taken while in friendly no injuries and no gear taken. If you like challenging games and can handle loosing a character permaneantly that you have had since the beginning of the game I would recommend this game.			"

												The game is a lovely Turn Based Strategy with a couple of flaws in the execution only.  Often the characters themselves appear as if they can fit through something, but they cannot when you try.  Also there are times when enemy units have immunities to various mechanics, and it does not show this on the buff/debuff menus when you inspect an enemy unit prior to attacking.  That being said, this game does not show mercy or cut you any slack, but that is part of the appeal.  It is a very tactical and thinking man's game, where you can easily lose a character mid-mission, and they end up being useless or near useless afterwards, and you are counting the days until you can buy a replacement.  It is a beautiful application of a masochistic strategy game, that makes you feel reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaly good when you out-maneuver your enemy, and leave them in a horrid position to fight from, while you overwhelm them with debuffs and swarm tactics.

												Definitely recommended, especially at the current sale price!The difficulty level is not as bad as some are saying, especially if you play the tutorial.I started with a Skaven warband, who are now level 3, and have a 90% win rate (twoof the wins were decisive victories -- doing the extra goals).I do have a couple of criticisms:Diversity of maps.I am hoping this is just my limited perspective having only recently started, but themaps feel homogenous.  I would have liked to have seen more design diversity.An eery garden/park district, a sewer (there was one in the tutorial), or ann all insidedistrict (like a palace), to name a few....If it was a port city we could have battles on corrupted ships!  =)Match ending immediately after rout.Would it be game breaking to allow one more round for the victor after the rout?Isn't it reasonable to think a warband would gather whats relatively close to thembefore leaving.  We are suppose to be scavengers after all.Anyway, thanks for the free weekend!  Now off to buy the game and the DLC.			"

This game is not for everyone. If u want casual and story driven game this game is not for you. But if u want very hard and challenging experience then i can recomend this game for you.			"

												Really fun game, until you realize that the developers force you to play the sisters of sigmar.  They are so much stronger than all the other warbands its absurd.  It is one of only two complaints with this game.  They need to have their chance to hit lowered if they are going to put out that much damage, or have parry actually do something.  Parry being the second complaint...I played so many campaign fights with literally less than 10 parry procs.  This warband leader has 82% parry proc and does nothing but DODGE LOL.  Come on, fix this please.  Parry is worthless, and Sisters of Sigmar are do too much damage.  I would recommend staying away from this game till they truly balance these broken factors, they distinctly break the game.			"

												Despite always fancying it I delayed getting this as the luke-warm reception it recieved put me off. However, I must say I'm getting pretty hooked.The virtual dice rolls won't always go your way. You simply have to make peace with that if you want to enjoy this game. Though sound strategy will see you right most of the time in single-player. It is pretty common to have one or maybe two out-of-action party members per match even when things are going well. And there is always the chance they end up perma-dead or with such a debilitating injury they become next to worthless.Multiplayer is another matter, there will be players out there that can take your beloved warband to pieces. But you have the option to play in exhibition mode with no permanent repurcussions, but no rewards either. Or just have seperate relatively 'safe' SP and riskier MP warbands. It's worth knowing that there is a veteran system letting you level up and keep bonuses to running your warband that carries over to the next even if they all end up dead. You even get to choose how you spend your earned bonuses for each warband. I've got 25 hours of fun out of this to date and I've only played with 2 of the warbands on offer so far.More customisation options would be very welcome, it is hard to make your party members look individual, which is a shame. Another niggle is that the game always suggests a parry stance for my warriors that are better at dodging and vice-versa which gets tiresome after dozens of battles.			"

From my point of view, the developers should stick to the mechanics of the board game e.g. instead of going ""heroes of might and magic"" with the fighting animations, this gets bored and repetitive quick, i would like it if it would be like the Blood Bowl game or the org. tabletop mordheim game, where you can see the number of dice being thrown, and then if you crit, you roll again to see what happens, but in the game you can see the following animation e.g. beheading, stunned, break legs (e.g. when falling or jumping from heights), loose an eye; that would be so awesome. but i guess it could also work just as a text notification.i did not like that you cannot zoom out and see the whole map, i can see the point and fun with the locked character view, but i hope that the developers will make this a choice when setting up the game amongst other game rules. (weather conditions which would effect your vision, game quests, missions,)They could also make a map editor, to create your own maps or arrange tournaments just like in the blood bowl game.i could go on with the things i would like to have in the game, but in the end I bought the game since i have had so much fun with the tabletop version of Mordheim.I really hope that they do not drop the ball with this one, this has the possibilities of becoming a great game.

												RNG is awful, multiple 80-90% chances to hit that all miss. Even statistically speaking you would make hits. AI is more favoured, as it is more likely to hit you than you would hit them.Lack of warbands, Mordheim did have vampires, orcs, undead ect...Lack of customization for your soldiersThe game can be challenging, however it is not fair majority of the time as it is poorly executed.

												Played an hour then refunded. A hodge podge interface which is immediately baffling, little in the way of obvious information presented to the user. Many icons with no tooltips.Doesn't appear to have translated any of the immediate accessibility of its tabletop parent, instead there is perhaps a decent game buried under there if you can be bothered to dig in and find it. I couldn't.			"

								This is a punishingly hard game. It is true to the tt version in that it can be so brutal..... Get an amazing champ that is your warbands powerhouse then BOOM looses an arm. It is balanced by a veteran system, so you can aquire perks for a warband  which carry over if it all goes sideways and you need to start with a fresh teamThis is one of the best early access games I have dipped my toes in. Great things ahead.			"

												this game is very unforgiving to you. i've played 5 missions as skaven 2 wins 3 losses. first two missions i was defeated. played 2 games of chaos and wow i didn't lose but my first mission i lose a guy forever. lol So really your choices are very important and if you have a low end system this game will be very bad for you. you might be able to play it with low settings but still.Anyways it was very fun and your decisions really will define your fate of your toons. yes you can use tactics as well to help edge to your side such as close quarters of a building or higher advantage.

												Definitely recommended, especially at the current sale price!The difficulty level is not as bad as some are saying, especially if you play the tutorial.I started with a Skaven warband, who are now level 3, and have a 90% win rate (twoof the wins were decisive victories -- doing the extra goals).I do have a couple of criticisms:Diversity of maps.I am hoping this is just my limited perspective having only recently started, but themaps feel homogenous.  I would have liked to have seen more design diversity.An eery garden/park district, a sewer (there was one in the tutorial), or ann all insidedistrict (like a palace), to name a few....If it was a port city we could have battles on corrupted ships!  =)Match ending immediately after rout.Would it be game breaking to allow one more round for the victor after the rout?Isn't it reasonable to think a warband would gather whats relatively close to thembefore leaving.  We are suppose to be scavengers after all.Anyway, thanks for the free weekend!  Now off to buy the game and the DLC.			"

												I found this to be a great Warhammer strategy game. Does a great job capturing the feel of the (classic) WH world, and is property difficult. Another reviewer described this as ""XCom meets Warhammer,"" and I completely agree.And yes, the game is hard, but it is not ridiculously hard, as others imply. This is a strategy game: strategy is a requirement. If you want a Diablo-clone, you won't be happy, but this game isn't an action RPG.You'll like this if you like Warhammer, strategy, or both.

												If you plan to 'play' this game, be warned, because the game will play you. It will screw you on over every chance it will get. Don't expect to win every fight, the game will find a way you mess you up, everything that can go wrong will go wrong. As of why this is thumbs up is sometimes it's fun to make best of the worst situation, you can occasionally get lucky get a glimmer of hope before it's crushed without mercy. It reminds of a manifest of evil that was conjured by ""Darkest Dungeon"" and ""Blood Bowl"".TLDRIf you can find enjoyment in a loss and you like turn based strategy with permenant consequences you may want to give it a try.

												After I let this game rest for about half of a year, I come back and I'm pleasantly suprised.This game is hard, it's rougelike hard. Don't assume you'll have the perfect warband in the end.To clarify how hard here an example from my recent warband: My lvl 8 leader got injured and got the 'stupid' trait. Meaning most of the time he sits around and does nothing. I had to abandon this warband, because leveling up another leader was unrealistic. I think it's 'rougelike-hard' in the way that after any mission your warband is a wreck. Half dead, stupid, lost gear and you don't have money. The developer counter this by giving you boons which you unlock by just playing the game (aka 'Veteran System', this doesn't affect the battles but the management of your warband, so there is no direct benefit in PVP).  It doesn't make the game a breeze but it's nice to have.This game is in my opinon not so much about crushing the enemy but a game which rewards carefull, tactical play.If you like banging your head against walls, or games like 'Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup' ( in terms of learning curve and tough luck moments) I recommend this game. If you hope to roflstomp this game you'll gonna have a bad time.			"

												Utterly, massively, unplayably based on RNG which can and WILL destroy all your best-laid plans for victory.I would compare it to classic XCom, but that's not an apt comparison. In XCom, your technology gradually improved, allowing even your rookies to have half a chance of hurting what they hit and surviving being flicked by a wet towel. Furthermore, you had a ton of warm bodies to throw into the meat-grinder. In Mordheim however, you have a very small band and your tech in the end-game is going to be largely the same as what you started with. Instead, you're expected to nurture and grow your little warband into a team of elite fighting badasses who can pick their teeth with the business end of a bloodthirster's battleaxe.The problem with this is that the costs of keeping your team alive and in the fight are astronomical and the odds of being downed in a matter of moments are heavily against you. Your team never survives long enough to become even halfway reliable, without a shower of shooting stars over a field of four-leaf clovers and quadruple-amputee white rabbits! Your enemies will always seem to hit you on a 60%+ chance, while you struggle to land half your blows on 80% or higher. The game is entirely based around chance and simply cannot be beaten by anything less than a professtional Russian Roulette player!But I suppose if you're the kind of masochist who enjoys having a game feed you your own elbows in literally every encounter, then have fun, you lunatic. Personally though, I'd save your £30 and go punch a biker instead.			"

												If you can't find people to play the tabletop this is a solid alternative. Catpures the city of Mordheim perfectly and the difficulty is solid. Needs more warbands but certainly worthwhile now.The warband you make is going to suffer losses. You will most likely be replacing people. You will most likely watch the dice fall against you at one time or another. This is exactly how it should be and you will learn two things in the city of the damned.1. Everyone can die.2. You best be prepared for♥♥♥♥♥♥to go down.Embrace this and accept these rules and you will do just fine. Well as fine as you can in a place like Mordheim.			"

												Mordheim is one of those games that I am still on the fence about. Sir Stübington (Another steam user) pretty much hits the nail on the head on every point. And yet despite all these problems I still think it is an enjoyable game. I remember playing this game in real life on table top and it feels very much the same even the fact that chaos was unplayable and Sisters of Sigmar wrecked face (AND THEY DON'T EVEN GET SLINGS IN THIS GAME)Bought it in early access and have seen it go from unplayable mess to what is now a playable but imbalnce messed. It basically needs to do another jump like I saw from here to now to be a really good game. If nostalgia and Warhammer are not your thing you are probably bettter playing Final Fantasy tactics TBH "

												Appears to be a ridiculously faithful adaptation of Warhammer tabletop.  Never played it myself, but I've watched some folks play a few rounds.So far I've been having some fun slogging through the tutorials, and it seems like it has plenty of potential.  The tutorials themselves are pretty anemic, though... they basically throw a ♥♥♥♥ing glossary and dictionary at you and expect you to sort it out, but it's an indie production, so a barebones tutorial isn't exactly a big deal overall.I like it so far.  One warning though: the loading screens take ♥♥♥♥ing FOREVER.  Plan on doing some laundry, fixing a sandwich, and taking a dump before you can actually PLAY the damn game.			"

												This game has been on my wishlist forever. After the debacle with most of the early access games I have invested in before, this particular game gave me hope that there are companies out there really willing to work hard.There are very few games like this that have been released. It is a diamond in the rough, and is apparently based off of a tabletop game that I had no idea even existed. I have delved into the turn based action and immediately felt right at home. I loved the way my warband could be customizable, but I almost wished there were more options. Maybe this will be a patch or DLC they may release.Pros:- Great tactical gameplay- Classic well designed turn based action- Interesting preparation experience- Customization options for combatCons:- Good graphics, but not the best; however, I have seen most of these games being played for depth rather than glitz and glammer.- The AI isn't the smartest as yet, but I am sure they will make the necessary changes. (I was able to snipe a baddie because he didn't know how to ""jump down"" from a ledge, and just moved back forth in a 3 foot pattern for 7 turns)-I would have liked to have seen more customization options, which I am sure they will be making available from DLC.I would recommend this game for fans of the old fanfaire of turn based games. It isn't Final Fantasy Tactics by a long shot, but it is the only title that I have personally played that has even had a chance of comparing to it. Not bad guys, not bad.P.S. after three days of playing this game it has corrupted my soul. This game is HARDCORE. If you are easily discouraged, I would not recommend it. lol... WOW... great stuff.

												Ok never played Mordheim (the tabletop one) but am a Warhammer fan, this game is good, even for early access its good (its no longer in early access and is still awesome) and you can see all the signs of it reaching significantly awesome when its finished (it did), if you like strategy games you'll like this, if you liked xcom (the good one) but thought it needed less guns and more stabbings then this game is for you. If however you think this game is not for you then its time to rethink your life and play this game.This game did for a considerable period of time have a difficulty spike that went from reasonable to you will die which in a game like this is beyond brutal that has now been removed, so while you'll still find the game pretty brutal it is no longer unfairly so.This below relates to something no longer in the game thankfully and I would give the developers every credit they listened to the fans and updated this.Incase you think that maybe I just wasn't up to the challenge here is how it goes. Effectively (and you wouldn't know this until you start the mission) when you reach the top of the stairs you are instantly and ambushed by creatures that can only really die if you hit them with items from the rest of the level, with the problem you can't get to them because of the combat you've just been forced into, this killed 3 consecutive warbands of mine, as in 50% or higher dead or maimed to beyond useless. This in a game that to get to that point will take 5-10 hours at least per warband is...irritating			"

												I really enjoyed the free weekend and hope this goes on again soon (hopefully next time i'll actuallly be able to afford it).Yes the rng can be unforgiving, but much like Blood Bowl and all dice based games, it is a matter of calculated risk. That said, there will be times you get stomped from the start through no fault of your own; such is the roll of the dice.The atmosphere is pure grimdark and the voice acting is well done. Procedural generation constantly keeps battles interesting despite the scenery itself being a bit same-same after a while. My main complaint would be lack of visual customisation of your warband- in particular the gear. Would be nice for a purple item to actually look superior, or at least different, from the vanilla starting gear. Would be great if those rare, expensive, paid-for-in-blood-and-tears items would actually be shiny.			"

												The difficulty goes from challenging to unfair. Losing matches due to terrible RNG or glitches is even more frustrating considering how hefty the penalty for failure is. The maps and missions are all virtually the same with slight variations, and only four factions in the entire game (which means you should get used to fighting the same opponents over and over again). There seems to be a lack of items and equipment to choose from as well, which overall creates a frustrating boring experience. That being said the game has alot of potential. If some of the more frustrating problems were dealt with, as well some new content added I would reccomend it.			"

												Finally the release is here.This games scratches an itch I have had for years.  Turn based combat - with character growth, and character injury.  The first time your veteran loses an arm, a leg, or an eye - you will feel it.The first time your one armed veteran returns to action and shows he still has what it takes, you will feel pride in this little digital warrior - or you'll use him for fodder.The game has great atmosphere, decent art, decent sound, and amazing gameplay.  It does have a small campaign available for each warband that mixes things up a little bit.I have just really enjoyed my time searching and scavenging the city of Mordheim.  I have recommended this game to several people at work who have bought it and also have enjoyed it.If the devs read this, here is my wishlist:- more customization options, I would even be willing to pay for this.- new art for blue and purple items compared to white items- birght wizards!- more warbandsah you know - just keep adding on to this amazing game.  I look forward to seeing what else is coming! "

								I have been a huge fan of Warhammer games since Dawn of War. This game goes back to the very basics of what Warhammer is; and is a direct reputation of the turned based combat. Mordheim takes Warhammer and makes it into the strategy game it should be, but that being said it still needs improvement. For starters, when I have defeated an enemy  champion, the game tells me I have been defeated and none of my progress is saved. With all things taken into consideration, the game is still in beta and is not near completion. I will say that if you are a Warhammer fan and love playing games based around the fiction this is the game for you! Have fun and enjoy!			"

												If I had to summarize this game in one phrase, it would ""turn based, tactical, dark souls, rogue-like"".  If that intrigues you then I highly recommend this game to you.  But if any part of that doesn't interest you then you will probably hate this game.It's not strictly a rogue-like, but if you go into this knowing that your units will die, your gear will be taken, and you will lose then you will enjoy it much much more.  When you restart a new campaign, not only will you have a better understanding of the mechanics, but your commander will have leveled up giving additional starting bonuses like gold and other perks.If you can appreciate that a 95% chance is not a given, that a 5% chance is not an impossibility, and are willing to stick out a steep learning curve, you will find the gameplay to be very rewarding. 8/10Good:- Intense and addictive gameplay.- Deep, balanced and fun mechanics.- Well developed theme and backstory.Bad:- Forgettable campaign storylines.- Steep learning curve.- Your best hero losing an arm.Ugly:- Some of the voice acting is truly awful.- Totally random and unpredictable mini-boss encounters that you have no chance of winning.

Early Access Review
								Well.This game shows a lot of potential.Of course it's early access and so some of my critique may quickly become obsolete .Strategy combat around city scapes where you can climb, drop and leap is a lot of fun.Even though I am ignorant to Mordheim I greatly enjoy fantasy and this game has bucketloads of it.A nice choice of starting warbands although I am a bit unsure about the lack of female mercenaries ( I wouldn't use them anyway but I find it odd) Perhaps there is a lore based reason?  Great potential for future growth. The ambience and atmosphere of the game is great however I am not too sure about the suitability of the soundtrack. While I think the soundtrack is quality it sounds like the drums of war and great battles at points. But these aren't great battles: they are skirmishes for ones life in the dregs of a corrupted world.   Anyway it seems insignificant. Stylised music for each warband would be great also. Ironically the opening menu ambience is fantastic but it does not seem to be replicated in skirmishes.At the moment the games engine doesn't seem quite capable of supporting itself and I would highly recommend the coders get their butts in gear as to fixing critical game glitches for example playing versus  player seems to get stuck and 4/5 times will not get unstuck and you are left thinking of what might have been. Load times that don't seem to be done justice by the in game content. There are some minor graphical glitches  mostly in chraracter models. The human impressive unit looks bald from some angles if he has no headgear. The ogre has an invisible buttcrack when he's stunned. Sisters are miraculously empty on the inside of their armour and it's particularly evident when they fail a drop check. Brethrens robes spazzing out.  Overall the graphics are solid, stylised and make a positive impact on the game.Quite a few quality of life problems and glitches that need to be fixed up. There are spots in the map that are bugged one way or another. For example in the sewers of the church of sigmar there is a reddish tentacle-ridden area that one of my sisters got stuck in. There are multiple places where, as a ranged attacker, you can walk up a wall and get stuck in it for an added height boost and sniper spot particularly in houses of the merchants quarter. Seems to be a few problems with characters magically falling down walls they just climbed.  And the menus in skirmishes could really do with full mouse capabilities. There are people who are griping and giving this game a bad rap. You must understand that there will always be people who give a game a bad rap and in the last 5 years they seem to have crawled out from under every rock and basement known to man.  If you have a reasonable intellect you can master the keyboard menus quite easily. The game is quite the very definition of early access and an excellent early access game with the promise of great growth potential for 2v2 and great customisation and strategy.

Considering that the base game is not free to play they will be walking on thin ice with me and I imagine a lot of players if there isn't a reasonable means for those who can't fork out money to build their warbands up and give them a sanctuary to play and enjoy the game where they don't constantly get stomped on by someone who has already learnt grand true comet of sigmar and  has 200 damage weapons. Sigmar forbid they make it so you have to WAIT because your lack the funds to pay for your warband or you don't have enough warriors and can't afford to buy a new one.That will drop the game to the status of a glorified facebook game and I would be severely disappointed.That aside I will try and remain positive for this game and hope to see it blossom into a popular title of its genre or atleast become a cult classic.For those of you considering the purchase of this game in early access please consider the following.o The PvP is not thriving yeto You can't build up resources or exp at this pointo There are some fatal game errors o The game requires more resources to run than it appears			"

												I don't normally review games but I will make an exception this time for a few reasons. This game is exceptionally good, and it's current reviews do not reflect that. When reading other negative reviews I encourage potential buyers to read with the question in mind ""Would this person's problem have been solved if they had just been better at the game?""I read review after review and nearly every negative one I read was filled with paragraphs of ""The RNG is broken, Its impossible to recover from deaths or serious injuries"". Having played the game a significant amount I can confirm that these extensive reviews could easily be replaced with ""The game was too hard for me""Mordheim is hard, think Dark Souls. There is a sharp learning curve to it and even with my brother and I playing and sharing information I still couldn't get a lvl 10 warband decent enough to beat the last mission until I remade it 3 times. This was not as frustrating as it sounds though because there are plenty of options and variations to try, and each on has a particular niche that it works best in. Lastly, I have had this game since early Beta and the team working on it is one of the best I have experienced. Currently the game is only lacking in a few quality of life tweaks like the touchiness of shooting through windows or ambushing through dorways. But in the short time I have owned this game these problems are repidly disappearingMy point is, the game is too hard for the people leaving poor reviews and I highly recommend it			"

												As a fan of Games Workshop I was looking forward to playing this game.  Positives first it looks great, has not lagged, crashed or frozen on me once.  Sounds great and does a dame good job is emulating the table top game it is based on.  The reasons why I am not recommending this game boil down to the combat.  To be fair to Rogue Factor they have done a good job in merging the rolls to hit, wound and save into one single action but however there are some major problems.  First the percentage chance show when about to hit an opponent is just wrong.  It only shows your chance of hitting after your characters modifiers are taken into account, but not the enemies.  The community keeps pointing out that the opponent’s modifiers are shown; they are just not included in the calculations for hitting.  This is especially frustrating when despite being told you have a 95% chance to hit, you miss four times in a row.  Second and perhaps the biggest the range for the RNG used in this game is too high.  When turning a table top game that requires dice to play into a computer game using an RNG is a good way of measuring the dice rolls.  In this case however Rogue Factor have taken a game that uses dice numbered between 1-6 and ups it to 1-100.  This is a major issue as it greatly increases the chances of missing and failing to repel attacks.  The worst one of these I experienced was having a single Novice from the Sisters of Sigmar kill two of my henchmen and my war band leader on her own because I could not roll a single hit.I would suggest you play Bloodbowl instead as Cyanide has done a far better job at converting a tabletop game into a computer game.

Early Access Review
								Well.This game shows a lot of potential.Of course it's early access and so some of my critique may quickly become obsolete .Strategy combat around city scapes where you can climb, drop and leap is a lot of fun.Even though I am ignorant to Mordheim I greatly enjoy fantasy and this game has bucketloads of it.A nice choice of starting warbands although I am a bit unsure about the lack of female mercenaries ( I wouldn't use them anyway but I find it odd) Perhaps there is a lore based reason?  Great potential for future growth. The ambience and atmosphere of the game is great however I am not too sure about the suitability of the soundtrack. While I think the soundtrack is quality it sounds like the drums of war and great battles at points. But these aren't great battles: they are skirmishes for ones life in the dregs of a corrupted world.   Anyway it seems insignificant. Stylised music for each warband would be great also. Ironically the opening menu ambience is fantastic but it does not seem to be replicated in skirmishes.At the moment the games engine doesn't seem quite capable of supporting itself and I would highly recommend the coders get their butts in gear as to fixing critical game glitches for example playing versus  player seems to get stuck and 4/5 times will not get unstuck and you are left thinking of what might have been. Load times that don't seem to be done justice by the in game content. There are some minor graphical glitches  mostly in chraracter models. The human impressive unit looks bald from some angles if he has no headgear. The ogre has an invisible buttcrack when he's stunned. Sisters are miraculously empty on the inside of their armour and it's particularly evident when they fail a drop check. Brethrens robes spazzing out.

												If I had to summarize this game in one phrase, it would ""turn based, tactical, dark souls, rogue-like"".  If that intrigues you then I highly recommend this game to you.  But if any part of that doesn't interest you then you will probably hate this game.It's not strictly a rogue-like, but if you go into this knowing that your units will die, your gear will be taken, and you will lose then you will enjoy it much much more.  When you restart a new campaign, not only will you have a better understanding of the mechanics, but your commander will have leveled up giving additional starting bonuses like gold and other perks.If you can appreciate that a 95% chance is not a given, that a 5% chance is not an impossibility, and are willing to stick out a steep learning curve, you will find the gameplay to be very rewarding. 8/10Good:- Intense and addictive gameplay.- Deep, balanced and fun mechanics.- Well developed theme and backstory.Bad:- Forgettable campaign storylines.- Steep learning curve.- Your best hero losing an arm.Ugly:- Some of the voice acting is truly awful.- Totally random and unpredictable mini-boss encounters that you have no chance of winning.

												Finally the release is here.This games scratches an itch I have had for years.  Turn based combat - with character growth, and character injury.

It does have a small campaign available for each warband that mixes things up a little bit.I have just really enjoyed my time searching and scavenging the city of Mordheim.  I have recommended this game to several people at work who have bought it and also have enjoyed it.If the devs read this, here is my wishlist:- more customization options, I would even be willing to pay for this.- new art for blue and purple items compared to white items- birght wizards!- more warbandsah you know - just keep adding on to this amazing game.

Early Access Review
								I have been a huge fan of Warhammer games since Dawn of War. This game goes back to the very basics of what Warhammer is; and is a direct reputation of the turned based combat. Mordheim takes Warhammer and makes it into the strategy game it should be, but that being said it still needs improvement. For starters, when I have defeated an enemy  champion, the game tells me I have been defeated and none of my progress is saved. With all things taken into consideration, the game is still in beta and is not near completion. I will say that if you are a Warhammer fan and love playing games based around the fiction this is the game for you! Have fun and enjoy!			"

												Loads of fun, yet very challenging. Round by round, the game might not seem challenging, but when you start losing powerful characters and have to start from the bottom, and struggle to catch that character back up, things can get rough. THankfully, the game is very rewarding. There is something called the Vetran system. The more you play your different warbands, the more all new warbands will benefit. Such as higher level characters you can purchase later in the game, saving you the trouble of re-leveling a character from scratch, but at a hefty price. Also, starting your warband with more gold.The only real issue with this game, is it needs more content. I'd love more warbands to be added. But, it is a small fault. The core game is still great, I'd just like to see it grow even more.			"

The ""Dark Souls"" of Tactics GamesFirst lets clear up the ""RNG"" conspiracy all of the negative reviews are focusing on. When you see 67% for a hit that is what your chance to land a blow is. IF you roll that check and IF you get your 67% your opponent WILL THEN roll their Dodge/Block chance. That is not taken into account into the % to hit chance you see. Settle down and do some research before crying about the difficulty.With that said this is a great game, it will make you go rage mode but will keep you coming back for more if you truely enjoy tactics games. This game requires that you have overwhelmingly solid tactics making use of choke points etc. You need to keep a pretty deep roster because you will lose guys in a fight. You will need lots of trial and error but that makes a win more rewarding, and unlike some games when your guy gets ""knocked out"" theres a chance he will make it in the end, albeit with possibly one less arm.This game has hundreds of hours in it if you want to invest in trying out all of the different factions. I haven't even beat the game yet and have over 80 hours. I recommend this game to anyone who can do the math and do not to those who scream RNG and hit the refund button.			"

												Very simplistic turn based stategy game, don't let that trick you into thinking it's easy. RNG rules and it doesn't favor you in the least apparent 80% will miss three times in a row for your warband but the AI doesn't seem to obey the rules of Chance.But even if it did it serves to highlight the real problem with the game. The complete lack of depth to it's gameplay to give context, at the ten hour mark you may have characters with two or three abilities all behaving much the same. Some warbands have purely worse troops that still cost the same...management is shallow and limited, deployment is more often then not taken from you.All the preparation in the world and all the careful management (or what little the game offers) matters little when all but moving your troops is reliant on a dice roll.Other tactics games simply do more, often with much less powerful hardware.Add to that an abusive requirement to hand in resources regularly forcing you to focus on collection in battles where the AI can simply focus on you.The entire game seems like it was designed by a dev team who didn't know how to make a challengeing game but still wanted to plaster ""Hardcore"" on eveything.If you're a warhammer fan you've probably already brought it and are playing it like me simply because it's a warhammer game that's vaguely playable.In even simpler terms, this focus on making as simple a game as possible but also as ""Hard"" makes a game that only real masochists will enjoy beyond it's warhammer skin. If you want more challenge then that afforded you by making your way through a brick wall with your face there are many other roguelikes available to play.			"

												A game that has so much potential. But it is undeniable that there are SERIOUS balance issues. Sisters warband and Skaven are superior hands down.The start of the game is MUCH too brutal to players.There is no increasing difficulty as the mobs increase at the same rate your warband does.Items at the start of the game are completely pointless. If you work for hours and hours and don't die you MIGHT get a better weapon or armor.Almost all potions have a downside to them that typically outweighs any benefit and they also take up inventory space, which means you will not be able to loot as much.Ranged units are trash until MAYBE they are OKAY at the end-game when you have lots of units (MAYBE).Progression takes too long and by the end of your progression you aren't even happy with what you ended up with. If you pick a good faction, and then only go after missions that are the easiest type (warpstone rush) then the game is super easy mode. But if you stray from that, you will probably not play the game for a few weeks when your leader falls and dies. Customization is poorly labled... instead of picking colors for your clothing/armor you get to flip through a list that is just numbered (lazy programming here). You also get to do that for every single character since you cannot do a pre-built color scheme similar to the original 40k games. Final impression: This is sorta like the ""kife-game"" of video games. It looks so cool, and that's probably why you want to play it. But after the pain of actually playing the game, you will be filled with remorse and sadness. The balance issues really just kill the game right now along with only having a few units and a few warbands to choose from. At best this is a watered down intro to the tabletop game. At worst, it is a waste of any time you put into it.			"

								In general, the idea of the game is very good, and delight plans for further improvements ... But. As long as you do not add to the game At least Russian interface my score game - negative.___________________________Update: 03/12/2015In connection with the promise of the developers have added several languages localization estimates change to ""positive"" ...))Vince, thank you for your comment. Hope you gave me appreciate vote.I hope for your word of honor;)For everyone else:The gameplay is really fascinating, and looking at the promise - just jump for joy! I advise you to buy this game early access to support and motivate developers.___________________________Update 09/27/2015The idea of the game interesting, but it is too little content. Choose from several types of armor available almost from the beginning, and not a very large assortment of weapons a few upsets. I would like to see more weapons (perhaps some modernization it) and armor and their unique and rare counterparts. So, in my opinion, still not enough voice characters. Their silence eventually begins to put a damper.At the same time, I have high hopes that the game will add a new faction.And yet still not enough localization, because the game has a large number of specific skills and abilities, which are not always understood without translation.

Only solution was to start again or cripple the current warband for quitting out :PWould easily recommend but in-game RNGeezus is tough enough without messing with the save files.			"

												The game, in it's current state is poor.The main reason for this, is that the mission briefs are complete and utter bs, there's absolutely no reason for it to be like this, it doesn't improve gameplay, it doesn't help the story, it literally is like an idiot wrote a little summary for a completely unrelated incident and stuck it on your loading page.Let's give you an example, just loaded up a mission ""Enemy has split into three strike squads, you must split into three teams and deal with them (in other words) as they are running scared"". What does this mean to any normal people? The enemy is in three groups? Wrong, the enemy are all initiative 70 skaven clustered in a little group consisting of their entire warband, in sight of after one move, who methodically go around and in 4 on 1 or 5 or 6 vs 2 massacre your men. Meanwhile your strike teams have deployment zones that are too far away to be able to get there to assist before everybody is dead.So you put time into building a warband, then have it massacred. If the brief was ""the enemy are concentrated"" and there is a brief that says that, different game.Oh and did I mention now that warband is dead, you may as well start the game over, because you won't have the gold to replace them, low level recruits will get massacred in any game mode you play, and you won't ever be able to fulfill your wyrdstone shipment again after your main squad has fallen.The game has so much promise but is so poorly executed. Oh and the customization, yeah you can change your guys colour, thats about it. Stick to the tabletop game, this is a poor copy.			"

I bought the game on a whim due to its artstyle and intriguing combat.Its high in tension and has a wonderful atmosphere as well as great looking characters and maps, thing is, its hard, really hard. I've won about one mission and that was by pure luck, so I would say don't get this game if you don't have the skill to play it. If you are adept at tactical games then this definitely for you, if you're like me and can't deal with that kind of thing then look elsewhere.			"

												I have played over 30 hours of this game since it's offical release and I have enjoyed every minute of it. Yes the game does have it's glitches, which I hope the devleopers are looking into and going to try and fix, but I have seen few games roll out without a few glitches at release time. The game is unforgiving, but the table top game was just as unforgiving and I enjoy that part. It makes you feel like this mission could be your last so you need to use tactics to not just win, but to survive. If you run up and attack a whole warband with only one guy, well bad things are going to happen to your one guy. The game also makes you think about future missions. You can't just go and blow all your gold on members and equipment. You have to save money in case you need to replace that equipment or even replace a member who died or was too injuried to be worth using anymore. Luckily they have the reserve system, so members who are injuried can be put in reserve while they heal, or even train (yes training takes time in game also) and a fresh member can replace them. The controls are a little hard to get use to at first, but after a while playing the game, it became easier. While the load time is horrible and the AI seems to take forever to make its move during it's turn, it has yet to push me away from this game.  Overall, it is a good, horror filled game that you never know what is coming at you around a corner and you never know when it will be your last. If you enjoy these types of games or if you enjoyed the table top game, this is definitely one to pick up. I think you will enjoy it.			"

								As an early access I would normally give it some wiggle room, but considering the price tag, I would expect a lot more out of this game.Pros:  It isn't done, so maybe it will become a good game.Cons:* Very excessive load times for such a short skirmish (1-2 minutes for 15 minutes of play), this should be a big fix target.* Not sure if it is because I am new, but perhaps the computer enemies should not get 3 attacks to my 1-2 and somehow have 2 extra people at the same time.  Game balance is for crap, and without difficulty settings, I don't even want to fight 100 fights to figure out how to finally beat them.  (Worst part, they were the same faction, so it is not factional aspects).  And when they ran into 3 traps and still killed me so completely, something is wrong.* Management doesn't seem to say much, not sure how to ""configure"" people to win, assumed the default would do it.

												Not worth its asking price. Everything in the game is too convoluted, too much of the UI information obfuscated(you can see what the various stats mean between the missions, but not during the missions), and you are forced to scrap your campaign multiple times as when bad luck strikes and you fail a single mission, that is a blow from which you are not likely to recover, as if you just keep on going, your warriors will deteriorate due to carrying wounds from previous fights they lost, even the Undead. They are not really Undead in any sense, they are just humans with a different skin and some unique passive abilities. I wish I could still have a refund for this utter trash. Sadly, the few missions I played took far too much time and I went past the two hour mark. The game looks terrible, plays poorly, FPS spikes over one thousand during the opening credits which is sure to harm your  GPU in the long run, and suffers from very ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design.			"

												I want to love Mordheim, but I can't. The idea of it is great, but disheartening in practice. For one, your enemies always seem to be better than you. They dodge more often and hit more often. They sometimes even outnumber you while being better than you. And you have to spare troops to acquire special stones while your superior enemy swarms you, so you can send the stones to your faction's benefactor every few days, cause if you don't do it four times then your warband is finished.I love games that challenge me, but Mordheim just feels like I'm being punished.Oh, how silly of me. I forgot to mention the entire map is a clusterf*ck of traps. Traps on the floor, on the walls, I'm surprised there's none on what few ceilings there are.			"

												I really love this game, probably for the reasons that people don't love this game; the WALL of difficulty, the complete randomness, having a guy run around wrecking the scourge of chaos while missing an arm and an eye.It's not a game for everyone, but it reminds me so much of tabletop campaigns. (doh! It's Warhammer!)I like the fact that it took me three times to overcome, a what would now be, simple mission. I like not knowing what warband I'm going to run up against, gets the blood flowing. I like it when my spells fail LOL Chaos at it's finest. TL/DR: Mordheim is not for the weak or the cowardly.

												I really want to love this game, but I just can't in good conscious recommend it to anyone. There are too many issues.In case you aren't aware, Mordheim is based on a skirmish tabletop by Games Workshop, though as I understand it it doesn't use the original game's rules. The adaption is a turn based strategy game in a really dark fantasy setting where you build and manage a warband. You recruit heroes and henchmen and slowly build them up by surviving randomly generated missions. There are permanent consequences anywhere, from permanent injuries after dying to downright permadeath. There is a constant race against time too since you need to deliver a ressource in time that you can gather during missions every few ingame weeks. If you manage to do it the timer is reset, but if you don't the whole game is lost. Losing too many people permanently and not being able to go to missions to gather the ressource does in essence also lose you the game permanently. This doesn't happen after 3 or 4 hours by the way, this will become a problem after 20 or 30 hours.It would all be fine if it would all be down to your skill as a player, but there is a TON of reliance on RNG in this game. If facing permanent debilitations because of things completely outside your control is something that bothers you, dear god stay away from this game.But it wasn't what made me quit playing ultimately (no I didn't ragequit after losing the game). What kills it is the slowness. There is a ton of waiting for enemy actions during missions and slow animations that can't be skipped or sped up. Also, the story missions are absolutely terribly designed. They are on maps that are confusing as heck with totally unclear mission directions. And they take forever. The first try you are almost guaranteed to lose until you figure out what the mission is even about. They are just a complete drag and no fun at all. After 20 hours of building my warband, seeing the forth mission of the sisterhood and thinking that I will have to face more of that♥♥♥♥♥♥after 20 more hours I just lost all energy and motivation. Thanks but no thanks, there are games that are simply more fun than this.			"

 Unforgiving and repetitive… but also challenging & nerdy!So in this black or white system from steam there’s just thumbs up or down. The question is: Would you recommend this game to others? The answer to this question is… NO!Why?This is not a mainstream game like XCOM, HOMM & Co. It’s a hardcore Warhammer niche game for freaks & nerds! So if you consider yourself more of a mainstream player, then this game is most likely not for you. The /ragequit chance is probably over 95%... (There’s actually an achievement for it.)If you want to test the waters for turnbased RPG & strategy RNG games, I strongly recommend to get XCOM first (It’s easier and better in most aspects than Mordheim & I enjoyed it tremendously). Put it on Classic & Ironman mode to see how it goes. If you enjoy this kind of gameplay & want more of it, get XCom 2. If you done with that, there is nothing else on your plate & you get Mordheim in a Steam-Sale, then go for it and try it out.I have some likes and dislikes about the game.1st  dislike: You can’t start at once. You have to go through boring tutorials and then watch guide videos and read guides online. You have to carefully plan your Warband (party progression) and execute everything by the book or else you’re most likely not gonna make it.2nd dislike: It contains several of my personal game design No Go’s:-	Dead Ends -> Did I mention that you’re most likely not gonna make it?-	Missing difficulty settings -> Sucks… /ragequit… / You’re most likely not gonna make it…-	Unlimited spawning of enemies -> In story-mission, which are optional & can be ignored-	Limiting the savegame options (fixed savepoints or online-only savegame) - As a PC player I want a free savegame-system -> If you manage to get your sgame broken it’s… Game Over!-	Repetitive MOTS gameplay & mindless grinding -> There is not enough content to keep you entertained for long, maps, enemies, loot, names => everything repeats itself after a few hours.-	Missing space for exploration and experimenting -> The game is about perfection and extremely unforgiving-	Absence of logic -> Mission ends when the enemy flees or gets killed… What do you do now? Right, you loot the map or auto-collect the rest of the loot like in XCom… But no, not in Mordheim, you only get a small fracture of the uncollected loot, so all you just did in this mission was practically for nothing… As the AI normally attacks you in the 2nd or 3rd round, you’ll have a very small window to explore freely.It’s also very hard to fulfill optional sidequests, for example you need to collect stuff from certain enemies. This is very hard due to the early routing of enemy warbands. After 3 from 7 or 4 from 9 are killed they rout and the mission ends immediately – especially frustrating if just beat down the one you needed and this ends the mission before you can loot. In this cases the game should marked the sidequest as fulfilled. I mean think this through: You get the order bring the trinket of a certain enemy home, you beat him down and his homies run away and you leave the area without the trinket… yeah, right…-	Unhelpful & boring tutorials-	Cheating AI (in general, not sure if the AI cheats in the game…)Likes:+ solid engine, great core game play, rogue-like ‘challenge factor’, nice graphics, no critical bugs+ Game has it’s moment, e.g. when you’re hiding behind a door in Ambush Mode, the enemy walks through it and you instantly kill the unit with a critical hit… Muahahah… - Pretty rare though…+ Crazy stuff like this seems to happen (Cult of the possed): Mnezocles 19 Dec, 2016 @ 8:58am Got severed arm on a mutant. Next rank had a mutation, grew it right back. "

												I want to like this game, the actual design of the game seem pretty fun but unfortunately the digital implementation of it is awful. The controls and UI particularly make me unable to recommend this game, they are really atrocious, which is quite unforgiveable as the actual design of the mechanics was already made for the table top, so other than art assets the UI and controls were basically all they had to do.This is a game that should be perfect to play with a mouse and keyboard, with a similar control system to a game like XCOM, unfortunately it has clearly been designed for a controller and even when using a controller it's not much better. Getting the information you actually want, like what an ability does or the debuffs and buffs on your character always takes multiple button presses to get to instead of just being displayed on screen or as a tooltip.You can't zoom out and get a good view of the battlefield, you are always locked behind whatever characters turn it currently is, I think there is a sort of 2D map you can look at but it it would be much more useful to just be able to zoom out in 3D and pan around the map.The graphics are also really mediocre, very flat lighting and shaders. But it's really the UI and controls that are a game killer for me.Again, the game its self is quite fun and compelling, I can see why it gathered a following in its table top incarnation but the developers have managed to make it such a chore to try and play that I honestly don't see myself going back to it.

												A very fun game set within the Warhammer Fantasy universe, plenty of depth and customization and all sorts of fun ways to leave your mark, both on your warband and on the faces of your opponents.I must say, however, the Random Number Generator for this game is seriously perverse, on the verge of being actually bad. Worse than X-Com by a damn sight, anyways. I've missed far more than one in five +80% attacks, I've been hit repeatedly with well over a 50% chance to dodge or parry, and the number of times my warriors have wiffed a 95%, with so much on the line, it's pretty sickening.

												A great twist on turn-based strategy. Overall a huge win with very deep character and party progression. Could use some AI improvement, but it remains challenging without feeling like it's cheating at all.This game is unforgiving, which makes the battles feel a lot more important than other games. If you've ever played blood bowl, it's similar in punishing you for making mistakes. I feel like there is a bit less random death in this game than others like it, and I feel like I have a bit more control over the fate of my units, which is excellent.Bottom line, if you're into turn based strategy, you should give this a spin.

												This game is not for people that like their wins handed to them or for people who can't handle it when things don't go their way because things won't go your way in this game. It's an odds game and you have to play like the odds are heavily against you, because they usually are. Some tips for getting the upper hand at the start of the game (which is where it's hardest):The AI doesn't play fair so throw any notion of being 'honorable' against it out the window. It knows exactly where your units go once they see them (even if you go out of view) and always has boosted stats over your units and will straight up murder you if you make a mistake, so use every trick you can against them. Be nasty, hide around corners and ambush them with multiple units when it sends some poor sucker for that last wyrdstone you left as bait.  Once they see one of your units, they will usually send everything to that location, except sometimes they won't send units that are on the kill list for the optional quest, so use that to your advantage.  You can set up a bottleneck in pretty much any area and ambush them as they come through so it becomes 1 vs 3 while their other units are locked away behind their one ambushed unit. Probably the best piece of advice, especially for early game, is choose the right missions. If you pick a mission where the enemy AI has easy access to a solo or small group of your units, they will suffer.  Never ever choose a ""both warbands are spread out"" and avoid the 3 groups split one (for those you can just bring 4 units and make it a 1 group thing). Early game you never want to go 1 on 1 (or worse) with a unit. Later on you'll have awesome units that can murder henchmen solo in 1 round but that takes time. The mission type defines the difficulty so much more than the actual normal/hard/brutal/deadly thing does. Although with brutal or deadly you can get surprise ambush missions which are basically the same thing as ""both warbands are spread out"" except the ambushee gets negative OP at the start so avoid those as well. In the later game ranged damage is really good at level 10 with good passives, but it's a little difficult to get a ranged unit to level 10 because they pretty much suck until level 8 or so.  You can buy warriors that are already leveled up later in the game, so remember that.If any of this sounds exciting, then this is your game.  I love this game so much more than many other strategy games because it's very difficult at first, and then you get that victory feeling once you start figuring things out.			"

												This game is very good if you're not afraid to lose a few characters here and there. especially on your first playthrough.People whine about the Random Number Generator because they missed a few hits in desperate situations, but my guess is they skipped statistics classes in college, and they shouldn't have put their characters in a desperate situation in the first place.If you flip a coin five times and it lands on heads five time, you're not gonna claim you've solved the coin flipping rule of the universe. Sometimes, in Mordheim COTD, you need to shackle the opponent's impressive character, but somehow your 95% succes chance Magister fails and gets stunned in front of everyone, and your poor sod facing the impressive character will have a bad time.Sometimes though, you play tight and get a lucky crit on their most dangerous character, and turn a uneasy battle into a piece of cake. You never hear people whine about lucky crits, though.You could see this game as an XCOM set in the Warhammer world with a default hard difficulty (which isn't that hard once you get the hang of it).Some of your characters will die, and that's ok, learn to manage a rooster big enough to handle those situations.If you want a blissful experience without any character dying, stick to the first xcom reboot on easy difficulty.Mordheim: COTD is beautiful, challenging and fun.

								The game is quite addictive.  It's fairly tough at first but once you get the hang of it becomes easier and even more satisfying.  All four factions feel distinct, and the injuries look quite good, though I hate when my troops become hobbled.  My only real complaint so far is the lack of customization for appearance, but thats a pretty small thing.  I would highly recommend getting this game if you like turn based strategy games and/or warhammer.			"

												As the kids would say, ""This is my jam.""I'm not usually a fan of games that punish you for losing, but there's something very compelling about Mordheim: City of the Damned.Love the levelling up of a whole roster of warriors. Love the unique third person view of the battlefield. Love the brutality of failure when members of your warband get dismembered or worse. Love the careful strategic planning and setting of ambushes in a fight, only to suddenly have the tables turn on me at the last moment because I got overzealous.While the current setting and the available races are very enjoyable, I hope to see this being expanded upon greatly to include more landscapes, more warband options, more variety in loot and rewards, simple more Mordheim and beyond!Recommended to anyone who likes some punishingly strategic game-play with swords and progression.

												8/10Mordheim is a great turn based strategy game set in a dark and gritty city plagued with evil and greedy beings. This comes straight from the Warhammer Universe, and i enjoyed it without ever playing the board games or really understanding the lore.The game is a lot like Valkyria Chronicles where you control each character from a third person view and have a large area to navigate in each short battle.PROS-maintains the dark and gloomy theme throughout the game-you have your own squad/warband and are able to upgrade them over the duration of the game-a lot of customisation which means you get attached to your squad -it is difficult to the point where one wrong move and you have resulted in your best soldier being knocked out and needing an arm amputation (difficult is good in a genre where you can steamroll the whole game without a challenge)-the battles are strategic and enjoyable-graphics and music are very appropriateNEGS-the ""random"" luck element in hit/dodge/parry chance is in my opinion rubbish (call me salty but 4 x 80% chance hits missing in a row is pretty bad) The dice rolls will infuriate you-Each sector of the city you play in is very similar. There are the odd differences but not enough to create a variety.All in all it is a very polished and enjoyable game and is a must buy when on sale!			"

												I've finished a few battles and learned a lot:1. Don't just sit there and get pommelled to death.2. Try to lure the enemy into abushes.3. Pick up Wyrdstone! You need to sell and trade it for reputation.4. You have to decide whether to go for treasure or position for the next battle.Pros +++ Fun!+ True line of sight - You might be able to see the enemy moving around the map but you aren't exactly sure of where they are until you're freakin' ambushed :P+ Overwatch using ranged attacks+ Lots of skills and spells+ The game saves before each move (I think) to allow you to pick up from where you left off.Cons- A map stopped loading at 88% once, but I just killed/reloaded the gameI recommend it.

												This game has 1300+ positive reviews and only about 400 negative, however, 4 out of the first 5 reviews you see are negative. That would almost make someone instantly change their mind about buying this game. Why aren't their more positive reviews up front for people to see? And steam, shouldn't the out dated reviews be moved down the list so people can see reviews about the current version? (I know iPhone and iPad app store only keep reviews about the current version.)In my opinion, the recent patch totally fixed most of the RNG problems and a bunch other glitches. About people who said that their character ""missed 5 95% shots in a row "". I'm gonna make an arguement. First of all, max level (10) leaders and heros have 9 offense points, which are enough for 4 one-handed hits or 3 two-handed hits. If your heros or headers are using ranged weapon, they could do 3 gun shots or 4 bow shots. A max level impressive warrior also has 9 offensive points, so 4 hits also. So I don't understand where you got those 5 shots.... So why don't you guys be a responsible reviewer and remove those negative reviews that are not true to the current version any more? Plus most of those posters just sounded like they did not know how the game works.But anyway, Mordheim is an awesome turn-based strategy game. At first I played it on my boyfriend's account and leveled up my sister warband to 10. Then my boyfriend bought me a copy, and since then I have played over 250 hours. I have enjoyed this game a lot. To those who have enjoyed Mordheim, I suggest you all write a positive review to bring more players into this game. I believe we all need more skirmish players!			"

												A very fun game set within the Warhammer Fantasy universe, plenty of depth and customization and all sorts of fun ways to leave your mark, both on your warband and on the faces of your opponents.I must say, however, the Random Number Generator for this game is seriously perverse, on the verge of being actually bad. Worse than X-Com by a damn sight, anyways. I've missed far more than one in five +80% attacks, I've been hit repeatedly with well over a 50% chance to dodge or parry, and the number of times my warriors have wiffed a 95%, with so much on the line, it's pretty sickening. Not saying the game is broken, but I'm saying there is a surprising amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, not numbers, being generated.

												Get this if you like blood bowl and hate elf bulls#!t.  No crazy rules, just knock the enemy out.Good game for those looking for a challenge.  At first it will feel completely random, but in time you can reduce the risk a great deal with good strategy.  You will still have those occasional moments when the enemy hits that 1% chance and you lose your best character.  If you can't deal with that, don't bother playing.The vetran system means you make permanent progress, no matter how bad it gets.  It almost feels like a rogue-like, due to individual matches for shorter games and progress across warbands.			"

												Solid 8/10Pretty good game, I bought it because X-COM2 wasnt out yet and I surprised myself stucking on that game instead of actually buying X-COM2.The fact is : This game is really harsh, I should say unfair and over-punishing with new players. Other player`s opinion may differ, but this was my experience. Dont get me wrong, its not a bad thing. This game was MADE to be that way.WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW : -----This game should have a warning on its label : You are going to get intensely r4ped for the first 10 hours or so. Its totally normal if you feel sad and angry, just accept it...Learning curve ?...No way, you are thrown into it and you are going to drown. Pretty much the reason of all bad reviews.-----The game also doesnt warn you that its almost impossible to stay with your first ever warband, so dont get attached too soon. You are going to replace them often, disbanding and re-creating at least once. They going to get killed, crippled, ransacked and sick poor again. You are going to want to bash your whole house and family with your keyboard, but its part of the first stage of the game.-----To be honest, once you get past the "" initiation "" step, its one of the best bucks$/game ratio I ever played, and I bought it full price so I reccomend you jump on it, especially if its on sale. The game also greatly rewards new warbands, depending on your easily obtainable achievements.Most of bad reviews come from people with less than 15hrs. Give yourself a chance, you are missing a great gem of a game. The game is still challenging and hard when you gear up and lvl up, but really less unfair. Damn good game.My point is : Dont buy if you dont like getting angry on a game. Dont buy if you want a ""walk in the park"" gaming experience.NOW THE HONEST REVIEW : Dont buy if you dont like unexpected and ""against the odds"". Whole game is based on dice-rolls and odds. Once again, reason of most bad reviews...Personally I call that "" Challenging"" and ""Refreshing"" ...Mostly ""Refreshing"" But most gamers nowaday calling that... "" Broken""...go figure....And I am not even that old. I am not even an hardcore gamer.PRETTY  SIMPLE :You want to win on each tries, you want forgivness on your stupid/rushed plays?You want to load a previous save because you ♥♥♥♥ed up?  Steam, Origin, U-Play, name em are full of those kind of un-original games, of any genres. 70-80-90$-DLC not Included, and you will get erected at how much copy-paste/recycled games are appealing and how much dev team doesnt care about you and your elite community. Btw, I got these kind of games on my pc. Some I love, Some I regret. I am no hater, I love games.Rogue-Factor`s first game...Not perfect, but damn impressive for a little bunch of devs. Promising future if you ask me, just dont bury em under false bad ""under 10 hours game experience"" meaningless-seen-better-meh-IamtheShit opinions.Worst of all, every negative stuff I read about this game is absolutely wrong on most aspects. Too little time into it to make worthy reviews. I have seen about 3 constructive bad reviews, with points I agreed on, but never to the point of calling that game-breaker.IMPORTANT TO MENTION : -Great ambiant music and great grim victorian dark atmoshpere. I mean, its dark, and grim. Like the first Diablo compared to Diablo3. -...You have to be patient...You have to let time to the enemy to place their warriors, can take several seconds.-I never tried multiplayer, due to real life stuff. But from what I heard, its not optimal yet.-Dev team often on forums and answering constructive posts.-Speaking about the forums, many experienced players are there, always happy to give tips.long read, sorry. By the way, I never played the table-top version. I heard there is some inaccuracies. Some people like it, some dont. Anyway, the game is awesome.			"

This review is for a single campaign, I haven't touched the multiplayer yet.First of all, I would like to say, that this game has a great potential and I hope it will get better in time. Still, I can't recommend it for now even if you're a Warhammer FB fan. And here is why:RNGBack in release days game was literally unplayable - you could miss 6 times in a row with 95% hit-chance and it was ""normal"". This horrible dice roll system was, for example, in new X-COM or Blackguards and caused so much rage and back blood, that you could raise a permanent Bloodthirster from it. But we don't need to learn from other's mistakes, right? Frankly, devs heard your cries, so in the current state the roll system was fixed and you will not miss as often, but it still has THIS MOMENTS, when the enemy dodges two of your attacks with 9% chance, when you can't dodge even once with your 40% chance. Or you miss 3 of 4 your 85% attack. Or a Tzeench kills you on a first spell with 9% mishap.But still, now it's much better and I'm hoping for the best.Stupid Strange ideas and overall balanceLike you can't parry with two-handed sword(!), but you can with a halberd(!!!). Maces and hammers have no armor penetration, but axes do. Hell, even rifles(at least, the hunter rifle) in this game have no armor penetration! Instead of that you have a crit chance or a crit strength! Yeah, sure.You get tired from using two-handed weapon(+1 attack point and - 20% damage for each next attack) or dual wield, but you don't get tired from using a one-handed weapon and shield. Should I tell you, why it's better to do 2 hits with one-handed than 1 with two-handed? Besides that, you're getting tired even from using guns! Even pistols! But it's not the funny part. The funny part is that you don't get tired from using all kinds of bows! WHAT. THE. FFFFFF~...and the daggers are just garbage. And you can't shoot in melee, but you can cast in it(really?!).   And you can shoot into melee fight even through your comrades. Ahaha, game, what are you doing, please stop!P.S You CAN parry with almost anything. Yes, even with a two-handed hammer. Just not as effective. Just not in this game.Loading time and Enemy turnEvery mission is loading forever. Like windows 95 on your old Pentium. And after that you need to wait when bunch of ugly women do all there jumping and falling, while they're slowly moving throw the map. And it's takes as much time as loading. So get yourself a good FB fluff book and alt+tab, because you gonna wait a lot. If you decide to buy this game of course.MissionsThere is two types of missions in this game: story missions and boring missions. Story missions are very good and I don't have much complaints about them, but you will rarely see them. The boring missions are only one type - smash the enemy faces. Yes, you can call them ""Warpstone rush"" or ""Domination"", but these are side quests. The major task is always one - make them flee. And it's fun. For a first hundred times. After that it's became a routine, which is not that bad due to an interesting gameplay, but still. The major issue is that often you can't even complete the side-quest because when the enemy morale passes some threshold the battle is over and you stand victorious on a pile of NOT picked warpstones. Ha-ha, too bad, boy, here is your 3 small pieces and get out of my map! Rrrrrrealy annoying. At least give me two extra terns to pick up my stuff.AIAI in this game is dumb and buggy. It will stroll around the map, when you are beating sht out of their comrades. It will choose  the retardiest way to engage or to move. It will stuck in the corners. In close combat with multiple targets it will start randomly shooting comets rather than kill a stunned 2 HP enemy. Et cetera, et cetera.And it will cheat with onslaught and ambush, I swear it.Allocation and MinimapPlacing you warband in this game is pain. First of all, you can't do it from minimap. Second - you randomly choose the next or previous positions. So you will bounce across the map like a ping-pong ball untill you get sick. Especially on the ambush maps.PerksThe skill and leveling system in this game is really good and has a potential. So much skills, active/passive perks and parameters like a balsam on my black heart.However, there is a fly in the ointment - there is no perks for a certain weapon. And I can't understand why - we have heavy armour and shield passive perks, but not for exact weapon or even a weapon type? This is a huge variety limitation and it's really upsets me.Second - there is a useful perks for all, and there is never-ever-ever use perks. Same for the spells: 1-2 ""must have"" spells(like lightning or chaos chains) and garbage. There is not much of variety - use these or be a gay.Third - the cost of learning is overpriced. You waste too much money and time on even basic perks. 200 gold for armor wearing, really? I can buy a purple armor for 200 gold! And it's a basic level perk! There is some corruption in this warrior school, investigate it.DifficultyI really like hard games, I really do. And I also like hardcore/ironman run, It makes me feel alive. But there is a line between a hard interesting challenge and BDSM. And Slaanesh sees, devs have crossed it. Even If you're winning, you can get an unpleasant situation, when one of your fallen warriors gets some nasty injuries, but it's fine. Worse when you get some really bad trauma, like arm or leg loss. For some of you, who think that it's cool - no, it's not. Your 5-lvl veteran becomes crippled garbage and there is nothing you can do(waste some of your warpstone for regeneration for example). But this is life, right? Ohoho, but don't even try to lose, you filthy little casual, because game will give you a full-strenght stomach punch and then spit on your writhing body. Half of the team will be dead or crippled to an unusable condition. You will waste tons of money and time to even heal them, not talking about replacing. Or you'll just delete your glorious unbeatable warband, like I did with my 6-lvl warband today. Game did everything it could to beat my leader magister and his patrol(No, I don't want to send a patrols, I'm a commander here god damn it!), including gay RNG stunnes and misses.There is a bright side actually - there is overall progress, which will make every new warband easer to progress, but still. At least make this game less fluky.What is good in this game, you might ask? Well, It's Warhammer in the nutshell - dark, unforgiving place where is no good at all - just less bastart. The atmosphere is great, the maps are looking cool, the customisation of your warband is unique. And like I've said before, this game has so much potential for further development. And I hope the devs will implement it in full.			"

												I thought about getting this for some time. When the game came out for a free weekend, I was thrilled. However the trill was short lived when I actually started playing it. Some people have complained about the steep learning curve. Elite Dangerous has a steep learning curve, this has a learning cliff with no climbing ropes. The tutorial was not informative and crushingly boring. Meanwhile the campaign is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lacks much of a story other than: Go here, do this, kill this, loose half your men ect. The mechanics are very clunky and the overall camera controls are rediculusly constricting. The veiws that you get are third person and third person. This would not be so bad if it were like Dragon Age. It can take 3-4 rounds to kill an enemy one on one which will leave your man crippled regardless of whether or not he is covered in heavy armor or clad in a burlap sack. Weapon type is also imaterial a halberd/spear has nearly the same combat range as a sword or dagger wielding hostile. Bows are made useless from the combonation of short range and low damage. But the logic envolved with this is also flawed. Combat, especially in the story missions is encredibly one-sided and your entire team will run off under stupid conditions. Once I had the enemy down to one and backed into a corner 5 on 1 and lost the leader. All 4 of the others cut and run.  If this had nothing else to compair it to, we would think it was incredible, but let me make a list of games like this that are better.Dragon Age, all 3Divinity 2 Divinity Orginal SinPillars of EternityBaulders GateIcewind Dale Temple of Elemental Evil (TOEE) Dungeon SeigeBlackguards 1&2Your favorite game hereOn an up note, this does beat out Sword Coast. Then again, contracting Leishmaniasis beats that. My point is, there is no point in getting this when there are a slew of other games out there that are so so much better that cost far far less.			"

												As a longtime fan and player of the tabletop game, I was thrilled to see Mordheim was being made into a computer game. My old computer didn't meet the minimum specs, but after buying an ASUS ROG rig on clearance at Best Buy this spring, I have to say Rogue Factor did not disappoint! This is a fantastic conversion, with four of the iconic warbands included, and now a fifth -- Witch Hunters -- available as DLC, as well as several hired swords. Keep it coming, devs!Like the tabletop version, the gameplay is highly tactical. Ganging up on lone enemies, while preventing the enemy from ganging up on you, is the key to victory. Yes, you will lose warriors from time to time -- get used to it, it's Mordheim! Keep your heavy hitters in front, while your weaker members grab wyrdstone and loot until they're strong enough to fight. Hire a reserve leader so you don't miss days when your primary leader gets injured -- make those wyrdstone shipments to your sponsor on time! That keeps the gold flowing and lets you build up your warband. Now, my Level 10 Ogre is a killing machine!No, the game isn't perfect -- there are occasional spots in some maps where you should be able to move but a small obstacle blocks your path. And the AI does get hung up once in a while, especially with the large monsters unable to find a path or blocked by a wagon. Also, the persistent arrows after you get shot really need to go away -- having your warriors running around fighting with an arrow right between the eyes or through their skulls looks pretty dumb. So those glitches still need to be ironed out. But overall, this is a great game of Mordheim. The visuals are spot-on, the story missions are fun, and you don't even have to paint your warband. Now let's get that Undead warband into the game! And then, Necromunda...			"

												So let me start off saying I only did the free weekend play so take that for what it's worth.Pros:great game universestrategy is required to winvery customizable war band membersfairly well thought out combat mechanicsCons:some parts of battle are so random you are destined to loseno amount of strategy or planning can save you from a random map stacked against youthe enemy turns, while in fog of war, take an eternity you leave valuable things uncollected on the battlefield wether you like it or notthe 'random' rolls are more brutal than a fight with Mike TysonOverall if you enjoy this universe and dont mind getting punched in the D*** over and over by tiny rat men because they have better rolls than Jesus then this game might be for you. If you want a game that you actually feel like there is a chance to win then another title may be your flavor. Essentially the gameplay is like Darksouls meets XCom.			"

												This game does not deserve this many bad reviews.  The game is not high priced. Has affordable DLCs even when not on discount. Its a visual beauty and the gameplay harsh and unforgiving.  You make yourself a warband which you can customize to some extend. And you set off in the grimm city of Mordheim to gatehr wyrdstones for your faction.  You win some and you lose some, but everything comes down to choices as you won't be able to sweep the battlefield after the match is done.  If you lose a fight your merc have the potential to get wounded this includes losing limbs, eyes and even permadeath.   IF you have an unlucky streak you might find yourself a crippled warband and you will have to reroll again.  The game is not designed for an easy game with godmode on.  Expect to die, a lot.			"

												1/3rd of the tutorial took me over an hour to finish.During this period, out of 27 attacks all with over a 65% hit chance each attack, I hit 5 times.And the seemingly hellish RNG is not at all made up for by the game's UI, graphics, animations, or story.All I can think is ""this is gonna be rough, and not in the fun way.""$40? Nah, that's a joke for how unpolished this game is. But if you're genuinely masochistic and you can get it for free or on sale, by all means, go for it.			"

												This game made me rage so badly... I rage quit. Came back later, got the hang of things, ragequit again when i lost my best dude. Eventually came back again this time certain i knew what was going on, got destroyed and rage quit.This is really a story of the game abusing me and me comming back for more, certain i can beat it and then getting a beating.In the end its one of the few truely difficult games that isn't completely unfair, the more you learn the more you use tactics and the better you do. With bits of RNG that kills your favorite guy you've been building up because of a lucky crit. In the end my verdict is: Brings out my masochistic desires. Great and rage inducing. You will rage quit, I guarantee it, and then you'll come back for more.			"

												At first i gave this game a poor review. However the dev team responded so I felt like i should respond My innitial complains were about the Terrible story missions and the fact that the reforcement mechanic is pull. However as the Dev was kind enough to respond about the long load times i felt that alone is enough to make up for its fault as you can enjoy the game for endless hours without doing the storied missions. Also to make it clear it is not the story in these mission that is poorly done but the mechanics that our added to them, Like not showing the objectives till you have completed the current so you cant forward plan. Also the fact that many of the missions end with getting stuck and stalled on a single stairway. Really i wish i could give a medium rating but thier is no middleground rating.  Also Skaven for life.Hi Chex 86,It seems you’ve had trouble with a unique Story missions. Here’s some elements that might help you out:- Only Story missions have the “reinforcement” mechanic- Story missions are not mandatory, you could ignore them entirely if you desire- Story missions do not grow in power with you, so you can come back when your rating is higher to have an easier timeWe are constantly working to improve the loading time and will keep doing so for the upcoming weeks.We hope these cues will help you enjoy the game.

												I bought it in early access ages ago as I played this tabletop game as a child and loved it.I waited until it was out of early access before playing it as I didn't want to ruin it (just like I don't watch trailers for movies).I am loving it. The game mechanics are very different to the original game but they work very well as a video game. Amazingly well in fact. This is the best designed game I'm played in a long time.I love the open-ended, rogue-like nature of the game. I got brutally slaughtered in the first game (before I realised not to split my band up) but still enjoyed it as I was immediately spending XP and changing my choice of weapons.Losing is common, but it's not so bad as your warriors don't die (some get injuries, usually 1 max). Just keep grabbing Wyrdstone on the matches.I've had zero crashes in 13 hours, of playtime. It is slow to load the matches (~40 secs) but once they start it's fine.If you like tactical combat and open-ended gamepleay, I can honestly say this is the best game like this that I've ever played in the last couple of years.Edit after 150 hrs:Still enjoying the game very much. The main flaw, and it's a big one, is that the AI pathfinding is pretty poor. This means that sometimes the AI warriors get stuck and essentially waste their turn. I hope they fix this in a patch as this game could otherwise be a classic.			"

												If you enjoy games such as XCOM and Darkest Dungeon, you'll probably enjoy this too. Don't expect AAA production values or fairness. If you come into this game expecting a smooth run, you're gonna be disappointed. If you enjoy the ups and downs of a game of this nature and take it as it comes, you'll find a satisfying experience tactically on par with the aforementioned games.I actually enjoyed that unlike XCOM or Darkest Dungeon, downed soldiers will usually survive and are more likely to be injured than dead. It's a bit more granular and allows for more balanced fights where you can have multiple downed soldiers but still win, rather than all-or-nothing (either you kill all the baddies, or it's a total failure). The 'rout' system plays into this nicely as well. Coming from XCOM I found it refreshingly forgiving while still keeping the fear of death at every mission-end screen.It's not a beautiful game and it could certainly have more variety - if I paid full price for it, as a frugal gamer, I might feel a bit ripped off. But at £10 it's a steal. It fills a niche that few games do, and it's gradually getting better over time as they add more warbands (even if you don't buy the DLC warbands, they'll show up as enemies) and fine-tune the balance. The devs are very communicative too. I hope to see the game expand even more over time.There's unfortunately lots of folks downvoting genuine reviews and trying to trash this game, which is silly. It seems a lot of folks have never played an RNG-based game before and are stunned that 90%s can miss and 10%s can hit. Those moments where your archer fails to climb up a wall three times in a row are hilarious BECAUSE they are unlikely. The moment when your henchman nails a 10% to hit a vampire lord, or when you lose your leader to bad luck - that's why we play these games. It enables a narrative that other games don't have. The triumph of victory against steep odds, the crushing defeat of failure. You don't get that feeling in most games. It's not for everyone, but if you're one of those people - you know who you are - then you know that there's no substitute.I suggest looking at hours played for reviews and check out some youtube lets plays if you're on the fence.

												Mordheim is a turn based strategy game with some vague similarities to the XCOM series but set in the dark, gritty fantasy world of Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy setting.This game is an adaption of the classic tabletop game Mordheim (which was itself the fantasy reskin of the excellent TT game Necromunda) and it captures the setting extremely well. The graphics and music evoke the right atmosphere and look damn good, especially when you realise what a small team it was working on this game.The game itself is hard. Like, really hard. Particualrly at the beginning, where the learning curve is like an overhanging cliff (and the wide skill selection is an avalanche that starts when you're part way up). The tutorials are good but they don't cover everything, they're definitely worth going through though. It does get easier and you'll find that you're able to do Brutal and Deadly missions and generally win, although that doesn't mean you won't lose people to going Out of Action during those wins.Ah yes, out of action... This game has permanent consequences for your actions. There's no save scumming, although there is an ironman style autosave feature in case of crashes, etc. Other than that you have to live with your decsisions and, due to it's TT roots, the roll of the die. Yeah, sometimes RNG can screw you, it's just that sort of game. Your mooks will go down and out and, when they do, they will end up picking up injuries or straight up dying. That part of Mordheim and, at least for me, part of the fun!So the purpose of the game? You've been sent to Mordheim by a baacker who is funding your activities in the city. Their exact nature and reasons for sending you there vary from faction to faction but suiffice it to say you work for them. And what you're doing for them is collecting warpstone, a resource that's scattered throughout the maps. You will periodically have deliveries to fill for them where they require a particualr amount of warpstone. Failing to make those deliveries will eventually lose you the game so try to make them on time. Other than that you will be levelling up your warriors and your warband, as well as you as a player via the Veteran System whereby you get perks like additional starting gold and access to Veteran Skills. Your warband will gain stat increases, more strategy points and offence points, as well as gaining skill points to spend on the bewildering array of passive and active skills available (warning: they aren't cheap, especially when you master a skill). Some of your guys will gain access to spells, and as you level up new hero types (and eventually the mighty Impressives) will be come available to your warband.  You'll also loot more powerful equipment and begin discover magical formulae that allow you to place marks on your weapons and armour, that do a variety of things.All in all I would definitely recommend the game. I very much enjoy it and can't wait to have a try at multiplayer (I've only done single player thus far), where I think the game will really shine. Just be aware that it is a hardcore exsperience. You will lose matches, you will have people get injured and die, your equipment will be looted from their bodies, you will struggle for gold to pay your warband and buy skills and replacement warriors. That's an integral part of Mordheim and might mean that the game isn't for you, which is fine. It is for me though, I absolutely love it!			"

												One of the best games featuring detailed squad management and tactical turn based battles. Each battle You fight is shaping a history of Your mercenary group. Every wound, every death, every item You loot or loose to enemy is permanent. But even if You loose Your group, You still earn some experience that will give You a small bonus next time. So there will be some benefit even in loosing.			"

												Get this if you like blood bowl and hate elf bulls#!t.  No crazy rules, just knock the enemy out.Good game for those looking for a challenge.  At first it will feel completely random, but in time you can reduce the risk a great deal with good strategy.  You will still have those occasional moments when the enemy hits that 1% chance and you lose your best character.  If you can't deal with that, don't bother playing.The vetran system means you make permanent progress, no matter how bad it gets.  It almost feels like a rogue-like, due to individual matches for shorter games and progress across warbands.			"

												A surprisingly very good game with its fair share of flaws. Allows you to have a warband of mercenaries, customize it, build it up, lose it, gear it, love it, hate it (all that with more charisma and style than any conversational simulator such as mass effect), all that in an endless gameplay mode that allows you to play for as long as you want even if you completed (or not) the main campaign attached to each warband.For those interested in pvp the game offers matches against other players but for that itwould be good if you join the gentlmen of mordheim group to arrange games, otherwise the game list looks like the Sahara desert 99.9% of the time. I have no interest in pvp so good for themThe art style in this game is quite an achievement of ugly looking people in proper dirty clothing and real life looking weapons for the most part,  contrary to the horrible color palette abuse and toyish designs most developers seem to follow (cartoon style, how I hate it). While the graphics themselves are not that great, the game itself looks good.If you are buying this its not going to be for the graphics, but the gameplay.The game has its fair share of flaws like I mentioned at the start, some of them being:Rather poor animations that could use a lot of more work.Limited variety of maps (4 maps if i recall correctly, and despite that every time you play the maps have different starting locations and random features such as blocked paths, holes in the walls and different routes, so all in all is not that bad).On that regard some more map(s) could improve this lack of variety. Sewers and catacombs and underground tunnels connecting buildings would make such a great addition... even if it is in the already known maps.Certain mission goals are a bit anal, such as the already discussed ""steal the idol from the enemy cart, then place it in your own cart"". Should not be enough to just steal it?.On a personal level I would love to see some kind of weekly or even daily randomly generated special missions featuring some narrative and rpg elements allowing you to play with the dramatis personae of your warband (the dramatis personae is the npc which acts as your ""boss"" and gives you the campaign missions). Maybe even reusing some of the campaign maps (which btw are different from the usual maps you get when you play normal missions).All in all, my best purchase from the previous year along with Space Hulk Ascension. Kinda funny that these small developer teams are making better turn based strategy games (and understand the concept) when compared to the big budget productions with lots of marketing and shiny graphics.However if you have mental issues with losing, and expect a game to be fair towards the player, or this is just a casual interest because it belongs to the GW franchise or whatever, then save your money.As a diamond in the rough it wont please everyone.

												I had previously written a review for this when it was in Early Access.  Now that it is in full release I figured I'd better get with the program.Mordheim is a turn-based strategy game based on the Game Workshop Mordheim setting.  Four different warbands (six if you get the DLC) square off against one another in a ruined city, competing for control of the city and the resources it contains.  It is difficult, unforgiving, and I love every second of it.One of the things that stands out most to me is the way the gameplay functions.  When a unit takes their turn, instead of relying on any sort of grid, they are free to move around in a third person free roaming mode, limited to their movement range.  This gives the game a very open and exploratory feel, and really feels like a skirmish instead of a board game with pretty graphics.  Each army is unique and favors different playstyles.  They have their own unique skills, equipment, stat limitations, and unit types.  This provides a huge range of options with which to customize your playstyle.  On that subject you'd better get good at the playstyle as well, because the game will punish you if you don't.One of the core principles of this game is that choices matter.  If one of your units falls in battle, they may suffer injuries that will affect their stats, lose equipment, or even die and have to be replaced.  If you do well, they will be rewarded with experience points that level their stats, provide skill points, and increase their health.  The PVP is a solid experience, though sometimes bugs get in the way.  Occasionally there will be issues causing you and your opponents games to ""desync,"" causing different outcomes for checks.  This could mean that sometimes a unit falls out of action for you, but not your opponent.  It's a problem.  Most of the time though it works just fine, and battles against a skilled opponent are still very rewarding.  It works well enough, that I've done some one off games on my YouTube channel, and even joined six other YouTubers and participated in a PVP league that ran for at least 16 battles.  My point here is don't let the occasional bug scare you off.  Another benefit to this game is the DLC.  Since release they have added two additional factions.  The Witch Hunters, and the Undead provide very different styles of play from the other four, and I still don't feel like any faction inherently rises above all the others.  In addition to this, they added a Hired Swords DLC that added another four units to the game that can be usable by the original factions.  This includes the Poison Wind Globadier, Smuggler, Worf Priest of Ulric, and the Doomsayer.  The Globadier and Doomsayer can be hired by the chaotic aligned factions while the Wolf Priest, and Smuggler are hired by the order factions.  It's a great way to mix up your war band and through an unexpected wrench at your opponent.All said and done I would highly recommend this game.  The great support from the development team, the wonderful art style and game features, and the originality in the maps and warbands combines to make a very memorable and enjoyable experience.			"

								All i could say was Wow wtf when I saw this title and in a good way.  Today was xmas for me, a game I would never have thought would be released, I didn`t think twice about buying this game.Even though I`ve only managed to play a couple of games, its definately worthy to make a home in my steam library.  The graphics are amazing, the gameplay easy to get into, the options and tactics are many and varied (in game).  Looking forward to the future of this title and the other warbands hopefully soon.  Even though a couple of my games have crashed, its what you would expect from a early access game.  Buy it if you liked/played Mordheim the tabletop game.  And, even if you didn`t play the tabletop game buy it anyway.			"

												X-COM meets Dark Souls. I don't think I've ever played a tactical game so addictive and very VERY well designed.So many customization (talking about RPG elements, not visual) options for your characters, and each victory feel like you won the lottery (because there is a big element of luck in the game lol).In any case, if you liked X-COM, want it to be darker and more hardcore, pick this one up, it's one trip you won't forget!(graphics could be way better, and the animations are dull and boring).

												This game has 1300+ positive reviews and only about 400 negative, however, 4 out of the first 5 reviews you see are negative. That would almost make someone instantly change their mind about buying this game. Why aren't their more positive reviews up front for people to see? And steam, shouldn't the out dated reviews be moved down the list so people can see reviews about the current version? (I know iPhone and iPad app store only keep reviews about the current version.)In my opinion, the recent patch totally fixed most of the RNG problems and a bunch other glitches. About people who said that their character ""missed 5 95% shots in a row "". I'm gonna make an arguement. First of all, max level (10) leaders and heros have 9 offense points, which are enough for 4 one-handed hits or 3 two-handed hits. If your heros or headers are using ranged weapon, they could do 3 gun shots or 4 bow shots. A max level impressive warrior also has 9 offensive points, so 4 hits also. So I don't understand where you got those 5 shots.... So why don't you guys be a responsible reviewer and remove those negative reviews that are not true to the current version any more? Plus most of those posters just sounded like they did not know how the game works.But anyway, Mordheim is an awesome turn-based strategy game. At first I played it on my boyfriend's account and leveled up my sister warband to 10. Then my boyfriend bought me a copy, and since then I have played over 250 hours. I have enjoyed this game a lot. To those who have enjoyed Mordheim, I suggest you all write a positive review to bring more players into this game. I believe we all need more skirmish players!			"

Early Access Review
								[ EARLY ACCESS ]This means not all features are present.As far as I understand at least for chaos side, only skirmish is available.There may be a campaign for chaos if not all races in the future but it is not yet implemented.I run the game on a old laptop MSI FX603 and the game runs smooth with low setting gfx.The game is interesting at the core. Stats seem perhap confusing at first but reading with automatically gauge an understanding of characeristics and capabilities.Gameplay functions seem long to reach between Q and E rolling out left or right but the game is playable and I am hopeful more optimization will come along the way.This game is for casual turn base strategy players. The game is slow paced.  The atmosphere is great. Decors on low on my low spec machine are ok. Pretty unusually slow and long SKIRMISH loading time (2 minutes or a bit more) for my old machine using an IDE 5k4 RPM hard drive but again this is early access and thing ""may"" improve along the way.I recommend this game to anyone who like to pose a strategy while 3D strategy element at first is somewhat boggling, anyone quickly take marks of position and location to defend, ambush, attack, skirmish, flee, counter and more, and the so the game suddenly deepens!

								This game is fantastic.  It has a lot of issues because of where they are in the development of the game.  However they are making progress, fixing issues, and implementing the remaining systems.  So this is truely a game that is still in development.If you like turn based games, like warhammer, and do not mind something that can be very hard...  This is the game for you.If you are easily discouraged by difficulty or have a habit of getting a little to attached to your characters.. You might want to pass.  The game is hard and your guys... well the WILL die or be injured to the point where you will sell them off for a dime.			"

												As the kids would say, ""This is my jam.""I'm not usually a fan of games that punish you for losing, but there's something very compelling about Mordheim: City of the Damned.Love the levelling up of a whole roster of warriors. Love the unique third person view of the battlefield. Love the brutality of failure when members of your warband get dismembered or worse. Love the careful strategic planning and setting of ambushes in a fight, only to suddenly have the tables turn on me at the last moment because I got overzealous.While the current setting and the available races are very enjoyable, I hope to see this being expanded upon greatly to include more landscapes, more warband options, more variety in loot and rewards, simple more Mordheim and beyond!Recommended to anyone who likes some punishingly strategic game-play with swords and progression.

It might become one of my favourites.At the moment however, I would not recommend you buy it - it is hardly playable at the moment. Wait till they make it a real game instead og a way too early access game. "

												At first i gave this game a poor review. However the dev team responded so I felt like i should respond My innitial complains were about the Terrible story missions and the fact that the reforcement mechanic is pull. However as the Dev was kind enough to respond about the long load times i felt that alone is enough to make up for its fault as you can enjoy the game for endless hours without doing the storied missions. Also to make it clear it is not the story in these mission that is poorly done but the mechanics that our added to them, Like not showing the objectives till you have completed the current so you cant forward plan. Also the fact that many of the missions end with getting stuck and stalled on a single stairway. Really i wish i could give a medium rating but thier is no middleground rating.  Also Skaven for life.Hi Chex 86,It seems you’ve had trouble with a unique Story missions. Here’s some elements that might help you out:- Only Story missions have the “reinforcement” mechanic- Story missions are not mandatory, you could ignore them entirely if you desire- Story missions do not grow in power with you, so you can come back when your rating is higher to have an easier timeWe are constantly working to improve the loading time and will keep doing so for the upcoming weeks.We hope these cues will help you enjoy the game.

												I have played a few games within Mordheim and it has almost all the time being fun! Starting from the early access a lot of bugs and other issues have been fixed. Especially the drastically decrease of the loading time is very nice.One of the remaining problems, which is kind of nerve wrecking, is the fact that some impressive units are not capable of getting inside buildings (rat ogre, chaos spawn, ogre). This is quite some issue during some fights. What is for my personal taste lacking is the amount of customization opportunities. Some armor is only with one option for the look and for me, that is not sufficient. For some gameplay of the warbands feel free to drop by at my youtube http://www.youtube.com/c/AndyBBardrik there are plenty of games to see!			"

Eventually came back again this time certain i knew what was going on, got destroyed and rage quit.This is really a story of the game abusing me and me comming back for more, certain i can beat it and then getting a beating.In the end its one of the few truely difficult games that isn't completely unfair, the more you learn the more you use tactics and the better you do. With bits of RNG that kills your favorite guy you've been building up because of a lucky crit. In the end my verdict is: Brings out my masochistic desires. Great and rage inducing. You will rage quit, I guarantee it, and then you'll come back for more.			"

												Mordheim is a turn based strategy game with some vague similarities to the XCOM series but set in the dark, gritty fantasy world of Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy setting.This game is an adaption of the classic tabletop game Mordheim (which was itself the fantasy reskin of the excellent TT game Necromunda) and it captures the setting extremely well. The graphics and music evoke the right atmosphere and look damn good, especially when you realise what a small team it was working on this game.The game itself is hard. Like, really hard. Particualrly at the beginning, where the learning curve is like an overhanging cliff (and the wide skill selection is an avalanche that starts when you're part way up). The tutorials are good but they don't cover everything, they're definitely worth going through though. It does get easier and you'll find that you're able to do Brutal and Deadly missions and generally win, although that doesn't mean you won't lose people to going Out of Action during those wins.Ah yes, out of action... This game has permanent consequences for your actions. There's no save scumming, although there is an ironman style autosave feature in case of crashes, etc. Other than that you have to live with your decsisions and, due to it's TT roots, the roll of the die. Yeah, sometimes RNG can screw you, it's just that sort of game. Your mooks will go down and out and, when they do, they will end up picking up injuries or straight up dying. That part of Mordheim and, at least for me, part of the fun!So the purpose of the game? You've been sent to Mordheim by a baacker who is funding your activities in the city. Their exact nature and reasons for sending you there vary from faction to faction but suiffice it to say you work for them. And what you're doing for them is collecting warpstone, a resource that's scattered throughout the maps. You will periodically have deliveries to fill for them where they require a particualr amount of warpstone. Failing to make those deliveries will eventually lose you the game so try to make them on time. Other than that you will be levelling up your warriors and your warband, as well as you as a player via the Veteran System whereby you get perks like additional starting gold and access to Veteran Skills. Your warband will gain stat increases, more strategy points and offence points, as well as gaining skill points to spend on the bewildering array of passive and active skills available (warning: they aren't cheap, especially when you master a skill). Some of your guys will gain access to spells, and as you level up new hero types (and eventually the mighty Impressives) will be come available to your warband.  You'll also loot more powerful equipment and begin discover magical formulae that allow you to place marks on your weapons and armour, that do a variety of things.All in all I would definitely recommend the game. I very much enjoy it and can't wait to have a try at multiplayer (I've only done single player thus far), where I think the game will really shine. Just be aware that it is a hardcore exsperience. You will lose matches, you will have people get injured and die, your equipment will be looted from their bodies, you will struggle for gold to pay your warband and buy skills and replacement warriors. That's an integral part of Mordheim and might mean that the game isn't for you, which is fine. It is for me though, I absolutely love it!			"

												8/10Mordheim is a great turn based strategy game set in a dark and gritty city plagued with evil and greedy beings. This comes straight from the Warhammer Universe, and i enjoyed it without ever playing the board games or really understanding the lore.The game is a lot like Valkyria Chronicles where you control each character from a third person view and have a large area to navigate in each short battle.PROS-maintains the dark and gloomy theme throughout the game-you have your own squad/warband and are able to upgrade them over the duration of the game-a lot of customisation which means you get attached to your squad -it is difficult to the point where one wrong move and you have resulted in your best soldier being knocked out and needing an arm amputation (difficult is good in a genre where you can steamroll the whole game without a challenge)-the battles are strategic and enjoyable-graphics and music are very appropriateNEGS-the ""random"" luck element in hit/dodge/parry chance is in my opinion rubbish (call me salty but 4 x 80% chance hits missing in a row is pretty bad) The dice rolls will infuriate you-Each sector of the city you play in is very similar. There are the odd differences but not enough to create a variety.All in all it is a very polished and enjoyable game and is a must buy when on sale!			"

You need to sell and trade it for reputation.4. You have to decide whether to go for treasure or position for the next battle.Pros +++ Fun!+ True line of sight - You might be able to see the enemy moving around the map but you aren't exactly sure of where they are until you're freakin' ambushed :P+ Overwatch using ranged attacks+ Lots of skills and spells+ The game saves before each move (I think) to allow you to pick up from where you left off.Cons- A map stopped loading at 88% once, but I just killed/reloaded the gameI recommend it.

												If you love balls-to-the-wall HARDCORE games with insane character customization, deep strategy, forced saves, and slowly watching as each of your characters gets maimed, losing arms, eyes, legs until they are murdered by an enemy team that always outclasses yours than this is the game for you! If you love a constant feeling of dread as each of your carefully designed and leveled heroes eventually gets murdered, this is the game for you. If you find Dark Souls is way too easy, and casual. ~THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!~			"

												So I LOVED XCOM and XCOM2 - I love Turn based Tactical/RPG games.... I hate this game, mainly because it's strategy light and luck heavy with perma-ironman. I know that people who played XCOM(s) will complain about missing constantly on a 90+% chance, but this is worse - it's so incredibly trolly with the numbers it presents - and the random fear, morale, and trap checks are just another way to keep the grind on. Which the difficulty was worth it in the XCOM series because it had a lot more than just getting trolled by the game over and over - it has a plot. This game possesses all the vacancy and empty promises that No Man's Sky provided, with the exception being that No Man's Sky is far more enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but hardcore Warhammer Players - because it's a lemon of a game. If I could get a refund I would, because it's a loser.			"

												A very fun game set within the Warhammer Fantasy universe, plenty of depth and customization and all sorts of fun ways to leave your mark, both on your warband and on the faces of your opponents.I must say, however, the Random Number Generator for this game is seriously perverse, on the verge of being actually bad. Worse than X-Com by a damn sight, anyways. I've missed far more than one in five +80% attacks, I've been hit repeatedly with well over a 50% chance to dodge or parry, and the number of times my warriors have wiffed a 95%, with so much on the line, it's pretty sickening. Not saying the game is broken, but I'm saying there is a surprising amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, not numbers, being generated. I am writing this review after having gotten my warband creamed due to poor rolling, but my complaint stands on it's own merit.			"

												This game is not for people that like their wins handed to them or for people who can't handle it when things don't go their way because things won't go your way in this game. It's an odds game and you have to play like the odds are heavily against you, because they usually are. Some tips for getting the upper hand at the start of the game (which is where it's hardest):The AI doesn't play fair so throw any notion of being 'honorable' against it out the window. It knows exactly where your units go once they see them (even if you go out of view) and always has boosted stats over your units and will straight up murder you if you make a mistake, so use every trick you can against them. Be nasty, hide around corners and ambush them with multiple units when it sends some poor sucker for that last wyrdstone you left as bait.  Once they see one of your units, they will usually send everything to that location, except sometimes they won't send units that are on the kill list for the optional quest, so use that to your advantage.  You can set up a bottleneck in pretty much any area and ambush them as they come through so it becomes 1 vs 3 while their other units are locked away behind their one ambushed unit. Probably the best piece of advice, especially for early game, is choose the right missions. If you pick a mission where the enemy AI has easy access to a solo or small group of your units, they will suffer.  Never ever choose a ""both warbands are spread out"" and avoid the 3 groups split one (for those you can just bring 4 units and make it a 1 group thing). Early game you never want to go 1 on 1 (or worse) with a unit. Later on you'll have awesome units that can murder henchmen solo in 1 round but that takes time. The mission type defines the difficulty so much more than the actual normal/hard/brutal/deadly thing does. Although with brutal or deadly you can get surprise ambush missions which are basically the same thing as ""both warbands are spread out"" except the ambushee gets negative OP at the start so avoid those as well. In the later game ranged damage is really good at level 10 with good passives, but it's a little difficult to get a ranged unit to level 10 because they pretty much suck until level 8 or so.  You can buy warriors that are already leveled up later in the game, so remember that.If any of this sounds exciting, then this is your game.  I love this game so much more than many other strategy games because it's very difficult at first, and then you get that victory feeling once you start figuring things out.			"

												At first i gave this game a poor review. However the dev team responded so I felt like i should respond My innitial complains were about the Terrible story missions and the fact that the reforcement mechanic is pull. However as the Dev was kind enough to respond about the long load times i felt that alone is enough to make up for its fault as you can enjoy the game for endless hours without doing the storied missions. Also to make it clear it is not the story in these mission that is poorly done but the mechanics that our added to them, Like not showing the objectives till you have completed the current so you cant forward plan. Also the fact that many of the missions end with getting stuck and stalled on a single stairway. Really i wish i could give a medium rating but thier is no middleground rating.  Also Skaven for life.Hi Chex 86,It seems you’ve had trouble with a unique Story missions. Here’s some elements that might help you out:- Only Story missions have the “reinforcement” mechanic- Story missions are not mandatory, you could ignore them entirely if you desire- Story missions do not grow in power with you, so you can come back when your rating is higher to have an easier timeWe are constantly working to improve the loading time and will keep doing so for the upcoming weeks.We hope these cues will help you enjoy the game.

												The look and feel of this game is very appealing and I found it extremely addictive from the start. The characters and sceneries follow the warhammer theme extremely well and you can tell it's a game created by gamers and fans of the original. However be warned, as it has quite a learning curve and it's hardcore relentless approach may not be for all. The rng can at times be a little frustrating due to constant misses, even with a high percentage to hit  and the AI seems a little lacking, with not a great deal of strategy being played by the enemy. Hostile mobs will generally attack the 1st thing they see and all rush to that area and fight until they win or lose, leaving little time for completing side quests and collecting items. With many more updates hopefully in the future as well as tweaks to the games systems I would regard this a good investment if you enjoy the turn based style of gameplay			"

												Mordheim is a turn based strategy game with some vague similarities to the XCOM series but set in the dark, gritty fantasy world of Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy setting.This game is an adaption of the classic tabletop game Mordheim (which was itself the fantasy reskin of the excellent TT game Necromunda) and it captures the setting extremely well. The graphics and music evoke the right atmosphere and look damn good, especially when you realise what a small team it was working on this game.The game itself is hard. Like, really hard. Particualrly at the beginning, where the learning curve is like an overhanging cliff (and the wide skill selection is an avalanche that starts when you're part way up). The tutorials are good but they don't cover everything, they're definitely worth going through though. It does get easier and you'll find that you're able to do Brutal and Deadly missions and generally win, although that doesn't mean you won't lose people to going Out of Action during those wins.Ah yes, out of action... This game has permanent consequences for your actions. There's no save scumming, although there is an ironman style autosave feature in case of crashes, etc. Other than that you have to live with your decsisions and, due to it's TT roots, the roll of the die. Yeah, sometimes RNG can screw you, it's just that sort of game. Your mooks will go down and out and, when they do, they will end up picking up injuries or straight up dying. That part of Mordheim and, at least for me, part of the fun!So the purpose of the game? You've been sent to Mordheim by a baacker who is funding your activities in the city. Their exact nature and reasons for sending you there vary from faction to faction but suiffice it to say you work for them. And what you're doing for them is collecting warpstone, a resource that's scattered throughout the maps. You will periodically have deliveries to fill for them where they require a particualr amount of warpstone. Failing to make those deliveries will eventually lose you the game so try to make them on time. Other than that you will be levelling up your warriors and your warband, as well as you as a player via the Veteran System whereby you get perks like additional starting gold and access to Veteran Skills. Your warband will gain stat increases, more strategy points and offence points, as well as gaining skill points to spend on the bewildering array of passive and active skills available (warning: they aren't cheap, especially when you master a skill). Some of your guys will gain access to spells, and as you level up new hero types (and eventually the mighty Impressives) will be come available to your warband.  You'll also loot more powerful equipment and begin discover magical formulae that allow you to place marks on your weapons and armour, that do a variety of things.All in all I would definitely recommend the game. I very much enjoy it and can't wait to have a try at multiplayer (I've only done single player thus far), where I think the game will really shine. Just be aware that it is a hardcore exsperience. You will lose matches, you will have people get injured and die, your equipment will be looted from their bodies, you will struggle for gold to pay your warband and buy skills and replacement warriors. That's an integral part of Mordheim and might mean that the game isn't for you, which is fine. It is for me though, I absolutely love it!			"

												Mordheim.This game is definetly NOT for everybody, in fact it is very niche. All you 30+ gamers will like it a lot. I have grown up playing turn based strategy games, which were very popualr in the 90's and been waiting for a good title for years.Playing this game will require careful planning and a lot of patience. In exchange it is a very rewarding experience and a serious time sink.After playing for some hours, my advice:take only easy missions for as long as you can. Be careful to keep the deadline with your shipments -though i don't know what is going to happen if you don't, i did it so far, but based on the rest of the game it will not be good for you.Gather the green crystals during missions, you have to produce a given number after some battles, like a tax.When engaging on missions, keep your group together, always use ambush stance and charge as much as you can. Avoid being charged is essential.All of your enemies will be evil scum who try to kill your soldiers. You must keep them alive!Your hero will become a terminator.If you loose a battle nothing punishing happens, in fact you won't have a flawless campaign.Don't get too attached to any of your soldiers, they might die during any mission.If you play recklessly, your soldiers will get knocked out. Be patient or you will be angry. Luck is not on your side vs CPU, but not unfair either.On low level, don't bother with scavenging, don't make detours for a chest. Stay alive and gather crytals instead.You can visit your wagon during missions and put items in the chest, making room on your solder to pick more stuff up.Your soldiers dont necessarily die when they hit the floor in a battle. After the mission you will get to know if he died, needs some days to recover, got some long lasting negative state, or recovers fully.The loot your soldier is carrying is lost if he gets knocked out on a mission (very frustrating)If the enemy warband is loosing, they tend to flee the battle, making the goals of the missons very hard to complete.Be careful using the shop not to buy items instead of selling (menus look like made with consoles in mind sadly), i spend half my gold by mistake when i tried to sell my junk.Pros:If you play it correctly it can be a very enjoyable and rewarding experienceArt direction is very well doneSolid rules and well executed gameplayBug free and very stable (Win10x64)4 factionsWARHAMMER FANTASY TURN BASED GAME!!!Meh:1 music track throughout the whole gmae and its about 5 minutes long. It is well written and sounds good, but seriously....No voice acting during combat. I think adding a lot of varied one-liners during combat would make this game 2 times better.Character models are  limited to one or two per faction and the customisation is lackluster to say the least. I never played tabletop WH, but if im correct, the painting and pimping the figures is half the fun.Console style camera, menus and controll are still horrible and shameful on pc. I hated the new X-COM for that and it is very similar in this game too. Auto camera actions are not optional.The game looks so much worse then the sample pictures which is a mistery since the screenshots are nothing special.Animation is very repetitve and overall not very excitiongThis game is doing so much things good and is for a very misstreated part of the players out there. With more work (patches, graphic update and new races pls!) it could be an outstanding game. Definetly pick it up if you are and oldshool gamer. "

												One of the best games featuring detailed squad management and tactical turn based battles. Each battle You fight is shaping a history of Your mercenary group. Every wound, every death, every item You loot or loose to enemy is permanent. But even if You loose Your group, You still earn some experience that will give You a small bonus next time. So there will be some benefit even in loosing.			"

												The game is fun  and has potential. Yet the developers CLEARLY have the game rigged to where the AI will win, despite anything you do. When the AI opponent dodges a strike nine times that has an 88% chance to hit, then you know something is up. I can see where multiplayer might be a little fairer, but as for the laughable AI, no. And that is sad because I really like this game, yet I really would like to enjoy the game for more than three sessions.			"

												While am a great fan of the tabletop version (even though it's not as good as Necromunda), this one left me quickly with a sense of wonder how was it even possible to make something with that unvieldy and user-unfriendly mechanics with so many turn-based games around.The only answer I came up with is that someone thought it'd be a good idea to make a turn-based third-person hack'n'slash.Besides mechanics, whole slew of warband types have been melded into generic ""human mercenaries"", and most warbands are seriously twisted with ""up to 5 models"" mchanics - though truth be told that limitation is what makes gameplay bearable with said mechanics.There might be something positive about this title somewhere further down the road, but abovementioned was more that enough for me not to bother finding it out.

												Good looking, fun game with hit and miss mechanics. The games does feel slightly lacking in unit roster and the units are not especially specialised which some might see as a plus, personally I don't. The DLC might add to this.Like I said mechanics are hit and miss. The back tracking/movement system is great. How ever mechanics like area of control are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Which might block a unit from taking any kind of part in a fight.The game looks great. Mordheim looks spot on. The city looks perfect from what I have read. Units look superb too, there are some alternate looks, but they're slim in choices. More would be great, to actually feel more connected to the troops and get some personality.The pricing is crazy though. Over 40€ for the game is over the top. While there are worse games to spend that money on, I would wait for at least >30€General feel and view of the game is strongly positive. Do recommend as a game at least. Price has to be considered though. It is not, I repeat not a steal. It is 100% at the top price. "

												By the numbers:  91/100The Short Review:Do you like the following?Knights of the Old RepublicX-Com (the original moreso than that modern... thing)Tactical squad-scale combat simulationsTurn-based gamesThe old SSI DnD gold box gamesWarhammer loreIf you answered yes to all of the above, push the Buy button.  I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.The Long Review:Part 1, The GoodIn the way of a preface, I've not played the Mordheim boardgame, but I am a Warhammer player from the very beginning of the franchise.  I ran a Warhammer FRP campaign while aboard ship (The USS Tarawa, to be precise) in 1991.  I later got into the miniature scene-- both the WH and WH40K side -- and I've a deep love of the Warhammer universe, especially the fantasy side.  This game fairly oozes Warhammer atmosphere.There is an attraction in managing a party of characters in an RPG that cannot be duplicated by MMOs.  It creates an emotinal investment born of the natural leadership impulse in competitive personalities.  Seeing your warband grow stronger and more powerful is a pleasure unto itself.  The recent resurgence in popularity of roguelikes is -- to me, at any rate -- an indication that many gamers are becoming bored by the ""customer is always right"" mentality that has come to dominate modern tripe-A game design.  Intelligent people get bored quickly when they always win the fight and there is no real threat of loss; only a challenge will keep them interested.  Mordheim provides challenge in spades.The developers of Mordeim understand that being a leader is the imporatant part of a tactical wargame.  Gradually developing your warband into a force to be reckoned with is the point of a successful party-based RPG.  The individual warriors become real to you; they are people to be trained and used to greatest effect, rather than disposable products of a factory.  The loss of a trained warrior has a real impact on your long-term strategy, as it should.  But it also opens up new avenues for advancement, forcing you to consider alteratives that you may not have seen before, often resulting in a complete rethink of your approach.Do not misunderstand me; this game WILL make you mad.  There will be matches where the RNG gods will frown upon your existence and you'll wonder if any of your party have actually even held a weapon before.  But there will also be engagements where everything goes right, where the universe smiles upon you, where you dominate your foes so completely that you will be convinced no one can stand against you... until the next battle.  That is the essence of a good tactical wargame, and Mordheim has it in spades.The beauty of the game is that any given engagement may or may not favor you.  Sometimes you will be allowed to deploy to greatest advantage, other times you will be caught off guard, scrambling to get your team together.  Much as with real war, the enemy doesn't wait until the situation favors you, rather you must analyze, adapt, and attempt to overcome.  A word of advice:  your first priority is always to Get the Band Back Together.  As a squad, you are strong.  As individuals... Well, there's a very old aphorism in the Marine Corps:  never employ the soda strategy.  SODA is an acronymn for Spread Out, Die Alone.Plan your strategy.  Train your squad.  Fight smart.  That's Mordheim.Part 2: The BadThere are a few minor issues with the game.  The most prominent is looting.  The rules are written in such a way that you must make looting items -- especially wyrdstone -- your first priority.  I put this in the bad category, but it's not necessarily all bad.  I understand the background:  you are a mercenary force in Mordheim.  Your reason for being there is to acquire the extremely valuable wyrdstone and sell it, either to your sponsor or alternate factions.  That's good; it's a great mechanic, as it forces you to always consider what you can get out of any given engagement and balance it against the risk of splitting up your force.  The problem comes with the loot rules.  You can ONLY loot that wyrdstone when you're standing on top of it during active play.  Even if you defeat the enemy and you're standing on top of an entire field of wyrdstone, you can't loot it afterwards.Imagine that you're a bank robber, (you're not I know, but just put yourself in his shoes for a moment).  You hold up a bank, you kill all of the guards and tie up all the patrons.  Now it's time to loot that vault over there fifteen feet away from you, right?  Nope!  You killed all the guards, so it's game over.  No loot for you. If you wanted the money in the vault, well by God you should have looted it while you were killing the guards, eh?  That makes sense, right?  OF COURSE IT DOESN'T.  But that's the loot mechanic in Mordheim.I understand the balance issues.  The devs don't want you to be able to loot the whole map, as it will result in a rapid build-up of gold and you'll easily defeat the AI.  I get it.  But there should be one full turn after you defeat the enemy warband wherein you can loot what you can reach.  Because killing an enemy while you're standing in a field of wyrdstone and not being able to BEND OVER AND PICK IT UP before the match ends is... well, it's just frickin' stupid -- boardgame rules notwithstanding.Part 3:  The UglyConsolization.  The interface was designed from the outset for a console release, despite the fact that the game's initial release is on PC.  I can deal with it, but it does become annoying from time to time.  For example, during deployment phase, you can't simply click where you want to deploy a warrior.  Oh no; you must go through every single possible position One. At. A. Time. in third person view.  On missions where there are dozens of possible deployment points, this can become extraordinarily tedious, since you can't deploy your warriors from the map.  You have to constantly switch between third person and map for each warrior for EACH POINT, examining sight lines and location.  It takes far, far longer than it should and is an inherent weakness of play-with-your-thumbs design.  It has a smaller but noticeable impact in the warband management screens.  An irritant more than an annoyance, really.  But it's there.That being said, however, the console-biased interface is not game-breaking.  I put up with KOTOR's ridiculous console interface because it was such a great game.  The same is true here.Part 4: The Indifferent S L O W.  I put this in the indifferent category because everyone will see it differently.  I love slow progression; the slower the better, in fact.  If you're impatient, craving a continual stream of satisfaction and reinforcement, you will almost certainly dislike this game.  It takes many, many hours of play to advance your warband even a little.  Magic-using characters, for example, start off weak and essentially useless; you must spend a lot of time and gold to make them powerful.  But with enough time and a great deal of gold, they can become the lynchpin of your strategy.  Leaders are vulnerable (some moreso than others) and must be carefully nurtured into powerhouses who can sway the outcome of a battle.  If you're looking for quick, easy satisfaction, you will not find it in Mordheim.  This is a game of time and patience, development and planning.   If the idea of investing an hour into a turn-based battle that would play out in mere minutes in real time annoys you, I cannot recommend you buy this game. Part 5:  Random Thoughts While Drinking Some Liquer Called Ke-Ke Which Tastes EXACTLY Like Key Lime PieBest Mechanic Ever:  Morale is separate from morale impact (on death).  It's far too complex to explain, (Steam says No More Words For Me), but essentially Morale is unit cohesion while Morale Impact is unit fragmentation.  Just try it.  Once you figure it out, you'll see the awesome genius of it. "

												This game is pretty good, albeit far from perfect. The mood is amazing and immersive and the gameplay is really solid and innovating. The 4 clans (5 if you get the expansion) all play very different and provide vastly different experiences, even if some of the DLC has toned down some of uniqueness of some clans (e.g. adding a very range-focused character in a clan that had no ranged characters).The game has a few problems though.The AI is weak. It will try to find you and then run straight to you with every unit, which makes it easy to pick them off one by one if you keep your warband together. Worst of all, it will constantly get stuck with pathfinding. After a while, when you've leveled up your warband to the max or near max, you'll just feel like you are grinding without purpose. There are campaign/story missions...but they get boring soon.When you choose a mission, the composition of your opponent will be selected based on your warband. So if you have 10 units, you will face a big warband and if you have 5, you will face a smaller warband. Also, if you take one of those expensive ""impressive"" units, the opponent will have one also and if you don't, your opponent won't either. This means it's no use investing on a big and diverse warband and you are better off keeping your warband small.Finally, despite the AI, the game is difficult as your characters can easily injured and maimed and become worse. Also, especially in the beginning they are very frail, so it's very easy to have them dropping like flies. Once you get how the game works, you can easily avoid it though, but in the beginning it will be very frustrating, also because you can save at your wish.			"

												A random number generator I can deal with. Punishing games I can deal with. One where your 20 hour campaign can be essentially fully defeated because you missed a 9/10 roll five or six times in a row... nope. You can legitimately watch a twenty hour warband become critically flawed after a series of statistically impossible rolls, when you've done everything right and made no mistakes. Nope. Graphics are great, gameplay is good when it isn't so ridiculously frustrating as to defeat any fun it previously offered.			"

								As a fan of the table top version I bought this game without even checking to see how it was meant to be played, other peoples reviews or how far along it was in development - Thus far I am impressed!It's early days still but the potential is huge imo.I also hope it is going to be a hit so the devs could maybe make my 2nd favourite GW game into a pc game - Necromunda.

												I love Warhammer and was excited to buy a game based on Mordheim. At first I was a little dissapointed to see there were no orcs or goblins or undead but thought that a Sisters of Sigmar army and Skaven were pretty fun. And it looks like it would be fun, if it weren't brutally difficult. I banged my head against it for 5 hours. I looked online for tips. I'm usually good at these kinds of games but this one is just too much at the beginning for me to handle. Looking on the forms the Devs are adamant that they will not decrease difficulty or balance the AI. They want it to be punishing. That's really unfortunate as I would have loved to sink hours into this game if it would have let me.			"

												The game is everything I had expected. It's fun, frustrating, demanding and addictive. It's refreshing to have a game that forces you think a couple of moves ahead but also have a back up plan if things go sideways (as they may with any rng game). You will get ""attached"" to your characters and mourn their injuries (haven't lost any....yet), but now have 2 ranged with on 1 eye each...lol. Yes the game has a learning curve but if you take your time, go through the tutorials and ask questions on the forums you will have a great time playing. I look forward to more DLC and facing my first human opponent.As far as the complaints I've read about I haven't really noticed any problems, I'm a casual gamer not into all the formulas ect., so I play to have fun and I haven't found anything yet to detract from the fun of this game.

												The game is fun if you are a die-hard Mordheim fan. If not, you will get frustrated out of your mind by the total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t balance and RNG in the game. Some battles balance seems ok, the next battle you are in a medium hard battle, 50% of your team get injured and you loose a ton of expensive equipment. There is no way to keep up with the damage you take and the casualties you sustain. Tactics, well, you will have♥♥♥♥♥♥for luck as the bad buys will spawn where ever and find your men before they manage to find and support each other. Not sure if there is a polite way of saying this stuff.. They need to fix balance and RNG. It is total crap at the moment.			"

												I played this game since early access and I have to say it has come a long way.Warband management is easy enough and has enough depth, without falling into unnecessary micro-management.You equip gear and items to your soldiers, level them up, buy skills and that's that. If you are into it, it also offers (limited) optical customization options for your soldiers.The turn-based battles are VERY intense. You always end up thinking about the best placement of your troops. ""Should I run back to my cart with my leader or hero and get rid of the warpstones that cripple him in combat? If I do that, then my weaker characters will be without backup.""Decisions are hard to make and they are always final. Your high level master Skaven assassin might end up loosing an arm in battle, thus rendering him nearly useless in the future (only one one-handed weapon, no shields, no climbing, etc.), and so on.Bashing this game for too much RNG is absolutely stupid, since it is an adaption of a table top game played with ... tadaaa ... DICE! Saying it is too difficult, because it doesn't allow to ""save scum"" is also pretty useless. If your people get slaughtered, then it happens in 90% of the cases due to wrong decisions made by the player. In the original table top version you cannot undo your turns, either. It is an honest adaption, although it lacks content compared to the original (a lot of warbands still missing, etc.). This is definitely NOT a game you will finish in one or two attempts in one afternoon and that's exactly what I love about it.It is like playing a Warhammer/X-Com mix with permanent iron man mode.It is glorious!Graphics are neat. They are not impressive, but they catch the atmosphere well enough and do a good job. That also means that this game runs on weaker machines with 4 GB of RAM and any 1 GB GPU.			"

												Okay so this game is really good at its core gameplay! but only to a point I mean so basically the only way to be able to play on equal grounds with your friends is to make brand new warbands or use Exploits which I will not mention due to the fact they're a must to have a warband that isn't completely maimed after a certain point because the Smuggler's Den system is absolutely insane, You can actually drain a map entirely of its resource of Wyrdstone several matches in a row and that won't even be enough sometimes and having to put my units in danger to get Wyrdstone because of the fact that They're in even more danger if I don't fill out those orders the warband will shatter in time. The hired swords costing as much as 650 coins at level 3 is completely uncalled for that makes no sense If someone has that much spare money that warband is much past the use of a level 3 character with the constant upholding of payments you're required to do, I realize the developers are going for progression and that feeling of accomplishment but the reason the most voted helpful comment is negative and with many of the same complaints is because that's simply the case and the percentages shown are not accurate, to not factor in the dodge chance or some other factor into the deciding player's action is unfair you're missing shots that are 1/20 consistently because you didn't have the information and now you have to fire a level 10 character because the stupidity checks he now has make him useless more than 70% of the timeIt simply creates the feeling or helplessness which is the worst thing a player can feel in a game, Some cool ideas could be presented to fix some of these, Mercenaries could use Steam Punk limbs as replacements at a price, Cult could have Skeletal limbs using magic from the ""Shadowlord"" the Skaven could have re-attached limbs threw sewing like the rat Ogre its just that the Helpless feeling needs a supliment and my gameplay shouldn't be permanently destroyed by some streak of bad luck it simply isn't acceptable because I love the game I've always been a Warhammer fan and I can't tell anyone to spend 40 dollars on something they're going to get that feeling from			"

												Good game but make sure you have a high-powered rig or you won't be able to enjoy the full graphical goodness.  This is a technically challenging game.  To excel you must really study the various attributes and capabilities of your warband and how they impact gameplay.I have a lot more hours now playing this game and have to say it is one of my favorite games.  The early levels are challenging as your warband is very weak.  Suggest reading some of the excellent strategy tips on the community hub.  Wish there were more Mordheim city level maps as the 4 or so maps for the regular encounters start to get fairly boring after a while.The campaigns are good but tough.  I suggest having a fairly strong warband - at least level 5 before taking on the first campaigns.  Once you are at level 5 or above the campaigns are good.  They almost always have impressives so be ready for that.  A weak warband level 2 -- 4 probably won't do well.  You  can't get impressives in your warband until you are at level 5.			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did since I'm an avid player of the tabletop game. Mordheim: City of the Damned has all the elements that make a tactical game fun. Campaign play, character advacement, varying scenarios, tough tactical decisions, and I could go on.However, the game fights you at every corner. The random happenings completely upset the freedom of movement of the game as it locks in your current movements. The AI just ignores the sub-objectives and groups up into murderballs. The RNG elements are just too strong (numerous times I simply had crit-stun-out of action happen against back to back to back). I could sense the fun to be had with this game, but all I ended up with was more frustration than fun. With limited gameplay time, this game is getting uninstalled and downvoted.			"

												7/10  Good game that aims for hardcore players.But i have a few issues with it.- Lack of options around the difficulty, as well as options to save when you want.- No correct numbers around what the chance of a succesful attack or move is. As well as what different special attacks or  commands do you are left to test and hopefully succed.- Various graphical bugs, screen twitches.- When you do win over your enemy, session is over, despite the fact you won you wont get any of his or the loot around on the map, it will be left behind unless your men put it into your cart or carries it with him. To that end it feels more like you were in a bigger hurry to leave the area than your enemy despite the fact you won.All in all it is a good game, packed with a lot of frustration (at times) as well as a very uncustomizable game state.

												This is a Random Number game with heavy grind. There is ridiculously harsh penalty for losing at the start. Your starting warband can lose all its important equipment through random rolls before it ever gets started. Once you get a good warband the random number generator can decide all your good characters die. HA HA HA delete and start over! Your characters will miss 10 plus attacks of better than 75 percent to hit but the AI NEVER does, Your high dodge of 50 or 65 percent will stop 1 out of 5 attacks if you are lucky. Its more dumb luck than strategy.If you try to talk to the developers the game has a very poorly behaved community who will try to stop you. The game looks nice but  had very slow loads. Every time you play a scenario the game stops and downloads.  It should be called Waitheim City of the Download. There is no comparison tool or any useful way to plan out your character builds. I had to go find the original minatures game site to get important information. They spent their money on some hack actor who annoys you with the same winning or losing message over and over and over. Its like nails on a chalkboard to lose and then wait while this imbecile cackles out bad acting.			"

												This game started off with amazing potential and, at it's roots, is fun in a twisted, masochistic kind of way. Unfortunately, the developers have got it into their head that it's a good business practice to cater to the super hardcore masochist crowd and ONLY to that crowd. In the same vein as Dark Souls, you'll really only enjoy this game if your idea of fun is getting brutally mauled over and over and over again, mostly because random dice rolls decided you're going to die.Then there's the community. God forbid you have a concern that the game might not be perfect, for the tiniest voice is discontent is met with contempt, scorn, and mockery from the aforementioned masochists. They will actually TELL you to ♥♥♥♥ off and don't play the game if you don't enjoy the savage beatings the game gives you, even if you did everything right, and yes, you CAN do everything right and still get your warband destroyed because of the RNG, but the hardcore crowd will blame it all on you, tell you that you suck, and should either suck it up and enjoy it or leave. They seem to have no idea how detrimental to the game's longevity this is, nor do they appear to care, so long as they preserve their precious ""hardcore"" status.The devs, unfortunately, have plainly expressed their intent to NOT implement certain features (like a basic Save/Load mechanic) because they want to be ""hardcore like Dark Souls,"" they have no plans to expand upon the pathetically lackluster customization, and generally have made it very clear that they don't intend to do anything but cater to the most hardcore of hardcore players.In short, if you liked Dark Souls or XCOM on Hardcore Ironman, you'll like this. If getting bent over and destroyed at the whims of the mad ocelot god that lives in Jeff's head doesn't sound like your idea of fun, skip this game.			"

In Mordheim, I found myself saying ""Just one more mission"" because I would be on a roll, I would then lose due to cockiness then proceed to cry myself to sleep as 5 of my guys were killed or routed by a single Clanrat, ♥♥♥♥ YOU RNJESUS. 13/10 would play again.

Early Access Review
								[ EARLY ACCESS ]This means not all features are present.As far as I understand at least for chaos side, only skirmish is available.There may be a campaign for chaos if not all races in the future but it is not yet implemented.I run the game on a old laptop MSI FX603 and the game runs smooth with low setting gfx.The game is interesting at the core. Stats seem perhap confusing at first but reading with automatically gauge an understanding of characeristics and capabilities.Gameplay functions seem long to reach between Q and E rolling out left or right but the game is playable and I am hopeful more optimization will come along the way.This game is for casual turn base strategy players. The game is slow paced.  The atmosphere is great. Decors on low on my low spec machine are ok. Pretty unusually slow and long SKIRMISH loading time (2 minutes or a bit more) for my old machine using an IDE 5k4 RPM hard drive but again this is early access and thing ""may"" improve along the way.I recommend this game to anyone who like to pose a strategy while 3D strategy element at first is somewhat boggling, anyone quickly take marks of position and location to defend, ambush, attack, skirmish, flee, counter and more, and the so the game suddenly deepens!

The difference beeing that you can´t change difficulty (the tought love) and it´s set in a Warhammer fantasy world and that you don´t have asy many options while in combat. If you mess up a few of your characters whill probably get hurt :DYou need to plan out both warband composition, their skills, the deployment and the movement during the mission. I like it....			"

												This game has 1300+ positive reviews and only about 400 negative, however, 4 out of the first 5 reviews you see are negative. That would almost make someone instantly change their mind about buying this game. Why aren't their more positive reviews up front for people to see? And steam, shouldn't the out dated reviews be moved down the list so people can see reviews about the current version? (I know iPhone and iPad app store only keep reviews about the current version.)In my opinion, the recent patch totally fixed most of the RNG problems and a bunch other glitches. About people who said that their character ""missed 5 95% shots in a row "". I'm gonna make an arguement. First of all, max level (10) leaders and heros have 9 offense points, which are enough for 4 one-handed hits or 3 two-handed hits. If your heros or headers are using ranged weapon, they could do 3 gun shots or 4 bow shots. A max level impressive warrior also has 9 offensive points, so 4 hits also. So I don't understand where you got those 5 shots.... So why don't you guys be a responsible reviewer and remove those negative reviews that are not true to the current version any more? Plus most of those posters just sounded like they did not know how the game works.But anyway, Mordheim is an awesome turn-based strategy game. At first I played it on my boyfriend's account and leveled up my sister warband to 10. Then my boyfriend bought me a copy, and since then I have played over 250 hours. I have enjoyed this game a lot. To those who have enjoyed Mordheim, I suggest you all write a positive review to bring more players into this game. I believe we all need more skirmish players!			"

												So let me start off saying I only did the free weekend play so take that for what it's worth.Pros:great game universestrategy is required to winvery customizable war band membersfairly well thought out combat mechanicsCons:some parts of battle are so random you are destined to loseno amount of strategy or planning can save you from a random map stacked against youthe enemy turns, while in fog of war, take an eternity you leave valuable things uncollected on the battlefield wether you like it or notthe 'random' rolls are more brutal than a fight with Mike TysonOverall if you enjoy this universe and dont mind getting punched in the D*** over and over by tiny rat men because they have better rolls than Jesus then this game might be for you. If you want a game that you actually feel like there is a chance to win then another title may be your flavor. Essentially the gameplay is like Darksouls meets XCom.			"

												This game, dare I say, is even better than the tabletop version. No arguments over line of sight, no disagreements over if someone is in charge range or not, no loud discussions over the terrain features and how they affect your movement and most importantly, no one is getting dice pelted at their face when the above situations occur. There are some features of the tabletop version that I like and that are missing from this iteration however these are small things, and far outweighed by the impressive array of skills, a much better percentile system (over the old D6) and better opportunities to really customise your gang of misfits.

												This game does not deserve this many bad reviews.  The game is not high priced. Has affordable DLCs even when not on discount. Its a visual beauty and the gameplay harsh and unforgiving.  You make yourself a warband which you can customize to some extend. And you set off in the grimm city of Mordheim to gatehr wyrdstones for your faction.  You win some and you lose some, but everything comes down to choices as you won't be able to sweep the battlefield after the match is done.  If you lose a fight your merc have the potential to get wounded this includes losing limbs, eyes and even permadeath.   IF you have an unlucky streak you might find yourself a crippled warband and you will have to reroll again.  The game is not designed for an easy game with godmode on.  Expect to die, a lot.			"

Product received for free
												1/3rd of the tutorial took me over an hour to finish.During this period, out of 27 attacks all with over a 65% hit chance each attack, I hit 5 times.And the seemingly hellish RNG is not at all made up for by the game's UI, graphics, animations, or story.All I can think is ""this is gonna be rough, and not in the fun way.""$40? Nah, that's a joke for how unpolished this game is. But if you're genuinely masochistic and you can get it for free or on sale, by all means, go for it.			"

												This will be short, cause I'm not a pro at this.Very poor/lazy animations, and the character models could be a better. The aesthetics of the terrain/buildings are very nice though, and in theme with the Warhammer world. On topic of animations, the trap and parry/dodge stance animations are a little on the long side, and the stance animations are a little odd looking.For the most part though, I very much enjoy this game. The character leveling is fairly deep, actually deeper than the source material I think (I admit, never played table-top Mordheim, but I've got experience with tabletop Warhammer Fantasy, the two being very similar). There could be a lot more variety in mission types, and deployment is kinda clumsy, but game-play overall is fun.It should be noted too that the game suffers from XCOM-itis, in that RNG can really hose you from time to time.Would I recommend? Absolutely. And I am. I hope that the devs release more warbands.. I'd love to try the Witchhunters and IUndead.  I do find it intersting that several of the characters they did release dont appear to be in the original game (although I will also add that I only have the main book, and dont know if there is any other source material). The Poison Wind Globadier has always been a Warhammer Fantasy favorite of mine so its cool to see it in this.Ok so it wasn't as short as I said it would be.TL;dr: Go in with low graphical expectations and you'll have fun. :D			"

												The game looks well polished, but there is a lot of common mistakes that could easily improve the game if fixed... such as not being able to ""speed up"" an enemy's turn. Half of my time was spent waiting for enemies to get done with their turn. In a large map, this leads to sitting around doing nothing. And tutorial tips... If I'm in my third game, I don't need to know I can change hero items through the hero screen... I already know that. Lots of small stuff here and there make this game rather annoying and it quickly ruins itself as a ""game"" and quickly turns itself into a task			"

												This game is amazing. I've been playing the original Mordheim since it came out. It's not exactly like the table top version, but it does a great job of capturing the atmosphere. The campaign is open enough to allow limitless street skirmishes and build your warband the way you want. Character customization is spectacular. And I love the risk in every mission. You can spend 20 missions building up a hero just to have him criippled or killed by a skaven hiding in a closet.The best part to me is the city itself. At a glance, it doesn't look like much, but on the ground, it's a labrynth. Climbing to the top of a ruined house in search of wyrdstone or treasure, hiding in doorways to ambush enemies.

												First mission almost my whole warband gets wiped and i only killed 1 of them. Mission randomly ended and said i had succeded and completed the objective.I make this review as somone who plays xcom, wastelands 1 & new 1, divinity:OS ect..The gameplay is incredibly boring every character seems to be the same just with different numbers (Though some might not have a ranged weapon though u can just equip them with 1) same animations, same abilities, same stances, even look the same. Then there is the leaders, heroes and henchmen which are all the same thing anyway, infact my henchmen seemed to be signifcantly better than the heroe and leaderThis game is so overly complicated when it doesnt need to be. The gameplay is so simple and dumbed down (walk over to the guy and hit him, set a stance, end turn   Mayby set to overwatch instead). But they just have all these terrible UIs filled with symbols and numbers that really dont need to be their. The tutorial is basically just walls of text at random during a setup skirmish where u cant really even do any of things its teaching u, instead sometimes the enemy will for reasons i will never understand.Customization may as well not be there, you can choose from about 10 colours 3 of which are black and 3 of which are red (i played the chaos guys mayby the others are better?) and each bit has mayby 1 other style which might add a spike or symbol to that armor piece.For $40 its buggy, low quality, low content mess, that seems to have been made by fans of the board game that were very inexperienced with games development.$40 for 4 classes each with 7 apperently identical character types and no story (unless you include diologue and text dumps in load screens).Oh and ranged characters are♥♥♥♥♥ cost extra points to use ranged weapons, more points to reload, more point when hey have to switch to mele on there 2nd combat turn and on top of all that they do ♥♥♥♥ all damage and lose 30% accuracy just because they target is engaged in combat for some reason.edit:Decided to try again whilst waiting for some other trash to download.The continue button after loading the save didn't work. ♥♥♥♥it i said ill try skaven then.Skaven were significantly more powerful and actually had usefule leader but all the other issues were still present. Managed to win a mission with a few casualties. Saved the game came back later couldn't load. 'So marking this game as unplayable, until they fix the many bugs.			"

												So my leader was against enemy leader with a 84% to hit and all I need was 1 hit to knock him out of action but somehow the enemy leader dodges 2 of my attacks and manage to knock my leader out of action when my leader had more than half hp left. If you want a game that rolls favors AI, this is your game. Its like you always roll 1 and the enemy rolls 20. There was another time where I literally wasted all my enemies except one tiny soldier but that soldier manage to do a critical ambush attack on one of my soldiers and instantly knock him out of action and I lose the morale rout roll and lost the map. Its like the developers couldn't make a decent AI so instead they just give AI 100% rng for attack, dodge and parry. This game is beyond frustating. If you dont mind the AI having that huge advantage then go for it. I dont mind a challenge but this is not fair nor fun to play for me.update: after a dozen of missions or so I decided to try the first campaign mission. Enemy has infinite reinforcement and a giant skaven ogre that attacks 3 time, which if it all hits will one shot any unit you have. For added difficulty the troll appears inside the small tunnel so you cannot overwhelm it with numbers, only 1 or 2 units can attack the ogre at a time.And the objectives is to find and move 15 explosive barrels inside the enemy tunnels. Yup fending off neverending enemy hordes while moving barrels. As you would expect I lost the mission. Dont bother buying this game even if it is in sale unless you like losing a mission for stupid reason like enemy always causes crit and or stun damage, while your's rarely proc. RNG heavily favor AI. Another example, I literally have to put enough enemies out of action to lower the morale to less than 0 and get an automatic win in a map cause the AI keep winning the morale rout roll check which starts at 44 btw. I have no doubt that if the morale rout check could go lower than 0 the AI would pass it with flying colors. This game only makes you feel angry and frustated at the RNG(its not really a random number generator its a whatever favors the AI number generator)			"

												While am a great fan of the tabletop version (even though it's not as good as Necromunda), this one left me quickly with a sense of wonder how was it even possible to make something with that unvieldy and user-unfriendly mechanics with so many turn-based games around.The only answer I came up with is that someone thought it'd be a good idea to make a turn-based third-person hack'n'slash.Besides mechanics, whole slew of warband types have been melded into generic ""human mercenaries"", and most warbands are seriously twisted with ""up to 5 models"" mchanics - though truth be told that limitation is what makes gameplay bearable with said mechanics.There might be something positive about this title somewhere further down the road, but abovementioned was more that enough for me not to bother finding it out.

												Good looking, fun game with hit and miss mechanics. The games does feel slightly lacking in unit roster and the units are not especially specialised which some might see as a plus, personally I don't. The DLC might add to this.Like I said mechanics are hit and miss. The back tracking/movement system is great. How ever mechanics like area of control are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Which might block a unit from taking any kind of part in a fight.The game looks great. Mordheim looks spot on. The city looks perfect from what I have read. Units look superb too, there are some alternate looks, but they're slim in choices. More would be great, to actually feel more connected to the troops and get some personality.The pricing is crazy though. Over 40€ for the game is over the top. While there are worse games to spend that money on, I would wait for at least >30€General feel and view of the game is strongly positive. Do recommend as a game at least. Price has to be considered though. It is not, I repeat not a steal. It is 100% at the top price. "

												I love this game... If you are a Warhammer fan, I'd expect you to have a similar response, though there is a steep learning curve.  Young players (possibly with ADHD ;) complain that the game is too hard at first, but the challenge is part of the excitement and fun.  Once you figure it out, it is addictive!  The bugs, long load times, and other problems that players justifiably complained about in earlier reviews have been fixed; the game is now a joy to play.  The Devs care and are responsive to player concerns and questions.  All the DLC is worthy too.  Chaos, Skaven, and the Witch Hunters are my favorite factions to play, but they're all distinctive and interesting. Like other reviewers, I'd prefer more character customization options and maps, but those are minor quibbles.  Tip: Make sure you go through the tutorials before you start your first warband. In short, this is one of my all time favorite Warhammer games... I can't stop playing it...  "

												Nice.Games Workshop is a dirty word these days, but this game takes me back to their glory days! It's Valkyrie Chronicles meets a tabletop game with a sprinkling of X-ComNot gonna be for everybody, as its quite micromanage stats based, looks and feels a wee bit clunky (lack of char customisation, some things arn't particulaly apparent what they do), story side is lacking, maps all feel the same and finally the injuries and hardcore save system is for a particular taste.On the other hand, I love this game. Hardcore save creates characterful campaigns and make all descisions feel important and risky. The AI is alright. I love building characters up and fiddling with stats, the atmosphere is great and the warbands all have a different feel.If your fed up of the trendy pick up, play and win games, this is a great shout.Not tried multiplayer, but the single player is worth it.

												A random number generator I can deal with. Punishing games I can deal with. One where your 20 hour campaign can be essentially fully defeated because you missed a 9/10 roll five or six times in a row... nope. You can legitimately watch a twenty hour warband become critically flawed after a series of statistically impossible rolls, when you've done everything right and made no mistakes. Nope. Graphics are great, gameplay is good when it isn't so ridiculously frustrating as to defeat any fun it previously offered.			"

												Three words: ""Waiting for opponent"", and those three words are a great NO-NO for me in a computer game.The battles are so slow paced that it feels like you are playing with a human opponent. The mechanics are not good. I could compare it to some other games who did it right, but there is no point. The game is tough but not fun. It is just not good enough to be recommended and this is coming from a Mordheim and Necromunda tabletop player and a true fan. "

												I was playing with my cult of the posses warband and I was about to attack an enemy with my archer, selected aim to better my chances to hit the enemy, 95% possibility to hit...MISSThen attacked with my other archer in my next turn, again used aim to better my chances, 95% chance to hit again...MISSThe percentage to hit is just an ornament on the screen, the game doesn't calculate the actual percentage you have to hit a specific target, I kept on trying to hit an enemy while having 95% to hit, which is the cap, and missed five times IN A ROW.This game uses the same character models for a clase, so you will have up to 6 clones of the same model in your warband, and some models are just so ugly -sister's leader- no I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state.

												Don't buy this game.  It's actually worse than if it was just awful because it's just good enough to convince you to invest hours into it only to set you in a horribly lopsided scenario where you watch helplessly as all the heroes you've worked hard to build up are mercilously beaten down in situation so one-sided as to leave you completely helpless.  Then watch them die and become disfigured rendering your whole warband essentially worthless.  You could argue this is an attempt to reflect the Mordheim miniature game, which can be pretty brutal, but knowing it is pretty brutal, in the miniature game you can volentarily rout a mission pretty early on when you see the situation is hopeless and minimize casualties.  This game forces you to continue suffering a beat down until nearly all your forces are taken out.I like a challenge, I like the gritty nature of the Mordheim world, but I have too much to do and too many games to choose from to invest hours of my life into something that crushes your efforts that callously and so do you.

												Some games strongly rely on grinding to become powerful and successful. This game keeps the worst part of that, it's just grinding and that's all. Choose one of the only four factions that are in the game. Choose a bunch of warriors between a few types of units to assign to the only three classes that form the band (leader, heroes and adepts). Put them again and again on the field to scavenge for wyrdstone and steal the enemy's flag. Level them up so you can collect wyrdstone with more efficiency and most important of all, do not let the rival gang cripple one of your fellow servants because if the wound is permanent that character is ruined for the rest of the game.I still don't get what's the fun about the purpose of the game. Despite of that I still not fully regret the purchase because the graphics, the ambientation and the atmosphere are great. But that's all I can remark from the game.			"

												So after not playing this game for about 2 weeks due to lying difficulty, horrible RNG, and being punished for something I can't control (RNG) I finally picked it up again seeing how it was apperantly fixed. Low and behold I'm wrong. I was severly disappointed seeing not once but twice, in a row, my leaders get brutally destroyed. I would be more forgiving had it not blatantly been the OP AI. I can not at all recommend a game that is buffing the AI instead of just adding in a bit more code. My mercanie, using sword shield, is fighting right now with back up. Misses a 73% charg, ok I just came back not like it's going to be like that all the time. Get smacked in the face by a two hander for 48 damage, 1/3 of my health is gone and the enemy didn't even have a buff. Dread instantly sets in seeing the enemy leader now whip a corner, he has a mace and shield. Ok not going to be so bad my guy might still survive this! Get charged, ok I'm in 44% parry stance, charges are usually pretty low with 60-70% of hitting I should be able to parry, I mean, RNG was supposedly re-worked! Nope, 45 damage + stun on a charge. Another attack followed by it and leader already dead on a normal in my FIRST GAME. Oh my guy was able to get ONE hit off, a 22 damage hit. Now the enemy leader was buffed, he had green (not white) damage indicators but for a 100% damage increase buff? ok that's just dandy why bother with this mission. I was literally forced to restart on the first god dam mission. This isn't hardcore, this is just set up for player failure! THAT'S NOT HARDCORE! So far, from teh two restarts that I had RNG is still blatantly in favor of the AI as they never once missed out of their 10-12 hits on me while I had a 2/4 chance of hitting majority being 80% of hitting. Difficulty is still blatantly lying to your face about ""normal"" missions which really just means enemies are tougher, more health and damage. That's not what normal means in most games, normal means a fair battlefield everyone is equal not AI are heavily favored and buffed. I could forgive the game for buffing (even though it's a 45% ♥♥♥♥ing buff) on Brutal and deadly, the ones that are meant to be a challenge and far more difficult. Normal should not though and it makes the game far more frustrating especially when piled on top of the unforgiving punishments and RNG. The die rolls for dodge/parry are different from hit chances. They do not affect each other, at all. It's more along the lines if you rolled a hit but your opponent rolled a dodge, the dodge will over right the hit. I'm going to the feedback forums themselves and see if something might be going on, a bug or glitch mayhap with this RNG since it's supposedly fixed.All in All the game is still buggy, hopefully that's the case, or clearly throwing over powering AI at you to compensate for it's failure of ""hardcore"". I'm still going to play it due to my love and adoration for Warhammer but to recommend this game to someone else is just something I can't live with. I keep hearing it gets better as you survive and play but my question is, how can it get better when I can't even get past the first day?edit: it's becoming more and more difficult to keep this review from a scathing hate review. The RNG is becoming more notible in just either being ""oh my god I can hit everything!"" to ""I'm missing 95% all the time and my 70% dodge is NEVER dodging!"". This will never be in the case of the AI however which is the most infuriating part, they seem unaffected by any form of faultiness, they'll have a miss here and there but it doesn't occur often. If you want a game that's a challenge, fun, and rewarding go play Xcom, this game just offers the challenge but none of the reward or fun.			"

												This game needs some serious balancing. The RNG is is out of whack, spent the better part of 4 hours getting into melee bundles where the entire enemy warband almost one shot all my members including hero and leader (60+ damage a swing) where as I can only deal 15-20 (assuming I'm lucky enough to hit at all) no matter the troop type so if im lucky 3 or 4 of my members can take down one enemy, this is with a starting warband on what was meant to be a basic map. Resource gathering is far too hard in the early part of the campaign and it's far too easy to be left with no warband and no gold or wyrdstone to be able to come back from. I appreciate the gaem is suppossed to be hardcore in that your band is persistent but the difficulty curve is waaay too high to be fun. Tried 3 different warbands varying between ranged or melee heavy or a mix and none of them could win a match or gather any resource of note. Found the menus and interface annoying and hard to navigate, causing some frustarting mistakes in battle, nothing feels intuitive and all the information feels like an overdose so nothing really sinks in. I did like the look and atmosphere of the game and it's always nice to have some customization options so that kept me entertained naming my bands and coming up with backstories, shame they all got hacked to bits  so deftly by uber buffed ai. More warbands choices might draw me back eg. Vampire Counts, but I'd be very cautious after this 1st taste tbh. Really unsatisfying and frustrating experience in it's current form. So disappointed. :<			"

												The game is a bit intimidating at the start but if you can push through it the game really opens up and becomes a lot more fun. Currently the only real complaints I have are: 1. the game has a limited amount of ways to make money early on and if you arent completeing certain tasks it can be easy to go bankrupt if you dont keep some money in reserve. Try not to spend too much money early on in the game or you can wind up losing just because you're broke. 2. Some of the factions seem a bit unbalanced in some ways. The skaven seem to have a lot of health early on and what I mean is their weakness is supposed to be low health but early on they seem to have around the same as everyone else but are more maneuverable and do more damage, so at the very start skaven have an advantage. Later on however it balances out as their sustainability problem compounds making them work as intended, as fast moving and precise ambushers.I enjoy the customizability and I enjoy the gameplay and I also like how injuries can be cosmetic. For example one of my guys now has a peg leg he got from a battle after his leg got severed from falling in battle. I also enjoy how countering other factions requires different tactics like countering skaven you have to stick together and overpower them because if you run off with your warband split up they'll just out maneuver you and hit one group with everything they have however if the skaven are ever caught split up and you can move fast enough you can drop one or two and push it in your favor.It's really a fun game that I recommend giving a try as there are almost no games with this kind of gameplay out there right now.

												A turn-based squad RPG with roguelite elements inspired by the Games Workshop franchise. Player combat takes place on different locations of Mordheim, offering a new strategic challenge at every match. The static setting and the evenly matched skirmishes gives it the feel of an ""arena""-type game.Out of combat, players manage their characters and with a reserve pool avalible early on, the game feels similar to Blood Bowl (another Games Workshop franchise). Characters avalible in the four factions are highly customizable, also owing to the tabletop minature background. Characters accumulate injuries and experiance over time which makes each run in Mordheim a unique challenge, as players are tasked to prioritize between collecting the valuable Wyrdstones and fighting the competing group. Comes with multiplayer so you can play online after getting tired of the extremely poor singleplayer AI. Easily recommended to Warhammer strategy fans.			"

												This is the first game i've taken the time to review on steam.  I would love to recommend it to people, but sadly i cannot in its current form.  If your looking for a game that is fair or at the least plays by the same rules you have to, then keep moving.  This game is designed from the ground up to be unfair towards the player.  All because they are unable to make an even remotely decent A.I.  You WILL miss 9/10 attacks, even when they have a 95% chance to hit,  Meanwhile the enemy will roll 5's all day so they get multiple criticals and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hits in a row.  I don't have a problem with RNG.  It is obvious however when playing this game that the deck is severaly stacked.  I wouldn't doubt if there is a 50% chance on every roll to add 30 or more to your roll.  You will NEVER roll a 1 or anything near it.  You will however roll 85-95 on every other roll.  This wouldn't be a problem if they allowed you to choose if you wanted high or low rolls to be good, however that is sadly not the case.  On top of that, every match that you do really well on(complete all the objectives/no one is taken out of action) you will,for no reason, still have 1-3 heros with wounds that have to sit out for several days.   In case you are wondering if im just a baddie at the game, i have yet to lose a round yet.  Despite all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that causes me to curse and scream in fury at this game, it still cant manage to beat me.  Thats how BAD the A.I is.  They will walk the opposite direction of the nearest ally/enemy fighting to go stand in a random doorway and try to ambush something. Despite the fact no one is in that direction.  This means instead of feeling like you had a good match, or that perhaps you made a mistake and could learn from it and improve, you instead just got RNG'd.  The same goes for improving your characters.  You want to put a hero in heavy armor? Well, too bad.  You sure as hell aren't gonna be able to buy it from the shop.  Wanna two-handed sword instead of an axe? Well, F*ck you.  You damn better hope an enemy in one of the upcoming matches has one, and is stupid enough to rush you by himself so that after killing him you can actually loot the body.  Cause if his teamates are around you wont be able to stand close enough to loot it,  Do you want a specific enchant on your weapon or armor? Again, you can just f*ck off.  There is an amazing amount of them to choose from.  To bad they only way to get them is RNG from a mission reward unless you just so happen to want one of the horrible ones offered by the other factions.   Also what the hell is with the RNG time on deleveries?  Sure the last time you sent a shipment to the pit you were paid the next day.  This time?   Well its gonna take about 3 days.  Really?  You will never have enough gold to train the skills and spellls you want.  You will find yourself selling a ridiculous amount of looted treasure and stone, just to pay and heal up the scrubs on your team that get injured from stubbing their toe,  On top of that, why the hell do i have to pay these idiots AND supply the equipment for em?  Can they not supply their own tools/weapons and armor? Maybe the fact i've paid these idiots in the neighborhood of 500g a piece would mean they could pay for their own damn training and weapons?  Also spellcasting is useless in this game, unless you consider risking doing 9999 damage to yourself to MAYBE succeed in casting a spell that MIGHT reduce a random stat.(or other equally uselss spell.)  I kid you not.  Not even the 10th time i try to cast a spell and my only caster,and leader, manages to one shot himself.  I mean come the hell on.  Meanwhile the only negative you will ever see an enemy caster get is the on that just so happens to stun himself and EVERYONE near him.  ""Oh, so his spell failed to cast, so my leader and two heros are now stunned,  Great,Tl;Dr :  If you ever see a programmer respond to this saying they have looked at the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor rng, buy the game, Otherwise this is just another Vermintide.  It looks like warhammer, almost feels like warhammer, and is only fun to die hard fans, and even then only briefly,			"

								With the new update introducing the campaign mode and proper warband managment the game has much more content, it's fun as hell but has some issues. I honestly don't trust the RNG, anything below 80% is a guaranteed miss in my experience, maybe i'm unlucky but it definately feels off. The camera angles can be extremely frustrating, if you're using any of the large creatures like the Ogre you'll get a great view of it's♥♥♥♥♥ and thats all. The game as a whole works well though, and it's got enough content to keep you occupied for many hours. I'd like to see more item variety, more item drops and more rune recipe drops, in the 40 or so hours I've played the game I've only seen one named magical item.Best tactical TBS i've seen in a few years, highly reccommend.

												Cons:- Heavy random number generator focus on most gameplay mechanics.- Enemies are scaled to the player's warband rating.- Lack of a minimap means constant backtacking with the fullscreen in combat map to make sure your warriors are heading in the right direction. - Story mode missions have tedious objectives with the purpose of prolonging the duration of the mission.- DLCs required to unlock additional warbands. - Many of the optional campaign objectives cannot be completed. Enemies will either concede or die too early before players can have a chance to complete them. This means a loss of experience points gained. They add up.  Rating: 4/10Did not enjoy aspect of the game. The customization was disappointing. The levels themselves were large but clunky in design. The combat felt unrewarding. For a freeform tactical turned base strategy game it failed to keep a turn based strategy fan like myself entertained. I suggest skipping it entirely.			"

												This Game is made all the more infuriating by how good it could be, but it is just frustration and anger wraped in a pretty bow. A brawl disquised as tactical combat. I had to delete it to prevent myself from trying to progress because I feel like if I smashed my head against this brick wall long enough I might find gold underneath. The cake is a lie, and this game is just a turn based third person shooter.After some time I decided to give the game another go, and really put in some hours to see if the game improves as you progress. It does, alot. If you can get past the first 10 missions there is a fun game underneath the pain and agony. I like games that punish poor decisions, not so much games that punish bad luck with rolls. This one is unfortunately the latter, a little good luck can get you a long way but the best flanking manouver can go horribly wrong when every attack misses even though it claims your odds are over 80%I still cannot recommend this game; even though I am personally enjoying it and will likely continue playing. Even a victory is a defeat early on as the route mechanics just do not function properly for low level groups making most optional objectives completely unattainable. If you are a stubborn sort who can get past the first 10 hours then go for it, otherwise look elsewhere.			"

												Very slick X-COM style game inspired by Games Workshop's Mordheim.  Pros:Permanent consequences force strategic and tough choicesLOTS of skills, upgrades and units4 initiatal warbands feel and play differently despite strong overlapsIt is faithful to original mordheim without being stuck to D6'sCons:AI can be pretty stupidIt's mordheim, prepare to HATE random chance.  (As a table top player, it was far far worse)-You'll miss key rolls to hit, climb, or cast spells-Your favorite character will die-You'll be on a roll then the next encounter is AMBUSH and suddenly all tactics are out the windo(This can suck by modern gaming standards, but that's part of the charm of the original)Loading times are stupid long - apparently nearly every aspect of map and oppenents team is randomly generated on the spotEarly campaign is boring.  You need at least 3-5 games before you get enough skills to build a warband to your liking and not just vanilla.  Once you hit level 3, then you're going places.  Overall, I would strongly recommend this game to roguelike fans, strategy game enthusiasts or nostalgic games workshop players.  It's not perfect, but its one of my favorits.			"

												I thought about getting this for some time. When the game came out for a free weekend, I was thrilled. However the trill was short lived when I actually started playing it. Some people have complained about the steep learning curve. Elite Dangerous has a steep learning curve, this has a learning cliff with no climbing ropes. The tutorial was not informative and crushingly boring. Meanwhile the campaign is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lacks much of a story other than: Go here, do this, kill this, loose half your men ect. The mechanics are very clunky and the overall camera controls are rediculusly constricting. The veiws that you get are third person and third person. This would not be so bad if it were like Dragon Age. It can take 3-4 rounds to kill an enemy one on one which will leave your man crippled regardless of whether or not he is covered in heavy armor or clad in a burlap sack. Weapon type is also imaterial a halberd/spear has nearly the same combat range as a sword or dagger wielding hostile. Bows are made useless from the combonation of short range and low damage. But the logic envolved with this is also flawed. Combat, especially in the story missions is encredibly one-sided and your entire team will run off under stupid conditions. Once I had the enemy down to one and backed into a corner 5 on 1 and lost the leader. All 4 of the others cut and run.  If this had nothing else to compair it to, we would think it was incredible, but let me make a list of games like this that are better.Dragon Age, all 3Divinity 2 Divinity Orginal SinPillars of EternityBaulders GateIcewind Dale Temple of Elemental Evil (TOEE) Dungeon SeigeBlackguards 1&2Your favorite game hereOn an up note, this does beat out Sword Coast. Then again, contracting Leishmaniasis beats that. My point is, there is no point in getting this when there are a slew of other games out there that are so so much better that cost far far less.			"

												I don't do many reviews but I thought i would put something for this game.(I have played quite a few hours on this with my offline PC)(Edit - Spell check lives again so corrected a lot of errors... Sadly was on an odd day)Personally i thought this was a good although very difficult game when i started, but i found despite the few issues and UI the game was actually quite good.If you are looking for another casual turn based game where you can just pick some classes and tank up then I would recommend avoiding this game. Every mistake you make will come back an haunt you at a later date including avoiding some side objectives,I think it would be easier if i gave a basic description of the pros and cons for this game...Camera: The camera is a 3rd person camera that locks onto the unit you are meant to be moving that turn, Doesn't allow free roaming with the camera and makes seeing around corners and in buildings a little more difficult when trying to avoid ambushes.Movement: This caught me off guard at first.. Using the standard movement keys WASD to navigate was a bit odd for a turn based game but once I figured out the blue circles were something akin to movement areas, you would only lose a movement point when changing to a different ring giving you free movement within your Movement points.Actions: This i found a little off at first but every action has a reaction.. Firing a gun means it needs you to use a reload action, gives you arm fatigue for the rest of the turn lowering accuracy.  Climbing walls needs at the jump points Isn't always guaranteed with a chance of a sprain if you are very unlucky ect. Usually it is best to prepare for the consequences for most actions.UI: I agree with most people... It is a little clunky and not the best.. But when you look past most of its appearance you mostly use Q & E to change action instead of a menu. Regardless it shows everything you need.Ok now for a simple list:Pros:On High graphics settings it looks goodAI is hard and sometimes unforgiving (Well good in my opinion)Soundtrack is fittingOpen maps in most levelsExcellent customizationConsequences for loosing affect appearance of unitsRandomly generated map placementsSome replay abilityUnlocks persist through multiple play throughWays to deal with enemy vary based on your preferred tacticsCons:AI is hard but can predict how they act based on the game modeVery few game modesUI is a bit clunkyMaps look a bit samish even if they are randomly generatedOn low graphics looks appalling compared to most modern gamesDon't always get chance to loot stuffThe game is hard, fun but at times frustrating when it goes from bad to worse. Not always the end of the world but makes progression harder.  Worth it if you like difficult games that seek to destroy you in as many ways as you can.. until you figure out AI tactics but even then still easy to die.I'd give this game a 7 out of 10.. Despite its flaws it has some merit and room to improve.			"

												A TLDR at the bottom of this review to summarise my points.I really enjoy this game, though it is anything but a 'pick up and play' game for when you have ten minutes to kill. The graphics are beautiful and illustrate the lush environments of a seedy and damned city. The gameplay is challenging from the outset and learning curve (if you ignore the tutorials) can be steep. I chose to play through as Skaven, and haven't tried the other races as yet, so my opinions may be invalid or void with regards to their gameplay. The customisation of characters is adequate, it's not an integral part of the game, and seems to be purely asthetic, though it is a nice touch, as is the injuries, for example; if a character maims a hand, their hand on the character model is mangled. The story missions, character progression and warband management are all solid, on the whole, the game is well made and fun, whilst having a high level of strategic gameplay. However... and this is my only gripe about the game thus far, the load times are ridiculous! I have a high end machine, and yet sometimes I can go away boil the kettle, make a cup of tea or coffee and return and it still hasn't finished loading the map. This is the main reason I have yet to try any of the online features. Also, it is annoying when the voice overs from the mission and the narrator fight it out trying to talk over eachother, resulting in a garbled mess of voices and leaving you to read the mission objectives etc... for vital information you need.TLDR: +graphics+voice acting+ gameplay+story+ challenging- load times- voices overlappingOn the whole a great game, but not for the impatient.

Early Access Review
								tl;dr There are very few features currently in the game, but what's there is very good and very promising.So, point of mention: I never played Mordheim before this; I'm familiar with the game and its concept, but never had a chance to actually get in a campaign. Also note that this review is current as of the second content updateCurrently the game only really has the combat more or less. There's 4 warbands (essentially Skaven, Empire, Warrior Priest Empire, and Chaos), and they all have unique units with different skills and abilities, including a powerful Leader unit and 1 impressive unit (Ogre, Chaos Spawn, Rat Ogre, or Super Sister) The rest of the options are fairly simple as to be expected from a starting warband, usually with only a skill or two differentiating them besides their different stat lines. Unfortunately, this does make the units feel very generic, but that's how I imagine they are until level ups and injuries anyways.Surprisingly, combat/movement does not take place on a grid, but in 3D environments using circles to mark how far you can move with each movement point. This does create some weirdness moving around objectives, because you can end up eking out a lot more movement in some situations, looping around obstacles without leaving your circle, but largely looks really nice. The movement is also interestingly handled by WASD, so you actually get to run around with your guys, which was a refreshing change and felt really good. A nice side effect of this as well is that the entire game is playable with a gamepad, hinting that they may move into consoles at some point. Circles also dictate enemy threat zones and ally ""control zones"", which is an area that keeps other allies from performing actions. It sounds strange, but basically its simply to keep you from stacking 30 guys on one enemy. Nice to note that although there are many missing features currently, the game does include a fairly polished 4-part tutorial that also gives you a chance to see all the factions. Load times were a bit of a bother, but that could also be my machine. Lastly, the interface during the game was very nice. You're able to easily open windows with a single button press that will allow you to see a summary of your active character's stats/buffs, the target character's stats, or a breakdown of what modifiers are on certain actions (explaining why your success chance is higher or lower than expected). All in all, it allows the player to only be confronted with the information they feel they need without requiring lots of popping back to a settings menu.Insert standard comment about bugs and it being in early access so hopefully they will be polished out.Currently, the only form of customization that exists is choosing what weapons your guys have equipped. Dual wielded weapons can be equipped in any combination, so there's actually some nice variety here in, even just with equipment, deciding and executing specific roles for your dudes. As warband management is the newest feature, it's pretty light, but there's lots of promising space on the screen to be filled in. Notably, there's something like 12 locked equipment slots, hinting at lots of consumables and magic items coming in the future (one of the tutorials actually mentions something about enchantments). The Skills page is broken up into something like 10 different tabs, also hinting at lots of customization incoming (currently you can only skirmish with the starting armies, and loot + XP are not applied).Graphically, the game is, frankly, amazing. I'm running it on a 3-year-old laptop and I was getting decent FPS on the ""good"" setting, which is better than the vast majority of games I've played. Surprisingly optimized for an early access game. I'm not a huge fan of the maps and environments, but that's mostly a question of taste; I'm not one who really enjoys OMG SO GRIMDARK!!!1 all the time. That being said, for that vein they do look absolutely fantastic. They also sport lots of points of interaction, allowing you to climb and leap through different elevations. Nice level design so far from what I've seen. Traps and looting are in, though can't really say how big a role they currently play.All in all, I have to say that I am very impressed. Like I said, the game still has lots of missing key features, but the thing is that they seem to be taking their time and making sure that they do everything right the first time around rather than spit out a bunch of features and try to massage it into a playable state. Personally I won't be playing a whole lot of it right now (since I'm mostly looking forward to the warband growth aspects of the game), but it is totally playable and, compared to almost all other Early Access games I've played, seems to really be starting on the right foot.

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is a Masochist wet dream.This game is possibly the funnest time you will have getting your a** handed to you on a silver platter especially late game. This game has a entire list of just painful factors that'll leave you rage quiting after every game you play, but like an abused girlfriend, you'll just keep coming back for more hoping to pull off those tight decisive victories and bloody battles that make you cheer alongside your warband.Now Mordheim is a game that doesn't go easy on you and one bad mistake could cause your entire warband to be brutally defeated and lose you the game. Just to list a few, AI is tough and they will hammer as many soldiers as they can into a battle line just to take you down. Not a problem, but you'll be fighting against harsh RNG that definitely favors the AI in most fights. Criticals could knock out warriors leaving them completely vulnerable to even more hits, the AI will dodge what feels like every other hit you make before delivering their own blows that'll have your guys hurting or REALLY hurting. If you think that's cruel, the enemy doesn't have to kill everyone, only enough of your warband to bring your moral down till you route, which can be typicall 3-5 of your guys in a warband of 6-8.Good news though, the enemy warband can also break, instantly winning you the battle. The Bad news is if the enemy breaks, you lose out on completing any optional objectives that are vital for leveling up your warband. ""Complete optional objectives before you fight"" I hear you say, which would work except you forgot about the brutal AI enemy that'll block, charge, and murder your warband if you try to run around them, or would route before you could kill enough enemies to get on to completing the objectives.After a battle, you'll have to deal with managing your warband, paying for their service and any medical bills from them getting injured, outfitting them with better gear, customizing them a bit, training new abilities. If a warrior is injured, they could be out of service for days which means you won't be able to fight with them, which is painful if you're leader becomes injured.And to put icing on this hot-tamali cake, you have a timer! Throughout the campaign you will be required to pay your Warbands sponsor/leader/murder-lord shipments of Wyrdstone which you will collect during missions and receive a bit after a mission. And not small shipments, HUGE shipments of over a hundred pounds of Wyrdstone must be filled in the manner of 2 weeks, and every shipment will be larger than the last. If you fail to fill these shipment requests (I believe twice), you lose the game. Game over, Warband disbanded, please try again.....oh ya. And the game auto saves so no loading an old save if you lose, cheater.NOW for AAALLLL of that...it's still a really good game and very, very rewarding when you win. The RNG is effected by a lot of skills you earn from leveling up that can swing things more in your favor. A clever player can usually lock down enemies and swoop around with faster troops to gather the wyrdstone and I've noticed wyrdstone piles seem to grow more fruitful as the game progresses so fulfilling those requests for your sponsor/leader/murder-lord never trully get's impossible. If you manage skills right and make sure to pull your soldiers out if they're hurting, you can avoid a lot of problems down the line. Optional objectives are still tough but smart planning (and a little luck) can achieve you a decisive victory.Probably what I have to say though most for the fun factor is that it's tough, but never impossible. The feeling you get from just having enough gold to pay for one more battle, to just barely pay off the request with one more day to go. To pull of a clutch victory from the grasp of defeat  or see you're warriors beat down a powerful enemy who seems so impossing is so satisfying. It's what makes the game so good. It isn't being defeated and restarting from a checkpoint.This game isn't about how hard you hit, but how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!			"

												i like that we are now getting good games in the warhammer universe, and hoped that this game would be played alongside vermintide. unfortunetely the pure RNG in this game is a huge turnoff for me.the good-good graphics and art style: the world is well realised and everything fits well with the theme of a city distorted by wyrdstone.-wide range of tactic choices: i enjoy how unique the different factions feel, i unfortunetely didint get deep into this aspect as i wanted to refund this game, but what was there was good.the bad- the load times are long: i have a fairly fast SSD and this game still takes multiple minutes to get into a level, to the point i frequently tabbed out and watched videos while waiting for the music changes to let me know the loading was done.-slow paced: the game takes a long time to get going, and most of the time you spend the first 2-3 turns just running towards objectives not knowing where your opponent is going to be.-unclear RNG mechanic: i enjoy games that use risk management as a primary mechanic, but this game is really bad at giving you all the numbers to make an informed dicision. sometimes you will miss repeatedely with 80% to hit, is flanking usefull at all? etc.-bland warband management and custimization: th amount of freedom you get with your warband is limited, perhaps later on this is expanded, but going 3 missions in and replacing a character with clones of himself is dull and none of the units feels unique. i was also dissapointed the the extent of the costimization options are colors.

Half of my time was spent waiting for enemies to get done with their turn. In a large map, this leads to sitting around doing nothing. And tutorial tips... If I'm in my third game, I don't need to know I can change hero items through the hero screen... I already know that. Lots of small stuff here and there make this game rather annoying and it quickly ruins itself as a ""game"" and quickly turns itself into a task			"

								With the new update introducing the campaign mode and proper warband managment the game has much more content, it's fun as hell but has some issues. I honestly don't trust the RNG, anything below 80% is a guaranteed miss in my experience, maybe i'm unlucky but it definately feels off. The camera angles can be extremely frustrating, if you're using any of the large creatures like the Ogre you'll get a great view of it's♥♥♥♥♥ and thats all. The game as a whole works well though, and it's got enough content to keep you occupied for many hours. I'd like to see more item variety, more item drops and more rune recipe drops, in the 40 or so hours I've played the game I've only seen one named magical item.Best tactical TBS i've seen in a few years, highly reccommend.

												The art feels pretty much exactly how it should feel. Spot on.Game play, and running a warband is hardcore and feels right. There is a learning curve here, but this is because there are so many character build options. The AI does get a bit easy to beat after a while but for me that is not a huge problem because a bunch of us have bought the game in order to play against each other. Still, it feels downright hard when you start because you will make so many mistakes while you learn.To run a ""Campaign"" against other players requires a bit of admin from someone because the game does not support it but you do keep your loot, items and injuries so for us its perfect. One small moan here is that the amount you have played grants you ""Perks"" that could unbalance the warbands a tad. An option to flag a warband as a No Perks warband would be nice.Overall, one of the best games I've played recently. Definitely enjoying it more than some other recent big titles. "

												The game has a learning curve and the RNG can be a little annoying at times but also adds some suspense to the game.  Sometimes, you have a great plan but your warband can't execute and sometimes, a lone soldier holds the line against the odds.  Unlike a game like X-com, even a novice henchman has pretty good chances to hit but they have shakey morale.  Don't let novices get surrounded or they might rout and get themselves killed.  Remember that collecting Wyrdstone is your primary goal.  Killing the enemy is secondary.  Of course, if you spot a lone enemy, kill him/her and if a bunch of enemies engage, they send in all your warband to fight, but in the beginning of a skirmish, try to gather some loot and wyrdstone before hand.  This will help you greatly after the battle as you need the wyrdstone and loot to pay for the treatment of your wounded and salaries of your troops.Overall I have had a lot of fun so far.  Challenging game but satisfying as well.The multiplayer scene is not great, but I think it will get better over time.  Regardless the AI is challenging enough for me.			"

												Borderline on yes vs no; overall love the game and concept but the UI, rolling and AI quirks really ruin the overall experince.  The interface is almost as hard as the actaul game.Depth and character sheets are extremely close to classic tabletops; really good stuff.GREAT hard game that will make you hate yourself over and over again; 1 mistake can cost you the game.  Really a blast to play.  I am on the fence for this; if you are a Mordheim fan; then a defineite buy; otherwise I would probably not reccomend. Now the bad:1.  UI is miserable; inventory, leveling and skill points is only a slight step up from doing it on paper.  I can see they are trying to maybe make it similiar to true D&D style maybe?  Overall is could of been made much easier/simplier without losing content.    2.  As other have said; RAND rolling is skewed against you; 75% success rolls and you end up losing 5 times in a row.   Something is amiss; happens over and over again.  I am sure they have some reasoning; but the dice in D&D have never been as mean as this game.3.   Stupidity of interface during battles; confirm mouse clicks after cycling or spacebaring through 5 opitions; over and over and over and over andddddd aaaaHHHHH where am I?!?!?!  Hotkeys guys; we have more then 2 buttons on a keyboard.4.  Hidden map idea; wish they made this a toggle.  Not knowing where your enemies are is a bit of change from typical tabletop; (for obvious reasons); and adds a ton of diffculty to an already burtal game.  Not sure I like the dynamic; forces you to play in a compelty different style and cuts back on tatics quite a bit.Overall it almost looks like a bad console port where you only have 6-8 buttons; buts its not...  The other quarks i can overlook; but this is just in-excusable.			"

												As a longtime fan and player of the tabletop game, I was thrilled to see Mordheim was being made into a computer game. My old computer didn't meet the minimum specs, but after buying an ASUS ROG rig on clearance at Best Buy this spring, I have to say Rogue Factor did not disappoint! This is a fantastic conversion, with four of the iconic warbands included, and now a fifth -- Witch Hunters -- available as DLC, as well as several hired swords. Keep it coming, devs!Like the tabletop version, the gameplay is highly tactical. Ganging up on lone enemies, while preventing the enemy from ganging up on you, is the key to victory. Yes, you will lose warriors from time to time -- get used to it, it's Mordheim! Keep your heavy hitters in front, while your weaker members grab wyrdstone and loot until they're strong enough to fight. Hire a reserve leader so you don't miss days when your primary leader gets injured -- make those wyrdstone shipments to your sponsor on time! That keeps the gold flowing and lets you build up your warband. Now, my Level 10 Ogre is a killing machine!No, the game isn't perfect -- there are occasional spots in some maps where you should be able to move but a small obstacle blocks your path. And the AI does get hung up once in a while, especially with the large monsters unable to find a path or blocked by a wagon. Also, the persistent arrows after you get shot really need to go away -- having your warriors running around fighting with an arrow right between the eyes or through their skulls looks pretty dumb. So those glitches still need to be ironed out. But overall, this is a great game of Mordheim. The visuals are spot-on, the story missions are fun, and you don't even have to paint your warband. Now let's get that Undead warband into the game! And then, Necromunda...			"

Early Access Review
								tl;dr There are very few features currently in the game, but what's there is very good and very promising.So, point of mention: I never played Mordheim before this; I'm familiar with the game and its concept, but never had a chance to actually get in a campaign. Also note that this review is current as of the second content updateCurrently the game only really has the combat more or less. There's 4 warbands (essentially Skaven, Empire, Warrior Priest Empire, and Chaos), and they all have unique units with different skills and abilities, including a powerful Leader unit and 1 impressive unit (Ogre, Chaos Spawn, Rat Ogre, or Super Sister) The rest of the options are fairly simple as to be expected from a starting warband, usually with only a skill or two differentiating them besides their different stat lines. Unfortunately, this does make the units feel very generic, but that's how I imagine they are until level ups and injuries anyways.Surprisingly, combat/movement does not take place on a grid, but in 3D environments using circles to mark how far you can move with each movement point. This does create some weirdness moving around objectives, because you can end up eking out a lot more movement in some situations, looping around obstacles without leaving your circle, but largely looks really nice. The movement is also interestingly handled by WASD, so you actually get to run around with your guys, which was a refreshing change and felt really good. A nice side effect of this as well is that the entire game is playable with a gamepad, hinting that they may move into consoles at some point. Circles also dictate enemy threat zones and ally ""control zones"", which is an area that keeps other allies from performing actions. It sounds strange, but basically its simply to keep you from stacking 30 guys on one enemy. Nice to note that although there are many missing features currently, the game does include a fairly polished 4-part tutorial that also gives you a chance to see all the factions. Load times were a bit of a bother, but that could also be my machine. Lastly, the interface during the game was very nice. You're able to easily open windows with a single button press that will allow you to see a summary of your active character's stats/buffs, the target character's stats, or a breakdown of what modifiers are on certain actions (explaining why your success chance is higher or lower than expected). All in all, it allows the player to only be confronted with the information they feel they need without requiring lots of popping back to a settings menu.Insert standard comment about bugs and it being in early access so hopefully they will be polished out.Currently, the only form of customization that exists is choosing what weapons your guys have equipped. Dual wielded weapons can be equipped in any combination, so there's actually some nice variety here in, even just with equipment, deciding and executing specific roles for your dudes. As warband management is the newest feature, it's pretty light, but there's lots of promising space on the screen to be filled in. Notably, there's something like 12 locked equipment slots, hinting at lots of consumables and magic items coming in the future (one of the tutorials actually mentions something about enchantments). The Skills page is broken up into something like 10 different tabs, also hinting at lots of customization incoming (currently you can only skirmish with the starting armies, and loot + XP are not applied).Graphically, the game is, frankly, amazing. I'm running it on a 3-year-old laptop and I was getting decent FPS on the ""good"" setting, which is better than the vast majority of games I've played. Surprisingly optimized for an early access game. I'm not a huge fan of the maps and environments, but that's mostly a question of taste; I'm not one who really enjoys OMG SO GRIMDARK!!!1 all the time. That being said, for that vein they do look absolutely fantastic. They also sport lots of points of interaction, allowing you to climb and leap through different elevations. Nice level design so far from what I've seen. Traps and looting are in, though can't really say how big a role they currently play.All in all, I have to say that I am very impressed. Like I said, the game still has lots of missing key features, but the thing is that they seem to be taking their time and making sure that they do everything right the first time around rather than spit out a bunch of features and try to massage it into a playable state. Personally I won't be playing a whole lot of it right now (since I'm mostly looking forward to the warband growth aspects of the game), but it is totally playable and, compared to almost all other Early Access games I've played, seems to really be starting on the right foot.

Early Access Review
								If you like stratergy, in a battle to battle type set up (think XCOM battles) then this is right up your street. I would however be remiss, if i didnt mention that at the moment Feb 6th. There is only skirmish mode availible to play(free fights, with no unit concequences. I.E. no woundings/death/battle damage or exp gain to player units)  and a limited Warband (unit customisation)  that allows you to change out you units Weapons and Armour and Units, so you can get a an idea of your play style and what the game has to offer.As for controlling the game, its really straight forward:Use mouse to look around and change direction (like any First or Third person game) and confirm Actions/skills. Q&E to change actions/skills and select enermy units. W for moving.(personally I havent used the map yet. so I cant comment on that one)The one thing that I found a little jarring was the opponent movement camera. The player camera cuts to the nearest character unit witnessing the enermies movement a bit to quick for my liking.  not that this is a major problem. Just my preferance.I admit I have never played the board game, so i cant compare the two,But I'm pleased with the game so far, I'm really looking forward to the campaign content when it drops.I recommend looking for some player videos on the web, to get a better idea of what the game is about, before buying.

												This Game is made all the more infuriating by how good it could be, but it is just frustration and anger wraped in a pretty bow. A brawl disquised as tactical combat. I had to delete it to prevent myself from trying to progress because I feel like if I smashed my head against this brick wall long enough I might find gold underneath. The cake is a lie, and this game is just a turn based third person shooter.After some time I decided to give the game another go, and really put in some hours to see if the game improves as you progress. It does, alot. If you can get past the first 10 missions there is a fun game underneath the pain and agony. I like games that punish poor decisions, not so much games that punish bad luck with rolls. This one is unfortunately the latter, a little good luck can get you a long way but the best flanking manouver can go horribly wrong when every attack misses even though it claims your odds are over 80%I still cannot recommend this game; even though I am personally enjoying it and will likely continue playing. Even a victory is a defeat early on as the route mechanics just do not function properly for low level groups making most optional objectives completely unattainable. If you are a stubborn sort who can get past the first 10 hours then go for it, otherwise look elsewhere.			"

												Pros:Interesting team rpg progressionStrategic gameplayDifferent factions offering various playstylesLots of replayabilityGreat visualsCons:Steep learning curveRNG aspect for calculating hits, dmg, etc, can be frustrating sometimesVsing AI can get stale once you start vsing other playersConclusionMordheim: City of the Damned does very well to replicate a tabletop game onto a pc format. The RNG dice rolls for calculations will deter some people, but it's very much like playing cards or gambling. The frustration of fails at 90% chance is superseded by the success of 10% chances. You win some you lose some. The game allows you to strategically play your odds, establishing an interesting core gameplay mechanic.			"

You will have fun with this game until it decides that you are going to lose no matter what.All available missions are Deadly and this is only your third day? Scout for more missions!  Oh, what's that? The first two scouts came back with MORE deadly missions?!  Guess you'll have to use the rest of your money to scout once more, unless you wanna go on a suicide mission!  Oh, nice! it was a normal mission! Let's do this!  *DEPLOYMENT F***ED YOU* Oh look! you're spread out with each unit all alone and the enemy skaven are RIGHT next to your guys, surrounding them.  Oh, cool! They all go first and can surround and take out half of your guys before you even get to act!  What? You're routing on your first turn?Oh! Awesome! All of the guys that went down in that battle died!Good thing you went with that normal mission instead of the deadly one.  Better hire more people with your zero money.			"

												A TLDR at the bottom of this review to summarise my points.I really enjoy this game, though it is anything but a 'pick up and play' game for when you have ten minutes to kill. The graphics are beautiful and illustrate the lush environments of a seedy and damned city. The gameplay is challenging from the outset and learning curve (if you ignore the tutorials) can be steep. I chose to play through as Skaven, and haven't tried the other races as yet, so my opinions may be invalid or void with regards to their gameplay. The customisation of characters is adequate, it's not an integral part of the game, and seems to be purely asthetic, though it is a nice touch, as is the injuries, for example; if a character maims a hand, their hand on the character model is mangled. The story missions, character progression and warband management are all solid, on the whole, the game is well made and fun, whilst having a high level of strategic gameplay. However... and this is my only gripe about the game thus far, the load times are ridiculous! I have a high end machine, and yet sometimes I can go away boil the kettle, make a cup of tea or coffee and return and it still hasn't finished loading the map. This is the main reason I have yet to try any of the online features. Also, it is annoying when the voice overs from the mission and the narrator fight it out trying to talk over eachother, resulting in a garbled mess of voices and leaving you to read the mission objectives etc... for vital information you need.TLDR: +graphics+voice acting+ gameplay+story+ challenging- load times- voices overlappingOn the whole a great game, but not for the impatient.

Product received for free
												I thought about getting this for some time. When the game came out for a free weekend, I was thrilled. However the trill was short lived when I actually started playing it. Some people have complained about the steep learning curve. Elite Dangerous has a steep learning curve, this has a learning cliff with no climbing ropes. The tutorial was not informative and crushingly boring. Meanwhile the campaign is half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and lacks much of a story other than: Go here, do this, kill this, loose half your men ect. The mechanics are very clunky and the overall camera controls are rediculusly constricting. The veiws that you get are third person and third person. This would not be so bad if it were like Dragon Age. It can take 3-4 rounds to kill an enemy one on one which will leave your man crippled regardless of whether or not he is covered in heavy armor or clad in a burlap sack. Weapon type is also imaterial a halberd/spear has nearly the same combat range as a sword or dagger wielding hostile. Bows are made useless from the combonation of short range and low damage. But the logic envolved with this is also flawed. Combat, especially in the story missions is encredibly one-sided and your entire team will run off under stupid conditions. Once I had the enemy down to one and backed into a corner 5 on 1 and lost the leader. All 4 of the others cut and run.  If this had nothing else to compair it to, we would think it was incredible, but let me make a list of games like this that are better.Dragon Age, all 3Divinity 2 Divinity Orginal SinPillars of EternityBaulders GateIcewind Dale Temple of Elemental Evil (TOEE) Dungeon SeigeBlackguards 1&2Your favorite game hereOn an up note, this does beat out Sword Coast. Then again, contracting Leishmaniasis beats that. My point is, there is no point in getting this when there are a slew of other games out there that are so so much better that cost far far less.			"

												I don't do many reviews but I thought i would put something for this game.(I have played quite a few hours on this with my offline PC)(Edit - Spell check lives again so corrected a lot of errors... Sadly was on an odd day)Personally i thought this was a good although very difficult game when i started, but i found despite the few issues and UI the game was actually quite good.If you are looking for another casual turn based game where you can just pick some classes and tank up then I would recommend avoiding this game. Every mistake you make will come back an haunt you at a later date including avoiding some side objectives,I think it would be easier if i gave a basic description of the pros and cons for this game...Camera: The camera is a 3rd person camera that locks onto the unit you are meant to be moving that turn, Doesn't allow free roaming with the camera and makes seeing around corners and in buildings a little more difficult when trying to avoid ambushes.Movement: This caught me off guard at first.. Using the standard movement keys WASD to navigate was a bit odd for a turn based game but once I figured out the blue circles were something akin to movement areas, you would only lose a movement point when changing to a different ring giving you free movement within your Movement points.Actions: This i found a little off at first but every action has a reaction.. Firing a gun means it needs you to use a reload action, gives you arm fatigue for the rest of the turn lowering accuracy.  Climbing walls needs at the jump points Isn't always guaranteed with a chance of a sprain if you are very unlucky ect. Usually it is best to prepare for the consequences for most actions.UI: I agree with most people... It is a little clunky and not the best.. But when you look past most of its appearance you mostly use Q & E to change action instead of a menu. Regardless it shows everything you need.Ok now for a simple list:Pros:On High graphics settings it looks goodAI is hard and sometimes unforgiving (Well good in my opinion)Soundtrack is fittingOpen maps in most levelsExcellent customizationConsequences for loosing affect appearance of unitsRandomly generated map placementsSome replay abilityUnlocks persist through multiple play throughWays to deal with enemy vary based on your preferred tacticsCons:AI is hard but can predict how they act based on the game modeVery few game modesUI is a bit clunkyMaps look a bit samish even if they are randomly generatedOn low graphics looks appalling compared to most modern gamesDon't always get chance to loot stuffThe game is hard, fun but at times frustrating when it goes from bad to worse. Not always the end of the world but makes progression harder.  Worth it if you like difficult games that seek to destroy you in as many ways as you can.. until you figure out AI tactics but even then still easy to die.I'd give this game a 7 out of 10.. Despite its flaws it has some merit and room to improve.			"

												Where to start?The game is generally good, graphics are alright, nothing to get overly excited about. Game play is good but gets really repetitive really quickly.... A few annoying factors in the game, such as the 'Hit' mechanic, it comes accross as random to me without any real difference between characters or traits or skills. You can still miss on a 95% hit when you really need that hit, yet a 47% chance to hit actually hits! Boogles me at times.Then there are the bugs! I've lost count on the number of times my game has crashed on me, for no apparent reason throwing up a message with the heading 'ops'.... 'Oh, im sorry, did you have an accident there game?' SO to round off, if a Warhammer fan, then get the game, if not a Warhammer fan, then I wouldnt recommend this one.If I had to score this game, I'd give it a 6 out of 10.			"

												I love this game.  Feels like a tactical board game brought to life.  It's got a lot of problems:  It's got quite a few bugs, and some clunky UI and controls.  The learning curve is steep and the tutorials suck.  Parts of the core game design look flimsy:  The game is supposed to be unforgiving, and losing a battle means less xp and permanent injuries making your guys less valuable.  But it doesn't stop you from totally avoiding it with an unfortunate exploit.  Just grab a friend to play against, and cut your internet connection during battle and the game rewards you both with a victory.  Makes it kind of trivial to build up a powerful warband.The objectives are so lame.  I mean, OBJECTIVE, singular.  Always it is to kill the other guys, and collecting loot is sort of a bonus.  It is repetitive, and just assumes that both players will clash somewhere in the middle of the map, or near a big pile of wyrdstone.  Nothing stopping one player from running away forever like a troll, not letting the game end until someone gets bored and forfeits.  IMO the game should also end if all the wyrdstones are collected from the map.  That's like the whole premise of the game anyway.This is definitely a niche game, for those who love tactical board games and have the patience to figure out the mechanics.  It is a lot of fun if you can look past the bugs, clunky UI and controls, and some poor design decisions.			"

												TLDR - Its like a fantasy XCOM but with the difficulty of playing Dark Souls with your toes with zero reward.PROS-Concept and ThemeExcellent 50% praise of devs 50% to the original tabletop. Its an authentic representation thematically.- Party membersCan lose limbs through fighting/grow new ones via warp corruption (see tentacle surprise)CONS- The AnimationsToo long and artificially slow the game down. Gathering warpstone (like a 2nd currency which you HAVE to gather) takes literal years to do and breaks immersion)Risk/Reward is way off - If (and its a big if) you win a battle, you get about 5% of the total loot on the map. That means you either spend the combat aspect of the game doing fetch quests or you fight stupidly close battles for next to no reward.Maps are WAY too large- For real, Ive had games where its taken 6 guys 8 turns to find 1 of 6 dudes on the other team. The AI is massively imba- You know how in XCOM it feels like RNG is both rage inducing and gives you those 'Holy balls how am I still alive?' moments?. Yeah this skipped the second part. Every enemy you fight even the plebs are dead-eye, power-armoured ninjas. They deal dmg that would make an Exocet Cruise Missile blush, their loin cloths are being loaned to the US Army, their weapons have radar guidance systems and either your dudes all fell out of a pub in East Belfast after 16 hours of heavy drinking before coming on the mission or the enemies got spitroasted by The Flash and Quicksilver because good luck hitting any of them. Your guys are BAD- Their attacks are as ferocious as the blind hamster the knitting club keep around for morale. On the point of morale, the void where it should be is conspicious in its absence. The mere suggestion the going is getting tough they (literally) drop everything they own and run for the hills faster than the vegan your friend just introduced you to iforms you of their moral highground. You just spent 20 mins collecting valuable warpstone? ♥♥♥♥ that - Michelle thought she saw a ghost in this haunted city so now we are going to run away and cry on Tumblr. You think you can hit that guy? Nope, the success rate for your guys hitting that dude (who youve surrounded on all sides for a warpstone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) is lower than stunted half blind twins conjoined at the♥♥♥♥♥♥scoring a touchdown at the Superbowl. They take a hit worse than Rihanna and move at a pace that has glaciers feeling oblidged to slow down so they feel like they aren't a drain on society and should be euthanised.			"

Early Access Review
								Early Access leaves me with high expectations of this game and so far the developers have me convinced that all these great promises of theres and more to come are just around the corner!If your on the fence for purchasing this game i would compleatly reccomend doing so! this has been nothing but pure fun for me and its only going to get better! but be warned there be bugs out there! take this early access game with a grain of salt and youre going to be in for a f*ckin great time ill say!EDIT:Since my last review so much more content has been added and the difficulty has been ramped through the roof! :D The AI that used to be a pushover in the first version of the game is no more and now i cling lovingly to the soles of my enemies boots as my teeth are kicked in time and time againI LOVE THIS GAME!!!! If your a fan of Darksouls and Darkest dungeon (but only if you liked the corpse and heart attack system of DD because theres no toggling difficulty in this game you casuals...) then this is a must buy!!!!

												Where to start?The game is generally good, graphics are alright, nothing to get overly excited about. Game play is good but gets really repetitive really quickly.... A few annoying factors in the game, such as the 'Hit' mechanic, it comes accross as random to me without any real difference between characters or traits or skills. You can still miss on a 95% hit when you really need that hit, yet a 47% chance to hit actually hits! Boogles me at times.Then there are the bugs! I've lost count on the number of times my game has crashed on me, for no apparent reason throwing up a message with the heading 'ops'.... 'Oh, im sorry, did you have an accident there game?' SO to round off, if a Warhammer fan, then get the game, if not a Warhammer fan, then I wouldnt recommend this one.If I had to score this game, I'd give it a 6 out of 10.			"

												I love this game.  Feels like a tactical board game brought to life.  It's got a lot of problems:  It's got quite a few bugs, and some clunky UI and controls.  The learning curve is steep and the tutorials suck.  Parts of the core game design look flimsy:  The game is supposed to be unforgiving, and losing a battle means less xp and permanent injuries making your guys less valuable.  But it doesn't stop you from totally avoiding it with an unfortunate exploit.  Just grab a friend to play against, and cut your internet connection during battle and the game rewards you both with a victory.  Makes it kind of trivial to build up a powerful warband.The objectives are so lame.  I mean, OBJECTIVE, singular.  Always it is to kill the other guys, and collecting loot is sort of a bonus.  It is repetitive, and just assumes that both players will clash somewhere in the middle of the map, or near a big pile of wyrdstone.  Nothing stopping one player from running away forever like a troll, not letting the game end until someone gets bored and forfeits.  IMO the game should also end if all the wyrdstones are collected from the map.  That's like the whole premise of the game anyway.This is definitely a niche game, for those who love tactical board games and have the patience to figure out the mechanics.  It is a lot of fun if you can look past the bugs, clunky UI and controls, and some poor design decisions.			"

												TLDR - Its like a fantasy XCOM but with the difficulty of playing Dark Souls with your toes with zero reward.PROS-Concept and ThemeExcellent 50% praise of devs 50% to the original tabletop. Its an authentic representation thematically.- Party membersCan lose limbs through fighting/grow new ones via warp corruption (see tentacle surprise)CONS- The AnimationsToo long and artificially slow the game down. Gathering warpstone (like a 2nd currency which you HAVE to gather) takes literal years to do and breaks immersion)Risk/Reward is way off - If (and its a big if) you win a battle, you get about 5% of the total loot on the map. That means you either spend the combat aspect of the game doing fetch quests or you fight stupidly close battles for next to no reward.Maps are WAY too large- For real, Ive had games where its taken 6 guys 8 turns to find 1 of 6 dudes on the other team. The AI is massively imba- You know how in XCOM it feels like RNG is both rage inducing and gives you those 'Holy balls how am I still alive?' moments?. Yeah this skipped the second part. Every enemy you fight even the plebs are dead-eye, power-armoured ninjas. They deal dmg that would make an Exocet Cruise Missile blush, their loin cloths are being loaned to the US Army, their weapons have radar guidance systems and either your dudes all fell out of a pub in East Belfast after 16 hours of heavy drinking before coming on the mission or the enemies got spitroasted by The Flash and Quicksilver because good luck hitting any of them. Your guys are BAD- Their attacks are as ferocious as the blind hamster the knitting club keep around for morale. On the point of morale, the void where it should be is conspicious in its absence. The mere suggestion the going is getting tough they (literally) drop everything they own and run for the hills faster than the vegan your friend just introduced you to iforms you of their moral highground. You just spent 20 mins collecting valuable warpstone? ♥♥♥♥ that - Michelle thought she saw a ghost in this haunted city so now we are going to run away and cry on Tumblr. You think you can hit that guy? Nope, the success rate for your guys hitting that dude (who youve surrounded on all sides for a warpstone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) is lower than stunted half blind twins conjoined at the♥♥♥♥♥♥scoring a touchdown at the Superbowl. They take a hit worse than Rihanna and move at a pace that has glaciers feeling oblidged to slow down so they feel like they aren't a drain on society and should be euthanised.			"

												Great game, but you need to be into this sort of style of gameplay otherwise you will hate it.CONS- large upfront amount of game mechanics to learn, sometimes the stats pages look like something out of an excel spreadsheet.- Slow gameplay, so if you are into arcade style speed and action then this is not for you.- Difficult and punishing, which is a pro or a con depending on your preference.PROS+ Fantastic atmosphere and Warhammer Lore+ Very deep, if you stick around it will last hundreds of hours before you have seen all the game has to offer.+ Its addictive, in a 'just one more mission!' sort of way.+ Having perma death results in you becoming quite attached to your little soldiers, resulting in you rooting for them in fights and being upset when they die.

												I like tough games, but seriously, this is insane? Dev's need to work on the random seed or something, becaue the player is at an extreme disadvantage. I can get a victory here and there, but it is rare, and leaves no time to gather loot which apparently is required part of the game.My own forces miss attack after attack, while the enemy seems to have a 95% hit rate. The enemy also seems to always hit for 40-50 damage+ and take much much less damage back. Your average soldiers can only take 2 or 3 hits before they are down. Even my hero gets two shotted by a normal soldier with a two hander. (Which is realistic, but not very good when the rolls constantly favor the computer).			"

												I've greatly enjoyed the game, as much for the thematic elements of the warbands of undead, mutants, witch hunters (and so forth) as for the warband campaign and progression system. Fighting around mordheim, completing faction quests  and leveling up and customizing my warband is a lot of fun. I would recommend buying this game! (On sale of course...only ever buy games on sale). My only complaint is that its a little too easy. More on that below. But first, add on about 20 hours to the amount of time I've played; I spent a lot of time playing disconnected from steam, and even when I resynced the hours played didnt update. Go figure.So I dont get people complaining about this game being too hard. Sure, my first warband got wrecked, but after that it got alot easier. Maybe its because I'm an over-cautious player (doing whatever I can to keep my precious, customized, stylized warband from dying), but with my current warbands I win about, um, 100% of the engagements (vs. AI mind you).Yes there is a perma death/injury system, yes there are the wyrdstone deliveries, but they arent crazy difficult if you PLAN around that aspect and position/group your troops accordingly.To those complaining about RNG; no such problem on my end. Sure there are untimely enemy crits, and terrible misses from your party, but nothing about that shouts out ""broken RNG!!"" to me. All to be expected.My only complaint would be that the enemy warband setups are too predictable; in order to have an easier time balancing the strength of your warband vs. the random skirmishing AI warband the developers made it so that your oppsoing enemy will take the EXACT SAME unit slots at you.So if you take 2 heroes, 1 impressive and 3 henchmen, guess what your enemy will bring? 2 heroes, 1 impressive and 3 henchmen. O____OIt takes ALOT of strategy out of the game. No large mobs vs small elite forces. Its always large mobs vs. large mobs, or small elite forces vs. small elite forces. It would make my day if the developers released a patch that changed that. Right now the predictability makes the game too easy.Also, if the developers ever put out a full set of customization options for your warband (like different heads, armor appearances, etc) I would totally get behind that!

												Update:-----------As of yesterday, I managed to connect to a Multiplayer game, so looks like something has been fixed in one of the patches. Thanks devs! I'm still unable to play the game in windows, so I played in WINE after dual-booting.It was a fun game for MP, and I enjoyed the ability to scan around in 3rd person while the opponent was scurrying around trying to sneak up. The turns went fairly smoothly, with no discernible lag between turns.Original review follows.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Every game results in a hard lockup of my PC. I have to hard-power-off every time. Drivers updated, reinstalled, tried all the settings, checked temps yada yada.  Support responded with boilerplate questions and never replied after I provided the info they asked for. I have 400 other games that do not lock up my PC.It does run under WINE in linux (on the same hardware as above) but have been unable to join a friend and play online. It's pretty straightforward but drop a comment if you need help to run in wine.Could have been a great game that I would have sunk some hours into, but  I can't recommend a game that locks up my PC in windows and doesn't work MP in linux.

												Ladies and gentleman, I have played this game for a few hours now, and i really like this game. The single player is challenging in the beggining, and it feels so rewarding seeing your warriors progress. Id give this game full recomendations, but the multiplayer is broken. I organised a Online only tournament with myself and 15 other people, but a third of the time, the game crashes in some way. when the game crashes, both players are punisahed, and can lose players and equipment for it. Even if one persons internet goes out, both warbands suffer. This issue needs to be fixed, because online League formats would make this game 10 times better than it already is. Please please fix these issues			"

								In a game so full of terrarian you'd think the developers would think more about it.A) You can just melee attack through walls and other bits of rubble. You might even be able to do ranged attacks through such terrain as well, I wouldn't know since I've been mostly playing Sisters (a melee army).B) Most of the time the camera is just looking at a wall when someone attacks.Other than that, it also feels very ""Tech Demo"" and not very ""Early Access.""I'm really hoping for big things out of this game, but as it is right now its not worth the money.

												This game is complete and utter garbage for one reason only. The random number generator is broken as all hell in this game.At first I loved this game and thought it was the most accurate conversion of a GW game that I had played, but when all your hard work and tactics is thrown under the bus in every single match its insulting to the player that the Developer is either so inept or so careless that their ""random number"" generator is bias and broken.When your leader has a 75% or more dodge rating and EVERYTHING HITS HIM EVERY TURN, it shows how broken it is. I understand that occasionally you get back luck and bad rolls, but this game consistantly ruins your efforts. Dodges are failed enmasse, and yet when you attack an enemy with an 85% chance to hit and you fail 5 attacks in a row, every turn it demonstrates that the developer has skewed ot the numbers to fail you and favour the AI.This is an enormous deterant to playing seeing as your Warband has to carry from game to game with all its failures and setbacks while the enemy AI gets a fresh team every single match. If this was just a difficulty setting I wouldn't mind so much. If it was bad luck every now and then I wouldn't mind so much. However all the high percentages set in my favour, fail about 80% of the time. Whenever the enemy has a low percent, they seem to succeed 80% of the time.It breaks the game and mean no matter how much effort you put in or how much time you spend learning the mechanics, it means ♥♥♥♥ all. Because its auto set to fail you.\O/   DO NOT BUY THIS BROKEN GAME   \O/			"

There's no exploration, there's no reason to try any subtle tactics, there's no reason to be in the city of Mordheim period. This game would be the same if the warbands met in an open field.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money, I'm requesting a refund.			"

								Coming from a background laden with the likes of Mordheim, Necromunda, Gorkamorka it is safe to say that I am no newbie to the Warhammer universe, albeit somewhat disenchanted with the recent developments at Games Workshop. I was originally thrown into the wargaming hobby whilst young and grabbing up a copy of Space Crusade and Warhammer: Quest and I personally always favoured the Games Workshop adaptations that featured tonnes of ""fluff"", whose being warband campaigns that did not count on you buying the latest or greatest mini's but really becoming immersed into play system that demanded tactics.Over the years Games Workshop has failed to meet the bar with many of its video game adaptations of its franchises. Blood Bowl was an epic example of how to mismananage, annoy and isoloate an entire sub culture of gamers away from your product by failing to meet basic demands.Mordeim: City of the Damned is however a massive step in the right direction! The gameplay is immersive as ever with rich environments and fantastic graphics, the W,A,S,D controls in third-person rather than a strict ""overhead only"" approach layer upon another dimension of interactivity and narration. The actions and cut scenes have been carefully crafted to actually look good! The controls are consistent and easy to use, along with being able to grasp the basic rules for the game.What I must commend Rogue Factor on the most is the balancing of the game. Many players threw the Mordheim original rulebook out of the window, because of many broken atrributes, the favoured the fan moderated and constructed 'Coreheim' rules. Rather than using the broken original rules, or further breaking or basterdising rules to fit, Rogue Factor have balanced this gameplay beautifully, making it a pleasure to play.Please Rogue Factor, once you have completed this, do Necromunda: Tales of the Underhive.

								Mordheim City of the Damned is an excellent game.  Because I have crummy Internet I am not able to download it as quickly as I would like.  However, the patches for the game have been amazing.  I would reccomend it to anyone who likes nitty gritty turn based games.My thoughts on the different warbands:Cult of the Possessed: So far they are my favorite warband to play as.  They have good attacks, but lack in defense.  That is okay considering their henchmen start with two handed axes.  Thier leader starts out with a decent spell and their hero does have the chance of random mutations.Clan Eshin: They are my second favorite to play even though they lack physical prowess.  They are not able to hit very hard, but their leader does start out with a poison weapon.  On the other hand, they are all excellent at dodges from the start making you harder to hit.Sisters of Sigmar: The Sisters of Sigmar are the absolute worst warband to face in my opinion.  I have yet to win a battle against them and they all seem to be overpowered even at low levels.  When I try to play them, they always end up doing awful.  They seem to have a pretty good chance of doing well later on down the road though.Mercenaries of Reikland: I have honestly not played them as I have never been a huge fan of the Empire.  I don't know all that much about them.Overall, the game is very difficult to start, but it the game is very rewarding to players who do well.  The game itself is a little clunky, but it is a very good game.			"

I am NOT ok with selling individual heroes as DLC.Only buy this game if it is on sale, and only buy the DLC if on sale and bundled.It is a shame for a great game to be handled like this, but business needs are being met in a distgusting way.

								One of the better specimens from the recent wave of turn-based tactics games. Has long way to go in terms of content but what is there is very much playable and moderately exciting. What's in the game now is definitely not worth the price tag but if things go the way the developers promise, it should be. It's a cautious recommendation but a recommendation nonetheless.

												Excellent, hard, and honest turn-based strategy game in the vein of XCOM, etc. You take a warband of character classes into a spooky city and engage other warbands. The game allows for wonderful customization of your characters' stats and you can design a particular warband member just so. Then that warband member gets annihilated in combat and needs his leg amputated and you have to rethink your build for him because he can't climb walls anymore. It's an Ironman-mode only game, so there's no coming back from a maneuver, decision, or result. If you aren't thinking about strategy your warband can get wiped easily by the AI, suffer permanent injuries, and you're back to square one and need to hire a few new characters. Do you risk going for loot or a gem and exposing a character to a potential ambush, or do you hide for one round so a few other characters can catch up and add security against a potential engagement? Decisions like that happen on practically every turn, and they add incredible atmosphere to the combat. It's procedural, so every non-story mission is unique and the replayability is fantastic.A hard game at first but you eventually get the hang of things and learn to be patient and think carefully before you act. There is a nice selection of guides written by members of the community that I found invaluable. They cover things like warband management, combat tips, levelling, which skills to train for X builds, etc., and make many aspects of the game much more approchable for new players.			"

												This has the potential to be a really good game - in some ways it is a good game already - and it may well become one in all ways. If it does i'll certainly change my review to positive, but at the moment, despite a lot that's good in the game design, good atmosphere and good graphics, there are some annoying design flaws and some basic necessities lacking.If i could i'd have given it a neutral review at the moment, as a i like a lot of things about it, despite being frustrated by several others, but Steam only allows positive or negative.The atmosphere is good and some design choices are good too - e.g being unarmoured gives less protection from damage if you're hit, but it also gives a higher chance of dodging attacks - and of climbing and jumping successfully.The AI is pretty good - not perfect - but about as good as I am at any rate.However some other design choices do not work.The amount of equipment characters can lose from being knocked out in battle is excessive, as are some of the permanent injuries. You can play say 8 missions with a warband in the single player campaign, win 7 heavily, then lose so much equipment from one defeat that your campaign is over.(EDIT : Above not entirely true - once you've played enough of the game, even if you lose campaigns, you get Veteran Skills for all your warbands, which include some giving you a 5% chance over so much time of getting free armour, but still, armour is rarer than it should be imo)This is even more so, as , even if you do have money, the shop frequently has literally nothing to buy in it - and even when it does have anything to buy, sometimes very little, and  rarely much armour.The penalties for abandoning even a single player campaign mission are often equally campaign-ending. I abandoned one mission and practically my whole gang were injured as a result, even though none had even lost any significant number of hitpoints in the part of the mission i played.One hero ended up losing an arm, while my only archer developed megalomania, meaning he could no onger use missile weapons - and he was pretty high level at this point.This is made even worse by the lack of any save game function in for single player campaign - so if you get one disastrous mission you can't reload from before it and try again, you have to start the campaign from scratch with a new warband.The game has included the variety of set ups from the original tabletop miniatures game, but, while these worked well for the tabletop game, they don't all work in the computer game. For instance when one side is deployed inside buildings in the tabletop game, they can leave them quickly and easily in a single turn. But some of the computer game buildings are confusing mazes that can take a while to get out of at all.The overhead map you can switch the view to in battles now makes it a bit closer to the tabletop game - but unfortunately the map is sometimes misleading, showing what are actually rows of houses that can't be entered or crossed to look like they are a drop or have gaps them in - and this can result in defeat in some missions because you just can't find how to get half your warband to where the fighting is.The 'ambush' stance in battles allows for ""ambushers"" to ""ambush"" while standing in the open. I've even had enemies run up to within two feet of me in plain sight in the open, go into ambush stance - and when i move the two feet to attack them they ""ambush"" me , attack first and cause my character a ""surprised"" penalty. This encourages sitting back and waiting over attacking, as if you stand back and ambush, you will almost certainly get all the first blows in, whereas if you attack first, the enemy will often get the first blows in using ambush.The zones of control around your own warband's members can often block the movement and attacks of other members of your own warband, which is pretty bizarre and annoying at times in narrow streets. Sometimes you can get round this by climbing up nearby buildings and moving some warriors round to attack the enemy from behind - and this is fine. Other times this is impossible though, depends on the luck of the randomly generated maps.While you can increase the stats of members of your gang by just getting experience, for some reason getting skills from experience also requires crazy amounts of gold that make giving characters skills not practical, which seems like a bad design choice too.The interface for equipping your warband members is strange and not intuitive in some ways - e.g to buy armour for a warband member from their equipment screen you need to click on the equipment slot . then on the shop, then the equipment slot that piece of armour or weapon goes in again.Probably even most of these problems would be ok at least for the single player campaign though, if it had a save game function you could use before a mission.

												Turn-based squad strategy RPG in the Warhammer (not 40k!) universe. Very grimdark, lots of gruff voice actors trying super hard. If you've played any game in either Warhammer or 40k you know what I'm talking about.The game is very atmospheric, but extremely light on story. 90% of your missions will be randomly generated, and of those I never saw one that presented something new or interesting. Just a cobbled-together mash of buildings, hallways, and annoying dead ends. Randomization adds very little to the game, only changing the map and team spawn points. The mission is always to simply kill everyone on the other team, or deal enough morale damage to get them to rout.Typical for the genre, chance plays an enormous role in the outcome of your missions. Because this is so gritty and realistic (a ""hardcore experience"" as the game puts it) your guys will get knocked out, often, to things you could not possibly prevent. Party members who fall in combat have a chance to die instantly, or receive a permanent debilitating injury. To me, that's as good as them being dead. I'm not carting around some guy with -25% move speed who can't climb over walls for the rest of the game.So, obviously you don't want that. Any party member who's left alone can and will be killed in one turn if he encounters 2 enemies, or one powerful one. I found the most effective, and boring, strategy was to thus keep my whole team in arm's reach of each other at all times. The game has no time limit mechanics so there's really no reason to not play that way.Lots of little annoying things too. The tutorial system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Information is vomited on the screen, literally dozens of statistics that no normal human could parse meaningful decisions out of. Enemy turns go by at a snail's pace, even with ""Speed up enemy turns"" checked. Eventually I just had my phone out for the inexplicable 45+ seconds of enemy turns that I couldn't even see because of fog of war. There's no *sell all* button for your resources. Traps litter the floor of the map but you can see them with the naked eye so they're pretty obnoxious ""gotchas"" more than anything deadly or interesting.Nothing I've ♥♥♥♥♥ed about here, by itself, makes Mordheim unplayable, but together, it's really unfun. I don't even mind the RNG sometimes screwing you over; I played XCOM on Ironman mode because I enjoy that thrill of not knowing what could happen. So a game that forces that upon you seems like it'd be right up my alley. I really wanted to like this game! That's why I stuck with it for as long as I did, despite the flaws. In the end, I just couldn't be bothered to bring my team of crippled lowbies into yet another randomly-generated massacre.			"

												The actual game is AWESOME!!! Like the mechanics. The world. The way they worked the tabletop movement to computer game.BUT!!The UI is so horrible that in the first 10 minutes I had cursed it 3 times, and instantly had better ways to do it. Simple ways.Good things:- Clear stats. What should affect what.-The way they made turn- and stat- based game in to this animated thing.- Mordheim. Well done.Not:- Tutorials. I spend 2 hours reading, playing and listening that. I'm vereran WH fantasy and Mordheim player... I got the idea... but because of the UI, I really struggled to understand the computer game mechanics. But 2h in tutorials... yeah not gona float in mainstream.- User Interface. UI for short. I don't even know where to begin! This is so failed.-- Every information piece is scattered to the sides. There is no focus to the relevant information. 2/3 of the screen is wasted on a little model that doesn't give you any information. I have no idea what is relevant.-- Any logical keybinding or hotspot does not exist. You keep pressing buttons and expecting certain result... but nothing happends. Feels like actual playtesting has been skipped, because only a masocist could play this.-- Deployment in scenarious is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ In tactical mode (bird eye) you can see the spots that you can place your models, but you can't place your models in that view!! Makes sense right?! You can only place your models in the gameplay third person view. So you have to switch between, the gameplay view and the tactical view, about a 30 times when placing your troops. In the third person view you have no idea where you are ofcourse. And it doesn't help that even if know who/what model you are placing, because the UI doesn't really tell you in the beginning. I couln't figure out how to rename my troops so I could tell them apart. Again failure of the UI.Honestly. There has to be someone in their QA who had doubts? Someone who said this is quit hard to pickup??If you where in a position to change the keybindings, controls, and UI you had to be bonkers to not say something? I love the francise. Steam says that I have played 6 hours... 2 of those are from early access/beta. I still not have completed the first mission. That should say something.I want this game to succeed. I can see the problems and even how to fix them. What I can't see is, why didn't this♥♥♥♥♥♥get fixed before release?			"

												I'm a big fan of the Warhammer universe so I really wanted to like this game, but it seems like the developers can't tell the difference between a rewarding and challenging experience, and just cranking the difficulty up until the game is just straight up unfair. It is not fun to lose over and over just because the game says so. And there is little to no skill actually involved in the combat, it's all dice roles. I can't recommend this game but it is something I will keep my eye on in the hopes that some balance is brought to it.			"

Early Access Review
								The idea is really great and hopefully when it's done being developed we'll realize a really fun game...However, most the time you don't see the player's actions that you control.There's nothing indicating where all your players are in reference to eachother.There's nothing showing you what the topography or area location has in it so you know where you want to go or hide or defend or setup ambush or anything - essentially cannot strategize at all.  Literally, at all... And there seems to be a glitch as to when your player gets to have turns because I just played a game where I didn't get to move one of my guys the entire match and he was just getting hit over and over even though I had parry enabled.No one plays it or is willing to wait for matchmaking (if it actually works I don't know) to come to fruition because I never found a human player to play against and ended up just playing AI.There's no tutorial of any sort or direction on how the GUI or skill tree works or anything like that so you just kinda figure it'll come after you gain experience somehow or something... no real way to know how to do anything until you hit buttons and try stuff out and decide that something did what you thought it was suppose to do.Plus one of my players was stuck in a building all by himself.  There was an invisible wall where the staircase was and a door behind that wouldn't open so one of my players was just sitting in a room by himself.  I don't know if the AI could engage by coming to him because I couldn't force myself to play after 15 minutes or so and I realized it was a fruitless endeavor.Don't buy it yet.  Make them develop it before handing them your cash.  It's definitely NOT worth it right now.			"

												Well, I went back and tried the game again to see if anything had been fixed.  It's still the same.  Unplayable.There is a lot to like about this game:  atmosphere and graphics being the best selling points.Unfortunately, there is an awful lot to dislike about this game:1) the RNG is a joke.  The 2nd time I quit it was after 16 consecutive to hit rolls of over 90.  That's 16 in a row, people.  One of the biggest mstakes the dev team made was putting the actual die results on the screen. It simply allowed me to see EXACTLY how awful the RNG truly is.   Over the course of 5 games I tracked every die result for each type of action.  I saw very little difference between action types such as ""to hit"" vs. ""climbing.""  But I wanted to track if there was a difference.  After averaging my ""to hit"" rolls, I found an average roll of over 80.  That's not even an attempt at randomicity.  IF you are the kind of person who enjoys constant failure at easy tasks...then this game is for you!2)  the variety of warbands is unacceptable.  I am a long time tabletop Mordheim player and loved the variety in the warbands. Here we get 4.  The Sisters have been solely relagated to a melee warband (they removed their sling option) and also removed perhaps the coolest aspect of the Sister...the steel chains.  Oh, well.    The Mercenary warband is one that wasn't even an actual warband in the original game, and here is just a watered down version of mish-mash of all of the other warbands that existed.  The possessed are unplayable becasue the mutations are random and one cannot actually plan/develop a warband because the random mutations ruin warband members so thoroughly that the only answer is to fire them and start over. 3)  skills are just a waste.  Pick a single attack and rank it.  Ranking more than one is a waste of time as you will never use it.  The passive skills are MUCH more useful.  Most skills are completely useless since you have limited slots for skills.  As a result, some skills that you may find quite useful ...such as helping you climb, will NEVER be taken becasue they are not worth the slot they use up.  A a result, at least half the skills could be removed from the game and it would have no significant effect on gameplay at all.4) the compensation for a good AI is simply the fact that every warband you face is better than yours.  Generally, a lot better.  More hits, better damage, faster; everything.  As many have said in other reviews, the game has a steep learning curve, but is not as impossible (in general) as many here seem to feel.  BUT, the huge advantage the AI has in strength, makes this game a series of gambles more than anything...pull the lever and hope you win and aren't ambushed.  Which leads me to the next thing...5) Ambush.  This breaks the game entirely.  When you are ambushed, the AI starts in range, usually goes first (due to the fact that they are simply better than your warband) and can take out 2-3 members of your warband before you even get to make an action.  This is essentially the game devs implementing a feature to knock the player down a few pegs by randomly killing some of their warband.  Such fun, let me tell you.   Spend hours upon hours building your warband only to be ambushed and  permanently lose 2-3 members of your warband before you even get to make an action.  Such awesomeness.    Which leads me to the SINGLE RNG factor that succeeds more than it fails...6)  When your Warband is being utterly destroyed, you have a MUCH greater chance of making your route check than ANY OTHER ROLL YOU EVER TRY.  You will miss attack roll after attack roll and fail all of your ALL ALONE checks, but when it comes time to make that 20% chance to NOT route...you make it.  Thus ensuring you get to hang around for at least one more round and risk losing even more warband members.  The ONLY way I can explain this is that it is a purposeful inclusion in the game to ensure the utter destruction of your warband.In conclusion, I think the devs are sadists.  I can only imagine them laughing themselves silly as players continually struggle against their plot to kill them at every turn.  They probably lay bets on how many players have launched their mouse against the wall in utter frustration. Additionally, I think they are lazy.  Dudes, just make a better AI...don't take the cheap way out and simply overpower the player with overpowered adversaries and rigged die rolls, that's such a chicken**** way out it makes me sick to my stomach.  You are expecting people to give you money for your product; have enough respect for your customer to put the work in that is needed to justify the money you are making.  If that's too much to ask, you should find a different line fo work.			"

												I really wouldn't recommend this for anyone - I bought it pre-release and kinda looooved it! Just a few un-fun things like getting ambush on a mission you normally would've facerolled - Just to get 3/4th of your warband MURDERED before even being able to move one model. Another thing is, now it's vastly pay-to-win if you want to play pvp or even have a chance to play the game the way it's balanced for.I don't condone every little thing they come up with being pay-to-get DLC when you've already paid 40€ for the friggin' game - It should just be part of the game you boughtAll in all, I'm a HUGE Warhammer fan - I LOVED Mordheim tabletop! I even really enjoyed this pre-release! But pay-to-win and pay-for-more-powerful-than-anything-heroes is just lame and shouldn't get any more support			"

The Good:- The graphics are pretty decent- Environment is great and you can feel the dark and despair around you- Rogue likeThe Bad:-The combat is atrocious since the turn/attacking systems is completely random and doesnt follow any pattern- Steep learning curve- Confusing management and wyrdstone bartering-When climbing/dropping between floors you have the chance to take damageI was expecting a game like Xcom but was not greeted well. Overall I didn't really enjoy this game (6/10).			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but 12 hours is the most I can do.It's really clunky. Useless animation of your crew reloading and taking trap damage and looting stuff take way too long.In the end, I think you spend most of your time waiting to be able to play, which is even more frustrating when you're loosing.Then, It's supposed to be a hard game, whith no ability to reload saves. It could be fine, but there is still some awful stupid bugs that can make you lose, and it's hard to see your captain dying for a bug.My biggest concern is how hard it is to read the map and make precise positionning. It is supposed to be a tactical game, but it's nearly impossible to make the tactical part works. Sometimes it ""feels"" like your tank is blocking the door, but it is not. Some time it feels like there is a path, but it is not, and as you climbed a wall, you cannot get back. Sometime this house feel safe, but there is a ""hidden"" (hidden because you have to fully explore to see it, which can take 4 to 5 turns ) passage on the third flood after four stairs and bridges, and the IA kowns it, and use it.In short, you're often punished because the game isn't good enough to give you the information you need to play well, and I hate it.To conclude, after trying lots of differents things, and looking for advice on internet, it always end up with the same technique : make a bottleneck in a closed room and defeat all your opponent in a 3vs1 fight. Every map is only ""how can I end up to this situation fast enough ?""Anything else is too dangerous, and you will get punished hard. Difficulty is fine when it force you to get better, but it's not the case here. It only force you to make a new game when you're not lucky enough.			"

												NOTE: My hours played should be far more than shows because I've mostly played this game offline.I REALLY wanted to like this game, and for periods I would have quite a bit of fun with it.  It mixes several things I really like: (1) Turn-based combat; (2) good graphics; and (3) a 3D Map.  But I'm about to uninstall.My primary issue is COMBAT:- You want victories to be as clean as possible, meaning that none of your troops get put out of action (lose all their HP).  That's fine, but the ""strategy"" required to avoid such ruins the game.- The RNG of whether you (or an enemy) hits or misses a swing is far too important.  I don't mind an unforgiving game (where its very possible to lose characters or die) but when the unforgiving element is tied heavily to RNG, that's a problem.- The enemy often has more (or stronger) troops that you do.  They will swarm on you really quickly once they find you.  So if you go out and try to collect loot on the map (fun) you expose your troops to getting pounced upon and dying (not fun).  The best tactic is often to ignore loot and set up a very defensive position and simply wait until the enemy finds you (not fun).- Some maps force your units to be split apart from each other, either randomly or by choice.  In any event, its quite frequent for some of your troops to be separated near an enemy.  Once they jump on you, you can't really effectively run away.I think those are enough points to give you my general impression. "

												I really tried to like this, and I looked at forums and suggestions for play but I really cannot recommend this at all.  I know the frustration of RNG linked games, like for instance Blood Bowl; they can make you howl with rage, but as long as you can still have fun I don't mind that at all - so I love Blood Bowl despite the fact your best player can die trying to run in a score with a 80%+ chance of success without any opponents near them.  This game has that frustration but without any fun.  It is dull, frustrating and repetitive.  I gave up thinking of reasons I should give it another chance and just removed it.  Not worth wasting my time, and I would suggest yours.			"

												Mordheim is a merger between two of my favorite things, tactical strategy and warhammer fantasy.  Mordheim should be the game that I spend 100+ hours playing, and mucho dinero buying all the DLC. Instead it is infuriating beyond belief. My complaints first:Tactical game? -- has no functional top down view, no functional grid, nothing to help chart pathways, lay ambushes, plan charges, nothing. Ambushes often times do not trigger, for reasons unknown to me. Sometimes my warband can charge engaged opponents, sometimes not, seems completely random. I've found my warband stuck in poor situations too often, due to not being able to gauge distances, etc... Inventory-- is a total joke. Small items do not stack, WTF???? Bob loots 3 coins from a body. Bob gets 5 coins from a chest. Bob has 8 coins, right. No Bob has 3 inventory slots and two of them are occupied by 3 coins and 5 coins. Now Bob previously picked up a total of 27 coins. These 27 coins all fit in one inventory slot, but either Bob is too slow to put all his coins in one slot, or...Same thing with wyrdstones. Small fragments take the same space as clusters, which are 10 x the size? You also can't equip anything you pick up. The helmet you just picked up, which you have a place for, on your head, nope no putting it there, that'll have to wait till after the mission.  Gameplay-- is slow, with unnecessary animations. Opposing warbands are really aggressive, their only tactic is to swarm. Quest goals are sometimes vague and can take forever to figure out, or the quest will just randomly end, regardless of wether you are able to complete the objectives, or not. And your typical gather wyrdstone quest, goes like this. 3-5 rounds of exploring, looting, gathering. You get noticed by the other warband. They swarm your warband. One leader/hero or another falls. Morale check. Quest over. And this happens over and over again. RNG-- Game uses rng which can get stuck, causing your warband to suffer, sometimes permanent damage. I just finished a match where the roll was 90 for four consecutive attacks. I lost the objective, due to my hero falling to a zombie with 10 wounds left. Seriously, the zombie has time to destroy my hero, while two other henchmen miss all their attacks. Hero falls, zombie loots the token I took from the other warbands hero, I finally get a shot in on the zombie, morale check and quest over. No objective for you. My compliments:Warband develpoment -- Customization on every member of the warband. You can tweak each member of your warband to make them specific, dynami, and unique. There are almost too many customization choices available, which means you can really spend time and geak out. Landscape-- Mordheim is Warhammer fantasy to a T. It's brutal, trap filled, landscape in ruin. Basically Warhammer fantasy. Mechanics-- Not fully a plus in my book, but I do like that the warband can do maneuvers and attacks. Different maneuvers use movement points, attacks use offensive points, etc...I don't know if any of the issues I have with the game will ever be fixed, or if anyone with the ability to mod or fix some of this stuff will. I hope that happens. Like I said, Mordheim should be the game that occupies way too much of my life, except that it isn't.			"

												I want to like this game... I really do. I gave it a big chance, tried each warband, played it pretty hard.. But it's massively let down by terrible balancing and lack of saving... My game was ruined at Act 1 scene 4, after building a solid gang, I was progressing across the bridge when the Chaos Ogre on next to no health, Stunned the main story character then killed him in 2 blows from full health.. Mission over I lose? all my characters take wounds which ruins them, I lose all my magic equiptment... Seriously 3 BS Dice rolls in a row and may as well start over.. Why would you not give a save option? Seriously it's 2016.. you have an ok game with a terrible mechanic ruining it.Add to this... Terrible balancing means camping/Turtleing is by far the best option, kite an enemy, kill them, rinse and repeat.I await the downvotes from the insane hardcore lovers.. ""oh you just don't get it"" or some such nonsense.. Terrible mechanics don't equal hardcore they equal terrible design descions...Edit - It's not even difficult for the developers to fix. Offer a single player mode (so saving can't be exploited for multiplayer) disable the multiplayer for warbands created for singleplayer, and allow the player to save the game, it's clearly saved after every single characters move.  Just add saving/loading in camp. Then people can re fight bad fights.. Suddenly the game is less merciless and enjoyable. Balancing the battles however might take a bit more work. At present the AI seems ridiculously over powered in 1 on 1 situations.			"

												Was a really good game that had value both to more harcore players and to more casual players (although it required some kind of cheaty tactics) but they caved to the hardcore players and removed the ability to save scum. While I understand why people wouldn't want this in the game but I didn't see any reason they could have left the option in the game for those of us who wanted it. Haven't played the game since, waste of moneyedit: Went back to play this game again to see if it still was just as unfun as it was when I played it last and I confirm if you don't like games that just punish you for even booting them up then don't get this game. I played one mission and already regretted even the time I spent downloading it. If you just like the setting then I would grab Vermintide, it's a much better game and while challenging can be actually fun with a little investment (It has its own problems but they are not as severe, and the developers have worked to improvbe on them). If you want a warhammer tactical game grab Total War Warhammer (although I would suggest getting it on sale, it's not quite worth the full price). Maybe if you're a very particular kind of gamer than you can derive some kind of enjoyment from this game, but the developers made a ""design decision"" to alienate a majority of prospective customers and that's probably why this game barely gets a few hundred players a day. Sad but true			"

								In its current build I wouldn't buy it...There is no single player to learn the game.  The tutorial isn't much help (praying/looting features aren't implimented).So what is left is 3 factions to choose for 1 on 1 fighting.What really is left to pick is 1 faction that you outfit with guns and 2 handers to take down any who are close and hurt them before they get to you...Yes some tatics can help but honestly there is currently only one real choice to play PvP atm.  They have talked about changing up the ranged gun to hit when people get close in future patches, but there is a long way to go before this gets anywhere fast...  I'll check back in a month and update my review again, but at the moment it feels about as much fun as a kick in the groin..			"

								iam sorry to say but they XXXXed it up...they didnt make a 1:1 conversion like bloodbowl...which would be perfect(like bloodbowl) they made a new game thats not realy mordheim. this hole hitpoint and hide/dodge stuff is not the mordheim we expected.the first time i saw the game i bought it and got disapointed..i hope theys make a classicmode like in bloodbowl to fix it and let us play mordheim with their nice graph but the original tabletop system and rules on pc. THAT would be a great game..so its just another 08/15 failgame.please guys: change the game to the original rules..it would be fine and balance wouldnt be a problem. with your actual  combatsystem there wont be balance like in the tabletop game.so if you want mordheim for pc: dont buy it. its simply not mordheim :(hope to see some changes soon!

												I expected text. I expected numbers. I expected complexity and I even expected difficulty. I cannot recommend this game.The setting is good. The intro-cinematic sets the scene brilliantly and left me eager to dive into the mysterious city of the damned. The graphics are good and the atmosphere is created through them, even if the musical score is somewhat repetitive. Unfortunately, the illusion started to wear thin on the race-selection screen and, after several missions, the complete lack of any form of story was quite apparent. Without a story to speak of, all that remained was the strategy game-play itself and, sadly, it is awful.The strategy game-play is scuppered by the user interface which is abominable. Text flashes on the screen, containing vital feedback and numbers, and even though the game is a turn-based one, you still miss things because it disappears before you can read it - most noticeably when effects and spells trigger or during your opponent's turn! This is simply inexcusable - a scrollable text console of past dice-roll outcomes and effect numbers would have been more functional than the fleeting semi-transparent U.I. overlays that Mordheim relies upon.The controls are also pathetic. There are no mouse-and-keyboard controls at all – the left and right mouse buttons act only as pseudo-buttons, keyboard keys as more buttons and, together, these basically replicate a console controller. The mouse pointer, itself, is hardly utilised. Expect console-style inventory management and lists and lists and lists. To select a parry action, for example, you do not click a parry button or press a parry key. Instead, you use Q or E to scroll through all available actions until you get to ""parry"" and press the single action button. You have to scroll all the way, every time. To find out whether you have an ""Aim"" action available, you have to scroll through every available action, reading each one, to see if it is in the list. It's hopeless.Additionally, on the user-interaction side, the concept of a party-based strategy game with over-the-shoulder third-person movement is simply laughable. To see an overview of the situation - vital for any sort of strategic planning - you have to open a map view in which everything is represented symbolically, the height-levels of the terrain are inscrutable and no commands can be issued. To issue commands, you return to the over-the-shoulder perspective in which you can't see much at all and the game controls like a regular third-person game. This is extremely awkward to use, accurately. Why the developers thought this was preferable to a click-to-move, click-to-select scheme with a proper pannable and zoomable camera has only one possible explanation: can't click with a controller!Mordheim's penultimate failing is its complete lack of respect for the player's time and patience. I appreciate slow games and long games and games that reward a time-investment. I do not appreciate games that consist more of waiting than of playing and, in Mordheim, you spend well over 50% of your play-time staring at the message: ""Waiting for opponent's turn."" Why can't the opponent's turn be simulated near-instantly, as fast as my CPU can do so, when I can't even see the opponent-character that's acting? Time is also wasted by pointless animation for non-actions - for instance, the silly one that plays every time you select ""Overwatch"" - something that should be instant because it only has an effect in the next turn, if at all.Ultimately, however, Morheim fails to answer the most important question of all: ""Why should I care?"" After playing for a few hours, I realised that I simply didn't have any attachment to my warband or to the goals of the mission or to the gear I had scavenged or to the future of the game - the game simply neglected to make me care... certainly, it didn't make me care enough to see past the abominable U.I. and pathetic controls, or to invest the boredom-time waiting for my opponent's turn.

												This game is too hard.  The original Mordheim (and Necromunda etc like it) were tabletop games where both sides were humans and most importantly 'Used the same dice'.  Here the computer has one loaded set against yours.  Before people cry 'RNG' I have seen that in other games - even games based on other tabletop games by Games Workshop, and at least its generally fair even if you have a bad game sometimes.  But here when my character misses 3 '90% hits' in a row, and his one hits with 3 '60% hits' in a row - and it happens almost every game - I call that cheating not 'RNG'.  When this happens in 'every battle' then it goes beyond a joke, and so I have decided to uninstall this game today.  A shame really - I enjoyed the seeming difficulty to start with.  But there a difference between a difficult game (which I enjoy) and a cheating opponent (which I do not) - and there are better ways for a developer to make a game hard than loaded dice!  Not even remotely recommended - 2/10			"

								Very promising turn-based tactical battles.Visually looks good.More in-depth review when game is farther along, many things are marked ""coming soon"" at this point.Quick update: there is now single-player campaign system and it seems very interesting :)You recruit characters to warband between missions, equip them, level up, healing and so forth. The campaign really is promising in that there is depth and results of each mission will carry to affect further missions (do you have plenty of new people or experienced veterans, how good their condition is etc.).One thing that might be good to see is some kind of initial placement of your own warband and/or select their placement. As it is there is sometimes the problem that some characters are in a bad position and before your turn can't do anything about that. Perhaps something is planned already but we'll see.So good progress in development. And as said before, there is depth and challenge to keep you interested in the same way classics of the genre keep you interested.I'll update review as I have a chance to learn more.			"

												I wish I could recommend the game. Sadly, though, I can only review based on what I experienced.I tried to run the game on Windows 10 x64, i5-4670K, 8GB RAM, R9 290. I found performance to be quite shocking for the visuals presented, but I guess this is not inherently something to fault the game for, the system requirements are shown to be quite high, and there are screenshots.If, however, there are also visual artifacts popping on the screen (I googled, and apparently this is an AMD-side problem that the developers of Mordheim have no influence over) and your first experience of actually playing is waiting for the AI to end its turn for 5 minutes...it's not a good first impression. Let's not talk about the first impression of the warband screen.Due to the visual problems (and high demand on GPU, higher than titles released this month) I'll sadly have to refund, it's quite unplayable for me. All in all, I sadly can not recommend this if you own an R9 series GPU.			"

												Ok, this is my first review and it is worth my time to write about this game which is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥in my opinion.For me this game is punishing me all the time without even slightly rewarding me for anything. It seems like the developers were thinking ""oh look, our game is so hard and so challenging and most of the time we thought about ways to penalize you, so we must have a really great game, people like that!""Trust me dear developers, no they don't. I really liked games like Dark Souls which were challenging and hard, but also rewarding and you really had a pleasure to win after multiple deaths on the same boss. Dark Souls didn' t miss the one and most important thing that you did, you should have fun playing a game, afterall thats the only reason why you start to play a game, no?But let me start and say why. I'm sure I did something wrong on the first mission but god forbid. why shouln't I on my first day playing this game. What happend on the first story mission:1) I wasted 5 hours of my life without any progress or enjoyment2) Monsters started the first round and ganged my hero (2 x 48 hp hits) so he was almost dead (he is ok equiped, breast plate, helmet etc.. how am I supposed to finish the mission with one of my best players almost dead from the start of the mission??3) I had to play that mission two time to know how to place my party in the sewers for the Spinetaker rat there which is killing my people in one round4) I managed to kill all in the sewers with only loosing one player and placed 7/10 barrels there (really I have to place a frigging 10 barrels, why not make it 50???)5) So I thought ok, no problem I will go back and take another 3 barrels with me, but what happend? of course 2 more rats as reinforcements appeared.6) After killing those two rats, three more appeared. At the end I managed to kill a total of 9 rats.7) But of course they kept coming... why? I can't tell, I guess I would have to ask those genius developers of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game8) Of course at some point all was over and my main character had a 5 day penalty, that means there is no reason to try the mission again for 5 days, resulting in failing the shipping request which will result in even more penaltiesSo, my first experience with this game was not only frustrating but I just felt messed with by the developers, thats really why I'm so mad about this♥♥♥♥♥♥here. Spending hours and loosing all at the end without any progress, with only frustration, please tell me why should I play your ♥♥♥♥ing game??Edit: Oh, and as I see all the weapons of my characters are gone also, rating my party useless. Hehe this is all so ridiculous, it really starts to get funny now for me.Edit: Ok, I played my warband a bit further. Recovered from the penalties, won some missions, was ably to fulfill the shipment penalty request of 167 weight. I stayed on the normal missions like suggested, actually my warband was in a good shape. Today I'm really done with this game after giving it really a looong chance that it didn't deserve from the start, and will finally uninstall it.Additional negatives:.) On many maps your party is spread all over the place making it impossible for you to plan tactically but just try to find the fastest path to group them together..) You have no idea how to navigate on this map. Is there really an exit in that building or will you find a magically closed door that you are for no reason unable to open..) It seems like the rats which I encouter often can walk over half the map in one turn giving them a tremendous advantage to form together and zerg single targets killing them in the first turn. I would say in those missions the advantage of the AI is 80:20 from the start. In addition self deploy just does not always work. No one knows why..) When the enemy is low you magically start to miss (I don't speak about dodge/parry). That is a proven fact for me. It is like that. Even when you have 88-93% hit chance, if an enemy is low on health you will start to miss a lot. If someone says otherwise, they need to go back to school. That is fact, it is cheating..) Some missions you will lose right from the first round and you can do nothing about it, just nothing. That is not how a tacticall game should work. This is making it look hard or unforgiving when it is just bad design and game mechanics..) You can not use the weapons or armour that you obtained after a mission. Really there is almost no loot in this game and when you find some, you are not allowed to use it because it is from a different warband. Really? You will not be able to use the poison swords from the rats or the hammer from the sisters, because the developers miss the animations? Give me a break, or some more for this game, please..) I could really go one but I'm losing interest....Who ever reads this, trust me, stay away from this game and take any other turn based game instead. Trust me, I'm not ranting or lying, just trust me.			"

I love X-Com so it's not like I've never played an RNG based game before.-The characters all look inbred (seriously, why would they make every character a mouth breathing Mr. Potato Head?)-Enemies can somehow jump the whole map in one turn to attack you three times in a row yet if you try out that character they can barely cross the street and then miss the enemy with your 1 attack-Save system is absolutely horridLucky I got this in the humble monthly so I don't feel too ripped off, mainly thanks to Dragons Dogma			"

Posted: December 12, 2015
												Mordheim: City of the DamnedI’ve always loved table top games and played a little Warhammer 40k back in the day, and I’m a huge fan of 40k themed games, but I never really got into the classic Warhammer setting.  This was my first real experience both with the classic Warhammer setting and Mordheim, and I love it.The gameplay feels like how a tabletop conversion with great graphics should, and at first there isn’t a whole lot to fights – knock them out before they knock you out.  As the game picks up you gain levels, new units, items, skills, and enchantments and things start taking off.  Skills and items sets, along with unit placement and scavenging, becomes a huge part of every encounter.  If you get far enough, you can even unlock some units from another faction for more diversity and options.As many people have discussed, the game is brutally unforgiving.  Think XCOM on Ironman and one of the hardest settings – as much as I wish I had the option to turn off “Ironman” in this game, it’s built in.  The Random Number Generator (RNG) is more forgiving than it used to be, but people who are “perfectionists” will quickly find themselves stressed at all the things they cannot control.  You will miss with a 95% chance to hit, either because you rolled a “1” or because they dodged.  You will also get hit when your guy has “135%” chance to dodge incoming attacks.  And that’s the beauty of a true table top conversion.  Even gods have brain farts.The weakest aspects of the game, at this point, is balancing and AI – and they Venn diagram into one another where the weakness of the game is concerned (for me, at least).  While each faction does something a little better than the other, the units are mostly the same across the board with the only real exception being Impressives and the Chaos faction’s large number of Fear/Terror/Alone immunities.  The AI also leaves something to be desired.  I often find that 1 or 2 of the enemies in a fight get stuck on walls, in doorways, or on stairs – especially common for the larger Ogre, Rat Ogre, and Chaos Spawn Impressives.  This is great for the player because it means less to manage, but it is also frustrating – it makes victories feel cheap, keeps you from fulfilling optional bounty objectives (as it is often the bounty targets who get stuck!), and you never know when that guy is going to decide to stop derping into a wall and join the fight.  Another problem is the way the AI will often bee-line for you - which means that Heroes, Leaders, and Impressives (that don’t get stuck) are the first you run into, which also means they’re the first of the enemies to go down before the henchman can support them if you’re patient and set up proper ambush points.  The way the game “balances” the poor AI decision making and pathing is by simply making them stronger than you.  In a “normal” fight, the easiest on the map, enemies have more wounds (hit points) and hit harder.  It scales up with difficulty; the hardest missions simply have units with 40% more wounds and damage on top of their guys having more skills and better stats.  What this means is that you will never have an even match-up against the AI; you’re always expected to out play them as you’re never on equal terms.Despite the issues above, the developers are intent on polishing their game.  They are already working on improving the AI and making other adjustments as/when the community brings up issues.  The game has a lot of potential for growth as the Warhammer world is huge, with tons of units and factions that could be included, as well as more cosmetic options for people who are really into the customization aspect.  I look forward to seeing what the developers do and I hope to see more games like this, especially a Warhammer 40k type!			"

												This is a rough tough game and I love it. + It doesn't baby you like ♥♥♥♥♥ console games.  When you make mistakes you will be punished (sometimes severely) permanently.  BUT it has a decent set of tutorial missions to ease you in and get you and your warband on your way.+ If you are a  squad-level strategy fan you'll probably like it.  It's similar to XCOM, Blood Bowl, and Space Hulk Ascension if you've played any of those.+ It's original.  I love that the devs took risks on this and I think it paid off.+ The graphics are certainly not AAA, but they did a good job of making you feel like you're roaming the twisted streets of the city of the damned.There are some downsides for sure:- Currently loading screens are almost 1 min, and I suspect it has quite a few memory leaks.  Hopefully this will improve with patches.- The 3rd person persepective really detracts from the strategy nature of the game.  It's very difficult to navigate your team around the multi-level streets without constantly flicking over to the map.  I wish they'd built the game more around top-down perspective.  Having said this I can see why they chose to get you down into the streets where the action is.- Alot of the bonuses are marginal.  I find this frustrating.  2% here, some other useless skill there.  When your men get 'killed', often they either suffer some marginal penalty, or get one so severe they are finished.- The AI is pretty good compared to many games, but has some pretty serious flaws.  Hopefully this will improve with time.			"

												A good TBS game!   You move a Warhammer-style squad through the ruins of a city in search of comet fragments.  4 different factions with 4 somewhat different play-styles give it decent variety.  AI is generally predictable, prioritizing loot over tactical advantage, but will react quickly if you make a mis-step, and also makes a point of prioritizing & hunting down near beaten warriors of your squad if you leave them exposed.MP is much more of a nail-biter challenge, as each player scouts for the other and tries to bring more force of arms to the point of conflict before the other player.  One-on-one duels between squad units tend to be RNG affairs, which make a lot of the strategy about tactically manuevering your opponent into an ambush where you can bring the hammer of sigmar down on them with the full weight of your squad.

												Yes, I would still recommend this game, but it's a barely pass.I find this game interesting enough to play for few hours. The graphic is good enough, the gameplay is fine. The designers have worked hard on it. But after few hours of game play, the real test of every games, the continuation of finding interest in playing and the objectives of every mission, seems to have failed me. I have heard that the first full patch is out and more patches are on their way. I can only wish that further development different types of missions and background can be considered. "

												I really want to enjoy this game, and I'll probably keep playing it now and then, but it's very, very hard to recommend, especially at full price. On sale it's much, much safer for your wallet, though not on your blood pressure, it will suffer and if you're anything like me you'll break a keyboard or two while realizing that.It is an excellent strategy game. As a warband within the walls of Mordheim you are tasked by superiors to retrieve a substance froma meteor that's all over the city, while combating rival bands and improving your troops.It's strategy, so you'll move units around a battlefield and combat and pick up items and resources, pay tribute to your benifactor, and upgrade your team. However, given my complaints, it might be better to call it a rouge-like strategy.Your higher ups will demand some wyrdstone, you will go out to complete the order, and get paid for it. RNG will kill your team. You will try to hire more people. You will run out of money. You will be stuck without money and without units and your superior will still demand more until game over. Over and over and over again. Plan to fail in the face of an awful system of routine pain and suffering if you want to get to the delicious center where all the excellent strategy and gameplay lie.An auto save system keeps you from save scumming, which would be a mode in another game, allowing for a variety of people to enjoy the game any way they want. As it stands, it serves only to frusterate as men you pay to fight fail and fall over while trying to complete basic plans. A 90% chance to hit is closer to a 50 in the eyes of the RNG gods. Watch people you've put hours of work and skill into die because they were randomly put next to an ogre. Observe nights of effort put to the flame by lucky crit.Some people are into that, and that's cool, this game will cater to you, and I can reccomend it. The rest of us are left kind of disappointed we spent money on this.			"

												     A poorly executed attempt at bringing the original Mordheim game to PC. If you enjoy dumping hours into building a team, only to have 30 minutes of gameplay destroy your effort, you'll enjoy this. If you like getting your teeth pulled, it'll be a great experience. If you enjoy being roughly ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥ this is the game for you.      The sad thing is there's a great game hidden somewhere in here, but the glitchy AI (that does things like speed through your overwatch and into your face without having suffered any consequences on a turn-by-turn basis) kinda ruins any hope of greatness this game may have had. I want to like this game, but I also don't want to stick my leg in an open door and smash it closed as hard as I can repeatedly.			"

												A game that I have invested many hours into that has ultimately given me minor streaks of enjoyment with a heavy dose of pure, gut wrenching frustration, due to largely the games broken, or non-existant RNG engine (Random Number Generator). The game maker has ""addressed"" their broke RNG engine in the last patch, but for the life of me, I see no difference. I have yet to play this game against other humans, but against the AI, no matter the hit chance, the AI wont miss and no matter what I do, I seem to be unable to hit consistantly. if they ever fix the RNG engine in this game, I'll change my review to thumbs up, but until then, its nothing but frustration and hate for this game that has so much potential.  A game that is not fun due to what seems like weak AI that is propped up with a loaded RNG engine is not worth your money.			"

												Terrible animation.Long loading times.No save option. Every mistake or bug will screw up your campaign. I've started a new game four times now, only to be screwed over by some silly starting placement after one or two missions.Frustrating gameplay. It's like Dark Souls, but without any of the reward since there is no skill to the fighting, just RNG. It just feels unfair everytime your hero gets knocked out after missing two 80% chance hits in a row.Repetitive surroundings. Every location is the same boring burnt down cityscape. Nothing unique about anything. Generative maps can be great but it needs more character.I can imagine this is fun in multiplayer with a few friends for some classic table top like action, but as a single player video game it fails to be any kind of fun.

												I have NEVER, in the history of Steam, used the Steam Refund system. I refused. Even in games I have that I could only touch once. I left them in my library out of respect for the game developers, or just because it padded out my collection a little. Either way, that changed when I got this game.I am a huge fan of Games Workshop. I love the lore that they craft. I even played through their horrible first rendition of Space Hulk because I enjoyed the original tabletop game. But this game just broke me a little. My friend watched as I struggled through just over an hour of gameplay. It was horrendous. He died of laughter. I went and got a refund.I want to like this game. I do. The concept behind it is full of potential. But this delivery is just poor. I would wholeheartedly come back if they completely revamped it instead of pushing out a DLC warband or two. At least Space Hulk learned a little from the past in the sequel; I hope this game can eventualy do the same.			"

												I found this game to be frustrating in the extreme. The Loot system if difficult to use and limited in capacity as to make it impossible to collect the required items to complete missions. Combat is often one sided with the computer controlled faction  making all their doge/parry attempts and you making less than half of yours. NPC characters also on average do about 50% more damage per hit. Games should offer some challenge but one bad mission in this game (which happens quite offten as it turns out) can wipe out a war band that you spent many hours building up with no way recoup the losses. The control system is also very clumsy so that you can often end a characters turn or preform the wrong action by accident . Overall i am very uhappy with this game and feel that it was waste of my money and time.			"

												Only recommended for a die hard Warhammer fan. If you are looking for a strategic game is better to find an alternative. The campaign & warband management it's generally well done, with upkeep costs for your soldiers, wound system (both mental and physical) that can permanently change the warrior attitude and stats, equipment choices and so on, but the actual strategic gameplay is a joke. Movements and attacks are performed in a 3d person view camera, you can't pan around and you can only use a crappy 2d map to actually plan your moves. Movements are clunky at best. UI it's terrible.  Actions takes way too much time to process (especially the enemies ones), many useless animations are in the way. Stats checks for stupid stuff like climbing a wall that frankly i don't understand what purpose should serve in terms of actual gameplay. Lastly, most of the skills/spells you can teach to a warrior are useless or way too marginal to actually make a difference. It's just feels weak as a turn-based strategic game. Overall a sleep inducing gameplay, with a boring soundtrack and low quality sound effects that unfortunately didn't help in keeping me engaged.			"

												Cold boring game.Maps are pretty dull (along with the soundtrack) and you can sometimes run around them for some time trying to find enemies or stones. Combat is unimpressive, just generic slashes or flashes of magic. Theres no map of the area youre in so you can often lose your people.The injuries element is nice but thats the only thing, A shame as I would have loved a good Skaven game.			"

												Just to preface with 'gaming experience' in the 'Warhammer' setting...1. Warhammer 40k fan (Rogue Trader) - shows me age...2. Warmaster Fan - shows I enjoyed more than just the flashy Space Marine or the gritty Black Orc...Really wanted this to be something good - as in 'a successful port'. Yea...So, as a port its not bad.  Pros:It's a port of the mini gameCons:Create warband.  Warband does so-so.  Warband instakilled in match against a basic opponent that just rolls them....aaaaand....not enough starting money to reliably rebuild.  And, this is only day two?If more starting money was provided to rebuild a constant battle of warbad attrition = no thanks.The balance is off plain and simple.Should you OP through the game = no.Should you have to struggle through a game = yes.Should you be bent over a barrel every single game = no.There really needs to be a flat hand versus a thumbs up and down in the rating section because a thumbs down really isn't fair - to be honest...As an IT person what the devs did was actually really cool...it's the balance that's way off; and, not in the building but in the battles.  Yes, yes, yes - the setting is supposed to be brutal but I should not be missing 85% chance hits four times in a row in matches that are right next to each other.  That should be something of a statistical outlier. Would I recommend this game - no.And, that really pains me to say that as I understand the business model and the 'need to eat'. Balance the math behind the scene a bit and get back to me. Other than that - bravo devs! "

Posted: January 17, 2016
												AVOID THIS GAME. YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY.I so wanted to like this game, but as it stands I cannot recommend the game. The graphics are good, as is the combat system.I did make a negative review after 18 hours play, but decided to delete that and give the game a second chance as it is quite addictive. However I wish that I hadn't bothered deleting the review.Over 200 hours played and almost as many warbands formed and deleted within first few rounds due to being routed and made useless by way over powered AI warbands.All that you read about the broken and biased RNG is true and then some.Warband characters who have 80%+ chance to hit miss 80%+ of the time. Whilst AI characters hit your characters 80%+ of the time and a high percentage of these hits are critical kills or stuns. Your hits do minimal damage, with very few criticals.The vast bias toward AI characters can in no way be attributed to stats and buffs or debuffs. The obvious imbalance is too great for this.If this were anything to do with gambling the developers would be guilty of cheating by using loaded dice.In the 92 hours I played so far I have formed and deleted over 100 warbands, most of them during the first or second mission, because they were put out of action so easily by the AI warband, with resultant loss of items, and treatment costs and cost of replacing items and characters which were out of action or died.If you meet the Sisters warband near the beginning you might as well abandon mission immediately and delete your own warband. They are so OP, and have far greater movement han other warbands. Chances of beating them latter in the game increase, but only slightly. They have high level spells, and multiple high damage hits with weapons.Out of action characters get wounds which need treatment. This treatment is expensive and far out weighs any loot or gold gained from a mission. It quickly comes to the point that you can nolonger continue as you can't treat out of action characters and you can't replace them. If your leader is out of action you cannot continue untill treatment is finished or they are replaced by another leader. With obvious loss of already scarce funds. If you have insufficient funds that's end game.On the subject of costs, the costs of training a character are prohibitive. On the one occasion where I did get a warband to a decent level I had characters with 6 skill points which could not be used as the costs were unaffordable. Most charcters had got to their maximum stats too as it took so many missions to get anywhere.In the end this warband was deleted at the library mission still in the first chapter, as charaters were either so badly injured, lost limbs or died that continuing was not possible.At high levels the costs of replacing characters who die is so expensive as to be pretty much impossible. This means you can only get low level replacemants who are put out of action the first mission they enter.The mercenary warlock is a waist of time and money. His single spell, blinding light, is ineffectual. He is easily killed and not worth the expense of treatment. I soon fired the one I had.The same goes for the wolf priest of ulric. Crap spell to start with, misses most of his hits if he gets into melee, only 10% dodge chance even without armour so easily killed. Also can easily be  killed or seriously wounded just casting his one crap spell.Game load times are appaling. Go make a drink, finish it and go make another. If you are lucky the mission may have loaded. Deployment and AI movemnt also gets increasingly lengthy as the warband members increase in numbers.I will probably continue playing in the hope that the RNG issues are fixed, but I won't hold my breath on that score having seen the number of comments on this area without improvemnts being made.I cannot recomend the game until the RNG issues are fixed.Edit:- 18/01/16I forgot to mention the constant freezes and crashes. Usually when any sort of action is initiated. Climbing, jumping down, attacking and triggering traps. I have plenty of games which are far more graphic intensive and I do not have issues with them.The crashes are particularly anoying because of the lengthy load times.Edit 8/2/16Gave it another chance.Appalingly bad game balance. It seems that not only is the game heavily balanced towords AI warband strength, and hit abilities and defence abilities, the AI warband does not have a limit on the nuimber of characters in the warband or the distance each character can move.Just deleted yet another warbdand after 33 games getting nowhere. Hadn't even got as far as the temple mission (second main mission). Warband at full compliment with most characters max'd out on ability points, was overwelmingly outnumbered by characters who could move from one side of the map to the other in one move, and had multiple hits per character. I did have the disadvantage of 3 one eyed characters, 2 of them being archers. The ability to gain gold is so limited, and the expenses involved replacing higher level characters so excessive, as to make replacing even one of these 3 impossible.All my characters were put out of action and belongings removed. This left me with all characters needing days of recovery with no weapons, and no money to replace lost weapons.I have now deleted this pile of garbage from my pc, as it's obvious balance issues are not going to be fixed. It has become far to tedious spending hours getting absolutely nowhere, because the game is so heavily biased in favour of the AI warband. Unfortunately a refund is even less likely than a balance fix.Edit: After a very long break I decided to give this game another chance. Big misstake.Hoping updates would have improved the obvious imbalance to the overpowered AI characters how sad I was to find that the AI charcters are now even more overpowered. Now it is impossible to get anywhere without being obliterated.Out of over a dozen warbands started, well over 60% were deleted after the first round having been whipped out by overpowered AI with greater numbers in warbands, having much higher damage output and multiple attacks. Edit - after spending over 100 hours getting mercs to level 9, most of them level 10 I had to abandon act 2 scene 2 because the game froze on pulling the lever to the heirloom cart. Had to control, alt del to get out of game, and then would not load past 98%. Tried various fixes from checking game cash and deleting local files and reloading, but did not work. Even deletd save files once I found it, and cut connection to steam cloud for this game, and it still managed to try and load from same broken save file only to get as far as 98% and no further. Abandoning resulted in most mercs being killed and those left were incapacitated including the captain so could not continue with game. Deleted warband. This is a known issue that still has not been fixed!Unfortunately I cannot get a refund so I will no doubt continue to bang my head against a wall playing this occasionally since I have wasted my money on the game.

												While I can't recomend this game I have to give props to Rogue Factorfor their revolutionary, yet simple, game engine! It couldn't have been easy to come up with something so sadistic yet seemingly random. I don't know if 'screw the player whenever possible' can be written in game code but thats what this game feels like.I read on a post that easy mode for this game came at lvl 5 when you could get your epic (or whatever) hero. Well as soon as you get one, your enemys have them too (on single player). I did this on three of the 4 factions. It sure was fun playing round after round on two of these factions, with my big ol' ogre dude failing inteligence tests over and over and never doing anything. Keep in mind, to field these guys you have to get rid of 2 hero types that would have actually done something. The AI never really seemed to have this issue, their big ol' ogre dudes always seemed to show up to roll over my band. The whole game is like this. I have never been so frustrated, or dissapointed, by a game. Sad, the concept was awesome. "

The control system is also very clumsy so that you can often end a characters turn or preform the wrong action by accident . Overall i am very uhappy with this game and feel that it was waste of my money and time.			"

												Cold boring game.Maps are pretty dull (along with the soundtrack) and you can sometimes run around them for some time trying to find enemies or stones. Combat is unimpressive, just generic slashes or flashes of magic. Theres no map of the area youre in so you can often lose your people.The injuries element is nice but thats the only thing, A shame as I would have loved a good Skaven game.			"

												Just to preface with 'gaming experience' in the 'Warhammer' setting...1. Warhammer 40k fan (Rogue Trader) - shows me age...2. Warmaster Fan - shows I enjoyed more than just the flashy Space Marine or the gritty Black Orc...Really wanted this to be something good - as in 'a successful port'. Yea...So, as a port its not bad.  Pros:It's a port of the mini gameCons:Create warband.  Warband does so-so.  Warband instakilled in match against a basic opponent that just rolls them....aaaaand....not enough starting money to reliably rebuild.  And, this is only day two?If more starting money was provided to rebuild a constant battle of warbad attrition = no thanks.The balance is off plain and simple.Should you OP through the game = no.Should you have to struggle through a game = yes.Should you be bent over a barrel every single game = no.There really needs to be a flat hand versus a thumbs up and down in the rating section because a thumbs down really isn't fair - to be honest...As an IT person what the devs did was actually really cool...it's the balance that's way off; and, not in the building but in the battles.  Yes, yes, yes - the setting is supposed to be brutal but I should not be missing 85% chance hits four times in a row in matches that are right next to each other.  That should be something of a statistical outlier. Would I recommend this game - no.And, that really pains me to say that as I understand the business model and the 'need to eat'. Balance the math behind the scene a bit and get back to me. Other than that - bravo devs! "

												RNG: The game. Simple as that.Its not really about planning, about strategy or whatever. Its all about dice rolls.You might plan ahead, trying to setup ambushes but in the end all that matters is if you will get proper rolls. 85% chance to hit or 95% doesnt mean anything, you will miss all attacks because this time RNG decided to have bad day. That enemy you flanked and outnumbered will kill half of your people, because RNG will favors him this time. And said half of people will die for good or get absolutely useless due to permanent injures because of RNG. Half of your troops wont even get a chance to attack against that vampire from DLC warband because they will fail all rolls. All your precious weapons will get stolen because your guys will fail their dodge rolls and die. Your units will lose half their hp from charging enemies, because when both you and AI have same range, AI gets advantage, because. And so on...Of course, veteran players wont agree with that. They will tell you that game is fair and ""high level warband gets advantage over AI"". Maybe - chances are that you wont reach that high level at all. They will defend system, where enemy warband have same composition and same levels as your own team - except that they wont be restricted by gold and have all those skills you cant learn because you lack money. They will tell you that AI is actually in worse position for picking skills at random - while your own team wont have ANY. They might even just tell you to ""get good"".Some say that all the fun in this game comes from losing. If you like being wiped on the floor, then go ahead - you will probably enjoy this. If you want fair game - go play something else.			"

												Only recommended for a die hard Warhammer fan. If you are looking for a strategic game is better to find an alternative. The campaign & warband management it's generally well done, with upkeep costs for your soldiers, wound system (both mental and physical) that can permanently change the warrior attitude and stats, equipment choices and so on, but the actual strategic gameplay is a joke. Movements and attacks are performed in a 3d person view camera, you can't pan around and you can only use a crappy 2d map to actually plan your moves. Movements are clunky at best. UI it's terrible.  Actions takes way too much time to process (especially the enemies ones), many useless animations are in the way. Stats checks for stupid stuff like climbing a wall that frankly i don't understand what purpose should serve in terms of actual gameplay. Lastly, most of the skills/spells you can teach to a warrior are useless or way too marginal to actually make a difference. It's just feels weak as a turn-based strategic game. Overall a sleep inducing gameplay, with a boring soundtrack and low quality sound effects that unfortunately didn't help in keeping me engaged.			"

												There's a lot of fun mechanics in the game, and it's interested to see how the devs translated the tabletop wargame rules to a tactical/action video game. Overall though, it's way too punishing for me to have any fun. The gameplay feels trial-and-error based, and when you're punished so thouroughly for every failure the cost is just too high. If you enjoy restarting five times per campaign in XCom this might be for you, but I don't have that tolerance for random failure.			"

												The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ you face the op DLC warbands in the regular game but you don't get to play as them. Have fun watching your warband fail their terror checks time and time again was they are picked off by the vampire leader. Another gripe the the missions, you will come across missions that pick your starting placement for your men which leads to one guy being alone almost right next to the computer's camp. Yeah kiss his♥♥♥♥♥good bye as the moment he bumps into two guys he is thrown into a break test. If he fails he runs which lets the computer get free hits on him. Now that being said I love these games, I have played X-com with the long war mod and X-com 2 and there is so less ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to deal with compared to this game.			"

												This game has an excellent premise, it has the perfect setting, it is punishing if you make a mistake and intend you to not get attached to warbands as they fall by the wayside in the city of the damned.It is also incredibly unfair at times, and I personally will never put the game down with a smile on my face as I generally feel cheated by the RNG or the AI's ability to rush half a football field over to you and then ruin your day in a turn. Add this to the INCREDIBLY clunky looting and movement system, you can when the luck goes against you feel like flipping a table due to the sheer time investment you've made into the session.Is it a good game? At it's core, yes it is a good game. Is it worth 40 Euro? No. It is not worth 40 euro by a long shot. Pick this up when it is on sale.			"

												Mordheim has a nice idea, coming from the old tabletop game.  However, the idea that your warband automatically deploys every time in random areas with no idea where the rest of the warband is, is just flat out rediculous.  You have no way of knowing where they are unless you accidentally see them in passing, when the enemy is moving and you see at least 2 warband members.  Then finding any loot, forget it.  You have no way of knowing where that is either.  You will wind up deleting and creating new warbands constantly because you have so many injured, that you cannot adventure to make money, and when you do, you are scattered and wiped out.  And your opponents are not scattered.  They are grouped together and always know exactly where your warband is.			"

Posted: March 5, 2016
												I really wanted to recommend this game.  Let's start with the good: it looks amazing, and does a strong job of capturing the feel of despair that permeates the Warhammer universe.  I approached the game assuming it would be a rogue-like, and on my first playthrough everything clicked well for 8-9 battles and I had a great time.  I won most, I lost a couple.  Eventually, my warband lost a fight badly, my Leader and my Hero both suffered perma-death, so I rolled-up a new warband.I've rolled up four new warbands since then, and never made it past the second mission.Because the AI is so bad, the Devs game it a huge number of advantages.  Some are blatant, others I'm inferring based on AI behavior.1) In anything that should be an even match-up, it takes twice as many hits for a PC to defeat an AI than it does an AI to defeat a PC.  If the enemy leader runs up out of nowhere and smacks your leader, you will lose about 1/3 of your health in one shot.  When you counterattack, you'll do about 1/6 of his health in total damage.  Also, archers are incredibly underpowered, and only do about 10-15% damage to an enemy.  It's pretty much the same for minions.  This means that in a one-on-one fight, you are generally guaranteed to lose.  The only way to defeat the enemy is to mass combat power on an isolated enemy.  Which brings us to point 2...2) It's often impossible to mass combat power, because the game frequently scatters your characters' starting positions all over the map.  You will often start with at least one character alone and surrounded by enemies.  Even if you have all your characters make a beeline for a central location, it will take a minimum of 2-3 rounds to consolidate.  In that time period, at least one or two of your characters will probably be dead, because the AI never seems to have a problem bringing 2-3 characters into contact with an isolated character by round 2.3) The AI always seems to know the shortest path through level geometry.  If I have archers stationed at a high point raining down arrows, the AI can always find a path to get a melee character into close combat in one round.  Meanwhile , a human player without perfect knowledge of the geometry may spend several rounds trying to find a path up to an enemy archer.4) The only real source of money in the game is Wyrdstone, and you must collect it constantly to please your patron to keep the game from ending.  However, the enemy generally seems to have no interest in Wyrdstone, and makes a beeline for your characters, forcing you to spend all your efforts fighting until one side routs.  If your rout, you receive no Wyrdstone.  If you win, you receive a very small fraction of the total Wyrdstone remaining on the map.The one time the enemy IS interested in Wyrdstone is when one of your characters has collected some and is running it back to your wagon.  The AI seems to know which character has Wyrdstone and focuses all effort on bringing down that character to prevent you from collecting any.5) There is no difficulty setting.  I understand it's supposed to be hardcore, but even after paying for scouts, my difficulty options for battle on Day 2 are frequently a combination of Brutal and Deadly.  In order to make your required payments to your patron, you need to win the overwhelming majority of battles.  Because of the low Wyrdstone collection rate, even the battles you win provide very little Wyrdstone.  Check out the achievements on who has even gotten as far as completing Chapter 1 for each of the factions.  The highest is currently the Mercenaries with 3%.  It's one thing if your game demands intelligent play and well-thought tactics.  But this game is frequently over before you take your first turn.Verdict: This could be a great game if they smooth the learning curve a bit, stop the deployment stupidity, and reduce the AI's stat advantage.  There's a great game hiding in there.  The people who praise the game in its current form generally talk about how easy it is to exploit the AI.  If the only way to win is through AI exploitation, this is a poorly designed game.			"

												This is my first review.Mordheim is absolutely my very most favorite tabletop game of all time.  I love just about everything it has.  I love the feeling of scarcity.  I love the brutal, unforgiving nature of that terrible broken city.  I love how your heroes grow and develop only to eventualy succumb to wounds, madness or death.  It is dark, and it is amazing.This rendition of it did get some things right, a lot when I truly consider it.  However, I can not recommend it.  It simply has no soul...  It is immediately a grind from the very beginning and nothing else.  Yes, you will get some new units unlocked and some slightly better gear.  Yes, your units will level up, get skills and improve.  Yay!The game made it feel as if none of that really mattered.  You will never encounter the same warband you fought before.  They are all random.  You will never enter an engagement against anything other than a superior foe.  I like hard games, but I also like a game to make me feel something other than annoyance.Here's what happened to me.  I made a whole bunch of different warbands.  I tried 'em all.   Started with the Skaven, but couldn't get them to work.  They were really fast and could kind of use that to determine where the battles took place but they just seemed too fragile to keep up with constantly superior foes. Chaos way too random.  Really liked Sisters of Sigmar, but seemed to get the furthest the Empire.  Had everybody in really heavy armor.  Ended up in a fight with the Sisters of Sigmar.  Did freaking great/  Didn't lose a single guy and filled up with a lot of wyrdstone.  Awesome!  Wait...  where is this last enemy? The leader?  I creaped around through a few buildings ready to fend off an ambush but nothing emerged.  The computer was thinking every turn, so I thhought the matriarch must be moving.I found here in an attic right in front of the only ladder, too stupid to come down.  Because I had found them largely useless, none of my guys were packing ranged weapons and the only archer who could do something a little bit useful sometimes was wounded.That left me with three choices:1.  Accept every single one of my units as a casualty because I had not lost enough units to voluntarily rout.2.  Start a new warband as the game does not allow for loading previous games.  I am totally fine with this concept.3.  Quit the game because I didn't like the first two options.I chose number three, and that is why I cannot recommend this game.			"

								First up I love Warhammer and Mordheim and I think this could well be a fantastic game and hope it will be when finally released.I was planning to wait for the full release but it was on sale so I thought I would pick it up nowbut I always wanted to see how it runs and how its coming along.Well firstly the load times are as many others have pointed out, pretty bloody long but its not the end of the worldits likely the kind of game ill play with a podcast or something in the background,and while I can certainly see how it would not be a major priority a the momentit is something I hope they are able to reduce for full releaseSimilarly it doesn't run great on my laptop, granted my lappy is no beast but when I have fairly modern RTS games running at much better frame rates than turn based games, I think something needs to be said(It's my biggest problem with XCOM a game which I love but god damn does it run like♥♥♥♥♥♥Seriously why is a turn based stratedgy game running at sub 10 fps on the lowest settingsthat isn't something that needs a lil polish at the end, that is something that needs to get optimized pronto.So onto my experience playing the first tutorial, well I finished the tutorial part but you are allowed to finish the battle and kill the remaining enemies, so I set to it...for one turn and then My Rat ogre got stuck and I was forced to quit.Yeah that is a pretty big problem, game ending bug within minutes.What happened was one of my lil skaven ran up a walkway leading to a higher area and ran out of movement on the edge of the other side I then tried to run my Rat ogre up past him as he was closer I was fairly sure I could make it(It was not very easy to tell how far I was gonna be able to move, maybe there is an easier way to see that I didn't notice) so he goes up this ramp and though he is a big guy it looks like I should be able to pass by my other skavenbut alas he got stuck and floated off the floor slightly, unable to move in any directionand due to not being able to end a turn close to an ally (within their field of control)I was forced to quit.I really hope I can at some point change this to a reccomended and say that all this is fixed and the game is greatbut first I needed to do this so that these issues can be fixed, because quite honestly a game breaking in its first tutorial is embarrassing.I hope the devs see this and are able to fiz these issues as best they canI will be back, I bought to support and I am leaving this review to hopefully make this game better.

												Mostly the design of the game is solid. Fundamentals like the Stragey and Offence Point systems combined with the various actions are clever and I assume lifted straight from the tabletop. I especially enjoy the ambush mechanic and they are generally well balanced against each other.The maps look nice and are interesting but they need to open some buildings up a bit, it is too easy to turtle up inside a fortress of a ruined tudor building.Customization sucks though I would expect it to be a lesser priority.Collision meshes are too big and frustrating on characters making them silly road blocks for your following characters and making it difficult to navigate.However the biggest problem is that inspite of the level of tactical play offered your ploys will too often become undone by the rng. Your strategy may be sound, you may get the drop on the enemy and be able to focus your strengths, but then you will get ♥♥♥♥ed over by the rng.That is this game in a nutshell, the rng ♥♥♥♥ing you over, again and again. You will do little or even nothing wrong but a set of ridiculously bad rolls (or lucky for the enemy) will see you fail and punished hard. This game and world is meant to be harsh but somewhere someone forgot the game part of that equation, and it's implications. This is less a game and more an exercise in random-fueled frustration.For example I just had my entire warband of 7 take on the enemy commander of a weaker warband, and 2 whole rounds of my team missing, he pummeled my leader and gave him a skull fracture causing him to be stupid for the rest of the campaign. I could not have weighted it more in my favour but all that invested expense, time and effort is now wasted on a useless leader.Maybe if they introduce say three warband fate points I will give this game another shot, until then, ♥♥♥♥ this game.

This is less a game and more an exercise in random-fueled frustration.For example I just had my entire warband of 7 take on the enemy commander of a weaker warband, and 2 whole rounds of my team missing, he pummeled my leader and gave him a skull fracture causing him to be stupid for the rest of the campaign. I could not have weighted it more in my favour but all that invested expense, time and effort is now wasted on a useless leader.Maybe if they introduce say three warband fate points I will give this game another shot, until then, ♥♥♥♥ this game.

												Good gameplay and atmosphere. Willl I get it? No, namely for not enough rpg elements in terms of character personality and customization, as well as the loot mechanics being a bit too harsh for my taste. A decent core experience though, and I will look out for future titles from the developers that maintain this style without compromising those elements.			"

												A very solid game, although perhaps too punishing at times. Losing many hours of progress to unavoidable RNG is a bitter pill to swallow, and there really ought to be a more in-depth story mode for all the factions to go along with the action.All in all a fun and solid game, but it could be much more and here's hoping it might eventually live up to its potential.

												I rarely write reviews on games I play here on steam, but this game definitely deserved one.  I got into the game during the early days of playtesting.  Even though I knew that the game was far from finished, it was very difficult to play back then.  Characters would get stuck on stairsor other platforms, or else a in game bug would force you to quit.  Needless to say these all got fixed and the game is one of the best ""digital"" adaptions of a Tabletop game to date, if not the best.This doesn't mean that the game is perfect, however, knowing what it took to make the game and what went into the development and playtesting mode I will eagerly await DLC for new factions or for the opportunity to play more than two warband on a single map.I am really looking forward to seeing more in the future.

												This feels like it would be a game from the late 90s / early-aughts.It's trying to be a 3rd-person turn-based tactical strategy game that incorporates some good ideas, but it needs so much more polish, the end result is just plain disappointing.You will constantly be fighting the camera if there are any walls nearby.Movement will be slightly more restrictive than you expect.The maybe dozen or so mission objectives will be ignored and it will just become a RNG slugfest to see who can kill the other teams leader and heroes first.I'm usually not one to harp on graphics, but the character models are somewhat bland.  Admittedly, I have not played around with the customiation options, but meh.Overall, I can't recommend the game.  It's interesting for maybe an hour, but as the flaws stack and wear on you, you will likely have trouble giving it your attention much longer than that.			"

								A wonderful start to a promising game. Though it needs to be fleshed out as currently (phase 2) all the warbands are not yet introduced; looting, rankings and customization are yet to be implemented; warband balance is wanting; graphic bugs occasionally infest gameplay. All in all though I encourage any Mordheim/WH fan to jump into EA as it seems that Mordheim does not have the mass appeal of many EA games (which is not necessarily a bad thing) thus, jump the bandwagon and help support the devs in developing what promises to be a great game.

												Difficult to get to grips with to begin, but once you get into it, an incredibly rewarding game, great fun to play with a lot of replayability. Getting too attached to your guys may be a mistake though...Pay attention to the hours played by those giving reviews. There are those who simply find it too hardcore (and it is, especially at the beginning) but learn and watch YT vids how to play and you will soon get into it and realise what a really great game this is.When you get into it you are really hooked on your little warband. Customise them, rename them, get attached to them...then cry when one loses a leg, an arm, an eye, or their life!If you like your GW games, this has similarities to Bloodbowl, but if anything it is more brutal.I really hope they do something similar but for the Necromunda setting in the future.Loving the game, and made it into Act II of the storyline with one of my warbands.

It is promised that at this party there would be fun, friends, and a random array of other things you enjoy. Youre heckin stoked man. You call ahead, all your buddies confirm, the party is indeed what was promised. You arrive and ring the doorbell, dripping with anicipation. A friend answers the door and shows you around the house. He then abruply excuses himself and dissapears. Youre prepared to party your innocent, unwary♥♥♥♥♥off. You round the corner headed for the punch bowl and BAM. A four foot tall midget spear tackles you and starts gnawing on your kidney, clad in a leather gimp suit.

They then deficate on your lifeless body and continue to frolick about.This is Mordheim.13/10 would have kidney eaten by midget again. "

												Well, the pacing of this game is so bad that I often load up other games to play while waiting for the few minute long AI turns at the start of each map. Before you can see the other team you have to sit around waiting for them to run their turns. Who thought that was fun?It's a somewhat similar experience to the tabletop game except for the AI being braindead. Charges mindlessly with units so that the leaders get their ahead of the minions and can be easily dispatched leading to an easy win.Final straw for not recommending was the arrival of the cash in DLCs in the form of units that should have been included on release but are now being charged for.AVOID.

Developers (I know that they are a tiny team) decided to jump to a next project and simply ignore all their fans who asked them so many times to add more warbands. Simply we doesnt care anymore - that's the message from them. And it killed all desire to invest time into this hard game. For what reason? The game has no future anymore.			"

Pros: Faithfully replicates a lot of the Mordheim wargaming experienceCons: Faithfully replicates a lot of the Mordheim wargaming experienceJokes aside, I really wanted to like this game. I'm a big fan of Warhammer in general, so anything in that setting deserves a look in my book. This game fails to deliver on quality, tho, and I'm a bit salty that I spent cash on it at this point. I kept playing, hoping it would ""loosen up"" and get better as I learned the systems more, but that didn't happen.I played Mercenaries, so your experience may vary depending on your warband preference.Main problemThe main problem this game has is usability. Information I crave isn't provided when I desire it. For example when an enemy is in ambush stance, and I see them, why can I not see how far their ambush range extends? This is vital information for planning my approach, but the information isn't there! This problem is confounded by the fact that ambush ranges vary depending on the movement range of the unit doing the ambush, so you can't learn an approximate distance through experience either.The same applies to traps of all kinds. When I have perceived a trap to be there, why can I not see the trigger area? For a game that wants to be tactical, it makes it very hard to make tactical decisions. The game would be a lot more rewarding if it gave me enough information.Outside a certain distance from my active unit, I can't see traversal-nodes anymore (leap, jump down, etc.) This is tactically important information, but I have to awkwardly run my unit closer just to see this info. Bogs down the game with unnecessary busywork.Secondary problemAdding to the usability problems is the fact that units block a larger area around them than their model indicates. This fact interplays with the level design, which is rife with small corridors, walkways, stairs and bridges to make it a horrible experience trying to maneuver your units around. If you get an archer out on a walkway, you can't be certain you'll be able to funnel any other units past him even though it visually looks completely possible. It's extremely frustrating when your entire plan of attack is foiled by visual misinformation like that. After being hurt by this issue a few times, I started playing extremely conservatively. This bogs down the entire game, as you can't assume based on visual clues what's possible, and have to take the safe bet at every juncture.OtherThe game soaks in randomness. Sure, Mordheim the wargame does, too, but the encounter layouts that aim to provide variation are frightening because of it. When there's a large probability of my units permanently dying, it's infuriating when one is dropped in the middle of three Sisters of Sigmar that proceed to bash him to death in unison with no recourse possible. I have no control over this. If I was given the chance to stack up my forces in a manner I wanted, I could at least take the blame for the misstep myself.The strategy/offense point system feels sub-par. Moving a huge distance and not moving at all has no bearing on how many attacks the unit gets to do. This feels awkward, and makes strategy points less valuable once engaged in melee. Please create a way to revert any movements made on a unit to the starting to position. This is unnecessarily awkward, as I have to retrace my steps to get back the strategy points used. Sometimes, moving in a certain way around corners and through doors will make it impossible to retrace my steps, too.			"

TL,DRPros]/b] Visually the world looks good. Captures the style of the classic Mordheim table top game and adds to it. The warbands carry some of their flavor from the original game well. Combat is simple and easy to learn early on, but can be expanded on with skills. The maps are great and intuitive. They are both easy and difficult to navigate at the same time. Unlike most Turn based games your moves aren't locked in.  Room to grow. Theres plenty of source material to develop more warbands and hopefully a better story mode.Cons RNG in this game is almost too painful. The maps could be more diverse.  The warbands only carry a very limited amount of their inspiration over from the table top. leading to ... The warbands are too similar. Very low amount of customization.  Lack of a regular Story to play.  RNG      I truly do like this game so far. It has a lot to offer, to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy (TBS) games and/or Gamesworkshop. The warband all fit their flavors aestheticly. There is RPG elements mixed into the characters; It is deceptively deep if you can keep your characters alive long enough. But thats not to say this game doesnt have it's downfalls. Repetitive maps generic feeling warbands and rage-inducing RNG all scream for some serious future updates. Here I will cover some of the pros and cons I encountered along the way.       P6) The most refreshing part of the TBS side of the game is the ability to move your character throughout the world and then back to explore a different avenue, before coming to the point that you want to stop. Being able to freely explore the buildings and streets is a HUGE boon. P5) There are traps and enemies along the way that can stop your exploration though. The maps are built like city streets and inner city mansions, making them easy to navigate. The catch is all the traps along the way that will stop your movement along the way. Also, many of the buildings are in ruins so you might enter one side hoping to cut through to find that the other side is blocked off. C2) After playing for awhile however, the maps start feeling too similar the buildings all the same. It's like if you were walking through a forest. ""Sure, this clearing is different than the last. But it's still really similar.""      Being a longtime Gamesworkshop fan since WH40k: Chaos Gate and an avid player of the Mordheim table top game, I was really looking forward to this game. Getting into the game the aesthetics were spot-on. Dark gritty dirty broken. Exactly what longtime fans expect. The look and feel of the warbands is also on point. Where it fails is customization. You can change a few bits of clothing here and there. You can have some different colors but nothing more. That limited customization bleeds over into the gameplay of the warband themselves. Each warband plays in a very similar manner. You have x ammount of little dudes with x amount of heroes. Each warband has the same numbers. Each warband can use most of the same weapons. The flavors of the original game are there for all the warbands except skaven. Chaos guys mutate. Sisters gals are vendictive nuns with divine magic. Merc are well Mercs but they have access to the largest array of wepapons. Skaven are supposed to be an endless horde of assassin rat-men. Because the limited number of henchmen they are not endless. Skaven barely hold onto the idea of being assassins by having a few poison skills. More to come later im tired time for bed "

												What an experience! So unforgiving and brutal, yet tactically challenging and rewarding on good days. Just don't begin to build up an affection for your warband as some bad days will follow unavoidably ... or really bad days.Normally Roguelikes aren't my thing, but this game is so fun and the lore and the factions are just great. The combatsystem is quite similar to the Valkyria Chronicles series (excluiding the direct aiming and in-turn suppression fire) and, in my opinion, is the best possible choice for this kind of game.Mordheim features a global progression that will make new attempts easier over time, but do not expect the game to hold your hand or to provide you with an alternative difficulty. Depending from various factors that you do not know before attempting combat the fight might turn from ""under control"" to ""last ditch effort to avoid getting pummeled"" rather quickly.  This is not a game about you nurturing your party through grind. This game is about improving yourself, trying out new things and always taking risks you might wish you would have avoided afterwards.			"

												This game is a very good adaptation of the tabletop game. Probably the only critique I have on the game mechanics is the huge focus on Wyrdstone, which, while giving it a sense of difficulty, gives problems in terms of trying to play it as a simple fight. You only get that time to play it like that when you collect and send out the shipment, but it's not for that long a period. But this is definitely a great game if you're into Games Workshop's tabletop games.			"

												Mostly reviewing this to counter all the free weekend people who didnt seem to understand the game. I also started playing during the last free weekend, and it was an easy decision to buy it after i got used to the game mechanics.At first i was annoyed by the limited inventory space, and being unable to loot everything on the map, but the game is balanced around this and if you got all the wyrdstone/loot after winning the game would be too easy and would become boring because of it. I think there is a good risk/reward system in the missions. You can go with the hardest missions and split up your guys to gather more loot of complete the optional objectives, but you risk getting someone isolated and taken out of action. Alternatively, if you only do easy missions and focus only on routing the enemy warband, you risk failing wyrdstone shipments.The only problems i have with the game now is that the AI is very basic and often gets stuck on terrain, and some of the optional objectives are pretty much impossible to complete.

												Mordheim is essentially a  turn based action strategy game that tries to reduce the feeling of turn based action, and by that I mean that the game removes more traditional elements like grids square moves etc, your movement, for example, is just like you would move in an action game save the distance and actions you take are limited and create almost a checkpoint system where you can back track your movement...so long as nothing happens during that movement.It is set in a city that is basically hell on earth, where demons roam and everything is trying to kill you while you collect little green rocks called wyrdstone that serve as your main currency generator, which incidentally is also trying its best to make sure you die by debuffing you with magic radiation. The fish on the walls spray junk on you to debuff you, traps are everywhere and any corner could have a very angry woman with a hammer or a giant rat with big claws to maim, kill or eat you and then loot your corpse. Surviving Mordheim is like surviving the game of thrones… don’t get too attached to any one character as it will die, lose a leg, arm or eye when you least expect it. There is no save scumming and you get what you get. Which is thematically accurate and well Mordheim.There are moments in this game that are brilliantly funny, like seeing the enemy caster blow him or herself up… it's not so funny when it happens to you. The luck gods are fickle creatures and they do not like you. And that is the core of this game, managing and minimizing luck and risk.  If you can manage your risks well and understand what and why things happen, you will do fine.. ish. However, there are times when you will out right get bent over and torn to shreds, and you will pay for your mistakes. Which to me is part of the challenge of the gameThe AI is not brilliant and sometimes the enemy will sit their licking the walls if it gets stuck on something..like their wagon, though overall the AI acts in a more or less intelligent fashion with the scripted missions being better about it, the AI is exploitable. I once trapped half the enemy force on my own wagon due to its inability to “see” or register some objects and I threw bombs on them until they died..or switched to range and got out of its hole to shoot me. However, this level of ridiculous exploitation is a bit rare and normally one or two enemy AI will get stuck like this every few missions..so don’t count on it. The AI also tends to “prey on the weak” meaning your new hero is going to be target number 1 more often then not..so be aware. Common complaint: other then the AI is regarding impressive..personally I don’t use them all that often as they cost me 2 hero slots and I lose versatility for raw power but here is the thing, as others point out when you 1st get your impressions as you will always be facing an impressive that out levels you own until late game “ie L7-10”. This is true and often frustrates people who play, fair enough, but the trick is until you impressive beefs up, don’t ever have it go head to head with other impressive instead treat him like any other new member, protect it have it beat on weaker opponents and use it as a tool to support the warband, don’t think “raaahg kill!” and send it running off on its own…its just going to die. This game can be a great deal of fun and for me it is…likewise it can be an exercise in frustration as it will punish you, but the sense of reward when you do manage to complete a few chapters is that much more worth it, because unlike other games that just kinda had you victory with a simple reload, you haved, to earn it here..through a mix of strategy, luck and occasionally balls. For some people that is an awesome thing for others not so much  "

												Mordheim: City of the Damned is overall a fun game but it requires a very patient and forgiving player sometimes to enjoy it. Originally you have to build up your numbers slowly from 5 members in your warband (which I supported when first playing the game but by the time I made my 20th Warband it felt very restrictive and tedious) to a maximum of 9. The game can become rather repetetive after completing all the story missions with a Warband but before then it is varied and interesting for the most part. There are amusing visual and technical glitches which are relatively harmless (such as being unable to go down a set of normal stairs etc.) but there are also rare glitches which cause warbands at rank 10 to all suffer injuries due to a forced game shutdown (this having occured to a friend of mine's Skavens and he was not very happy to say the least). Never did I feel that one of my casualties was unavoidable and was caused rather by my poor decision making and replacing the units is not that hard in general so I feel the game is usually fair and not that difficult. Learning unit's strategies and combos is a thoroughly enjoyable part of the game that gives it some replayability. However one problem I have with the game is the number of warbands. There are originally 4 to choose from (with an additional one that can be bought as DLC to bring it to 5) and even though their styles are different I would obviously enjoy more Warbands			"

												I really tried to like this one. The opening words of dissapointment.I'm a big fan of the Warhammer Fantasy setting and love the warband combat where there is potentiol to get attached to each unit and on paper this game has many games I like. The cruel fight against all odds while just holding on, permanent scaring and wounds that influence gamplay, customizable units etc.I can get over things like medicore animations, the lack of variety character faces or limitations to the aforementioned armor custimization, the bafflingly bad menu design and the fact that said menus work better with mouse controls while the actual gameplay is more fit for gamepad.I do understand the limitations of a budget and in the end they did a very solid job in many areasBut holy ♥♥♥♥ the RNG (Random Number Generation) in this game is just infuriatingly bad to a point where I don't feel challenged or mad, just frustrated. I gave the game several goes with different parties. Some getting obliterated in their second battle beyond repair, others doing allright for a while until half of the team gets crippled and where things can only go downhill from there.RNG is really the core of everything in this game. Even before getting into the turn based combat, RNG decides which units are available, what stuff the shop has in store for your warband and what missions are available to play.In battles you have RNG to decide not only your positioning, but also any movement, attack or defensive actions you take.After the battles you have RNG that decides if an injured characters bears a permanent injury, thus decreasing their stats and further decreasing their chances of success...But surely it cant be just the virtual dice-rolling in the background that's so bothersome. X-Com or FTL for example work just fine for me.So I tried to understand why I feel that the RNG in this game is so bad and I think i managed to figure it out. The combat is very deadly, where a single attack can chip away huge chunks of a healthbar with most units at the beginning of a campaign going down in 3-4 hits. This leaves us with a combat system where technically every hit matters but the game excludes you from having major influence on the outcome.In the end, this lack of control is what just kills it for me and makes me feel like this game doesn't respect my time at all.No matter how well I play, how carefull I plan my movements, set traps and try to outflank my enemies... Win or loose, in the end it just all comes down to a random dice-roll and that just isn't fun to me.So sadly, not a recommendation for me.			"

												Going into the game you must know that it is hardcore. Like you will lose a character you've been training non-stop since the start to a simple mistake if you are not careful.Although it is hardcore it is a really fun game. The graphics are great and the gameplay is fun, it's just that the hardcore part of the game will make you pull your hair out at times.P.s. Failed 4 attacks at 95% chance to hit, failed a 95% chance to parry attack and lost my captain, rolled death on the injury table.

												Some things that happened to me in a few hours of play.Leader died on second mission, i had no money to pay the upkeep or medical bills, had to sell my wyrdstones just to get by but i also needed to fulfill a shipment request in three days. After hiring a new leader and patching up my guys i had one day remaining for delivery, took a mission crushed my enemies got the stones, somehow it all worked out and all was fine for a bit.Some time later my leader died yet again this time along with one of my henchmen and several others were wounded pretty bad, the loss hurt even more this time as both dead characters had spent skill points 200 gold down the drain. After recovering things were going pretty smoothly, i was making shipments on time doing well on missions and even picking up a few upgrades for my warband, it was looking good...Next day i do a campaign(story) mission, get horribly recked by demons and fail it, leader died again and my hero also died, my impressive unit got a leg sliced off and now can barly move around on a peg leg.Basicly playing this game is like riding a rollercoaster, sometimes you hit the high point and feel untouchable, then suddenly you get plunged into dispair and desperation.10/10 would get leader killed and units horribly maimed again.

												I do recommend this game for hardcore player that doesnt fear consequence of their decision that can lead to some crucial injury on your warband member and force the player to think twice before making decision . I love the way the concept is made by being able to control your character a first person with W-A-S-D control . Also this game have a great potential for DlC hopefully wont cost so much of money crossfinger , but in general the ambiance is great . The cons in my opinion as a player of Sister of Sigmar is that the spell shouldnt have such heavy consequence if you want to go on a more defensive build ( shield - one hand - heavy armor ) but still they are fighter so i understand . The graphic could be a lil more beautiful as the face of the Sister seem a little not beautiful and the RnG get some frustration some times ..   Otherwise this game is cool .			"

												It is turn-based tactical fighting, squad management game in the warhammer world.  If that sounds good to you than pick it up!  You will not be disapointed.  This game keeps all the stategy element of any other tactical game but instead of moving big clunky squads around you move individual warriors around.  Each warrior levels up, you can pick customizable skills and customize their gear.  As you go you unlock more troops/heroes and troop/heroes types.  Which can be a lot of planning if you OCD about your character builds like me.  You start to get attached to your troops but they can get injured or die which adds a true sense of risk to the game.   The factions are interesting and I love that they put skaven as a playable faction.  The maps are designed well and the control work well.  To maintain your warband you have to be constantly farming warpstone around the field which makes you split your troop into fighters and gathers most of the time.  The layout is a bit hard to see for the map.  It is hard to tell if an area is raise or if you can climb something until you run your character there but that might be intended.			"

												im going out on a limb with this, and sharing my experiance with my own skaven warband, in essence-ive been lucky as crap due to the horror stories ive heard, mostly i just get minions/henchmen with bad mental conditions or internal injuries that i can just shrug off, so far ive been getting good missions-my advice to people, dont take anything harder then normal for the frist few runs untill you get your warbands size up to snuff with good equipment and your henchmen able to carry at least 3 objects apeice, your heavier units around 4-5. This should give those warpstone runs an easy time or just looting the crap out of people.Also surround surround surround is the key, break enemy units moral and they cant attack! Unless its stinkin chaos, then they dont ever break-personal experiance. Also if you can and have grabbed secondary objectives go for the enemy cart and loot their idol and if you can their chest, you can get some good stuff somtimes from that!The game is susposed to be unforgiving due to mordheims nature as the boardgame and the fact its a gaint imperial city turned into a hell-hole of untold horrors of chaos, skaven, and undead (shame no undead faction...YET!) So those like X-com or the likes will enjoy this game, if your a casual gamer beware, as♥♥♥♥♥♥goes down the drain faster then a dice roll can when you get double 1's.The random roll dynamic fits it, sure you can have a guy with 90% chance to rip the other guy to shreds, but somtime sooner or later hes going to hit that 10% chance to miss, or the enemy dodge or parry is to great to beat. *continued*			"

I've put about 30 hours into it and while I find the warband progression more interesting then the combat, I may feel that way because the game makes me want to do the dam dice rolls myself with a proper tabletop warband on an actual table versus an actual opponent.

												This game is a very good adaptation of the tabletop game. Probably the only critique I have on the game mechanics is the huge focus on Wyrdstone, which, while giving it a sense of difficulty, gives problems in terms of trying to play it as a simple fight. You only get that time to play it like that when you collect and send out the shipment, but it's not for that long a period. But this is definitely a great game if you're into Games Workshop's tabletop games.			"

												I'd like to recommend this game as I do believe it is fun but I also found alot of people were put off and I was somewhat inclined to agree with them.  I bought the game because I personally enjoyed it and can live with its flaws but since this is a recommendation I personally wouldn't recommend it to someone else.With that being said, here are my views overall:The pros:1. It's a very indepth game, plenty to do and alot to learn.2. Clearly based on Warhammer rules including stats and skills which I love!3. Skaven! I mean c'mon!! Though I would personally prefer Lizardmen.4. Graphics are pretty decent.5. Gameplay is pretty fun and interesting and can keep me going for hours.The cons:1. Lack of content. I mean seriously.. alot of the maps are used too many times and only 2 acts per warband? meh2. Lack of races to choose from. Only 3 and only 4 if you buy the DLC.3. Having to buy DLC for extra units, no new races.4. Gameplay is rather difficult and the hit/miss ratio is rediculous!If you can tolerate an unbalanced hit/miss ratio similar to that of XCOM, or perhaps even worse, and enjoy Warhammer then this is for you but honestly if you can't cope with the frustration and don't like hardcore mode on games like XCOM where every loss counts then I honestly can't recommend this game. Also imo the price tag for this game is a bit steap due to lack on content, I'd recommend waiting for a discount if you're serious about buying it, which is pretty much what I did.Also, I wouldn't bother checking the forums, it's full of newbie haters who'd rather flame you than accept the fact that this game has flaws, they are worse than fanboys around WoW and that to me is pretty sad.  However, don't let the community decide your judgement of the game, fortunately they don't speak for that part, they just merely like attacking others, I guess it gives them a cheap thrill or something.  No doubt I'll get flamed for my comment here but haters will hate, infact if they do it merely proves my point.			"

												What an experience! So unforgiving and brutal, yet tactically challenging and rewarding on good days. Just don't begin to build up an affection for your warband as some bad days will follow unavoidably ... or really bad days.Normally Roguelikes aren't my thing, but this game is so fun and the lore and the factions are just great. The combatsystem is quite similar to the Valkyria Chronicles series (excluiding the direct aiming and in-turn suppression fire) and, in my opinion, is the best possible choice for this kind of game.Mordheim features a global progression that will make new attempts easier over time, but do not expect the game to hold your hand or to provide you with an alternative difficulty. Depending from various factors that you do not know before attempting combat the fight might turn from ""under control"" to ""last ditch effort to avoid getting pummeled"" rather quickly.  This is not a game about you nurturing your party through grind. This game is about improving yourself, trying out new things and always taking risks you might wish you would have avoided afterwards.			"

												Overall still love the game. However, a few issues.1. Stances. Percent to dodge and block should be automatic. Stance should increase the chance. Do no make my shield useless against an attack if I happen to not be in block stance.2. Charge VS Ambush. Make the Ambush range reasonable, or the charge range reasonable, or for god's sake put indicators on the ground. I cannot count the number of times I've been approaching an enemy in ""Ambush"" stance, setting up for a charge, only to get ambushed, when I CAN CLEARLY SEE THEM! On the other hand, I can count the one hundred million times I've been in ""Ambush"" stance only to be charged by a computer player. Make it fair or f*ck right off.3. Make the percentage the actual percentage. I wish I knew enough about programming to be able to read whatever code is going on in the background, but I seem to miss a lot more 70%, 80%, or even 95% chance to hit than I should. 7 misses in a f*cking row at 85% to hit isn't fair, and it isn't fun. This doesn't make the game more enjoyable when you do this, it just makes it unplayable. I've already disbanded several games and deleted the saves because while progressive damage and even losing is fun, it's fun to lose when it's fair. If I go into a ""difficult"" or ""punishing"" mission, I expect to lose, or for it to be hard. If I go into an encounter and make multiple mistakes, I expect to lose. If I go into an ""Average"" mission and miss multiple attacks in the 80% hit chance, only to have the enemy counter, and fail to dodge/parry multiple attacks, and then get my whole warband wiped out because the enemy got 3 criticals and 2 of my guys fail their ""all alone"" saves, that's not expected, that's not fair, and that's not fun. Why do you guys do this with your games?			"

												I was hoping and expecting a bit more from this game. Content is limited - only 4 warbands, very limited customization options for said warbands (at least as far as cosmetic customization goes) and after playing about 15  days/missions worth of campaign every ""mission"" has been... pretty much the same. There's some story missions but so far the main meat of the game just seems to be a repeating grind. ---------------------------------EDIT- There was a huge rant here about bugs that wrecked my gameplay experience. Those bugs seem to have been fixed and I removed the rant for that reason. I still believe it should not have been released as it did, however.--------------------------------I'm sure these issues can be fixed. (edit- and they were fixed) I'm sure it will be fixed. But in a ""full release"" it sure as hell should not have existed to begin with. Not even to mention the part where the Iron Man style gameplay is forced upon you. I don't see a valid reason why if desired the player can't just play a normal ""save and reload"" campaign. If the player chooses to savescum that's their business. No need to force it down people's throat ESPECIALLY if you can't prevent bugs like the one I mentioned from ruining the game experience.			"

												This game demands patience; not so much on the battlefield but with the loading times. On a high end machine it can take upwards of two minutes to load the battlefield. While the combat is certainly deadly for your troops, the act of combat couldn’t be more dull. Much of the time you are stuck trading hit for hit with no variety. Add to this the clumsy troop deployment and keyboard only based command system, and you have a game you should steer clear of.A real shame.			"

												As someone who has played the actual tabletop game, and still keeps several Warbands on hand (y'know, just in case)... I can very much reccomend this game to anyone that is a fan of the tabletop version. It has it's flaws, and there are bugs, but please keep in mind that this is an Early Access game. They are barely in alpha and aren't even finished making all the warbands.  I admit that the limitations of the program now do make it something that would be hard to play often, but as more features are released to people that have already bought it, the game will get much better. There are currently four warbands to choose from (June 2015) and they are Humans, Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar, and The Cult of the Possessed. The units included are all quite faithful to the source game, and the equipment loadouts are fairly self explainatory to anyone familiar with Mordheim, and easy enough to figure out for new players. Lack of leveling system is disappointing, but that will come in future updates. When the game is more complete it will have a lot more appeal to newer players, or people unfamiliar with the source material. Gameplay is fairly easy to figure out.  Move your character, perform action, etc. Combat animations look decent, the city has some nice detail and the maps look pretty good. Fun overall to play, though definately more fun with other players than against bots. The bots are fine if you just need a quick game, but for the best experience, play with friends.  All the best multiplayer games are ones that can end friendships. lol.TL:DR VERSION:   Good game. Currently would rate 6/10, only for limitations of early access version, but well worth investment. Great game, faithful to the source material, and fun to play with friends. 10/10 would buy again.UPDATE - Full Release Patch 2 -  Having played the campaign and had a chance to genuinely enjoy the game a bit now that it has hit full release, I can say that I still do not regret my decision to purchase this game. It remains a very playable, faithful adaptation of the classic tabletop game that still gets played in my house. Looking forward to the addition of more warbands and expanded content in the times to come.  10/10 would descend into the City of the Damned again.			"

												I made my mind up to give this a negative review pretty early in playing, but thought I'd give it a bit of an extra chance. Unfortunately, it's not really improved a great deal.I've played a lot of the Games Workshop games and I've enjoyed the vast majority of them. I liked the idea of Mordheim as something which has more of an inherent story built in as your warband develops and takes on progressively harder missions (unlike e.g. Dawn of War I which had very little natural storyline and Dawn of War II which moved away a fair bit from Warhammer 40,000). Unfortunately I felt they missed the opportunity to put in some sort of story campaign, or at least a heavier story element in to the pick your own adventure style campaign that is included.I'm not a huge fan of hardcore games (i.e. no saving and going back), but I appreciate that this is a conscious design decision by the makers. However, I feel that combining that hardcore element with a very steep learning curve decreases the chance that you'll actually keep playing long enough to hit an enjoyable point. I found myself repeatedly restarting as my warband increasingly reached the point where I couldn't do anything (e.g. everyone injured and no gold left). Perhaps it reaches a cruising point later on, but I've still never hit that and I feel like I've given it a fair crack.The warband tutorial is very dry and basically just gives you a slideshow of what all the buttons do. It doesn't give you worked examples which means you either have to remember it all, keep going back to the tutorials or just guess. They've tried to compensate for this by having guidance stuff at the beginning of every campaign you do, which gets pretty annoying if you've done it before. I think they could have combined the combat tutorials with a properly interactive warband tutorial to make a mini-campaign which would have been much more engaging.My main beef, however, with this game is the probabilities. Over my time playing it, I would say that 70-80% hit chances come off less than half the time. Perhaps I've been incredibly unlucky, but that's my experience. At best it makes the combat laborious as you wait for the whole turn cycle to go around again before you can attempt another hit. At worst, it screws you over as the opposition then piles a load of extra soldiers in to the combat and you lose all advantage that you had.			"

												It is a new pleasent spin on the tactical combat machanics of the old chess syle tiles to a semi-freeroam format. It is hardcore which just means you are required to use your head more in devising a way to defeat and/or meet the objectives required.			"

												A hesistant recommendation from me. It is a lot of fun and is mostly successful in translating both the mechanics and feel of the old tabletop game. However the RNG leaves me feeling so frustrated. Too many times do my 95% chances to hit work out as a miss. I know I shouldn't be taking probability personally but it just feels like extremely safe bets end up with failure due to consistent bad rolls. The percentage chances also don't square with reality - I have regularly had small percentage chances to hit large targets that were very near and in the open. The AI is also puzzling - I had a Skaven henchman run past 6 of my warband only to get the last hit on a wounded warlock at the back only to be cut down seconds later by his vengeful comrades. Skaven do not do that. Nobody rational does that - the AI was clearly programmed to prioritise him above everything else just to get the kill. The loading times are also long which doesn't really bother me but it might be frustrating for other users.It's a good game but in short frustrates me in a way the original never did.p.s. The Skaven need a nerf as of writing I have played ten games in a Skaven campaign and have won them all.			"

												I really like this game, it's addictive and is fun to play up to a point. But it is so demanding constantly, needing to earn gold to pay your warband, collect wyrdstones to send shipments and being constantly aware that one battle could be the end of your warband perminantly, even a technical win could result in a overall loss if some of your key members get poor RNG results at the end and end up loosing an arm or other injuries. While I do like the demanding nature of the campaign it makes the game something you can't really play when you're not paying full attention and it makes it feel not so much like fun to me. If they were able to introduce a way you could have duel profiles, one you could play seriously and was as it is now brutal, and one where things were more relaxed but not easy I think I would start recommending my friends to get this game rather than steer clear for now.

Early Access Review
								While I've only just started the game, I can say for sure that of the warhammer video game adaptations I've played, this is by far the best. Playing it on max graphics definitely lives up to the videos and screen shots that I've seen. The animations are still a little glitchy, but understandable for a very early release game. The movement could use some fine tuning as well. It can get annoying when you disengage from one enemy, try to walk around another and get pulled right back into combat. Overall despite the lack of players on at the moment, this is an absolute buy for any strategy game player. It takes all best tactical elements of xcom and brings it to the next level with a warhammer twist. But do not let the comparison fool you, this game brings much of it's own to the table compared to any other stategy. I can't wait to see upcoming patches and the full release.			"

												Mordheim: City of the Damned .An awesome game that simply needs polishing or at least modding....A hardcore game , 300% hardcore . I love it and it reminds me of X-Com: Enemy Unknown.There are several thing i LOVE . 1:NO♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SAVING .2:It`s Warhammer Age of Sigmar.3:Factions ( Skaven (LOVE EM ) , Adepts of Chaos (Disappoting) , Sisters of Sigmar (never heard of em) , Mercs and Witch Hunters (OP if you ask me))4:Customization is cool but could be better.5:The city is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥amazing ! Traps , shady pathways , destroyed buildings and mutation starting to take over the city . But there are thing that could be some much better in this game like:1:Skills are kinda lame ... Some skills seem to even harm you if you learn em. I would preffer X-Com like skill system or Faction exclusive skills with neutral skills mixed in or something like that ....2:Objectives : Poorly executed. Why? Cause to win you need to do a Primary objective and it`s simple . Route or kill all enemies , easy peasy lemon in your eyes squeeze ( Gives you 2xp) . Secondary objective kill and loot marked enemies(easy) , collect warpstones(easy-hard) , steal opponents flag and bring it back(Brutal) . (Gives you 3XP) Last one is total BS .... Primary 2xp secondary 3xp .... Just meh....3: Battle difficulty  : What is difficulty level does in battles ? It buffes your enemies with more health and damage that`s it ... lame as hell ((( It is rewarding though but there is no point in getting stronger because your enemies will ALWAYS be as strong as you are and have the same unit setup. So as i said lame as hell... GIve enemies more units or allow enemies to have reinforcements like in campaign missions...4: Units death : You would think that if your unit died ... well he died. Nope not here , we have KO`s here with an axe or a greatsword to the head . LOL . But here is a thing your unit that was KOed has a random chance of dying , you won a battle but your leader got KOed and BANG he is dead FUN!!! Otherwise there is an injury system that is really cool but at the same time I just hate it .... It just doesnt make sense to me ... 5: Ai turns : are SLOW as hell when you dont see their units ... All in all a fun game, soooooo .... BUY IT ! Me want MORE games like this =^_^=PS: I WANT ORCS AND MORE UNITS !!!			"

												Overall still love the game. However, a few issues.1. Stances. Percent to dodge and block should be automatic. Stance should increase the chance. Do no make my shield useless against an attack if I happen to not be in block stance.2. Charge VS Ambush. Make the Ambush range reasonable, or the charge range reasonable, or for god's sake put indicators on the ground. I cannot count the number of times I've been approaching an enemy in ""Ambush"" stance, setting up for a charge, only to get ambushed, when I CAN CLEARLY SEE THEM! On the other hand, I can count the one hundred million times I've been in ""Ambush"" stance only to be charged by a computer player. Make it fair or f*ck right off.3. Make the percentage the actual percentage. I wish I knew enough about programming to be able to read whatever code is going on in the background, but I seem to miss a lot more 70%, 80%, or even 95% chance to hit than I should. 7 misses in a f*cking row at 85% to hit isn't fair, and it isn't fun. This doesn't make the game more enjoyable when you do this, it just makes it unplayable. I've already disbanded several games and deleted the saves because while progressive damage and even losing is fun, it's fun to lose when it's fair. If I go into a ""difficult"" or ""punishing"" mission, I expect to lose, or for it to be hard. If I go into an encounter and make multiple mistakes, I expect to lose. If I go into an ""Average"" mission and miss multiple attacks in the 80% hit chance, only to have the enemy counter, and fail to dodge/parry multiple attacks, and then get my whole warband wiped out because the enemy got 3 criticals and 2 of my guys fail their ""all alone"" saves, that's not expected, that's not fair, and that's not fun. Why do you guys do this with your games?			"

												Personally, I dislike this game. Now don't let that get you down, because there's really nothing wrong with the game itself.If anything, if you're like me and you expect gameplay somewhat like turn-based dragon age, welp, you're looking in the wrong place. I think the best way to describe this game would be to compare it to darkest dungeon, but with better graphics and more confusion. And 3D. But of course, still the same amount of micromanagement, perma-death of characters, stress, and the game simply hating you. Another way to describe this game would be.... say... ""turn-based dark souls"". I think that should say enough.But hey, if you /are/ interested in a hardcore turn-based 3D game, then here's some stuff. This game allows you to choose between like, 6 factions, (two of which are dlc only but it won't tell you until you try to choose them), and build a warband with the units from that faction. With your warband, you go on missions, which are basically ""matches"", where characters take turns doing actions (order is determined by stats n' stuff) and you need to eliminate all enemies; there are also some side-objectives. This game has the kind of combat where you left click twice to attack, yet it is one of the most complicated combat systems I've seen, you know? Chances and stats and stuff? And targeting stuff? Ye. But don't expect to just go from mission to mission, left clicking enemies in a strategic way, no no no. You gotta assign stats n' stuff. You gotta equip yo units with stuff. You gotta let yo bois heal. You gotta hire new bois. You gotta manage ""wyrdstones"". And even in combat you gotta manage like 4 different resources per character every turn, like, no matter what. Basically it's hardcore af is what I'm saying.So ye. If you're up for a game that will take a while to get used to but then, like, you'll be used to it so you'll be like, liking it and stuff, and then you git gud n' stuff, and start understanding all the complicated stuff and... stuff... then ye. This is the 3D dark hardcore darkest dragon age dungeon board game for you. TLDR; It's complicated af, so only buy it if you know what it's like and want to get invested into it. Like, real deep n' stuff.			"

												This is a very rewarding tactical game with an impressive depth to it. The learning curve can be fairly steep, and the difficulty levels on the missions should be taken seriously: if a mission is marked as very difficult, expect it to be exactly that.  If you blindly rush into battle, expect to get slaughtered more often than not. With all that said, it can be played, it can be beaten, and it's a sheer delight when you do achieve victory.8/10			"

												If you like turned based strategy games you should pick this one up.  At over 100 hours I'm still on my first race.  The graphics are fine (nothing mind blowing), gameplay is fun.  I enjoy being able to use my movement points (SP) to wander around, then backtrack if I decide to take a different approach.  Real injuries that will have different effects on the party.  You can lose arms, legs, eyes, suffer brain injuries.  All of which will change the way the warrior plays the next time you play him.  Oh, and there is permanent death which really makes you want to make sure you plan out your attack the best way possible.Worth the price, but it seems to go on sale quite a bit if you want to wait.Pros-Fun-Challenging-Dark, depressing atmosphere really makes things menacing-Hits and missed attacks are critical     They can literally spell the difference between your warrior living or dying-Can be hardCons-Depressing losing trained warriors!

												I quite like the game, although it does get repetitive after a while. However the mercenary campaign ist absolute crap. Most of them are either either confusing (what needs to be done??) or it is super deadly (e.g. The Allurress one). They always take ages to complete and at least for the mercanaries it gets boring pretty soon, because they're storyline is not exactly building up on each other but rather most of the time it is some super powerfull boss/demon that needs to be slain for one reason or the other. Come one guys Mordheim offers way more stories than that!! All in all I'd say ignore the campaigns and have some fun with the skirmishes.  "

								I do a Bi-monthly checkup on all early acess games I buy.First off, Mordheim is a Warhammer game.I am obessed with Warhammer.So I usually get most Warhammer games that look good.This game is also turnbased.I hate most turnbased games.This game though is a gem among coal.Despite being in early acess (and me being a bit bias) This game is an absolute hoot to play. You get to make a warband in your own image. There are only four to choose from but I hope more are added later.Despite this I say that this game is a real pleasure to play and I can not wait for more content to be added.			"

												I absolutely love the old warhammer lore, so I bought this game just to support that; I've wanted it ever since the MMO servers went down. That said, in 2015, strategy games do not have to be turn based to be tactical, and I feel like playing this leaves something to be desired. I feel like they have a very limited budget or something, which is a shame because the world itself is awesome.Edit: Updating my review since playing more with updates since early access. If someone were to put everything they've added to this game, instead to Vermintide, the result would be one of the best multiplayer fantasy slashers ever made, with a massive fanbase of active players. As it stands, the core game mechanics are turn based and dice rolls. The warhammer board game I played in the 80s had similar mechanics. I'm switching my review to positive because they really did add great content and Fatshark should take note. But in 2016 I can't go from playing Witcher 3, to rolling dice to see whether or not I can jump off a ledge for my turn.			"

												This game demands patience; not so much on the battlefield but with the loading times. On a high end machine it can take upwards of two minutes to load the battlefield. While the combat is certainly deadly for your troops, the act of combat couldn’t be more dull. Much of the time you are stuck trading hit for hit with no variety. Add to this the clumsy troop deployment and keyboard only based command system, and you have a game you should steer clear of.A real shame.			"

												Purchased this during sale and havent stopped playing, was hesatent with the bad reviews.  But glad i got the game.  The gripes I saw were not enough factions, i'm sure it took alot just to do the current factions more in expansions maybe.  The perma death, wounds, and skill checks - heard alot of gripes on these, IT MAKES the Game to me.  You want to hit every time go play an RTS, a percentage is a percentage, yeah you can even miss on a 99% chance it's not rocket science.  I for one like the percentage ratios, Yeah it sucks for your favorite character getting a bad wound, but that's the breaks, protect it more, don't be a kamikaze.  I like the game for those reasons, it really gets my heart pumping when my favs are in a tough spot, im on the edge of my seat and if they die, then I just have to groom another character into my favorite.  So for me all the negatives other people seem to no like,  are extreme positives to me, it's what makes the game in my opinion.  I hope they make lots of Expansions for this game because i intend to play and play and do every warband faction, so it will be a while haha!!  MY only gripe is I have lots of people I can upgrade but can't because of money, maybe i'm doing something wrong, but i play lots of missions but somehow am always broke, maybe I need to open more chests, i used to not untill i started finding gold in them, now i try to get them.  So will see if my poverty stays.  BUT for anyone who loves Turn Based Tactics like I do and doesn't like a boring walk in the park,  THEN like me this Game is a Must have.  Wussies need not apply though haha, because it is not easy. it is a genuine Challenge...			"

												First I'll state that I DO recommend this game if you like tactical games, however I'd like to point out that when you first start the game its extreamly hard due to how bad off the very first team will start, but the game is designed be like this as I'll explain.You start off with nothing, and the first few fights will likely see most of the starting warband (squad) wounded or dead, however all is not lost. As you complete fights win/lose, you gain Veteran points that improve the next warband for the next play through. I'll not say anymore in fear of spoiling the entire system set in place, but the game gets better the longer you play.If you are a person who resets a game at the first defeat or are always reloading from saves, than this game will frustrate you because there is no going back once a fight has started and no checkpoints to restore from. You have to learn to roll with the damage and carry on. After 24+ hours spent in straight fights I'm really loving the game and I'm still only on my first warband. Love the game, only downside I've really seen is the enmey AI will most the time simply shoot to kill and ignore any other objective.			"

												A hesistant recommendation from me. It is a lot of fun and is mostly successful in translating both the mechanics and feel of the old tabletop game. However the RNG leaves me feeling so frustrated. Too many times do my 95% chances to hit work out as a miss. I know I shouldn't be taking probability personally but it just feels like extremely safe bets end up with failure due to consistent bad rolls. The percentage chances also don't square with reality - I have regularly had small percentage chances to hit large targets that were very near and in the open. The AI is also puzzling - I had a Skaven henchman run past 6 of my warband only to get the last hit on a wounded warlock at the back only to be cut down seconds later by his vengeful comrades. Skaven do not do that. Nobody rational does that - the AI was clearly programmed to prioritise him above everything else just to get the kill. The loading times are also long which doesn't really bother me but it might be frustrating for other users.It's a good game but in short frustrates me in a way the original never did.p.s. The Skaven need a nerf as of writing I have played ten games in a Skaven campaign and have won them all.			"

												I burn a lot of money on tactics games.  This is hands-down the best one I have ever played.  F*** the naysayers, the mordheim rng is a beautiful thing.  Playing a warband tells a story of struggle and triumph that feels real.  I love all my characters.  Amazing.  Simply amazing game.			"

												This game demands patience; not so much on the battlefield but with the loading times. On a high end machine it can take upwards of two minutes to load the battlefield. While the combat is certainly deadly for your troops, the act of combat couldn’t be more dull. Much of the time you are stuck trading hit for hit with no variety. Add to this the clumsy troop deployment and keyboard only based command system, and you have a game you should steer clear of.A real shame.			"

												This is a very rewarding tactical game with an impressive depth to it. The learning curve can be fairly steep, and the difficulty levels on the missions should be taken seriously: if a mission is marked as very difficult, expect it to be exactly that.  If you blindly rush into battle, expect to get slaughtered more often than not. With all that said, it can be played, it can be beaten, and it's a sheer delight when you do achieve victory.8/10			"

												I like Mordheim.  If you have the system to run it.  It's an asynchronous adaptation of the original that's very pretty with a collection of neat tactical environments.The developers were quite good during Pre-Release in terms of responsiveness, and I think overall they pushed out a good product, unfortunately they no longer support 32-bit systems.  Early on when they updated there was a brief time when Mordheim would not work on 32-bit systems but it was soon corrected.  So I'm a little surprised now that despite the last words being ""We're dedicated to our 32-bit fans and are working diligently to get it up and running on 32-bit systems"" (a paraphrase rather than a quote), there's been no update to fix the issue or any further communication on the issue since October 2015?  You'd think that they could give us an update ""We're still working on it"" or ""Yeah, we tried, but we can't get it done, sorry y'all.""It happens that system requirements change, I can't be bitter about that, but this behavior strongly implies that the money has run out and that future patches/fixes are simply not forthcoming.  Since I can no longer play, I'm not sure if it's worth $40.  Get it on sale.			"

												Note: My review is only based off of the experience that I've had during the free weekend trial that recently occurred.Mordheim: City of the Damned is a very good game.  It consists primarily of two parts, the first being warband management where you hire/fire/manage your mercenaries, deal with their items/skills, and fufill your wyrdstone delivery.  The second, is the primary part of the game, which is the turn based tactical strategy where your warband squares off against another warband in the ruinous city of Mordheim.  The graphics are decent but feel slightly dated if you zoom in a lot (a High-Res texture pack would be nice but definitely not necessary) and the sound and music are very fitting for the game.  However, graphics and sound aren't as important; The strategy is where the game truly shines as there can be a lot of depth, planning, and positioning involved to come out victorious on the battlefield.  Unfortunately, as good as the game is, I can only recommend it to people who are okay with the following points. Early game difficulty - The game can be extremely brutal to players early on in the game if not played properly.  As you progress through the game, you'll gain access to better gear, enchantments, etc that increases your troops' effectiveness and reliability to the point where you'll consistently win if you don't make terrible decisions/mistakes. RNG screwing you over - The RNG can screw you over.  Now, to make it clear, there are a lot of reviews out there that claim that they miss consistently with 80% chance to hit.  I would just like to point out that most of these people are missing the fact that the enemies tend to be in a defensive stance at the end of their turn.  You need to pass the chance to hit roll AND the enemy has to fail their dodge/parry roll in order to hit.  But back to the point of RNG, early game is where RNG is the most volatile and 60% chance to hit feels like 20% and 80% feels like 50%.  I've had times where I failed a climb up with 82% and then failed the proceeding one at 92%.  Or times when you attack one single enemy with 4 of your units and they all miss.  There were some runs where most of enemy team spawned closer to my cart than my own team did.  It's RNG, the only thing you can do is learn how to improve your chances or how to handle it.   The game is extremely TEDIOUS -  Some of it is due to bad design (I'll expand more on that later), and progressing through the game can be very slow at the beginning since the battles can be VERY time consuming, especially since you want to minimize risk at the beginning.  And if you want to complete the side objectives for additional Exp and items, you'll usually have to do it after a good majority of the enemy team is dead but before they rout meaning you'll have to keep several of them alive on purpose and tank them in order to do the side objectives.  You can spend hours on a character only to have him/her fall in combat once and all of a sudden, he/she is missing a body part and is now suffering from brain damage and now has to pass stupidity rolls every turn (It IS possible to get a full recovery after falling in combat but is very unlikely without using an item).  Or he/she is dead.  Hours of work down the drain from one mistake.  But that's life.The AI is decent but isn't always consistent.  There are times that they'll see you, hide out of line of sight, and then flank your archer out of nowhere but there are also plenty of times where they'll run into your band one or two at a time and you can basically overpower them if you've kept your band together.  There are also pathing issues that are very apparent when they run into an invisible wall such as a long wooden ramp leading up into a broken mansion and they get stuck there, allowing you to slowly whittle them down with your ranged units.  The AI also seems to have more health and deal more damage than you do.  I suppose it's to compensate for their lack of human ingenuity, but I've never liked artificially inflated difficulty that's achieved by throwing in more health and damage.There are also a lot of design choices that don't make any sense to me.  For example - Jump up in place a couple feet (if you can).  When you land, do you feel like it hurts more than jumping off the third floor? Put your hand on your keyboard.  Now move your body over to the left or right about an inch.  Are you suddenly unable to touch your keyboard anymore? Are you often unable to put any textbooks into a schoolbag because you've already put 4 pencils in that bag? Do you often go to work and at the end of the work day, leave work immediately without your belongings or your paycheck because the work day is over and you must leave exactly on the dot?If you've answered yes to these questions, then you are probably existing in Mordheim!  OR you're an out of shape Tyrannosaurus Rex with huge pencils and a possible developmental disorder and you should probably go to a doctor to get it checked out (the out of shape and huge pencils part that is, being a T-Rex sounds awesome).If you fail a climb up, you not only fail to climb up (duh) but you also take damage, up to 13 for jumping up a couple feet (Skavens do land on their back, I'll admit, they deserve that damage).  Most of the time, I've been seeing 9+ damage for failing climbs...  Meanwhile, failing a roll for jumping off the floor is...  6-16. And this is entirely unaffected by the armor class you're wearing.  So it's very VERY possible for you to be wearing cloth armor, jump up a couple feet and take MORE damage than you would if you were wearing heavy armor and jumping off the third floor.The next couple design choices make the game extremely tedious.  You get action prompts for certain things in the right positioning, such as picking up wyrdstone.  Unfortunately, move a pixel and poof, all of a sudden you lose the prompt for it.  I can't recall how many times I've gotten the prompt to do something, double clicked but apparently shifted a bit, and boom, I'm in dodge stance.  It's even worse when you do it in front of your wagon chest, as not only are you unable to deposit your items with that character that turn, you also block the your other characters from depositing items because no matter how close they are to the chest, they have to stand on THAT particular spot in order to open the chest.  Another time this gets tedious is when you're picking up Wyrdstones and they're all in a group.  You'd think you can pick them all up in one go if they're that right next to each other but NOPE, you have to pick them up ONE AT A TIME.  And sometimes, you're not in range for a particular wyrdstone EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF IT.  Which means you'd have to move and that costs a strategy point because you'll perform an action.  And items (other than gold) don't stack either meaning a wyrdstone fragment takes up the same amount of space as a piece of armor.  This makes ferrying items to your wagon chest extremely tedious.  And the worst offender in this game?  The battle ends as soon as the enemy warband routs or their last member dies.  You immediately leave the map without being able to pick up any items.  Yes, a small portion of whatever is left on the map is picked up when you win but you have no control over it so it could be (and usually is) the most worthless stuff in the map while you ended the match in front of a whole bunch of wyrdstone clusters.  All these design choices make the game THAT much more tedious and difficult in a bad way.I also found myself constantly opening the map to check my positions (that map also needs a car mirror/camera disclaimer that objects on the map are closer than they appear) so a mini map would make that part of the game that much less tedious.Overall: Recommend but not for everyone.

If only the leader is left with minimal health, and I've managed to surround them with 4 people, How they kill 2 of them and almost kill my leader is beyond me. Especially with my Archer guy being like 3-6 ft away and only having a 26% chance of hitting. Maybe, I just don't understand the mechanics of the game to well..

												7/10Good things:Based on the tabletop game of the same name and has a very tabletop vibe.  I found mordheim very challenging while strangely intreguing.  The graphics are solid and aid the grim atmosphere.  I enjoyed the Warhammer fantasy setting but that may not be for everyone.  Combat is similar to XCOM and looks simple but requires a deal of planning to fight effectively.  You will fail frequently, learn from those failures.Bad things:Lots of RNG, the game is similar to XCOM, and if you are good with the whole RNG stratagy aspect and enjoy that you won't mind.  If you hate that then you won't like it here since Mordheim cranks the RNG up to 11.  Units will die or become so damaged you will have to replace them a lot.  You will fail frequently, and it can be very frustrating with the RNG.			"

												I thorougly enjoy this game. It offers the tactical gameplay I have been craving. I entered during the early-access period and while for awhile it was dissapointing, the developers have certainly delivered on their promises. Mordheim offers a rogue like flavor with the ability of your warband members to become severly injured, both physically and mentally, and even die during the campaign. The ability for you to play against other people and have the same consequences of playing the campaigns is a big draw. Don't fret however if your warband becomes crippled. Your profile maintains passive advancements for being a warband leader, such as lower cost hiring of new warriors, or training old ones. So if you need to dismiss either a few people or your entire warband you still maintain some key forward momentum.The few complaints I have include the extensive load times, and a bit of lack of explanation in some abilities. The self cast abilities and some spells don't quite have enough explanation for what they actually do. So unless you can remember rather well you either have to test it once during the mission or write it down. This is balanced by the fact that the advancement is paced well enough, that you use the abilities with such a high occurence to become familiar with them until you purchase and train in your new ones.I Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys brutal, competitive, and tactical gameplay with a grim and dark fantasy setting. 8/10			"

												A nice suprise.Never played Morhiem table top, but love the WH world, so figured why not give it a try.Good:-Its different than other strat games. Its not Xcom with WH skins, its not Jagged Allaince with WH skins. Its a different type all in its own.-The models are amazing. I am in love with playing with my little Skaven warband. All the models look great.-Lots of options to customize your warband. From tanky to quick, from range to melee, etc. etc. So far it seems like you can make 2 warbands of the SAME faction and play them totally different.-The premise of ""Mordhiem"" is awesome. Looting a city to fulfill an order while competing with other warbands...very neat.Bad:-I know...I know...Mordheim is hardcore. At the same time its a GAME than needs to make MONEY. Appealing to more people (i.e. difficulty levels, saves, etc) would get more people that are dont play PC games to stroke their e-peen.-Wish there were more factions. Just 4? Yes they are done well, but dang...would love to see at least 2 more.-Performance. Its not bad, and load times are MUCH better, but still odd to get some slow downs now and then. -As a single player only, it would be cool to see some 1v1v1 fights, not just 1v1. All in all if you like Warhammer, and if you want something different you cant go wrong. If you are turned off by upper difficutly (although I hear its gets easier) watch some lets plays.			"

												If Xcom & Warhammer were put in a blender, mixed up a bit, you would end up with Mordheim City of the Damned.The game is good; but; can come over brutally unfair. I've only played 6 hours, and already had to restart a couple times either due to failing a mission putting me in a downward spiral of debt or just not understanding the mechanics of the game (in my first play thou').There is a bewilding array of stats and options available, my advice is to just dive in and start playing. Give the tutorial missions a whirl first to get a grips of the game then go for it. As you play you will grasp the stats and what is going on, I guess one small gripe with the game is a lot of things are not explained. A glossary or some way to look up terms would help;  over a few games I realised pressing B shows Buffs, press it again will show the debuffs.Another feature I'd like to see added is a small map in the bottom right corner of the screen (UI). When starting any mission I spend a good few minutes switching between the map just to make sure I am heading in the direction I thought I was.Games can be tense, maybe feel unfair, especially if one of your warband get caught out. I done a quick video let's play video if you want to see more, I've playing as Skaven. :)

			If you mixed Xcom with Warhammer you would end up with Mordheim City of the Dammed. It's a turn based, strategy game where you have to scavenge the city of Mordheim with your Warband.

Solo play with multi play so either or you are set. Decent fun in just the warband screen lol. Change uniforms, names all the good stuffs. Game play is good. Fights are unfair to you. Fun just the same. Bad.Unforgiving, as in do not pay attention to the % they put on your screen. Insert cake is a lie line here. Bad story line. Do not do the missions unless you out rank them quite a bit. Or have hours to look for things.Good game over all, do not expect to ""win"". Do not get attached to a warband, it will die, in the face, alot. There are no real tactics in the game, think more of tabletop with a cpu. Or if you get it Big Blue vs. you. Fun, fun game.			"

												Enjoy the game, battles are great. Suggestion to those that want to add a challenge, just play all maps with auto deployment, especially maps where you are spread out. Makes every game challenging to the point of getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked and very easy to lose your best people, which is pretty darn exciting.			"

												I've had alot of fun with this game, and i recommend it to everyone who isn't a crybaby. I had to start over a few times before i figured out how to play it. Now im finally getting the hang of it, and it gives me much fun :)It is brutal! Unforgiving! ..and NOT for people who will break down mentally if they lose a precious item...like your left arm  (Happened to me lol)If you want a challenge, then this is for you :)			"

												This is an awesome game - quite true to the table top which I loved.I'm a big fan of small unit tactics, but also that there is no back or escape option - once you start a game you have to take the result good or bad.Heartily enjoy this computer varation on a board gameI'm hoping that they might add additional groups into the future - Dwarves, Elves, Pirates			"

												Only a short time playing so far, but this is the game I have been looking for.  I love it!  To be fair I really like roguelike games and am familiar with the Ironman concept.  Also like team tactical turn based games.  I can see myself playing this game a lot.  Love the way skavens look to.			"

Good faction diversity.Have not tried multiplayer, i figure i would get owned. Im slowly getting a good idea how to play with the easiest faction, the human mercenaries. Now the carrot on the stick is there, character development and gear upgrades....It's pretty heart rending when you lose one of your best warriors, developed over time with specific skillswell worth a a good few dozen hours play time			"

												Well having played Warhammer... and its cousin Warhammer 40K in the Tabletop game mode.... you could say I was pretty prepared for how brutal this game can be. You absolutely need tactical play or it will grind you to dust. Always have a backup plan, you are playing Chess, where each piece and its move matters. And even if you do everything right... bad luck can bring you down. Yes, I admit its incredibly atmospheric, strategic, and tactical. I love this game... but yeah I can easily see how it could make you rage quit at times. BUT... yes... even when things look their bleakest... you can still win.... just when you least expected to.

												This a hidden gem.I would have never bought this game on my own but received it in the Humble Monthly, and I am sure glad of that.While not the most pretty in graphics and the UI is not that initiative, this is an insane amount of fun if you enjoy tactical squad games similar to Xcom.Being rogue like in its saves and the hard difficulty it can be both frustrating and rewarding. The 18 hours I have played (so far) has been a blast and has created some memorable game moments. Do yourself a favor, play the tutorials and then read some game guides while starting up. Wish the DLC wasnt so expensive, it strikes me as out-of-place considering it's just new factions IMO.Now back to the problem on hand, a high level tank of mine has suffered a skull fracture, making them have to roll against their intelligence each turn or do nothing for that turn, but in combat that they regain their clarity.....to fire this bloat or to keep?

												I want to start this review by saying I love the Warhammer universe and I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't.  I have given it more than a fair try and it just isn't fun.  I believe there are several balance issues that need to be addressed.  More than once I leveled up a powerful warband made, high leadership, high toughness, only to lose to continually failing terror tests against the likes the undead or wonky ""All Alone Tests"" when characters were not alone.  I wouldn't mind losing a character to injuries if the fight felt fair, but 9 times out of 10 that is not the case.  Avoid this game unless you like punishment.			"

												Another great game for masochists, are you a good strategist? Too Bad!  Feel the hateful touch of RNG-sus!  nearly every action has a percent chance to succeed which you can pretty much ignore because of how often a chance over 90% will still fail.  You would think the point of the game is the combat, but no.  You lose the game if you don't collect enough green junk off the map and keep your squishy losers alive to deliver the junk to your loan agent.  That's a bigger pain than it sounds like since you essentially have to gather crap before any of the enemies show up.  Once any enemies appear they make a beeline for the first of your characters they see and Jack them up.  If you want any of your team to survive you have to give up on everything but fighting and hope you nabbed enough greenies to pay off your warband loan for the week.       I can't imagine using a caster enough to train one up to being good, especially considering most of the magic seems to punish you to varying severities just for using it.  How does a spell that curses the caster with random ailments in order to give a character +10% chance to hit but they also receives 10-20 damage whenever they attack sound?  Laugh or rage whenever your agile rat archer fails to climb a brick wall and busts their♥♥♥♥♥  Start off your campaign by having your mushy fresh characters get wrecked by the automatically superior forces in the first few levels.  It's pretty tricky to feel confident in your warbands' future when most of your troopers are permanently crippled or dead from the first few missions.    This game can be summed up in two activities.  Desperately push your plodding troopers to loot a map for meteor boogers then engage your oponent in frustrating match of miss me dodge you while holding your lucky rabbits foot and four leaf clovers to pray for a lucky win.  This game can produce some really intense frustration when your characters suck and die through countless horrible rolls of the dice.  10/10- I must be lucky! I missed that attack with a 95% chance to hit!			"

												It's good, my favorite of the X-COM-alikes. I played Skaven, Empire, and Undead and progressed until I had a level 10-ish warband in each. A few pros and cons:Pros:1. Races feel distinct and none feels too strong or too weak. Weapons and armor feel balanced.2. The game does a good job in making you use tactics and the environment to win over an enemy that will almost always be stronger than you are. As Empire, I had a clump of ranged that moved around and focused individual stragglers or used chokepoints while my tanks took damage. As Skaven, I was mobile enough to converge first in the missions where you start out in separate packs. As Undead, i'd have zombies distract and occupy enemies while my crypt horror and vampires focused the rest down. 3. RNG is just right for me. Part of tactical games is to have a backup for your tactic; if my 85% chance to hit guy misses...what do I do? I've never had those one in a million streaks some of these other commenters have. One in a thousand? Sure. But not one in a million.Cons:1. Campaign missions aren't very good. Endless waves of reinforcements while you try to get that last objective. 2. AI will get stuck on stuff. The large creatures especially will get stuck on stuff. That ends up giving a lot of variance to the difficulty. 3. Many of the skills are almost never worth using. Overall pretty good and worth buying (maybe on 50% sale, those come around fairly often).			"

												I thorougly enjoy this game. It offers the tactical gameplay I have been craving. I entered during the early-access period and while for awhile it was dissapointing, the developers have certainly delivered on their promises. Mordheim offers a rogue like flavor with the ability of your warband members to become severly injured, both physically and mentally, and even die during the campaign. The ability for you to play against other people and have the same consequences of playing the campaigns is a big draw. Don't fret however if your warband becomes crippled. Your profile maintains passive advancements for being a warband leader, such as lower cost hiring of new warriors, or training old ones. So if you need to dismiss either a few people or your entire warband you still maintain some key forward momentum.The few complaints I have include the extensive load times, and a bit of lack of explanation in some abilities. The self cast abilities and some spells don't quite have enough explanation for what they actually do. So unless you can remember rather well you either have to test it once during the mission or write it down. This is balanced by the fact that the advancement is paced well enough, that you use the abilities with such a high occurence to become familiar with them until you purchase and train in your new ones.I Recommend this game to anyone who enjoys brutal, competitive, and tactical gameplay with a grim and dark fantasy setting. 8/10			"

												Third mission - A Rat Ogre tears off my best archers right arm.  Not willing to pay for his recovery, the man suffers for a few days and dies alone in the ruins of Mordheim.  The city is both capricious and cruel. Not only does it make you fear the consequences of every misstep, it gleefully punishes you for each one.  There is no ""save-and-quit, try again"".  There is no mercy in Mordheim; expect none and give none.  The true god of the setting, the RNG (or Tzeentch for the knowledgeable), is fickle and treacherous.  Trust not in the 95% chance hit, for it is a lie.  All is a lie - there is only Warpstone, and gold.  Glory, truth, honor, chivalry - leave these at home, for the city will drink your tears if strive for them.  There is only survival.This game is really fun.  I've never quite played a game with this degree of difficulty.  It's the Dark Souls of tactical RPGs, but at least Dark Souls has save points,  This might sound like its not for you, but trust me.  Every victory is all the sweeter when it came at the cost of one of your henchmen's eyes and a harrowing, intense battle amidst the insanity of Mordheim.			"

Yes, I played the original tabletop Mordheim.This game is epic and I've clocked up 36hours in three days.Most of the negative reviews seem to be from people that don't understand the mechanics (which don't take that long to learn btw - you can have fun playing from the first game with little knowledge). The game does take a lot of time, but with that in mind, it's deep. In my 36 hours, I've only played 1 warband and I'm still not bored.The game could be improved with: 1) more skills from the tabletop game i.e. skill that allows skaven to wield a weapon in their tail; 2) more graphical customisation options; and 3) better spell animations (other animations are great, just not for most spells).

												All in all, the game is fun, with a high replayability. You can quickly get attached to your warband characters and will feel woefully sorry if one of your highlevel soldiers looses an arm or a leg or gets killed on a mission. The six warband all have their distinctive features and play differently enough to use them all. Levelling options give you a great number of choices - better than XCOM2. Character customization is o.k. but  might be improved (more head or at least hat types) and a little less varied than in XCOM2. The game itself is fair enough, you can choose between ""Normal"", ""Hard"", ""Brutal"" and ""Deadly"" mission types. So far I have only attempted ""Normal"" missions, as - depending on your starting position and your opponents - even these may be challenging at times. Story missions so far are o.k. as long as you can avoid mistakes like not keeping your warband together. Beware that the game runs always in ""Ironman mode"", there is no savescumming and when your characters die or get maimed, they stay dead or crippled. Perhaps the introduction of some exit points on the maps would be a good idea. At the moment you can only ""abandon"" a mission  at the cost of injuries to all party members or end the mission by failing a party morale check - difficult if you have high leadership stats, as that means you will have to have almost all your high ranking characters out of action before party morale falls below the critical value.There could be more maps though. However the existing maps are big and as starting positions and weather conditions (day, night, fog) vary it doesn't get too boring. But two or three more maps would be nice. Hopefully the devs keep adding content to this game. It's much better than ""Darkest Dungeon"" and almost on par with XCOM2.			"

												The controls are absolutely abysmal. Feels like a straight port over from a console (although I have it on good authority it isn't), absolutely no thought given to using a mouse. On top of that, the UI is too cluttered with unnecessary stats and the grammar for the English version at least is horrendus.It's a good thing that despite those complaints it runs well and is generally enjoyable to create and customise a warband. It's not a very good game that relies solely on the IP and lack of diversity in the warband genre.Still, I'm having fun on it and will probably put a lot of hours into it. Wish it was better though.			"

												If Xcom & Warhammer were put in a blender, mixed up a bit, you would end up with Mordheim City of the Damned.The game is good; but; can come over brutally unfair. I've only played 6 hours, and already had to restart a couple times either due to failing a mission putting me in a downward spiral of debt or just not understanding the mechanics of the game (in my first play thou').There is a bewilding array of stats and options available, my advice is to just dive in and start playing. Give the tutorial missions a whirl first to get a grips of the game then go for it. As you play you will grasp the stats and what is going on, I guess one small gripe with the game is a lot of things are not explained. A glossary or some way to look up terms would help;  over a few games I realised pressing B shows Buffs, press it again will show the debuffs.Another feature I'd like to see added is a small map in the bottom right corner of the screen (UI). When starting any mission I spend a good few minutes switching between the map just to make sure I am heading in the direction I thought I was.Games can be tense, maybe feel unfair, especially if one of your warband get caught out. I done a quick video let's play video if you want to see more, I've playing as Skaven. :)

Product received for free
												Note: My review is only based off of the experience that I've had during the free weekend trial that recently occurred.Mordheim: City of the Damned is a very good game.  It consists primarily of two parts, the first being warband management where you hire/fire/manage your mercenaries, deal with their items/skills, and fufill your wyrdstone delivery.  The second, is the primary part of the game, which is the turn based tactical strategy where your warband squares off against another warband in the ruinous city of Mordheim.  The graphics are decent but feel slightly dated if you zoom in a lot (a High-Res texture pack would be nice but definitely not necessary) and the sound and music are very fitting for the game.  However, graphics and sound aren't as important; The strategy is where the game truly shines as there can be a lot of depth, planning, and positioning involved to come out victorious on the battlefield.  Unfortunately, as good as the game is, I can only recommend it to people who are okay with the following points. Early game difficulty - The game can be extremely brutal to players early on in the game if not played properly.  As you progress through the game, you'll gain access to better gear, enchantments, etc that increases your troops' effectiveness and reliability to the point where you'll consistently win if you don't make terrible decisions/mistakes. RNG screwing you over - The RNG can screw you over.  Now, to make it clear, there are a lot of reviews out there that claim that they miss consistently with 80% chance to hit.  I would just like to point out that most of these people are missing the fact that the enemies tend to be in a defensive stance at the end of their turn.  You need to pass the chance to hit roll AND the enemy has to fail their dodge/parry roll in order to hit.  But back to the point of RNG, early game is where RNG is the most volatile and 60% chance to hit feels like 20% and 80% feels like 50%.  I've had times where I failed a climb up with 82% and then failed the proceeding one at 92%.  Or times when you attack one single enemy with 4 of your units and they all miss.  There were some runs where most of enemy team spawned closer to my cart than my own team did.  It's RNG, the only thing you can do is learn how to improve your chances or how to handle it.   The game is extremely TEDIOUS -  Some of it is due to bad design (I'll expand more on that later), and progressing through the game can be very slow at the beginning since the battles can be VERY time consuming, especially since you want to minimize risk at the beginning.  And if you want to complete the side objectives for additional Exp and items, you'll usually have to do it after a good majority of the enemy team is dead but before they rout meaning you'll have to keep several of them alive on purpose and tank them in order to do the side objectives.  You can spend hours on a character only to have him/her fall in combat once and all of a sudden, he/she is missing a body part and is now suffering from brain damage and now has to pass stupidity rolls every turn (It IS possible to get a full recovery after falling in combat but is very unlikely without using an item).  Or he/she is dead.  Hours of work down the drain from one mistake.  But that's life.The AI is decent but isn't always consistent.  There are times that they'll see you, hide out of line of sight, and then flank your archer out of nowhere but there are also plenty of times where they'll run into your band one or two at a time and you can basically overpower them if you've kept your band together.  There are also pathing issues that are very apparent when they run into an invisible wall such as a long wooden ramp leading up into a broken mansion and they get stuck there, allowing you to slowly whittle them down with your ranged units.  The AI also seems to have more health and deal more damage than you do.  I suppose it's to compensate for their lack of human ingenuity, but I've never liked artificially inflated difficulty that's achieved by throwing in more health and damage.There are also a lot of design choices that don't make any sense to me.  For example - Jump up in place a couple feet (if you can).  When you land, do you feel like it hurts more than jumping off the third floor? Put your hand on your keyboard.  Now move your body over to the left or right about an inch.  Are you suddenly unable to touch your keyboard anymore? Are you often unable to put any textbooks into a schoolbag because you've already put 4 pencils in that bag? Do you often go to work and at the end of the work day, leave work immediately without your belongings or your paycheck because the work day is over and you must leave exactly on the dot?If you've answered yes to these questions, then you are probably existing in Mordheim!  OR you're an out of shape Tyrannosaurus Rex with huge pencils and a possible developmental disorder and you should probably go to a doctor to get it checked out (the out of shape and huge pencils part that is, being a T-Rex sounds awesome).If you fail a climb up, you not only fail to climb up (duh) but you also take damage, up to 13 for jumping up a couple feet (Skavens do land on their back, I'll admit, they deserve that damage).  Most of the time, I've been seeing 9+ damage for failing climbs...  Meanwhile, failing a roll for jumping off the floor is...  6-16. And this is entirely unaffected by the armor class you're wearing.  So it's very VERY possible for you to be wearing cloth armor, jump up a couple feet and take MORE damage than you would if you were wearing heavy armor and jumping off the third floor.The next couple design choices make the game extremely tedious.  You get action prompts for certain things in the right positioning, such as picking up wyrdstone.  Unfortunately, move a pixel and poof, all of a sudden you lose the prompt for it.  I can't recall how many times I've gotten the prompt to do something, double clicked but apparently shifted a bit, and boom, I'm in dodge stance.  It's even worse when you do it in front of your wagon chest, as not only are you unable to deposit your items with that character that turn, you also block the your other characters from depositing items because no matter how close they are to the chest, they have to stand on THAT particular spot in order to open the chest.  Another time this gets tedious is when you're picking up Wyrdstones and they're all in a group.  You'd think you can pick them all up in one go if they're that right next to each other but NOPE, you have to pick them up ONE AT A TIME.  And sometimes, you're not in range for a particular wyrdstone EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE PRACTICALLY ON TOP OF IT.  Which means you'd have to move and that costs a strategy point because you'll perform an action.  And items (other than gold) don't stack either meaning a wyrdstone fragment takes up the same amount of space as a piece of armor.  This makes ferrying items to your wagon chest extremely tedious.  And the worst offender in this game?  The battle ends as soon as the enemy warband routs or their last member dies.  You immediately leave the map without being able to pick up any items.  Yes, a small portion of whatever is left on the map is picked up when you win but you have no control over it so it could be (and usually is) the most worthless stuff in the map while you ended the match in front of a whole bunch of wyrdstone clusters.  All these design choices make the game THAT much more tedious and difficult in a bad way.I also found myself constantly opening the map to check my positions (that map also needs a car mirror/camera disclaimer that objects on the map are closer than they appear) so a mini map would make that part of the game that much less tedious.Overall: Recommend but not for everyone.

												The game mecanics and graphics are average at best. but as a whole it has a good feeling to it.I was really psyched about this game expecting competetive ladders and warbands fighting other players warbands.and you had a team you really worked with building up.In the end you can only play it in campaign mode against the computor. since there is never any games to join in multiplayer and if you create one yourself there is never anyone joining. Seems weird that i should be the only one playing this game so i guess the game makers ♥♥♥♥ed up so you can only see a small certain select group of people and if there isnt any online its empty. They could have made the matchmaking functions SO much better.So in short it´s an entertaining game if you like this kind of game and you like single player without any challenges. But for me it was a bust.			"

												This game is adictive and somewhat fun when things go right or at least half right. Being set in the realy Warhammer Fantasy world helps a lot, think GW was wrong in killing it off, but that is different. Character development is interesting and allows you to do what you want. Combat is quick and feirce. And I have to say the challenge is there.Problems are, I can't make it to warband level 5, nor really ever get a character to level 5. Difficulty is high, even when fighting an ""normal"" battle. The AI seems to always have more luck then you, particularly when you have a 95% chance to hit, and sit there missing two or more times in a row. I never seem to find any usefull blue or purple gear. I find my self nearing warband level 5 and all the enemies are on steroids, not sure if their equipment is blue/purple but they always hit, and always seem to get the drop on my guys. At this point I typically lose 2 games in a row hard, and don't have any fit warriors left to fight. I get loseing guys is part of the game, but 3 in a game is rough, twice in a row, and now you have level 0 guys fighting full upgraded level 3 and 4s, just makes things go south fast. So yea, while challenging, it is far more frustrating then pure enjoyment.			"

								I was very disappointed when the first Warhammer games were RTS. Warhammer is all about Turn Base Strategies and Mordheim puts the tabletop at your control. Creating your own warband and then placing them on the map seeing an actual battle take place from their point of view one move at a time. I feel they had captured the spirit of the tabletop game and I cannot reccomend it anymore than I do. Big thumbs up from me for finally bringing turn based to Warhammer since that was what it's meant to be. Now the hardest part of the game is trying to figure out which faction I want to play.			"

Lots of patches - this is good as the devs are working on it 6. I'm having a lot of funCons1. Weird camera angle issues (at times)2. Long loading times (this is just too annoying in my book)3. Playing with a controller is a must - keyboard is too anoying4. fighting can feel stale 5. some strange UI decisions that seem overly complicated6. can easily get lost in the game (sense of direction)7. some of the percentages of success/failure seem offIf you love warhammer fantasy and turn based games this game is fine though not spectacluar. It's slower paced and definitly not in the same category as vermintide (which is mordheim on steriods).At this point I'd say 39.99 is too much. 24.99 and below would be about right for what the game offers.Is this a must have - definitly not. But there's some fun in it.			"

Early Access Review
								It's pretty good considering that it's still in development, I hope they'll add an RTS style strategy view at some point. It's playable right now and I haven't really found any bugs other than occasional AI pathing errors that result in the AI being unable to complete their turn, as well as the game not realizing whose turn it is and being stuck at ""Waiting for opponent"" but I'm certain the devs have already acknowledged the existence of these bugs and are going to fix them in the future.Currently, the game is quite bare bones (that is certain to change). You can play as 3 factions (though they'll be adding the carnival of chaos soon) and are currently unable to customize your heroes and henchmen very much at the moment, other than in equipment. Classes, stats and abilities remain unchangeable at the moment. Also, currently the only visual differences between units of the same class are in weapons, but I'm sure they'll be adding visual differences between heavy armor, light armor and clothing in the future. Can't wait until they add progression, I want to see my inexperienced skaven thugs turn into true clan Eshin assassins. I do hope you'll be able to customize the name of your heroes, henchmen, and warband in the future, for the sake of other players, anyways (assuming you can't do that now, and I'm just clueless). I'm perfectly happy with my (hopefully) randomly generated warband, ""The Murderous Murderers of the Murderlord"".Graphics are great too, but I am unfortunately unable to experience graphics without lag (i still lag on lowest settings) because I have a weaksauce non-gaming graphics card.Overall, there's a lot of content that hasn't been added yet, but there's a lot of awesome sounding stuff listed as coming soon. I hope the developers deliver. Seems like it'll make a fun game.			"

												If you were expecting a faithful interpretation of the original tabletop game then prepare for disappointment for this is not the game you're looking for. The only similarities between this game and the original are that you're playing a warband management and battle game that has character progression, random loot tables and is set in GW universe's Mordheim. Deeper inspection, however, reveals that even these shared attributes are more dissimilar than they are similar.I'll start with my number one grievance with the game that is also the main thing you'll spend your time on: combat.The combat in the tabletop Mordheim is about odds calculation, risk assessment and careful positioning that aims to maximize the risks your opponent must take while minimizing your own. There's strategic beauty and elegance to this general concept that reveals itself to you when you start to comprehend the multitude of variables and see the matrix open before your eyes.In the PC game, however, you have no easy way of assessing how far you can move and you have no idea about the ranges of attacks and abilities. The camera is set behind the character whose turn it is, and despite the function that lets you see the entire map from above, you generally struggle to get an idea where you are and how to get where you want. Often you waste several turns just trying to navigate out of a multi-level house because there are only couple of set points you can jump down from and you can't openly inspect the map to find them. Sufficient information is simply not provided to you, which forces you to adapt a trial and error approach, which erodes any strategic merits the game might have otherwise had.The game also uses its own way of calculating hit chance, damage, armor saves, stats and even health that differ entirely from the tabletop game, making the game less accessible for us experienced with tabletop Mordheim.  Fair enough, the tabletop version is by no means perfect, byt why would you replace that system with something alien, more complex, and arguably, even worse?As if all of this wasn't enough the developers also added a horrible UI that makes even the simple task of charging an enemy a fiddly process that requires you to move your character back and forth to find the right distance from the enemy to enable the action. Each character also has their own 'bubble' that stops you from taking actions if you enter them, making positioning a constant nightmare, especially since, as mentioned above, you have no sense of ranges.And then we have the A.I... I really don't get it why the devs get this so wrong so often. No, you can't make up for bad A.I. by giving it an artificial advantage over the player in form of better stats and gear. That's the cheap way of doing it and ends up with A.I. that is is incredibly unrewarding and frustrating to face but at the same time easily abuseable. I'd go so far as to say that even if all the other issues were ignored the terrible state of the A.I. alone makes the campaign mode unplayable.The final insult to us who now prefer PC versions over the tabletop games because the real life version takes too much time, is make us wait for the A.I. to finish all its moves, slowly, one character at a time, even when the movement is not visible to the player... Why would you make your players wait and stare at the screen for nothing?The thing I personally enjoy the most in these type of games is the leveling and character management system. I just love seeing my guys advance, get new skill and stats, better gear etc. Unfortunately, this was also ruined by a stat restricted system that forces you to spend vast amounts of gold and several campaign turns to learn a new skill. You can't exactly go fight without your leader, and each wasted turn makes it harder for you to complete the time based objectives the game gives you.If I sound needlessly harsh it's because I am tired. Tired of seeing developers time and time again waste golden opportunities by taking something with good concept and great theme and then, rather than improving on the original games while staying as faithful as possible, proceed to s*it all over it and give birth to an abomination only Clan Moulder packlords could appreciate.

												**********RECIEVED ON HUMBLE MONTHLY*******************Fantastic underrated game! I wish there were more people to play against in multiplayer it really is a lot of fun. Single player is a great time and I have been waiting for a game like this for awhile. You have your persistent warband that stays with you in multiplayer and you really get attached to them so when they get injured you have to change your strategy.My first warband I made when I was first trying out the game was terrible and I just threw a bunch of guys together. It was awesome. I knew it was gonna be great fun when my leader lost his arm and his leg and it really shows it in the character model and changes his stats! He had a cute peg leg and could dodge REALLY well. Could only hold a dagger but it didnt matter it was ♥♥♥♥n hilarious. Throughout my playthrough many of my warband lost limbs and I think that I just got really bad luck. But it also made me invest in agility and changed how I played. It was LIT.Get this game! It has amazingly deep gameplay and customization, you could spend hours figuring out how you're going to outfit your group. GET IT it's lit fam			"

												I actually had no problems whatsoever from the performance side, except for one thing that kills this game completely for me and i don't see myself playing it any further. The waiting times while the AI moves drive me crazy. I started to Alt Tab out of the game because i was getting sick waiting. (i AM an impatient person). Waiting for hidden movement to be done while they loot, jump, and whatever the f*** they do is not fun.I was looking forward to a hardcore game, everything looks great from what i've seen but the waiting, i can't take it, let me speed this up and i might reconsider it, huge design failure in my book. (Apartently technical difficulties)			"

												First off its one really terrible thing to continue releasing new warbands as DLC. Its another thing to make those warbands overpowered AND put them into the game as opposition. Why? Why do you continue to torture me like this?! Seriously don't buy this game, it obviously isn't finished yet. Gameplay is good, sound is good. Gets a little repetitive. I got my moneys worth out of it before they released this so-called dlc.			"

Early Access Review
								It ain't 30 bucks finished, that's for damned sure. Buy now, wait unknown months for it to be worth the money.It's fitting that it's a Games Workshop property, since it charges way too much for what you're getting.			"

												What would otherwise be an enjoyable, if slow, turn-based squad tactics game is completely ruined by terribly designed campaign missions with ridiculous, poorly explained goals.  Even so, they would be survivable if it wasn't for the pathetic gimmick of endlessly spawning enemies, a poor substitute for actually designing a challenging enemy team.			"

												I wanted to like this game. Honestly I did. I Uninstalled and reinstalled at least 3 times before i left it for good, if that tells you how conflicted i was. I'll throw down some pros and cons then elaborate on specifics.Pros: +visually pleasing considering the time+elaborate and complex combat/level up system+loot system: special weapons and items can be found at random on quests+customizable teams: decently customizable. Each individual can have their color and costume changed as well as be given unique items and weapons to improve combat capabilities+3 playable factions(more with dlc)+Perma-death and permanent consequences(pro for hardcore game lovers)Cons:-Failure Countdown: you are expected to ship a certain number of 'crystals' to your faction leader every few weeks and the number is always ridiculously high at lower levels. you are allowed a few failures on this, but but the game only lasts as long as you can keep sending these 'crystals'.-No gameplay variance: the only, ONLY way to play this game successfully is with the element of surprise. Stick to shadows and pray to god you aren't spotted first. This style of play can be fun, but it gets old. There needs to be more options than the whole cloak and dagger routine. -the dlc are in the game already, but you can't use them. They show up when you first select your faction and you think ""oh cool, i'm gonna be these undead guys cause that sounds cool"" but nope, you gotta buy dlc for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's them just flagrantly slapping you in the face with the ""you just payed for our game, so we'll try milking you for more money by showing you what you're missing out on by not buying the dlc"" card. Real douchey move. Especially for a full priced game. When all said and done, all of these sins are forgivable. This however, is not. The A.I. is complete BS. They know. They just KNOW. They know where every item on the map is,they know the map layout, they know what to do and exactly when to do it, the only thing they don't know is your position before you are discovered(it's like they're oblivious morons to your whereabouts beforehand), but once you're found, there's no way to escape their pursuit. The most BS thing about their A.I. though, their turn time. Never, not once, did a turn of mine last even remotely close tothe time of one of theirs. Even my longest most thought out turns against their most simplistic, theirs is longer. Too much time is spent watching your troops stand around looking stupid. Seriously, half my time spent in this game was waiting for the bot to finish its turn. And that is an unforgivable, unredeamable flaw. If that were fixed, this would be a highly enjoyable and challenging game. but alas, the developers couldn't figure out how to make their A.I. think its moves a little quicker even though they already know all the details about the map and where they need to go. Good day gentlemen and ladies.  "
