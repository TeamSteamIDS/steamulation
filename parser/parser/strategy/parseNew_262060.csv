												To anyone reading these reviews who is confused by the massive swings between positive and negative, you need to know one thing: Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.What a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of ""correct"", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.HOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.As you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a  moment  rather than just a nice bonus. It can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a ""tactical retreat"" as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never  meant  to have it easy, that it's  always  been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure. Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.

Early Access Review
								This is a living review, I will continue to update it as my experience evolves; see comments for additional updates.TL; DR Overall, the game is fun and I can foresee getting many hours of solid gameplay out of it which is why I have recommended it.  Be prepared to experience the consensus ""cons""; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game.  If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it.The most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG.  All of these things exist in varying degrees.Combat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long.  The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit).  They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat.  If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous.The chat bubbles also leave something to be desired.  They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat.  I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted.  This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming.  Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly.RNG.  I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc).  I've chosen to recant that.  RNG is crippling, but only in the early game.  Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance.  Early on, resources are tight.  You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission.  You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels.  Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE. You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc).  Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions.  In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one.  As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful.Getting crit increases stress by 15-20.  Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10.  Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game.  When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right.  My personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order.  There exists a ""SPD"" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order.  Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system.  It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim).  The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack).  This becomes further complicated when trying to ""combo"" attacks.  IE. Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it.  Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action.Beyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features.  Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me.  I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight.  What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative.  Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive.  I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50.  Not to get too invested in ""real life"" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of ""real life"", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span).  The same could be said of what happens when you ""gamble"" on opening chests/sarcophagus.  It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward.Combat positioning and class synergy are very cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time.  This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting.  Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or ""practice"" mode that has some examples of ""combos"" would be helpful.  IE. a guide that says, ""Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T"".  The town is also neat.  The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful.  Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming.  Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss.  Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult.I've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost.  I whole-heartedly disagree.  Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it.  Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does.  Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat.  Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing.Class balance could be improved.  There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts.  I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless.  Jester, other than people abusing their ""stress heal"" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well.Ultimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay.  Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic.  When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated.  Early game can be THAT frustrating.  Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall.  Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though.  If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun.  My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game.  I suspect we will.If you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon.  The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers.			"

Early Access Review
								Games like this are the reason why I really wish Steam's ""do you recommend"" question had more than just two options. Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.First, the good.Darkest Dungeon is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the ""hard"" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.The stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the Cthulhu games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.Oh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.The game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...KR Rating: [5] GREATBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, Darkest Dungeon is a hard game.Well, no, that's not really accurate. Etrian Odyssey is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. Darkest Dungeon is not hard, it's unfair.See, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called ""curios"" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the ""retreat"" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like Dark Souls in a way.And the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.The developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the Darkest Dungeon. There are no heroes.No, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)That's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just ""recommend"" or ""not recommend."" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.But ""great"" and ""universally enjoyable"" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.If I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.That said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.If you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.(Read the review on Knight's Reviews by clicking here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com])			"

												I feel like I have to post a new review because all of the reviews that are pre-December, site problems that have been addressed. Red Hook released a huge bug fix and ease of use patch that was specifically designed so that players who dislike certain mechanics (like the stress for ""delaying"" a fight) can just turn them off. Red Hook is a company that does pay attention to the player base, the problem is that the player base is greatly divided. There is also an extremely vocal minority running a massive smear campaign on the internet, going so far as creating new steam accounts for the sole purpose of going through every positive comment and marking them unhelpful. While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.Now that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.This game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level ""WTF"" moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with. This game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like ""The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy"" or ""the game is anti-fun now"", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a ""balance patch"", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be ""fun-killing""). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.I'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.Edit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.Release Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release. I recommend this game 100%, and it will only get better from here, as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months.			"

								Imagine being stuck in a car for a fourteen hour drive. With three people you hate. While every other driver on the road is either drunk or deliberately trying to run you off the road. And you only have one sandwich left. And no head lights. Thats basically what the first few missions feel like. After that, it only gets harder because your driver has been blighted, your navigator was killed, and the other guy ate the sandwich because he had been driven insane. Eventually, after replacing a few people, you get to the point where, after a few pit stops, you manage to get rid of them and youre happily riding along with great people, and you think nothing bad is going to happen because youve got the perfect group of passengers. Then an eightteen-wheeler smashes your car killing all of you. Thats basically how this game plays. 10/10 would make that drive again.			"

								This game is the most frustrating, aggravating, infuriating game I have ever played. It is stacked against you. You will lose characters you spent time and gold building up, you will quit in anger, you will feel like the game will not allow you to win.It's fantastic.The whole point of the game is to see these psychological effects dungeon crawling and fighting terrors from beyond the grave would have on normal people, and it drags you down with it too. This game gets into your head and messes with you.I'll be trying it again tomorrow.			"

												Here's why people are giving negative reviews: because they want everyone to be alive in their roster. Because they spent so much gold removing negative quirks and whatnot.You WILL die in this game, whether you like it or not.Confident that your party is able to take on a particular dungeon because they are now higher level? Nope. Not happening. Random Collector spawns and kicks your party's♥♥♥♥♥ This is not about RNG, it's about complacency. If you go into this game thinking that you want all your characters to be perfect and nice, rainbows and glitters everywhere, then this is not the game for you. If your party makes it through alive at the end, you should thank your ancestors. If you are a perfectionist, this will be a very hard game for you. Your characters are essentially cannon fodder, disposable like daily contact lenses. Occasionally, you buy monthly ones, but you don't use them forever. They all have a 'shelf life'. At some point, they will become redundant or die. Nothing lasts forever.			"

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!“What, you'd like to know my story?  There's not much to tell, I'm sorry to say. I came here, same reason as you – for glory, for gold. And not one man can fault me with cupidity, no. I tempted good friends, capable friends, spewing that very promise, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.“Like pigs to the slaughter. “The first month was uneventful at the estate. Harried heroes came and went, but my friends and I were heartier fare. We spent what treasures we pilfered on libation, often causing a ruckus in the tavern. New adventurers would swagger in, ♥♥♥♥♥ure, and we'd put them right in place. We'd usually frighten the greener ones off... the rest would perish, often crying out – for God, for their mother, for the sweet release of death. Fools. “My friends and I, we don't adventure anymore. We tend the estate, greet would-be heroes such as yourself, to give fair warning. All your skills, all your learning, all your experiences past mean nothing here. You will die, likely alone and raving in the dark. Death is all that you can count on. Death is all you will know. “What, my necklace? No, these are no ordinary charms, child. These are my friends, you see. I carry them with me still, even after death. They quiet my mind, when the dark comes, you see. It was the least I could do; their bodies gave me sustenance – their bodies give me sustenance, HA, and don't let them tell you, CONVINCE YOU, that their hands were forced. They came willingly, yes.“And so will you.”Darkest Dungeon is an RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler – and yes, I've written this phrase so much it autocorrects genres without prompting. I've named my dog “RPG turn-based roguelite dungeon crawler” and he hates me. But I digress. Story is that your wealthy relative has died, not before sending you a letter, urging you to come to the ancestral♥♥♥♥♥♥hole to spruce things up and purge the ancient, unknowable evil that lurks, broods, and taints up the place like an unruly teenager. The game starts off with a neat little tutorial, explaining some of the nuances of gameplay: tactical placement of characters, attacks, effects, etc. These are all standards we've come to know and love in the genre, nothing out of the ordinary. But there are a few twists that set Darkest Dungeon apart. When you set out on a journey you'll select your adventurers, and there are a lot to choose from. Some are tanks, some are roguish, some are healers, and some suck (stupid damn plague doctor I HATE YOU SO MUCH). You can select your character order as well, and right clicking on a portrait provides insight into their ideal placement. Different heroes provide different bonuses, like scouting ahead to spot traps and treasure. After you pick your team you'll need provisions, a risk and reward proposition...  are you detecting a pattern? You'll need food for characters, particularly on the longer treks (there's even a camping/survival mechanic to replenish health and stress for such undertakings), or they're liable to starve. You'll need torches  to light the way and keep characters from intermittently having nervous breakdowns. And you'll need various health items to keep bleed and blight effects in check. Does this sound like a lot to juggle? Because I am not doing the death-defying, chainsaw spinning, greased up, foot juggling spectacle justice, I assure you. There aren't enough words. After your quest these provisions don't carry on to the next journey, unfortunately. So do you risk spending too much, or spending too little? Both carry consequence. But there's more.Every hero and heroine has a stress bar beneath their health. With each enemy encounter, trap, and the act of WALKING, the adventurers will accrue stress. This is countered by killing blows, critical hits, and some support abilities. Inevitably someone will reach their breaking point after one too many knock knock jokes and one of two things will happen: they'll rally courageously, lowering their stress and everyone elses, or become afflicted. This affliction, whether it be cowardice, masochism, irrationality (and more!), means you won't always be in control of that hero, often to their detriment and the team's. After you clear (or flee) a dungeon you return to the estate, a hub where your weary adventurers can get some much needed R&R. Mirroring the core gameplay, your decisions in the hub world are deeply tactical. Some characters are religious, and will only be willing to visit the abbey to relieve stress. Others will happily drink and gamble their sorrows away. And as less savory quirks develop (buffs and debuffs gained through adventuring and R&R, separate from affliction), you can send them to the sanitarium, where presumably all the fun is. All of this is costly in time and money, and you'll have to manage carefully. Fresh heroes and heroines are wheeled into town after every adventure, but they are newbly in nature. With each subsequent successful quest, estate properties unlock, providing you the ability to upgrade abilities, armor and weapons, survivor traits, and more (you can upgrade your town's buildings to improve their respective output). Expect to spend a lot of booty.After enough victories more procedural dungeon locales unlock, bosses become available to fight, and the game gets tougher. I'm not joking when I suggest that YOU, the player, will experience every quirk, affliction, and solace your characters do. I was paranoid. I was stalwart. I was masochistic. I was even hagiophobic (the last time a game introduced me to such cool vocabulary was Eternal Darkness). That is an accomplishment. And it was all worth it, every second of crawling, creeping madness, to play this game.It's only February 2015 and this will easily be a contender for GOTY, of that I have no doubt. The art direction is spectacular; beautiful and visceral at the same time, like an old, dusty, medieval anatomy book. The turn-based attacks are so cool, so varied. The enemies are bizarre, terrifying, and menacing. The heroes and heroines are flawed, heroic, almost real. The dungeon crawling is rewarding, the victories are often bittersweet, and the office cooler conversation potential of this game is off the charts with so many variables. But the narration, sweet tap dancing Allfather, Allmother, and every Allrelative in between, the narration is amazing. It's omnipresent, in the hub and dungeons, raising hopes and dashing them in dulcet tones. It's like Vincent Price and Paul Frees' (Disney's Haunted Mansion) voices got married and Cthulhu officiated. I have a few teeny, tiny criticisms. The game can be unrelentingly punishing at times, unfair even. And while there is no fail state per se, things can get so bad that you'll want to just restart. I'd like the option to play a game in which I can save. XCOM has a save mode AND  an Ironman mode, and I'd prefer that option here as well. There are also little technical glitches here and there, grammatical and spelling errors occasionally. That's about it. That's the sum of my complaints. I'd like to be able to save and there are a few little errors. And this title is in Early Access, which means we can anticipate lots of fine tuning and HOPEFULLY some cool additions as well. But what's already here, what's already been done, is spectacular.It would be a grave crime against the Elder Gods to pass this up, and madness will surely follow.			"

Early Access Review
								I have to say probably the  best purchase I have ever made , and yes I still say it post Corpse and Hound. I picked this game up right after its release and unlike most people I like it now more than I did before, allow me to explain why this game is easily worth the $20. First of all you won't like this game if you fit into the following two categories:  If you don't like turn based games or RPGs this game isn't for you, pretty strait forward.  If you don' like a challenge, and I mean a real challenge, if you put most of your games you play on easy and then prance through them congratulating yourself on a stellar job this game will bury your pride along with your party of heroes pretty fast. Its hard.  Why do I like this game (the pros):  The narrator is great. fits the mood so well and makes everything come to life with the expansive vocabulary and deep timbre. The artwork. Its superb, every review out there whether positive or negative will say it. It has the best art of any game I have seen a long time and like the narrator it helps the world come to life. The animation, though minimalist, is beautiful and powerful and really helps you feel the game. The sound is also great and helps build mood as it changes depending on how dark it is in the dungeon. At pitch blackness you hear the squeals, groans, shouts, or other sounds of the dungeon enemies off in the distance and during battle the music is louder and more ecstatic, making everything so much more tense. The aesthetics of this game alone make it work and suck you in, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg. The gameplay (I said it, and I'll talk about why other people be hating later). I have always loved tactical turn based and this game is the cream of the crop. There are so many options when it comes to how to defeat your opponents. The enemy monsters are varied and that determines the tactical choices you make. It is brutally unforgiving and thus it takes actual planning to get a good hero lineup and execute with top efficiency; however no hero, ability, trinket or consumable is overpowered (some people say monsters are overpowered... but I'll get to that later). and there are so many ways and lineups to be used to clear dungeons. The tactical battles and overall strategy (the economy, stress heal, and leveling up) go hand in hand. So why are other people not suggesting the game? You can scroll through all the negative reviews but you only really need to read one to read all it basically: ""the patch ruined everything."" But yet I don't buy into that train of thought and I will explain why:Pre-corpse and hound patch the game way simply too easy, it was all over the forums too. ""This game is too easy its boring"" or ""after early game its a walk in the park"" were the complaints. Unlike currently there was an ""overpowered"" strat where they would take a crit loaded team with two powerful front line hitters and two back line supports into a dungeon, snuff the torch, and then go ham destroying the front line enemies thus exposing the back line enemies while the supports buffed them up to hit even harder. Battles could be over in two turns. Heroes that didn't work into that formula were never used, like the grave robber, plauge doctor, crusader and bounty hunter. Yes every hero was viable but nothing could clear dungeons like a crit loaded dark run (they also gave you the most gold because as the dungeons get darker the more gold you can find). The Corpse and the hound added two unique mechanics that threw off the crit loaded dark runs. The first was corpses. Now when you kill and enemy his corpse remains, meaning that the weaker back line enemies can stay safely in the back line and keep throwing their stuff at you. This screwed over the crit-dark runs because now you had to hack through an enemy and then hack through his corpse to clear a path the back lines, making the battle go longer and thus their crit-dealing heroes took more damage. The second mechanic added was PROT or protection to enemies, heroes had always been able to get PROT by the means of a trinket but it was never that big a deal (why would you get a PROT trinket when you could just get a trinket that would boost your crit chance for your crit-dark runs?) PROT basically mitigates damage taken, and now that enemies had it (some had very high amounts) it took the crit-dark run damage dealers a few turn to hack through what used to be an instant kill. Both these additions made battles last longer but also opened the space for new mechanics and strategies. now dark runs were much more risky because of the amount of damage you could rack up (in the dark monsters hit harder and more accurately). But an added mechanic was the DoTs (damage over time affects) like poison and bleed completely ignored PROT and if you killed an enemy with DoTs it didn't drop a corpse. The heroes that had DoT's were the heroes that were considered useless before the patch, they didn't become super overpowered they simply became an actual option that could work. Basically ""the patch"" made the game harder and that cause a lot of long time players that had forgotten difficulty and were (to use game analogy) ""fattened by decadence and luxury"" to rage because they were unable to adapt. People say things like ""This game used to be a gem and now I would recommend it to ANYONE!"" the unfortunate thing is that if the game had had these mechanics since the beginning everyone would have loved it due to the difficulty. And even if you are scared by all the ""the patch ruined everything"" reviews, know that the developers knew this would happen. In the corpse and hound patch notes they said at the end that ""we will be tweaking these mechanics because we won't know the exact results until after implementation"" and they have as of 8/18  nerfed enemy protection and made corpses weaker.   Final thoughts I love this game, and the devs, Its only gotten better for me. I encourage anyone looking for a challenging game that will pull them into the lore and world to look past the negative reviews that all say the same thing. I wrote this review because I feel obligated to let everyone know why some people are mad. At the end of the day, despite the ""patch"" or PROT I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone remotely interested. 10/10 would go stalwart again.  "

Early Access Review
								This is not one of those games for perfectionists. Your monument to success here is built atop a mountain of failures. And that mountain will be staggering. Your characters will die, either going down swinging valiantly or from something extremely stupid because the entire world was out to get them at that particular moment. Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops. Sometimes you're just using recruits as stepping stones to get more upgrades to maintain your main fighting force, who are still traumatized from their last incursion or who are getting their negative traits tortured out of them in a medieval sanitarium. The game is designed around this, it expects you to do this, and it will passive-aggressively chide you for doing it. You burn through more recruits than a standard game of XCOM: UFO Defense, and that's an accomplishment.So despite all the suffering, is the game good? Extremely. It is remarkably complex, difficult and addicting. You will almost never have an ideal scenario, so you have to learn to adapt to every scenario, learn who or what is worth investing in, and work towards that as your goal. Another body in the ground is another cobblestone on your road to success, and expect the ground to be littered with more corpses of adventurers than you will remember. To you it was the most important day in your life when you saw your companions die from a heart attack, bleed to death, and get mangled by a buzzsaw, but for me, it was Tuesday, and soon enough, it will be Tuesday for you as well.Grim/dark			"

												DD has something that is missing from the current generation of sandbox style games - a really satisfying loop. Off to the depths with your party to kill some monsters, grab some loot, get sick, go insane, and stress out, then back to town to recover, heal, relax and level. The town portion has a relaxed sports management game vibe, while the dungeon crawls can be tense and challenging. Each phase is short enough though that there's always interesting strategic decisions to make. Unlike XCom style games though, even a party wipe doesn't crush your progress, because there's always more characters on the development mill. Sooner or later something WILL go wrong - that's RNG. ;) It is a grind, but a fun interesting grind which ensures you shift focus at regular intervals, and it is nice to play a game full of neurotic characters who's best option may well be to run away to fight another day. For the first hour it will punish you and you will hate it, but soon morbid fascination will seduce you to its bleak and withering charms. :)Edit: Ps. If you don't like games with punishing RNG (e.g, you hate Blood Bowl), you don't like games with strict loops (eg. Stardew Valley) or get bored with procedurally generated Rogue inspired games then you won't like this.			"

												Ah.. Darkest Dungeon... I kept myself from writing a review until I was able to finish the whole game. And now that I finally did it, im ready for this. The question is: are you?There's a lot to discuss about this piece. You maybe ask yourself : why so much negative reviews about with 100+ hours of gameplay? There is a clear answer (if you haven't read the other reviews, of course) but I'll explain it later. This is gonna be long, I can feel it. Take a cup of coffee and take your time to digest all the information im gonna give you:>AtmosphereSurely the most interesting point of the game. The art style, as you can clearly see is amazing, fabulous. I could even marry it. The characters, environments and enemies are pieces of art incredibly well done. Music rocks too. Narrator is so cool. >Before going into the combats themselves, I'm concerned I should explain what's everything about in a short way: old rich man living in a town, wow such hookers and alcohol everything is amazing but oh wait my mansion has some kind of dark sorcery stuff better waste all my money in expeditions to find what's all this about. Oh monsters I could never expect this etc etc etc so now the man is broken and needs the help of weirdos that come to the town with the promise of money (more or less like mercenaries, as I see it). Got it? Yep that explanation sucks. But the lore is cool and is better to discover while playing.>In Darkest Dungeon City Simulator 2420 you have some buildings that must be upgraded in order to be useful. It will take a long to have the Town at its fullest but you know, take it easy. Everytime you do a mission with a party a week passes in the game, and between weeks you can prepare the next expeditions, upgrade buildings, check the lore or cry for the hero ""Trump420blazeit"" that you lost in the last mission.>RNG: means Random Number Generator, and can be your best friend or worse than Hitler forcing you to eat broccoli. Basically im talking about luck. Darkest Dungeon depends a lot on RNG, is one of the points that people seems to complain about more. I agree with them, because at a certain point of the game your skill does not matter as far as It should. Pray at your god, will be more effective. >Combats are very well executed and give you the feeling of the battle, but I would like to point the STRESS. It's gonna be your worst nightmare. Your dear ''heroes'' will suffer it a lot when fighting, and when the number reachs 100, you're f****d because it triggers an event. This implies your hero getting totally mad or emerging victorious and becoming the hero of the heroes. Much luck involved again. However, watching your hero becoming the boss of the world among the chaos of the battlefield is amazing. But if he gets mad, he will refuse to be healed or swap position with others, so get ready for the worse. Maybe it sounds obvious, but if a hero dies we won't be able to fight more. Can't bring him to a Pokémon Center, you know. Anyway if you're lucky there's some events in town that could... Help you. > I Tend to call them heroes but they aren't. This is important. They can die. Anytime. Even from a crit of the weakest enemy of the game. But more will come, and after losing your most loved characters a few times you will understand what's all this about. This is about decisions. Every one counts, and can make you achieve a precious victory or lose your entire party when the boss is at 5 hp. Consider when to play safe or take risks, because Darkest Dungeon is excellent at one thing: making you regret your mistakes. (Oh, I still miss Carlos IV).>Bosses: of course a game of this class must have bosses! Every boss appears 3 times, so you have to beat it in aprentice, veteran and champion. Champion is the real♥♥♥♥♥♥and I have to take several pills in order to talk about it without crying, full detail later. (This review is starting to lose the point but I'm actually enjoying it). As I was saying, bosses are extremely difficult without preparation and knowledge about them, so It's on you if checking guides or not. I won't blame you. Nobody will because we all did it after losing an entire party vs the Brigade Pounder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) But anyway they are very rewarding, in loot and in the feeling of victory.>Curios: basically furniture and stuff that can be interacted with objects, and can give lots of cash or bleed/blight/diseases/etc If you risk touching them without protection. I suggest checking the wiki in order to not waste many resources, as they are very limited.>As i pointed a moment ago, the quests of Champion difficulty are crearly unbalanced. Enemies have sick amounts of dodge and critical %, and minibosses appear very often in the rooms you explore. In these missions is where RNG shines a lot, and if you didn't take interest in understanding how curios and positioning works you'll fail miserably. Or not. Who knows?NOW LET'S FACE THE REAL♥♥♥♥♥♥/b>YOU THOUGHT PEOPLE ONLY COMPLAIN ABOUT RNG? OOH POOR FOOLOnly if you're ready I'll proceed to explain what made me hate the game as much as I love it.>The fact is... Well... The last scenario is the Darkest Dungeon (no spoilers, chill) and consists of 3 missions + the final boss itself. To complete this missions you'll need to farm a lot. But a lot. I mean send parties and parties of low level just to get loot, die and be replaced to use this money to enforce the best members of the roaster. Because you'll spend an indecent quantity of money in replacing quirks, curing diseases, upgrading armors and weapons and curing stress. Then you'll have an entire party at It's maximum and all of them will die in the mission of the last scenario :D Because this is it huahauah I'm not even mad but It happened to me and FeelsBadMan it hurted more than my father's belt.> I completed the game (including all the bosses) in 280 weeks aprox, but I took my time. The most sick players do it in like 22 weeks but trust me is a suicide. Just take your time and enjoy the game. There's no rush and It's hard to get used of it.>The developers seem to take care of their game, because are nowadays upgrading free content, events, new quirks and even enemies. The patch had some major bugs and were fixed in less than an hour so hey! I appreciate that. On the other hand, a DLC is coming soon and still can't tell much about it. For now I only know I'll go back to Stardew Valley in a journey to forget everything I saw in Darkest Dungeon. Too much feels, too much emotions.>For now, this is It. I don't know if someone will even reach this point of the review but if you did thanks for reading! Hope it helped you. I completely recommend the game if you're looking for a challenge in your Steam library. Even after all the bad moments Darkest Dungeon gave to me, I'm still gonna hit the ''Yes'' button of recommendation.""Sucess so clearly in view... Or is it merely a trick of the light?""Edit: wow guys thx for the good comments :) If you would like to see more revs I made a group, trying to become a curator:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/uritearevsThe group is almost empty, but if you wanna join, everybody's welcome.Cheers!

												After a successful battle the haunting voice of the narrator of Darkest Dungeon speaks to me, stating that “overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer”. Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I’ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it’s a warning. Darkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I’ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I’ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting. The premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive. There are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy’s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.Perhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes. Before even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.With the game saving automatically as you go along, there’s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.I truly love this game and can’t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.

												TL;DR: Community Outrage Simulator masquerading as brutal dungeon crawl. 10/10, would read a thousand angry, formerly-positive reviews about corrupt devs instead of playing a great game again.I picked up DD over the summer, drawn in by a sociological interest in certain members of the ""community's"" outrageously toxic backlash to the implementation of corpses and some other changes. Obviously, I was familiar with and intruiged by DD for its excellent art style already, but generally I am the type to wait for something to be complete before I give it a shot. However the sea change from unabashed praise to seemingly universal criticism was so comically severe you'd have thought the game had actually reached out and harmed them.So thank you, dear, angry, entitled, (imo) wrong-headed (but certainly allowed to have and express your opinion, which you most certainly do, oh yes, you do...) players, for without your concentrated, delerious ire I may not have discovered one of my favorite games of last (and now this) year! For me, everything about this game is a win. The art, animation, music, sound design, narration, and general presentation are all top-notch. The prose itself is a particular highlight, as is the tongue-in-cheek brutality and general tone. To me, they really nail it.It's hard for me to address the criticisms leveled at the gameplay itself, because it seems to me the game is pretty straight forward about what it intends to be. DD is a procedurally-generated, turn-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on difficulty (with reference to Dark Souls) and light RPG elements and squad-management (with reference to modern X-Com). I concede that this can be considered grindy. Dungeon crawlers are generally grindy, even great ones like Dungeon of the Endless or Legend of Grimrock. The distillation of the various aspects of the form, the massive selection of character classes, buffs, debuffs, monsters, the writing, the aesthetic, these come together to give it something more than the sum of its parts. However if you don't enjoy that core to some degree or other, I don't know why you'd be considering this anyway.Personally, I never had a problem with corpses, because I never played the game without them. Over 50+ hours, I managed to beat a number of the bosses, level characters up to the top tiers, etc, ect, and only stopped because I felt like I had gotten far enough where I was ready to play the game in a finished state, and didn't want to master too much. I also died a lot. Then I died some more. And it was fun the whole time!As the year went on and waves of negative Steam comments continued to roll in, I felt like I was inhabiting a completely different universe from those players. As they railed against it getting harder and harder, for example, I found myself reflecting that the game seemed to be being tweaked to make it easier. I certainly wasn't dying as much. Maybe I was just somehow very good at it? I don't know. I still die all the time in X-Com. I don't think of myself as a master gamer or tactician. The other critique I saw a lot, which is one that really prompted me to put my words out there in defense of this thing and those involved in crafting it, is that the devs somehow didn't care about the criticisms, that they don't listen, or that they were corrupt, or that they had abandoned the project like does actually occur in the Early Access community, that this game was somehow some kind of scam. That's just ridiculous. There were three major updates from the time of my purchace to the end of the year, which added all kinds of content in various ways. They were constantly tweaking the game to find the balance that worked. They were communicative, and they were clearly listening and being involved (and also making the game, for goodness sake, cmon). Getting back briefly to the Great Corpse Outrage 2k15, for example, corpses were made a voluntary opt-out in the options menu pretty much from Backlash Ground Zero. Not that a developer has any reason to do something like that, but to then deny that it happened, or to say that they don't listen, that they're somehow scamming you, that the game is ruined forever is just a hysterical, petulent, garbage argument. I can't understand what this aspect of the community actually wants, for the life of me. If the game isn't for you, you certainly don't have to play it. But a certain amount of the negativity (which borders on outright hostility) strikes me as being like that guy who orders and eats the burger and then complains to management it wasn't cooked to his liking. Still, you have to admire (if not boggle at) their conviction, and their sheer verbosity of it all.For me, this game actually sold me on the idea that Early Access could be an enjoyable, worthwile process of participating in the honing of a project that you enjoy and want to support and I couldn't be happier with my decision to do so, and I look forward to playing it for another 50 hours or longer. Hopefully this small review will serve as some kind of counterpoint and let those bored few who got this far know that there's a worthy, enjoyable, wonderfully-crafted experience at the center of everyone's opining.

												With all the negative reviews lamenting the changes made since the game was originally put on Early Access, I feel like I need to throw some positivity into the mix, because this game is amazing.I've been playing on and off since it was first put on Steam, and am aware of the various changes which have been made throught each iteration of the game. To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.The changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle. Back before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.TL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.As for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits. There is some aspect of grind, and leveling up a large roster of characters can be time consuming, but I enjoyed myself the whole time.If you're on the fence with the one, the best thing you can do is stop reading reviews and watch some live streams to see if it looks like something you would enjoy. It's not for everyone, and there are a lot of different things to manage which can get tedious if you're not into that sort of thing. Still, I recommend this game to everyone I know, and it gets a big thumbs up here.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to be kind to this game, as it has a good deal of originality and fun gameplay (when you are not swearing at the screen), but some of the recent changes have been going in the wrong direction, and as a whole, probably tipped the scale to ""don't buy at this time.""There are a lot of things in the game that are good: the art and visuals are striking, the choice of characters is quite varied, and there is a lot of dark humor running through the game. The game is unapologetically difficult, with things like an automatic up to the second autosave to prevent ""favorable reloads"" when you get in a jam, and it was made that way intentionally. People seem to like the challenge. Even the sound is good. The price is reasonable as well.So this isn't a terrible game, and it is still early access so things might get even better as it nears ""completion"" (only 3 of 5 dungeons are playable at this time).But recently there have been several game design choices that have pushed the game from ""hard but enjoyable"" to ""too many things that make the game tiresome"", which I have been sorry to see.They recently introduced a ""corpse"" mechanic, that drops when you kill a creature without using a damage-over-time attack. This was a step back for gameplay and a change not alot of people like, as it makes combat more of a chore to have to ""kill things twice"" in order to get at the remaining creatures. This change has made several character types less effective (those that have no DOT attacks and can only attack the closest enemies) and really made combat less fun. It also makes several character types ""necessary"" even if you don't want to play them. This is compounded by the fact the computer opponents for the most part can attack any of your characters from whichever position without penalty.In addition to this, there were recent reductions to player damage, which again changed a lot of things that were ""hard but fun"" into a a boring slog. Damage on critical hits was reduced, making fights take longer. Creatures were given ""protections"" running up to 80%, making fights run a LOT longer, especially at the higher levels. Even to the point that the game ""penalizes"" you, for thinking you are dragging the fights out on purpose.  For some creatures, the combinations of increased protection, lower player damage, and corpses getting in the way of the flow of combat, has taken the fun out of things to a large extent. Add to that the fact that a lot of creatures will spam AOE attacks that hit your entire party, turn after turn, and again, the fun factor really takes a dive.There are also the usual number of growing pains with an alpha title, but those will likely get worked out.And there is certainly time for this game to ""recover"" before launch. And I hope it does.But right now it is over the line ""hard but fun"" into ""a slog that I no longer feel like playing much"".I would hold off buying at this time.			"

Darkest Review... First off... The GameThis game... where to begin, *Sigh* I bought this game in Early Access a week after it came out, I was looking for a Horror game- surprisingly this popped up under the tag (It's not a horror game btw unless you consider 2D monsters as ""scary"") and when I checked the trailer I said, ""Oh what the heck, forget the horror game this looks interesting"" I bought it, played it... and was very satisfied that I didn't search for that horror game because this game is a Flawless Gem...It's a Dark Fantasy RPG Rogue Like - ...Whew what a mouth full - It's inspired by H.P. Lovecraft (Yes the author of the so called ""Cthulhu Novels"") & Dark Souls. The Game's Immersion is extremely well done with the narrator - Wayne June his name is...Video with his narration.

			Darkest Dungeon is a hard-core RPG about the stresses of dungeon crawling. Lead a band of four heroes on a perilous side-scrolling descent, dealing with a prodigious number of threats to their bodily...		

His voice creates this immersive... tense atmosphere. The Narration is done in such a way that he narrates your combat actions, how you're exploring the dungeon and when you find unique enmies. The feeling I get when I play this game is like when playing a D&D tabletop with my friends in a dark room and we're exploring an ancient dungeon, except this game makes it appear visually, seriously if you like D&D you'll love this game. I sometimes get so immersed into my character ""Reynauld"" in the game I repeat the stuff he says when walking down the corridors of a dungeon! Haha! This game really is amazing to me.The creatures are exceptionally well done they look creepy and will fright your heros and yourself quite a bit. The heros are very well done.Level Design is outstanding (It really feels like exploring a dungeon).The Sound- Excellent! It may seem that I'm saying excellent everything, but if you don't believe me, experience it yourself. (Gameplay Vids on YouTube, isn't an ""Experience"") I suggest before you buy it... try it... and by that I mean go... you know, download it... for free ""somesites"" that I don't know and then if you like the game go BUY it and support the developers cause they deserve it as much as you enjoying their game for free.People say the game gets repetitive- which I don't know how it is possible, because this game has a story which people with 200+ Hrs havn't even completed yet, aswell as UNIQUE cinematics for each boss/lvl and sercret rooms. (There are over 14+ bosses and 50+ Quests 50+ unique items to collect.) If you play the game right and Explore like a person that knows how to play an actual RPG like this... - You'll find so many secrets that keep you from the main quest and prolongs gameplay even more...Secondly... The Concerns Surrounding The DifficultyThe game is OBLITERATINGLY HARD - literally the game is so hard that you have a chance to get both your tutorial characters killed (If you really have no idea of what you're doing) -or at least one of them. A lot of negative reviews is about how hard the game is, yet one of it's insparations are Dark Souls - which is renown for how insanely hard it is and yet no complaints about it's difficulty, and that FURIATES me to a very unnerving extent, because people now read the negative reviews of what people wrote & then they have like barely 20 Hrs of gameplay - they think the game is either accidentally made like this because of the RNG or the Devs are Insane, but actually if you run the game... after the intro it says that the game IS unforgiving - for that it is its nature... and on the store page.The game is meant to be this hard and unforgiving - you require skill and patience when fighting you can't just select a skill and click on the enemy and expect it to die! You need to look at the bottom right on the ""Enemy Info"" tab for the ""Chance to hit, Chance to Crit, the Debuffs/Buffs you get from using the skill and the Damage Probabiblity (Google the word ""Probabability""Please, if you don't like dying and starting over almost constantly... don't buy the game, because I can garantee you 100% that if you don't look at the ""Enemy Info"" Tab, or try to learn combining classes in a party... or if you're LAZY to take your time and think about what to buy before entering a dungeon... you will suffer mercilesly and painfully...The point is, just because your characters die because you dont know how to play the game (By that I mean learn it because you learn through trial and error) and immidiately quit after 10-12 mins of playing... and now go write a negative review about RNG and stuff you don't know... I bet you most of the people who have RNG written in their negative reviews don't even know what it means and what it does when encoded in a game... (Random Number Generator) unless they quickly google it.If you can look past losing/dying constantly, and know eventually when you learn the game you'll improve indefinitely... then this is the game for you hardcore gamers cause this game is meant to test your limits.:EDIT:If you really want to, because of all the NegReviews the devs recently made a settings TAB where you can choose to remove Heart Attacks, Stress, Corpses and more difficulties. But that's the game for wusses, It's not meant to be played like that.Thirdly... Game MechanicsCharacters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them.To have fun and not die you'll need to gather your 4 leaf clovers for some luck, because the game...sadly (for some) is RNG based, you'll also need to know your basic and some complex abbreviations for RPG's that's why the game has a glossary book when your at your Estate menu on the bottom right of the screen.You can CAMP!!! This is the first Dungeon Crawler That I found where you can camp!You get a few types of dungeons:- Short- Meduim (Where you can start camping)- Long      ^When you camp it's almost like when you play D&D with your friends, you first decide which survival skills to use and it spends time points that hover above your campfire for example, every class has Combat Skills <Self Explanatory (Used in Combat) and Survival/Camping Skills (Used in the camping menu when you choose to set up camp in a dungeon/room)The crusader has this one skill where he gives everybody stress relief with a speech he gives and where others can take watch while the rest of the party sleeps... all those skills take ""Time Points"" (The hovering number above your camp menu) and eventually when you decided you've used enough of those points the rest of the time is how long the party sleeps- the longer the more they heal and stuff.A TIP: After you bought the game, when you enter it and it shows RedHook Studios' logo don't press Esc. otherwise you'll skip the amazing cinematic Intro that gives you the starting lore you need!PROS+ & CONS-PROS+-Game is Hard-Lore is Great-Narration is Excellent-Lots of Loot-Variety of Monsters-Interesting story-Addictive-Great ImmersionCONS--Game is Hard (It can be good & bad from 3rd person perspective - Personally  I feel it's a pro cause it gives me bragging rights if I beat lvls)-Can be Frustrating-May Get Reppetitive (Depending if you Roleplay or not I.M.O.)-Realistic (Monsters that look like this I imagine won't be easy to fight in real life and people complain)-For HardCore Gamers only (By that I mean if you don't change the Misc settings for Heart attacks, Removal of stress ect.Thank you for your time in reading my review. If you feel I spent to much words on the difficulty please feel free to criticise in the comments and if I should add some stuff! For I don't crumble for the critics I embrace it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a lot of fun. The graphical style is awesome and the music, ambient sound and narrator dialogue are all near perfect. But what I love about this game is that it feels like a finished game, and for an early access game that is a great achievement. It manages to deliver a polished, playable and (above all else) fun gaming experience. Big game publishers should take note: This game is in a better state than many triple A titles are at release. And it is early access!This is how early access should be done. See my full review :

Early Access Review
								Everyone says that the new update has ruined the game. Simply not true. I've lost heroes because of my own mistakes, underestimating opponents (♥♥♥♥ing Ancient Webbers), and (rarely) RNGesus, but it's never been because the game was too stacked against me.To earn gold, you HAVE to budget. In early stages, when you're upgrading your Hamlet, you have to learn when Heroes are more trouble than they're worth and to let them go (i.e. their stress reduction cost total > the gold you're taking in, too many diseases, bad quicks that are locked in, etc). Everyone in the beginning is expendable. The overall goal is to accumulate wealth and upgrade that Hamlet. Simply said, you're not going to get to level 6 on your Heroes from the very beginning. After a while, gold and upgrading become less of an issue. Gold farming is incredibly easy to the Champion level dungeon runs (presuming you survive), with 15K gold as a reward for completing it, and it cost me about 4K to get more than enough supplies to survive. Adding in all the loot that I got (around 14k on my last run), the difference is real. Putting in about 6K in stress reduction, and 4K in quick-removal/disease removal, I still came out on top.Even with the ease of gold farming in later stages of the game, your Heroes can AND WILL die. I lost nearly an entire party of level 6 Heroes to Webbers because I had gotten into a ""click, kill"" mentality, and thought that the blight damage would be under control. Wrong. You have to think about each move you make, because every encounter has the possibilty of going south.Update (Jan 5 2016): I'm very pleased that the featured reviews are all recommended like this game deserves, instead of the people who raged when updates happened and couldn't think critically about it.

								I have waited 41 years to play a game like this... Am I right? Absolutely amazing. For an early access game, the entire team on this project deserves the highest honors and game of the year for 2015.The first game in years of early access and it works; it really, really, works! The stress is real for me as well as my chosen party … the wiffs … the crits… the closing of deaths door. The victory and the LOOT! Thank you!!  "

												I've had Darkest Dungeon for a while now and I'm pretty upset with the direction the developers have taken with it.  DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out.  Many people say that there is no ""fail state"", but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose.  There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.The reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly.  Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken.  Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).In short, the game has always been hard.  The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits).  Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations.  The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism.   I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.If you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm ♥♥♥♥♥ing.  I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently.  Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore.  If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying.  On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.All in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.Edit for clarity:After seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.The trinkets:I feel like they simply aren't balanced.  Most of the ""Ancestral"" (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help.  For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters.  That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit.  On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.The increased prices:Most people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game ""harder"", it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher.  Has this specific issue bugged me?  No, not really.Curios:Honestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now.  When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't.  You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.Healing:The devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets.  So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements.  Has this ever affected me personally?  No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons.  Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing?  Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.Facerolling:Do you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills?  Did they ever completely faceroll everything?  Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant?  Yeah, same here.  The game has never been ""too easy"" or ""too hard"", but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party.  One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE.  The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.Class choices:Let's face it, some classes are just underpowered.  I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit.  Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster.  The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable.  Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle.  I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept.  With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter.  The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well.  Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh.  In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet.  In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to ""faceroll"" things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched.  If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...For the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it.  But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying ""those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing"", there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD.  I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.If you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere.  By the way, nice job posting my review at the top of /r/DarkestDungeon and vote brigading the thumbs downs, Reddit.			"

												My hours in this game should accurately reflect my love for it. However, it is not for everyone.If you are looking at the title then I'll make a few assumptions. You like: dungeon crawlers, leveling up classes, loots...; which you will certainly find here.A few reasons I've spent nearly 300 hours on this game and not others should be what draws you in or dissuades you from purchasing.-Difficulty: listed 1st for a reason that some gamers don't enjoy a game that constantly and regularly challenges you and would appreciate a more liesure gaming experience. Understandable, but that is not this title. My experience in tough games and many hours in this one and I still have points, sometimes often, that I need to retreat.-Style: heavy-inky style gives it a dark world that perfectly fits the narrative and story. It should be said the Story is not something that explains itself very clearly. That being said, the finer details in Journals that you will find as well as the only voice in the game are done flawlessly. I could listen to this guy read a phone book and be enthralled.-Replayability: some may find the scope of the game rather small and they wouldn't be necessarly wrong. It isn't the completion of the game that was/is my goal. I actually was reluctant to finish it because I was worried I would lose interest. They do offer a NG+ (new game plus) mode after completion which adds a couple challenging hurdles for revisiting the Estate. But, the completion isn't the goal. Doing things better, differently and getting wiser was the carrot to lure me in to the long haul.			"

Early Access Review
								Written during Early Access.This is the second pre-release/early access game I've ever purchased. My general rule: do not purchase pre-release games of any kind, but watching a few play throughs on Youtube peaked my interest and had me break my rule for a second time in my life. The game looked (and still looks) gorgeous, and seemed challenging and fun to play.After two restarts, one being a quick play through on another computer, I got the hang of the game.I so want to like this game, and while I do have hope for it in the long run, I don't recommend this game in its current state.What? I can't recommend the game and I still like certain things about it? Absolutely! Here's a few things I like about this product:* The art. It's beautiful, effective, and it works. The artwork was, and still is my biggest draw. Some people put what appears to be tremendous love and attention to detail in this part of the game. At about 20 hours invested into the game, I'm clear I was sold on the art work more than anything else.* This is a strategy game, not a tactical game. I get to be the invisible hand that guides the estate, running a stream of adventurers into dungeon after dungeon, building my coffers, choosing the ones I want to live, dismissing the broken, and sending the fodder to their doom. So many games bill themselves as strategy but end up being minutia based click-fests. Of the actual game mechanics, this subtle aspect is my favorite part of all gamey things found here, and I hope it doesn't get lost in the development of the game.* I am very pleased with the implementation of the stress system. The stress system gives me a subtle factor that I need to handle beyond the usual hit points. I'm more afraid of stress damage than of HP damage during combat. It's novel, and I hope that the system gets more love and attention as the game develops.* The spirit of the difficulty level is spot on.And yet the main reason I can't recommend the game in its current state: I don't feel there's much _game_ here.I feel that this game is the most beautifully painted set of dice that I've ever laid my eyes on. The dice talk to me, they invite me to their (slightly scary) parties. And even though I try to convince myself they're more than N-sided polyhedrons, they remind me that I'm just a useless skin bag whether I'm rolling Critical Hits or Critical Misses.Before writing this I read reactions to the game posted here and elsewhere. I found it odd that I sided with people who were saying the game was too difficult and at the same time sided with people who said it was too easy.In a completely non-scientific study, I took a few notes about my game play, and summarized my experience: arbitrary. The arbitrariness swings too hard, both for the good and the bad. Examples:* Earlier build than the current, but I got 4 (egads!) hunger events across 5 rooms of travel.* Then of course I have dungeons with zero hunger. Zero. We got meters for everything else, and hunger is a classical part of roguelike games. How about a hunger meter?* My first foray into a level 3 dungeon I took two level 2 people and two level 1 people. Made it almost to the end, went an extra room, and got obliterated by a really scary monster, seems fair, although I was surprised I made it so far without a hitch. Then...* ...my second foray into a Level 3 medium dungeon with my A-team, appropriately equipped. One non-starter room and two total and unavoidable battles in I have a death's door highwayman, a 60% stressed Hellion, and everyone not on death's door was beaten (HP wise) quite badly. This made me take a break for about a day...* ...and then I came back and accepted I might lose my A-team and went trekking into the dungeon a bit longer, ready at any moment to quit the mission. Almost nothing happened and I completed the quest by exploring 90% of the rooms with only minor battles. Really?* Then my next two dungeons with full light had like no monsters and I got lots of treasure.* Then I spent a frustrating dungeon with consistent 75%-100% light getting surprise after surprise and being eaten by those gnashing dogs, whatever they're called. So much bleeding everywhere, so much being surprised. I even got Rabies, not personally thankfully, but my Vestal was frothing. Had to put her down like Old Yeller.* Then I make it to the hag, and everything is going pretty well, but almost didn't beat the hag because I let my leader stay in the cauldron and die, and then my Bounty Hunter got thrown into the pot after the leader died, which shifted my party order arbitrarily forward, and with the load out of my guys only my Vestal could attack the hag. Almost defeated by party order, so silly.When I do well at things, or even just making my toddler smile (which is a feat in and of itself) I can often look back and see what worked. Despite the moments when I get frustrated, whether I lost another run in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or lose a hand of Poker, I can often pinpoint what went wrong. But here, whether it's good or bad, it seems like the overriding factor of success or failure is out of my control. I wouldn't go so far to call the gameplay Darkest Cookie Clicker, but it's very alienating as a player. There's no joy in my successes, and losses, while frustrating, make me shrug my shoulders only to hire more bodies from the stage coach to throw back into the meat grinder.But this game could have substance, and a lot of it, if the same love and care that went into the art goes into polishing the game and the mechanics.With all that said, since this isn't my game, I have a qualitative request to ask the staff and developers of this product:Please, you have so much going good for you already in early access, but my expectation was to find a game that was more solid and art/UI that was less solid. Instead I found the reverse. (Despite some UI quirks, you have a very solid UI overall, something that is no easy feat.)Take a week off, not just a weekend, regroup, and please don't just shove spot fixes in to try to fix things. Please step back, take a holistic view of your game, and do the work to make the game mechanics and the game play itself as solid as the things that do work.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler game, developed by Red Hook Studios. The game was initially released in Early access in January 2015, before leaving Early Access in January 2016. Gameplay in Darkest Dungeon leaves you in control of a roster of heroes; you control almost every aspect of your hero’s journey throughout the game. Initially you start out with two heroes from the tutorial, and you can expand your roster by visiting the stage coach in the main game hub, here you can select from at least two heroes and have them join your group. The central hub of the game also includes various other useful locations too, such as an armour smith, weapon smith, a tavern, hospital, and many more. Each of these locations becomes key to the progression in Darkest Dungeon.  The dungeon crawling side of the game is done from a side scrolling perspective, as you explore randomly generated dungeons in search for loot and treasure. The combat in this game is turn based, and very tactical. Each of your party of 5 heroes will have their own preferred location in your group and will only be able to use certain attacks based on their location too. Each of your characters has 4 active abilities they can use in a dungeon; you can swap and change them as you please in the main hub provided you have learned the skill beforehand.  Your party will also contract diseases, afflictions, blights and wounds throughout their journey and most will probably even die or become useless. You can cure these by visiting the hospital in the hub, but some may render your character pointless to have around. Like the game says at the very start, you really have to make the best out of a bad situation most of the time. Graphically, it isn’t very intense; however the art style which is presented is just wonderful. The art style is really important to this game, as it shows the essence and feel of the game perfectly. The hand drawn look to the game is one of my favourite styles in gaming at the moment, and Darkest Dungeon wets my appetite beautifully there.   What is really important here though, would be the game’s user interface. As there is a lot of information needed to be able to progress successfully through the game, you are obviously going to need a clean and clear interface to show that information. The game’s tutorial at the start of the game explains a lot of it quite nicely. However a lot of the information is left for you to find out for yourself.  All of your characters information, stats and equipment are all a click away, as well as your map and inventory screen. I was really happy with the interface, a few changes I would of made is to add a lot of information to show right on the screen straight away, rather than having to hover over the item, or bar – it just felt like an unneeded hoop to jump through to get the information I wanted. The ordering of the turns can be quite difficult to keep track of as well; I still have no idea how it is worked out, but I would of liked to have seen maybe a time line of the battle somewhere on the screen to make it a little easier for you to plan your attacks; maybe this was considered already but was specifically not added so the game is all that much harder, that to me is the only logical reason for not having something like that included. The audio in Darkest Dungeon is also spot on as well. First of all, the narrator is just plain awesome. His rusty voice sent shivers down my spine at times; it is very much on par with other great narrations like Bastion and Transistor. Sound effects are all really nicely designed too; the attack noises and monster sound effects are very nice and add an extra level of immersion to your game play.This may be the hardest video game I have ever played. The game is so unforgiving and you will get screwed over, and you will probably die from your own stupid mistakes over and over again; but that is the whole point of this game. The aim to finish the game is very hard to hit and when you do hit it, you will be able to give yourself a very well earned pat on the back, because you will have just completed a monster difficulty game. I have never actually completed lost all of my party members, there seems to be an endless supply of them in the game’s hub, so you will never “lose the game” so to speak, you can just keep retrying (all be it with lower level characters).  This is one of those games where I had to spend a sufficient amount of time outside of the game, in the wiki and on forums just to give me that little extra edge over the unforgiving game play; I am not ashamed to admit and you shouldn’t be too if you have to check little bits of information out. Due to playing the game a lot offline this week due to PC problems, a lot of my time has not been tracked, but I have put in roughly 30 hours of gameplay. I have still not finished the game, I have managed to hit max level with about 6 of my characters but I have been spending quite a while farming and grinding money for me to upgrade them more before taking on the final stages of the game. Due to the game’s randomness, the replay ability is extremely high even when you manage to finish it the once. This is a game you can easily get at least 100 hours out of without growing bored of it. Technically I had no issues what so ever. It is definitely a game you have to use a keyboard and mouse on, just because of the amount of information you require access to. There aren’t any graphical options available sadly but it should run on just about anything as it isn’t graphically intensive. Although it isn’t exactly a technical talking point, but a nice added feature here was that you can actually turn off some of the game mechanics right out of an options menu, yes this may make the gam experience differ and may even decrease the difficulty, but I personally don’t see this as a real issue in a single player game. My conclusion on Darkest Dungeon is that it is one of the best games to come out via the Early Access system. Even when it was first released, it was a better game than most, but now it has been fully released this year it is an absolute must play title. All other devs looking to release a game into early access really need to pay attention to these guys as it was done so perfectly and hassle free. I can easily say that it is my up most favourite roguelike game ever. The game’s regular price on Steam for £18, 99 is a good price point, there is tons of content and extremely high production values put into this game. Do not hesitate for a second more and pick this game up.

												Laughing at the people calling the game too hard like. Friend. It's the POINT. You know what this game was designed to do? Crush you. Break you. But the real joy comes from spitting in the game's eye, telling it, no, ♥♥♥♥ YOU. Getting back up every time you're knocked to the ground. Yeah, the rng can easily ruin your day, your party, your hero that you built up. But you know what? Sometimes life deals you a bad hand. What matters is how you handle it. How you adapt to the way life ♥♥♥♥ed you.This is not a game that's supposed to make you feel good, or like you're good at video games, or that everything will be alright as long as you believe in the power of friendship. It's a game that makes you feel like you can take whatever life throws at you, no matter how much it sucks in the moment, because you know how to cope with unfair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Bring it, life.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this on Wednesday, took 2 days off work sick and put in 36 hours.Not a great game if you value your job!10/10, would risque losing my job again.TL:DRSeriously though, I thought I should add my imput after putting in the 36 hours. I did hit a bit of a burnout with the game (not suprising given the 36 play time in something like 70 real life hours). I've basically got as far as I can with this, so far as early access goes I really enjoyed it and I'm really looking forward to more.Personal Notes:+ Turn-Based: If you have small children, bladder problems or a wife who might just pull the plug on your pc. You may, at will move away from your pc, whenever you want. Without any worry. This game saves itself non stop even if you had a power cut, when you return, you will be where you were, at that turn. (No save cheating. I'm looking at you FTL!)+ Looking after my dungeoneers: Alot of people in reviews talk about sending wave after wave of followers to thier doom, I never did this. I named (friends and family work well here), upgraded, debuffed and looked after them. If the situation was dire, I'd do my best to get the sane ones back to my sanctuary to get them ready for the next run. This strategy kept me interested and scared of losing people+ Value for money: Steam bieng Steam, usually I wait for a sale to buy a game, especially one in early access. However I took the plunge with this one, and at 40 hours (to me personally) I am very satisfied with my purchase.+ Updates: Game has only been out 6 days, so can only speak for that time. Has been tweaked almost everyday with small patches. Personally I find this encouraging.easiest recommendation this year			"

Early Access Review
								*Edited* 10-3-15I wanted to write a positive review for this game.  The content and game-play are there, and the final product may work well in the end, but as it is now, its a game of luck, and not a game of skill.It starts out like a sick game of chess.  Your moves must be thought out, and sacrifices must be made.  Unfortunately, once you get deeper into the game, the mobs are clearly designed to play on the fact that death is not a big deal for them and that they do not have to deal with ""stress"".  There are a number of mobs that simply bomb your team's ""stress"" from a distance and cause diseases without thinking of defending themselves.  So instead of the enemy mobs playing smart, they just throw themselves into you knowing that its the next fight that will kill you.Another failing aspect of the game is the crit system.  The enemies have WAY too high of a crit chance.  EVERY time that I lost a hero that I spent time working on, spent money on, and built up to take on the heavy fights, I lost him/her to a string of OP crits that I could do ZERO to prevent.  -- Fight starts: first enemy attacks, crit, 1/2 hp lost.  Second enemy attacks, crit, down to 0 hp and now have a DoT.  My turn: DoT kills my highest level hero before I can do a thing.  --  Not a fun mechanic in the least.The game has also gotten worse as it has been updated.  Instead of building upon the old game, the devs are forcing the players' hands to play the game the way the devs want.  Literally changing some mobs to have such high defense that you are meant to be forced into using DoTs... That's not my play style, so I am punished for it.... no thank you.  This  also takes away from creative party builds.  Now you have a checklist that you have to meet and to hell with your play style.On top of the fact that there seems to be no direction at the moment.  If you stay in a fight too long, then your party takes more stress damage.  But with that game mechanic in mind, they add the NEED for DoTs, and enemy corpses that will block your melee units thus drawing the combat out and once again designing combat that clearly bolsters the monsters.  If a monster falls, there is a corps that keeps the ranged enemies in the back where they want to be, and EVERY monster has an attack that can reach from the back row, if one of your heroes falls, no corpse, your ranged guy is forced to move forward... The devs want difficult, and that's fine, but not at the expense of logic.  A corpse actually causes problems in a fight because your veteran fighters are too thick to step to the side?  * Scratches head *  Thankfuly, with the latest patch, they added the option to have corpses on or off.Then there is the preparation for the fights.  Some dumbass opens the gates of hell, so he calls upon heroes to fix his mistake, then charges you 250 gold for a shovel?!  A shovel that you cannot bring back if you don't use it?!  Is there a hole in my backpack that  only lets things fall out that I will have to buy again for the next fight?  Am I the only one who is lost here?  Your adventurers have no problem bringing back gold and stones, but any supplies that will cost you money next time will be left in the dungeon.  Why?  Because the devs say so.Another problem is the fact that your heros are ALL likely to end up with a debuff at the end of a dungeon, even if you do well.  I gotten through a dungeon or two that I took minimal damage, minimal stress, and left with a sack full of loot,  full bellies, and full health only to have ALL of my characters come out with different afflictions and zero positive attributes.  There are plenty of punishing games on the market that don't punish you for a job well done.  This game becomes a grind due to the fact that you are punished for doing a good job just as much as you are punished for doing a bad job.  It's easy to just stop caring all together because you  are going to end up worse off no matter what.  Hell, you can even be punished for trying to remove stress in town because your characters will disappear for days on end binge drinking, or will ""witness troubling activities"" and can no longer pray for stress relief.So if you want a game that is going to push your strategic skills and make you care for your heroes because if you play it smart, you just might prevail, DO NOT BUY THIS.If you want a game that will throw all of your hard work and preparation away due to one unlucky fight, go for it!*Started a new game 10-3-15 to try out the new updates.  Started a new game, and when I got to the first fight with my two starting characters, I preceded to miss five out of eight attacks, and the three that I landed were  two stuns and a bleed, all of which were resisted.  The enemy missed zero attacks, scored two crits, and I resisted none of the bleed or push-backs.  I was dead before getting to town.  STILL an unbalanced game of LUCK*			"

Early Access Review
								For a lot of people, Darkest Dungeon is going to feel like the game they've been waiting for. The team behind it has done a great job. It's impossible to discuss Darkest Dungeon without praising the beautifully stark art direction; it channels the deep shadows of Mike Mignola (of ""Hellboy"") perfectly, and the colors shift and suppurate everywhere from the doomed hamlet at the foot of the Darkest Dungeon to the deepest and most Godforsaken pit you'll chuck adventurers into like a wood chipper. The music deftly changes between ominous, somber, and stirring as the situation demands, and the narrator keeps the tone set wonderfully, commenting (though not annoyingly so) on every turn of fate in a Tony Jay timbre. Even putting aside the excellent and cohesive creative vision on display, the core mechanics of Darkest Dungeon are brutally satisfying. You'll begin the game tentatively sending small, untested and largely unfamiliar adventurers (I really suggest you not bother naming the poor souls yet) on short jaunts through nightmarish corridors -- keep the torch brightly lit in these beginning forays! -- in the hopes that some of them will back come out the other end with cash and relics to upgrade your town, relax and medicate your mercenaries, and keep the gears (the pulping, threshing gears) of your little dungeon-centric industry going. The dungeons themselves are hesitant strolls punctuated by combat where every single point of health and stress counts. Darkest Dungeon keeps its numbers small: it'll be exciting when the Leper smacks a bandit for 11 damage, whether or not the Crusader heals for 4 points will be a matter or life and death, and the first time the Bounty Hunter gets a critical hit on a Marked target with Collect Bounty, 40 damage will seem miraculous. The first three-digit enemy will be more than a little worrisome. The RNG is still as fickle as ever though, so be prepared for even the best-laid plans to get ruined by bad luck. Those tools at your disposal -- the mercenaries -- are a really great puzzle in themselves, too. Where should each fighter stand? What skills can even be used where they're standing? Is it too risky to have a mercenary who's useless if he's knocked out of position by a spell or an ambush? Is having a mercenary who can act in every position going to leave him spread thin? If you put two skills on an adventurer that can only be used in the very back row, what happens if someone in the party dies and there IS no back row? Should you send a very stressed Occultist with a fresh group of mercenaries and risk him driving them ALL mad? Is it safe to send a half-useless and untested Jester with three experienced pigstickers if it means his death will ruin their morale? This decision-making only gets worse (better) as the game goes on, and opens you up to a really great obligation to constantly shift, rearrange, retrain and reassess your bands of brethren. Missions will get longer, necessitating that your heroes stop to camp and comfort each other with incense, mockery, medicine, or prayer. As you start to get a few of your hires to a higher level of skill and bravery, sometimes so high that they'll refuse some missions as being beneath their abilities, the management of the town transforms from a largely between-dungeons concern to a much greater part of the metagame. You'll swap afflicted but useful madmen in and out of the sanitarium and make decisions on whether it's more pertinent to cure your Bounty Hunter's accuracy-ruining case of The Yips or purge him of Deviant Tastes apparently so unspeakable he's not allowed at the brothel. You'll wish a million painful deaths on the Caretaker because he took the last seat at the bar and your Hellion who's psychologically coming apart at the seams -- the Hellion that you NEED for the next outing -- can't relax with anything but a tall tankard. You'll stare at the weekly report that tells you than your Crusader, who you sent to meditate his cares away, decided to leave the hamlet on a vision quest and take his holy wrath with him when otherwise your whole 'A-team' skeleton demolition crew is ready to go. The town influences your quests into the subterranean meat grinders and vice versa. Parties that before seemed perfect will be split up because the Grave Digger needs her Rabies cured and the Plague Doctor's medicines seem more appealing when faced with the Blight-dripping porcine residents of the Warrens. It keeps the player out of complacency in a really satisfying way; fans of X-COM or other high-stakes strategy will love the feeling of having to scramble in the face of disaster or cut their losses and tell the veteran Vestal and Leper to abandon the quest as well as the bodies of their compatriots. Darkest Dungeons is a satisfying, strategic game about risk, reward, and reanimation. The dungeon crawls revitalize a task that's otherwise become almost a joke; there's no hazardous smashing through pinata baddies filled with loot here, and each time you hit 'Embark' you'll never really be sure what will be left of your party, if anything at all. The town management is a compelling game of its own, echoing ""worker placement"" board games and charming you as you hone blades, upgrade skills, and wrangle holy alcoholics into their barstools. There's still some rough edges from Early Access here and there. Placeholder dialogue pops up occasionally and the central story has been held off until it's done, but even unfinished and in a mostly sandbox state both halves of Darkest Dungeon interact with other in a way that'll have you coming back for more. More, and more, and more, until in the folly of your hubris, the keening susurrations within the deepest abominable chambers beneath your lineage's empty-eyed manse ring out across the blighted land in an unendurable cacophony of gibbering and most terrible doom.

Early Access Review
								I recently purchased Darkest Dungeon and I haven't been able to stop playing it.Before I write my review I wish to state that there are far too many negative reviews that are completely unjustified. Yes, the game is unforgiving however it is nothing like what the other reviewers have stated. A lot of the people complaining are the same crowd as the 'casuals' you find in other games suggesting changes to allow them to 'win more often'. For example, ""“Some traps for example are not visible and will just hit you without any counter option (but luck as in dodge)”. The traps become visible if you have 'scouted' the map. I have 112 hours at the moment and I do not lose any heroes  at all (your heroes have permanent death) and I have a full roster of heroes of every class. I can only imagine that the people who are finding the game incredibly difficult are struggling to understand the mechanics of the game. You will see below as to why it is identical to the 'casuals' you often find in other games. People are a complaining about balance changes. For example, ""“The developers … seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun)”. People were just AoE'ing enemy characters to death, removing any skill from the game as players could kill the enemy characters before they could even react. This was changed so you couldn't just 'no skill' AoE mobs down and people are complaining about this. People were double and triple stacking classes because of this and just mindlessly using the same AoE abilities (You can see this in YouTube videos before the changes). Know the abilities, choose classes that compliment each other and play smartly; this is how the game should be, right?The other complaints is that everything is too expensive. For example, ""Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl"". I started after the patch and although I dont have a huge amount of gold, my whole roster is upgraded to the max levels. Previously it was absolutely ridiculous and you never had to worry about how to spend your gold. It was just an unnecessary resource as you made an insane amount of gold and it cost nothing to upgrade skills/abilities, armour/weapons or use 'stress recovery' options for your heroes. Gold must be a reward for completing a dungeon and you should have to spend it wisely, not sit with it in thousands and never have to make a decision on how to spend it.People in the Steam reviews have used the cliched ""it is not polished enough"" which is the complete opposite of the truth. I do not think you will find many games as polished as this where the passion of the developers shine in their work. ----------Review:Darkest Dungeon to me has been a refreshing experience. It features the narration of Wayne June in the most unique way I've ever encountered in a game. The narrator will essentially comment on the combat pushing the sound design from Darkest Dungeon to a new level. When you land a critical hit, Mr June will make you feel it.Graphics: The game has a very dark art style to it. Everything is very well drawn. The creatures are hideous (in a good way) which adds to the dark theme of the game.Sound:There has been no cost spared in sound design. As someone with a degree in Music Production, Sound Design and Music Business, I really have a lot of appreciation for what they have done here. As mentioned there is the narration of your combat, but the amount of sounds they have created for the skills, which sound really good, is unbelievable. They all sound like the ability should. They have even gone as far to make unique sounds for when the abilities fail. Monster sounds are just as scary as the monsters are gruesome, making it easy to immerse oneself.Gameplay:I see the Steam reviews are saying the game is unbalanced and too difficult. I find the game to be almost perfectly balanced, if not too easy. I have 2 final bosses to finish and I have not wiped or died on any of the final bosses so far. I find the AI is a bit too forgiving where it could have got a kill it instead attacked a hero with more health.The game uses a unique system that when you get to 0 hp, you reach the status of 'Deaths Door'. You then do resist checks against attacks and if it fails, you receive a 'Deathblow' and that hero dies permanently. This is unforgiving however you have the option to retreat from combat and the dungeon if it is not going your way, which you should be as doing.Overall:One of the most unique games I've ever played and I only hope the developers look past the negative Steam reviews because this game is absolutely a diamond in the rough; a complete winner in my eyes. It is being released in January 2016 I believe however I feel that the game is already complete and I have not once felt like it was an 'Early Access Game'			"

												This game rewards the chicken-hearted. Stubbornly trying to finish a dungeon that's gone badly from the start leads to a deathmarch.This game rewards the detail-minded. Did you remember to unequip your trinkets? Did you re-equip them? Did you check to see if that monster is going to easily resist that attack? Dude, did you even make a provisions checklist?This game rewards the heartless. Sometimes the best thing to do with a syphilic, boozed-up ""hero"" with a bad case of nerves is to fire her. Sometimes deciding to let her die of a heart attack gets you a shiny.This game rewards the persistent. Not giving up after a humiliating party wipe is more of a key to success than flashes of tactical brilliance. Completing the game in less than 99 weeks (each week is a dungeon run that takes up to half an hour) is considered fast and gets you an achievement.This game rewards the flexible. Sometimes you don't have a lot of choices. Your healers are all too diseased and crazy this week. Your tank went AWOL, and your barbarian needs to have a pesky trait removed. Can you scrape together a viable party? Or maybe your tactics went well only up to a point. Will you come up with new ones or will you pack it in, mumbling bitterly about the unfairness of it all?It's not for everybody.			"

												EDIT: There has been some misunderstanding stemming from my opening lines. The key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes Darkest Dungeon unique and rewarding to play. Darkest Dungeon isn't just another RPG, and I don't blame anyone for approaching it like one. There are plenty of on-screen cues and tips that guide the player, but for players who have played since the beginnings of Early Access, it's easy to overlook them and not start from square one. Players who are completely new to Darkest Dungeon are likely to heed these in-game suggestions and warnings at face value, and may have a better experience as a result. I do not think the game is perfect, but it's pretty great and worth your time and money to experience.There are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played, and I want to shed some light on why this game is actually AMAZING, and has CHANGED over time to become BETTER. There aren't going to be ANY story spoilers here, just basic mechanics--more or less just the hamlet's features and how they interact with the core gameplay.It is a difficult game, and it is an RPG. When the going gets tough in a traditional RPG, there's usually a couple ways to deal with that: grinding monsters for money, gear, and experience, completing sidequests, and so on.In Darkest Dungeon, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. You have Heirlooms (used to upgrade your Hamlet facilities), you have Gold (required to use your Hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition), you have trinkets(a way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities), and you have the Heroes themselves--a renewable resource. Each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes: Resolve Level, Sanity, Quirks, Disease, Equipment, and Spells. Here's the part where people go wrong: they try to min-max, they try to save their heroes, they'll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out. This game restricts your resources far too hard for that, and makes your gains from doing so miniscule--you do make a profit, but its tiny and takes a long time. The profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost non-existent, and players see this as being the 'grindfest' as they slowly approach the endgame, often trying to circumvent this game's difficult mechanics (popular Steam guides are guilty of this!) by 'grinding it out,' using strategies such as suicide-gold runs (which are a time sink in and of themselves, adding to the grind illusion)...Those narrow margins of profit? The seemingly unending grind? Its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play, and those players aren't adjusting their gameplay. Progression through this game's intense difficulty isn't made by grinding out the perfect heroes, its by taking what you have and going for it. You're going to fail. You're going to lose heroes. You're going to hit brickwalls. But you're going to learn the absolute limits of every hero, the absolute limits of your style of play, and you'll push those limits. Your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly, taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down.Brute-forcing a grind through the game is technically possible. But you shouldn't do it. This game wants you to face its depths head-on, and as soon as you do, it drags you further down and constricts you even more.When you finally get it though--when you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the game--there is very little more rewarding. It doesn't happen because you grind. It doesn't happen because you followed a strategy--it happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it.			"

												A truly fantastic game with a criminally low review rating. This stems from the game having changed a fair bit since early access, but all the changes have been positive. Making the game less exploitable is a good thing, people! The other complaints I hear are usually ""The RNG is too severe! No skill!"" Which is entirely untrue. All RNG in Darkest Dungeon can be avoided by careful planning and thought. On my second run through the game, I survived 100 weeks without a single death or a single quest failure and with only one resolve check encountered. (Edit: I've now finished the game twice consecutively with no deaths!)Pros!- Highly addictive gameplay that keeps you coming back for more- Tons of replayability as no run through the game is the same- Very strategic combat; party compositions, trinket speccing, synergies... the list goes on- Beautiful in every sense. Stunning art-style, effective animation, fantastic soundtrack- Diverse and varied characters make for a lot of experimentation and fun- Fair difficulty curve, challenging the whole way with difficult but achieveable boss fights at the end- Lots of content for the price- Unique regions to explore with thematic enemies and procedurally generated dungeons- Perfectly managed stress and health systems with intriguing ""Death's Door"" and ""Resolve Check"" mechanics to keep you on your toes in and out of combat- Wayne June's narration is golden. It sets the Lovecraftian atmosphere perfectly and oozes quality with such sophisticated, verbose vocabulary- Town Events make things more varied in the Hamlet (For better and occasionally for worse!)- Somewhat frequent updates with new heroes, new content, bug-fixes, and fine-tuned mechanicsCons- A little beginner unfriendly in some places like cluttered tooltips, lack of game-mechanic introduction, etc- The fact it's not in your game library! Absolutely criminal!There's plenty more praise I could sing this game but I should stop now. This game captivated me and I fell deeply in love with it. I hope other people do too after reading this review!			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, I want to say that this game is amazing, the concept and the play style, despite my desire to never lose a man in a fight, is pretty amazing.  I'd recommend the hell out of this game, but recently, there was a huge update, and while I thought it was just a class addition, it was total chaos.  I had read a review suggesting that the game had became unplayable, and I can safely agree with this, I felt the need to write an actual review for this game because of it in the hope that it'll at least get someone to tell the devs that they ♥♥♥♥ed up.  It's a damn fine game, it really is, but the new update added protection to basic level enemies, yes I understand that they can't take full damage from EVERY blow you dish out, but basic enemies, with wooden shields, hooks, and metal cans on their heads shouldn't be able to stop 3/4's of the damage that is coming at them, it makes sense in cases like the Brigand Cannons or large enemies but not for regular opponents, it was made to a point that maggots are actually a team kill, having armor, debuffs, AND stuns, as well as above average speed.  Yes, you're making the game more difficult, but you're also making the ability to clear any of the dungeons a horrible thought, you'll only complete a dungeon on rare cases now, considering enemy crit seems so increased that where you'll score a total of three crits in one dungeon they'll score a grand total of 12.  Added protection, and adding the fact that the buffs that are actually good can now be replaced with things you don't even want, as well as having to pay gold up to fix a characters ""disease"" of being worried, all of this is new, unwanted, and really, really not needed.  This is turning into a factor where you'll lose to a hallway encounter before getting through a room, I've only done short dungeons with the new update and I tell you I cannot imagine one winning in the longer runs, given while you may never have your health dented, the balance of health loss and stress is overdone, you'll walk out of a fight, untouched, with minimal injuries, but everyone of them seem to leave an etching on your men's souls that makes them panic extremely easily, and overall succumb to heart attacks at an intense rate, there's no getting lucky with heart attacks, you panic, become weaker, and if you don't get away before they stress you further, you get a 100% chance to lose your man simply because they thought it was a good idea to make your fighters the biggest weaklings out there.  Overall, you deal less total damage as fighters, they made a lot of the good abilities completely not usable, they made stress your worst nightmare, they made the perks your fighters have nearly uncontrollable since you can only save so many from so many problems at once no matter the money, enemies with weak hides and pathetic armor are oddly stronger than they should be allowed to be, you'll find fighting larger monsters is easier than fighting the peons, and finally, CRITS ARE NEVER GOING TO BE IN YOUR FAVOR REGARDLESS OF THE CHARACTER OR MOVE YOU USE, No, it doesn't seem like they bumped down your crit chance, but when it's compared to that of the enemies, it's generally 25% of their total crit chance as an estimation, I wouldn't buy this game unless you either pound the idea into the developers heads that they're making the game terrible, or they fix their mistakes on their own, but if the game goes on sale for half off and you have the money to spend I don't see why one wouldn't try it out to say in the least.

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon: A game you will love or hate, or both at the same time.I bought this game after watching about 4 minutes of a stream. From the start it looked very fun, interesting and most importantly...difficult. It wasn't a game like so many where it's tailored to just get you from start to end. Where you mess up any number of times and just get more chances. With Darkest Dungeon there is room for error, but it's a very small room; and most the time you have to take a loss of some sort.Anyways into the real details.PROS:- Game looks, feels and sounds amazing- Combat system is fun, alas very random.- Upgrade system is very well done, with 4 different types of upgrade mats- Stress system is great, you get broken down mentally and physically, which is what seemed so interesting- Random dungeon layouts proves for a fun new adventure every time you embark- The game is VERY fun!CONS: - As it's been said so many times before in other reviews, good and bad; the RNG is not only too random, it's BEYOND frustrating. I fell this is by far the biggest issue with the game at current development. I'm not sure if it's a tooltip issue, or programming issue, or what the underlying cause is; but the RNG is far too random. I've literally (meaning literally not OMG ""literally"") had a 85% hit chance skill miss 9 times in a row. Now with 15% miss chance, sure it's not impossible, but this happens often in sperts of ""bad RNG"". It wasn't just a single time. When you have ""low light"" from your torch you're supposed to have a higher crit % according to the tooltip, but I don't think I've ever crit while doing a ""no light"" run. All in all, if you get angry at games on any level whatsoever, this game will definitely♥♥♥♥♥♥you off from time to time...often enough.- The Sanitarium is a joke, not only is it ridiculously expensive, with having to reduce stress after almost every dungeon, you never have time to put your characters in there. ESPECIALLY since you get a new affliction (debuff) almost every single run as well. So what is really the point of it? The Sanitarium needs to reduce stress as well, not as much as the Abbey or Tavern (otherwise they would become worthless in place of the Sanitarium), but by a 50% rate or something.- The in-dungeon character dialogue. They like to talk a lot, and when they do it stops whatever you are doing. It becomes increasingly annoying when they say the same things over and over as well. So you're not just being stopped to hear something interesting, you're being stopped to read the same thing over and over. It becomes unbareable when they get full stress and break, because in the battle they say something non stop and you spend 50% of the time waiting for them to shutup.- There is no structured combat rotation, it seems characters can go whenever they want. It's never ""your turn"" and then ""enemy turn"". Also, sometimes in particular with ""surprise"" attacks the enemy can go multiple times in a row, before you can. So at that point you're so far behind in the dungeon with almost maxed stress and no HP it's a miracle of you get out with all 4 people alive, or finish it at all.It's early access, so we'll see where they take the game, but right now it's still worth playing if you can deal with moments of being annoyed and hating your characters sometimes. Even with all the at length CONS, I still highly recommend the game.			"

								Look no further, here's an absolute summary of all complaints about this game:1) Early access, so not a lot of content yet.2) RNG Gods are merciless.And here's an absolute summary of why these complaints are stupid:1) That's what early access is. More content will be added.2) Check this out, because this is one of the reasons I LOVE this game: the very first page after booting the game is a disclaimer stating how ""Darkest Dungeon is making the best of a bad situation"". Get it? Failing is the default outcome of this game, so you MUST learn to take small victories, one at a time, building yourself up slowly. This is why a lot of the upgrades involve lowering the cost of upgrades; so that you can pick yourself back up when things go badly.Some dungeon runs you'll net 40k gold, and others all your level six heroes with Legendary equip will die from eight consecutive enemy critical hits. You must do all it takes, and not give up... to survive in the shadow of the...Darkest DungeonEDIT:The devs ♥♥♥♥ed this game up :DI'll leave my original review as an elogy, for a recent one explaining what happened, refer to everyone else complaining about it.

								Let me tell you the tale of Picot, perhaps the greatest Vestal to walk these haunted halls. She was on a mission to the Weld with Reynauld the Crusader, Watteua the Grave Robber, and Marchs the Leper to purify corpses. After a long and stressful trek the come to find the last corpse guarded by an Infested Giant and two Fungal Batterys. The battle is long and our weary heroes are all at Deaths door, the stress tests her resolve and she finds power in her last moments. After a moment of confusion she finds herself at the front of the party, unable to heal her friends and knowing the beast will certainly kill some in the next strike she raises her mace to the sky and calls forth holy light, a mighty blow backed by her own force of will strikes the beast and it crumbles. Spent, she can only watch as the last Fungal Battery kills her with its desperate retreat. Her three companions finish the quest and carry her from the hellish pit. Many in the Hamlet weep to see her fallen. They bury her on the top of the tallest hill. Reynauld still brings a single Daisy to her grave everyday in remembrance.10/10 Would bury Picot again.			"

												You should already know: it's a rogue-like dungeon crawler with classes you recruit and send on dungeon crawls.Now that the game is officially released and post-release-patched, here is a new review:The game is fantastic. The different classes and abilities mean you can play two runs in a row with totally different battle play styles. The narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton.The concept works really well. Rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits ""money run"" or ""artifact run"" into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression. The balance is (IMO) really good. You are low on things and people for a long time, by design. Your dungeon crawlers die a lot, by design. But it's all in service of the theme, and as you rebuild and get better everything else gets better too. Also, importantly, they have added a lot of options to change the gameplay to make it easier by toning down or eliminating various types of difficulty. I find the default difficulty fantastic but I'm also a big believer in letting people choose to turn off things they dislike. I paid $20 for this the first week it was on Steam, and played it for over 100 hours while it was still in Early Access. Now that the final game is out and there are new classes and areas and story content that I've never seen, I feel confidant that I will get another 100 hours. As some one who never pays full price for a game, this is a game I bought at full price and I'm glad I did.			"

Early Access Review
								Most depressing game? Quite possibly.Darkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.An incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.Playing as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of ""stress"" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.Each character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.Each character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.Actions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. I could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it. Though early access (at this moment), it's easily worth the purchase and will have you cursing for hours on end as your party members trudge through dungeons, are faced with insanity and eventually perish.Buy this game.

Early Access Review
								** Review of game subject to change because it is early access. ** (1/30/2015)The idea of Darkest Dungeon is genius, which is why I backed it on Kickstarter. You have a bunch of heroes going through random dungeons which tear them down both physically and mentally. The art is grim and dark, very much like Mike Mignola's work on Hellboy. The different classes are fun (Grave Robber, Jester, Leper, Crusader, etc.) are a nice change from your general wizard, rogue, knight (though they'll fill the same sort of roles). And the traits are pretty interesting. I don't remember all the names but I had one hero who loved dead bodies, another that talked to unheard voices in various lanugaged (including coding), and another who decided they didn't want to fight anymore and would pass every time it was their turn. The game plays very well, especially being early access and I definitely think is worth youre money BUT not before some major balancing. And I'm really hoping the people at Red Hook make some changes because this game has so much potential for stealing hours of my life. SHORT VERSION:- game is poorly balanced- too much grinding- some unintuitive design choicesIN DEPTH- The upgrade system is much like Rogue Legacy. You bring back money from your dungeon raids. However everything is far too expensive making a lot of your characters useless. More on that later- You have to bring items with you into the dungeon. Food and torches are a must. However for the minimum amount, you're looking at about 1500 gold per run. And if you run into some bad luck, you're gonna be screwed for awhile on your next trip. - stats system is never explained and is not very intuitive. - While there are a lot of classes, there really isn't that big a difference between them. They all have ranged and melee attacks. Some have buffs, some have debuffs, but they all feel rather similiar, which is a shame. - You can get new ""heroes"" after every dungeon. However by the end of their first dungeon, more than likely they will be riddled with either mental or physical ailments. Now this is part of the fun but to it costs about 1500 gold to heal someone of a single ailment or to bring their stress down. Early in the game you aren't going to have any money for that. - A couple of upgrades don't actually do anything. At least the stats say they don't. I also had a skill up reduce the damage my hero did, but bring the damage window (possibility of lowest and highest amount of damage) just 1 closer. So not really worth it because of the huge gap- There are ways to buff your heroes sanity, but your heroes will be losing sanity at such a constant rate, it's not worth it at all. We're talking you buff for 4 on a character (using that heroes turn) only to have an enemy land a hit and cause a hero to lose 28 sanity, and 14 to those around them. And that's one attack- You don't know the turn order of attacking. So less strategy- The heroes talk all the time, adding some flavor text, which is fun. HOWEVER, the game stops when they do. So you're walking, you have to stop and listen. You're fighting, you have to stop and listen. And they are REALLY chatty. It ends up getting pretty frustrating because it breaks up the flow way too much, especially with all the grinding you'll be doing. - When trying to pick heroes from the wagon, their speech bubbles will block the hero above them, making it impossible to pick the hero you wanted for a short while- Various dungeons you can enter open and close for no forseeable reason. Want to play the randomly generated version of the first dungeon? Maybe you can, maybe you can't. - The game is too much about grinding. It sells itself as being really hard. And it is but for all the wrong reasons. The Dark Souls games are hard but because they're very well designed to slow down the player and play cautiously, using your head. Darkest Dungeon right now is hard because all the numbers are off. Stuff is too expensive, damage is too varied, and stats might as well be in brale. (I had a hero who I think had an 80% accuracy but would hit maybe 30% of the time, with no debuffs). The game quickly feels like you're grinding through the dungeons (often without much success) to give yourself a better shot later off with very little payoff. Again, I think the game at its core is great. But there needs to be some major balancing and a few design fixes to get it back on the right track of being an awesome game of seeing a group of heroes unravel and try to recover from the horrors they've seen in the dark below. I look forward to seeing this game grow.			"

Darkest DungeonDeveloper: Red Hook SudiosPublisher: Red Hook StudiosNote: A key for this game was provided by the developer for the purpose of writing an unbiased informative review. No other compensation was given.Introduction==========Writing reviews on Steam is a tricky business. With only the ""Positive"" and ""Negative"" options to work with, it makes it really difficult to accurately rate games that fall inbetween the two. Darkest Dungeon, to me, is one of those games. Also the review character limit makes it difficult to cover all aspects of a game at times. If a ""Neutral"" option were available, I'd flag this game with it. Darkest Dungeon has a lot going for it, but it also had a lot of things that are holding it back.Gameplay==========Darkest Dungeon is essentially a sidescrolling, turn-based RPG that takes place on/underneath your ancestor's estate. The estate serves as the game's hub, where you can hire new party members, buy or upgrade gear, buy supplies, relieve stress, or even pay your respects to the fallen heroes by visiting the graveyard. You can only have up to 4 characters in your adventuring party at any one time, but you can have up to 20 characters on standby back at the estate. There are 13 different classes currently available, with 2 still waiting to be implemented. Each class has their own unique skills and abilities. When in the dungeon you have to manage a few 'resources', the most important one is stress. This is by far one of the most aggravating mechanics when mixed with the game's other features. To reduce stress, you can either camp in the middle of a dungeon or leave your characters at the Tavern in the estate. Leaving them at the tavern costs a pretty penny, and makes your parties extremely unbalanced. Some skills can lower stress mid-battle, while some camping skills lowers stress as well. When stress gets too high, some characters may refuse to quest with you, and should you attain high stress mid-dungeon, that characters risks a Heart Attack...which can kill the character. When HP reaches zero, characters enter a state called ""At Death's Door"". When this is reached, they don't die yet, but any attack afterwards has a chance to kill them. Death is permanent, but you can replace dead characters with more new hires. This, however, means you'll spend some time getting the new characters back up to snuff, which means more time grinding and more gold spent. Speaking of gold, let's say you complete a quest and earn...4,500 gold. Ok, that's a respectable haul, but most of it will go towards stress relief, food, and supplies, leaving you with a trifling amount leftover. Almost all of your gold is spent maintaining your characters so that they do not die.Another thing you need to manage, which isn't anywhere near as bad as stress, is light. Bringing torches will help keep light levels high, which offer bonuses to your party such as the aility to scout ahead and see what each corridor has in store for you. Low light levels mean stronger enemies, but greater rewards. Use your best judgment to determine if the risk is worth the rewards or not.The large majority of the game will be spent in combat. Any skills you have unlocked will be useable here, with combat playing out in turns. As you take damage, your stress levels will go up. Instead of leveling up, your character's Resolve will increase. Battles and random events in the dungeons will test your Resolve frequently, earning you perks or afflictions. Perhaps the most annoying part of combat are corpses. When an enemy dies, they leave behind a corpse; these serve no purpose other than holding an enemy formation together. This can make targetting enemies in the rear difficult until you get rid of the corpses. This is completely unnecessary, and only make battles even more drawn out than they already are.Alot of players complain about is how unfair the RNG seems to be. There will be battles where you will miss 4 turns of attacks, while your enemies will crit every turn. It seems like the game itself is against you, but I honestly think it's just RNG being RNG. The dungeon crawling itself is quite bland. On the bottom right of your screen you will see the dungeon map. To travel to a room, click it and then hold the cursor and mouse button down ahead of your party in the direction you want them to go. You will find all manner of things as you explore, including enemies, traps, treasure chests, curios, relics, or any number of other random encounters. Sometimes you will find unused torches which can be picked up and added to your stock, other times you may find relics that can offers bonuses to your party once cleansed.Graphics==========The game has an intense gothic, Lovecraftian look/feel to it, and is by far the best thing abotu Darkest Dungeon. Character designs are unqiue and thought out. Combat animations are simple, but effective. When actions are taken the affected characters are brought front and center on the screen, so you can focus on what's going on. Characters stand idle and have a small amount of animation to show then breathing while idle. This is a nice little touch that more games need to bring a sense of realism. As characters and enemies are damaged, small blood splatters are shown in corners of your screen.Sound and Music==========The music is another good thing. It's very dark and gothic; fitting for the setting of the game. The estate has a somber tune, and the dungeons have a dark, ambient tune that makes you feel like you are definitely deep inside a dark dungeon with little hope of escape. Battle music is fast and blood-pumping; coupled with the battle sound effects and stress mechanics, this can turn most battles into quite intense encounters. I also *really* liked the narrator in the dungeons.Performance==========The game runs beautifully with little to no issues whatsoever, at least for me it did.The one complaint I have is that sometimes loading a dungeon can take AGES. Sometimes it loads right away! Not sure what causes this, but it happened to me a couple of times.Aside from that, it ran at a steady framerate and I didn't have any odd crashes or bugs. The game is played mostly with the mouse. I can't see how this game could be played comfortably with a controller, so I stuck with the mouse. It worked very well.Final Thoughts==========Despite the downsides, I found myself enjoying the game quite a bit, and that is why I gave it a thumbs up rating. It's a really engaging dungeon crawler, although it can sometimes be really unfair and requires quite a large amount of grinding to be able to afford the upgrades you need. Still, it's quite challenging and I can safely recommend this game to people who like grinding and have that feeling of fulfillment when they reach goals. If you can look past the flaws the game has, you will find a somewhat enjoyable game within the Darkest Dungeon, although with a little more work and a few updates, it could be a great game.Gameplay Demo==========

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Darkest Dungeon is a grimdark dungeon crawling, side scrolling, mixed turn-based combat and real time adventure, rogue-like game developed and self-published by Red Hook Studios.The game boasts several unique features, the most prominent of which is the Stress system which may cause your heroes to either panic or rally depending on the situation. If a hero panics, said hero may become 'afflicted' or become 'virtuous,' becoming either a liability or a benefit to your current expedition.This game was made possible through crowd funding via Kickstarter, as well as Early Access.PLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes on the role of an unnamed 'Heir' of a powerful and wealthy family. After being called back to his ancestral home by an enigmatic figure known as 'The Ancestor' who awoken a sleeping evil within the depth of the family Manor, the Heir must now use what remains of the family fortune to gather a rag tag group of adventurers to explore, cleanse, reclaim, and rebuild his family's estate from the evil that now inhabits it.“Women and men... soldiers and outlaws... fools and corpses. All will find their way to us now that the road is clear.” - The AncestorPROS:+ AMAZING grimdark 2D artstyle+ Very good narration and voice acting+ Very good sound design and music that matches with the game's theme+ Numerous and versatile classes – there is a certain joy in experimenting with different classes, parties and skill compositions+ Very good and unique gameplay mechanics such as: Torch and light levels that directly affects gameplay Stress levels (Heroes can panic and become less effective if stress goes to high) Quirk System (Adds certain positive or negative effects to your heroes)+ Skill customization for the heroes – this makes them relevant even with different party compositions and tactical situations+ Harsh but manageable difficulty levels – mandatory autosave and no reloads with permanent hero deaths+ Good overall presentation+ Good replayability+ Lengthy game time+ Interesting back story and loreCONS:- Limited number of dungeons – to be fair, the dungeons are procedurally generated.- Sudden and unexpected difficulty spikes – specially when transitioning from Veteran to Champion- Limited visual customization for both town and heroes – mods[www.nexusmods.com] are available if you want to change hero skins- Resources (other than gold) becomes irrelevant late game, specially once the town is fully upgraded- Limited number of trinkets (equipment and accessories)- Occational graphic glitch- One or two crashes here and thereNEUTRAL:+/- The back story and lore is nice, but the game's story itself boils down to “kill the boss” – you can skip all other bosses and the back story with it.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME for any dungeon crawler and turn-based tactics fan. Featuring a good back story backed up with amazing artstyle, Darkest Dungeon brings to the player the tactical challenge of XCOM, the grimdarkness of Dark Souls, and the joy of exploration of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, all in one package.WORTH IT?I can easily RECOMMEND Darkest Dungeon at its full price of $24.99 USD (or your regional equivalent). With good replayability from the unique classes and the relatively unpredictable combat results, the game can last you for at least 20 hours or more.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

Posted: April 28, 2016
												If you were my friend, on a budget, and asking for my Darkest Dungeon review I would say: Don't buy this game.It took me a while (30hrs) to decide how I really and truly felt about Darkest Dungeon. If you are looking to buy this game then you are probably like me, a fan of difficult games (Dark Souls comes to mind). Let me go ahead and give you the warning that I feel I didn't get from looking at reviews...this game is not difficult in a way that is remotely satsifying.When I play a difficult game I want to feel something after a tough battle. I want to feel like I really earned my sword, my armor, my loot, my gold. I want to feel like all the progress I've made is deserved, because I learned from my mistakes and overcame my ignorance of the world's mechanics. At some point I want to feel successful, and look down upon this horrific world that I've made my way in and say, ""Heck yeah this place is scary, but I have at last become one of those scary things in it.""Darkest Dungeon is not that game. (Spoilers)1a) Stress Damage (Too High): Stress damage sounds cool right? Very Lovecraftian. But the problem here is that you are already walking such a razor thin margin of success that all you need is for your main damage dealer to go insane to wipe the party. Each character has about 100pts of stress they can take before giving in to madness...which really isn't much when enemies do anywhere from 15-20pts of stress damage per attack. 1b) Immersion Breaking: There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of logic to what causes stress or how much you take. Seeing a reanimated corpse shambling towards me would stress me out more than getting splashed with a cup full of blood...especially if I am a Crusader, Leper, or Highwayman who is...probably used to being splashed with blood.2a) Trinkets: I want to say that the items you use to ""boost"" your characters stats are worthless. That isn't true; it's just that they are nearly worthless. Yes you can find the rares, and you can get the ancients but the drawbacks are so significant that I almost never wanted to equip them. A bracer that gives +25 damage? Yes please! But it also gives +20% stress damage...when I'm already taking 20 stress a hit?2b) After playing Darkest Dungeon for 30hrs I have yet to find a single piece of loot that made me happy. Not a single one and for the life of me I can't understand why the developers went with such a harsh Catch-22 for all these items. If I don't care about finding gear to boost up my characters then why am I even delving into these dungeons? 3a) The story. 30hrs in and I am tired of hearing the narrator as he constantly sputter 12-letter words ripped directly from the pages of your favorite Lovecraftian horror story. Excusing that, my problem with the story is that the narrator explains everything in the intro scene. Quite literally. As you delve through the dungeon and find notebook pages you slowly come to the realization that they do not reveal anything new.3b) Immersion Breaking: I start to ask myself...what in the world am I doing down here? Maggots can apparently appear from thin air so it's not like I'm going to live in this hellhole after I clear all the monsters and bandits out. My ancestor is hecka dead so...I'm not here to save anyone. ...Why am I sending all these people to die again? I mean...It's not for money. Only people making money in this game are my vassals (tavern owner, abbey, guild, blacksmith) who, setting aside the fact that they are charging me straight out the nose for things, apparently require I give them dozens of family portraits and land deeds in order to fulfill the orders that I just paid (and continue to pay) them for.4a) The Bosses: Back to Dark Souls 2 for a second. One of the most frustrating fights for me was the gargoyles in the belltower. More than almost any other fight it felt unfair, as you get swamped from every direction, skewered, and suffer multiple deaths. But eventually you get it. You learn the pattern, match it to your fighting style, and succeed.There is none of that here. What seemed interesting and innovative to me in Darkest Dungeon was the number of classes and the combination of parties you could make. But gradually you realize that some of the classes are truly worthless (Antiquarian comes to mind) and even worse, that the game requires that you bring certain classes to certain dungeons. It curtails the way that you play and I am not at all a fan of paying money for a game only to have it pretty much micromanage my fun. 4b) Immersion Breaking: The Wizened Hag. After fighting six different room battles I finally come upon the hag only to discover...she sits in the back row behind an unbreakable cooking pot and cannot be moved. Literally...cannot be moved. So why in the world would you give me so many characters and abilites that change the enemies battle positions?  Why give me a power and then say, ""No, not here where it might be used best."" After the Wizened Hag fight (which I narrowly won thanks to a Crusader with Spear of Light) I looked up tactics for every single boss on the wiki, something I would normally be ashamed to do on my first playthrough of any game. Why? Because I'm not about to lose 4 to 5 hours of gameplay and grinding because Darkest Dungeon in unfair. Not difficult, but actually just unfair. 5a) Darkest Dungeon is simply unfair. Not in a sense of ""It's okay, I can still get through this limping through the dungeon"" kind of unfair, but in a ""Hey, your characters are going to die today, and that's all there is to it."" Kind of unfair. I have had a geared up team stunlocked to death by spiders in a hallway. I sat for four turns (all the spiders go, all my team recovers from stun = 1 turn) while the spiders stunned, marked, and killed my team. I have had enemies focus down my team one by one, from the healer in postion 4 to the tank in postion 1. Not with damage, but with stress, so that my characters pass instead of taking their turns and get picked apart. I have walked into a hallway and gotten surprised at 90 light, then walked into a room and gotten surprised at 80 light, and then gotten surprised leaving that room into another hallway at 76 light. I have watched as characters on my team repeatedly miss hitting the enemy 3 times in a row despite having no debuffs at all, and then watched as enemies debuffed to detract from accuracy, speed, and damage, proceed to get a critical hit, every hit, that takes my characters to deaths door and then the grave. 6a) These situations are common, which brings me to my last point. The game is unfair, so there isn't a real reason to get attached to your characters. So... If you aren't here to take your home back, and you aren't here to save your ancestor, and you aren't here to become fabulously wealthy, and you aren't here to lead a team of chosen warriors through hell and back...what is the point of playing Darkest Dungeon? I ask this knowing that there isn't one.*****EDIT 5/21/2016At this point in time only 0.9% of people who have purchased Darkest Dungeon have beaten the game on normal. (* 0.9% is from the Global achievement stats which lists by percentage of all players)			"

												TL DR: A fascinating game turns into a boring grindfest, skip or wait for rebalance patch--------------------------------------------------...And it's a pity, cause I really like this game! The combat is awesome and diverse, the dark atmosphere is perfect, the random nature of the game makes the dungeon runs very fun every single time - overall, this is a great game, let down by two major factors:1) The Catch-22 equipment upgrades, caused by the fact that your characters level far faster than you generate the necessary money for their upgrades.so, let's say you've leveled four of your characters from level four to level five. There's a game mechanic where high level characters will refuse to go to low level dungeons (which are beneath their dignity).So, the four champions can only do level 5 dungeons.But you can't beat a level 5 dungeon without the equipment upgrades.But equipment upgrades costs money.But to get the money you need to beat the level 5 dungeon.But the champions cannot beat it!So to solve it, you get a B-team doing the dungeons as well, but then you need to spend money on the B-team! The only solution is to recruit new characters (recruiting level 0 characters is free) and duing suicide runs with them, which is extremely grindy and boring.But this is nothing compared to...2) The EndgameBasically, once your team of four best characters of the highest level, the finest characters, goes into the first level of the final dungeon and beats it...They can never go there again!So you level four more best characters for level two of the dungeon.And they also can't go there again!So you do it again for level three, and level four.Assuming no one dies (which is impossible), this is 16 CHARACTERS you need to level up to level 6!This is the worst game restriction I've ever seen, I don't even know what to compare it with - it's like in Skyrim you would have to start a new character from scratch for every single boss fight. And for people saying ""this is hardcore"" - no, this is not hardcore, stupid restrictions to artifically prolong the game's life by making you do a ton of unnesessary work and grindfest are not hardcore!With these two factors, I cannot recommend the game in its current state.

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon is a challenging rogue like turn based game that features gothic and Lovecraftian artwork and themes throughout the game. It is currently in Early Access and is being developed by Red Hook Studios.In this game you are the heir to a manor that has been abandoned by your family due to a gateway being opened, allowing monsters and evil to be released and corrupt the land. You are tasked with ridding the lands of these mosnters and this evil, as well as to restore the lost glory and riches of your family. At your disposal are countless up and coming adventurers, enticed by the promise of fame and riches. Their mettle and their wills are tested in each dungeon. They will be stressed, they will be driven mad, they will ultimately die in this quest. Pros: +This game is beautifully narrated, and adds to the dark, gothic overtones of the game.+The artwork has a dark, hand drawn feel to it, which also adds to the gothic overtones of the game.+The storyline, though not the most original in the scheme of things, is very nice and the concept of it works well.+The stress mechanic your heroes face as they are used, abused, injured, and driven mad from the dark is very original.+When your heroes die, they die permanently. There's even a little graveyard for them.+Great music which is very atmospheric and adds to that dark feel of the game.+Your heroes have a great selection of classes which have their own unique abilities.+There are a decent variety of monsters and bandit enemies to fight+The game is difficult, but not overwhelming to the point you want to put your fist through your computer monitor. Cons -The game can get grindy and repetitive after a couple of dungeon areas.-There can be a lot of micromanaging and planning  for the dungeons, which normally would be a good thing, but this game takes it to another level.-Randomness of the fight encounters can and will be unfair at times.-There is a learning curve and the difficulty of the game can be a disadvantage towards casual players.-The game itself has been in early access for a while and at this point is unfinished Final Thoughts Overall I've really enjoyed playing this game. The dark overtones of the game greatly add to my immersion, and has been unlike any other roguelike game that I've played. The difficulty level of this game requires me to think, plan ahead, and treat each battle in a different way. I normally do not care for Rogue Like style games, as most just don't have enough to keep me immersed. I am disappointed that this game is still in Early Access development, but I'm hoping that it's due to the developers wanting to balance some things within the game. I paid the full price for this game, and have not been disappointed. Would I recommend this game?  Wholeheartedly. It is a very fun, unique, and challenging game. It is worth the full price. I would not, however, recommend this to people who don't enjoy challenging roguelike games. I rate this a 8/10. "

Early Access Review
								Let me preface this by saying how much I dislike turn-based combat.  In all my years of gaming, games like Final Fantasy and, well, any JRPG really, rubbed me up several wrong ways when I came back to the realization that my party and the enemy were taking it in turns to stand in a forest clearing and kick each other in the shins until the guy who didn't bring enough healing potions fell over.  The only game with turn-based mechanics that I ever liked, even loved, was XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which felt like playing a massive, high-stakes board game where tactical positioning and cover was of the utmost importance, and the turns progressed in a way that made sense.Well, after several years of being in a Pathfinder group, and about a decade of being in love with gothic horror in general, Darkest Dungeon did for me what XCOM did.  It did the impossible.  It got me to like turn-based combat all over again.That said, calling D.D. a ""turn-based"" game is doing the fantastically well-implemented RNG elements a disservice.  RNG is infamously difficult to get right, especially in rougelike titles where they basically hold up the entirety of the experience, but D.D. has found that precarious balance between unrelenting and fair, where challenges feel surrmountable and all of the numbers mean very important things that become gradually evident over time.  There's this problematic occurance in a lot of RNG games I've played where the slightest mishap in balancing the numbers is the single, tenuous line between monstrously unfair and insultingly easy.  D.D., to its credit and my endless amazement, has found the balance upon the edge of the knife.And, holy crap you guys, this game is still in Early Access.  Oh my good lord, but I cannot WAIT to see how these guys polish their formula, because it's already a mirror finish.In general, there's a whole bunch to love about D.D., but I'll rattle off a few things that I find immensely pleasurable:--The ""crowquill"" art style and gothic, Lovecraftian influences are drop-dead gorgeous.  Props to their art designer (and also to Mike Mingola, who kind of started the whole thing) for making some of the creepiest, grimiest, flat-out prettiest aesthetic choices I've seen since Dark Souls (the first one, that is).--The varied player classes and character builds makes for some damn fun experimentation and augmentation as you build up resources and plan your parties' ventures.  I love how almost every class is viable in almost any position with the right build and gear.  I've already had great fun trying out new kinds of parties, mostly failing, and learning a lot from those failures.  There's some deep, rich mechanics under this game's surface, and I, for one, am eager to puzzle them out.--The tactical positioning mechanics.  Holy crap, this might have basically sold the entire thing to me.  As I mentioned previously, turn-based games aren't my thing.  Turn-based tactics, on the other hand, now there's an entirely different bugbear.  The way you suss out how different squaddies fit together, the best party orders, the best adventuring combo teams, and then watching in abject terror as your team gets suprised and jumbled and your entire oder is screwed up and you have to scramble, sweating and swearing, to reassemble your precious roster row before that dreaded, incoming TPW.  Glorious.  Simply glorious.--The weight of the player's decisions.  Everything matters in this game.  Every little decision the player makes can have massive consequences in the short AND the long.  I seriously have not played anything so maschostically challenging, nor as powerfully rewarding, since Demon's Souls and Dark Souls.That's about it.  There's so much greatness in this game, and so much I could talk about.  It is in early access though, so I think a brief list of more things I'd like to see is in order:1. Random events in dungeons: coming across a lost family searching for a way out, or perhaps an ancient tome of eldritch power that the party can't decide what to do with, or maybe recuing a hapless villager from the clutches of the swine hoards.  Those are pretty simple examples off the top of my head, but this game is absolutely RIPE for the odd proc gen, or maybe even scripted events that can only occur once per playthrough, that comes along to mix up the formula.  Some great opportunities for challenging mechanics-driven decision-making here, guys.  Love to see it implemented.2. More character classes: yeah, there's already a lot, and I know some more have been planned, but holy crap guys, I cannot believe how many concepts for classes didn't make it in to a game like this.  The Huntress, the Archaeologist (Indiana Jones, anybody?), the Librarian, the Investigator (I'm thinking Shadow Over Innsmouth), the Sheriff (or maybe Marshall?), the Muskateer, the Assassin, and that's just right off the top of my head.  Seriously, to see more awesome adventuring dudes and dudettes to send to their untimely demises would make me just the happiest.3. More insight into the world and the story of the Ancestor: seriously, the bridging narrative (what there is of it) in this game is turning out to be some sick, twisted, wonderfully macabre worldbuilding.  I want so much more.  I seriously can't get enough.  If there's a way to implement it (as perhaps in a way similar to number 1 up above), more story missions would be the absolute tops.  It's already great, you guys.  I just want more.So, yeah.  Early Access.  Already an absolute gem.  Only going to get better.  GIVE THESE GUYS YOUR MONEY.  THEY EARNED IT.  Want to see more of it.  Probably will.  Eagerly await new content and alterations.Peace.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has gave me faith in the future of gaming.  I'm serious.  Dead serious.  You will die in this game.  You will get attached to at least one character minimum.  Upgrade them and they will die.  They will win your heart with valiant blows of crit's then out of the blue they are dead.  You will rage quit possibly cause of said circumstance.  Strategy is key in this game.  There is some luck involved, but if you ever have played a dice based game you know how that goes.  I am happy this game exists, and hope the developers only continue to add more content.  So far I have no complaints really.  Only thing I could say is I want more classes.  10/10 Holds a special place in my heart.			"

Early Access Review
								Foreword: This review actually hurts me to write, because I truly believe this game has insane potential, it just needs some tweaking to be something damn near a masterpiece, and since its still early access, its likely we could see those tweaks in the near future, so keep that in mindWhen most people think of Darkest Dungeon, certain words may spring to mind: Difficulty, Frustration, Stress. But if I had to sum up this game in just one word, that word would be ""Stagnation."" I had been following this game rather closely for some time and loved everything I saw, the game seemed PERFECT in my eyes, at least until recent updates to the game brought some ""rebalancing."" The latest updates saw rather drastic increases in the cost of... well... pretty much everything, heros cost more to train, town upgrades require more resources, and stress healing will bleed you dry. This, on its own, wouldnt have been too bad, had they not also considerably decreased the gold you'll get for going on expeditions. Many times ive completed a quest, only to spend most the gold i just recieved to lower my troop's stress levels from said quest, before saving what precious little is left to fund the next mission. Repeat this proccess about 5-6 times and congratulations, you now have enough to upgrade one of your heros' equipment or skills, and maybe a town building or two..... once. But if you're dedicated enough you can do this for long enough to have a fully equipped level 2 team, now you're ready to progress!Oh, you got surprised by a horde of spiders who shuffled the order of your party and killed your healer and highwayman before you could do anything about it? Well, have fun starting over, see you in another 35 missions and we'll do this again.So the point is this: Players who came into this new update with their towns half finished and their parties mostly set up will be fine, but if you're just starting out, the unforgiving gold deficit will keep you in crippling poverty and grind progress to such a slow and repetitive crawl that you'll actually forget why you're even playing, if you're unsure on whether to pick this one up, I'd hold off for now, wait for a few more updates and then check again.

												I’m awful at writing methodical, comprehensive reviews, so I’ll stick to bullet points like a basic ♥♥♥♥♥. Presentation Flawless. The gritty comic book style creates for an intense and immersive atmosphere befitting of lovecraft's literary style.  Gameplay Hard to learn, harder to master. The game’s mechanics are complex and not always well explained. This can be frustrating at times, particularly when your band of heroes is steamrolled by a boss you’ve never encountered, simply because you didn’t know what to expect. I recommend playing the game for a few hours, beating a few bosses, then skimming the wiki so you can better understand the in-depth mechanics of the game’s RNG. Nonetheless, its amazingly fun and satisfying. Music Perfect. Stuart Chatwood did an amazing job on the soundtrack. The music is also well implemented with the game mechanic of light, making for some intense battles where you feel like a true badass. Voice Acting There’s only one voice actor, Wayne June, and yet his performance easily lends to 50% of Darkest Dungeon’s enjoyability. His succulent voice invades my ears like some obscure lovecraftian alien lifeform. Dialogue While I love June’s lines and delivery, my one complaint with the entire game is that around the end of my first playthrough, I found myself tired of the repetitive lines from the characters and Ancestor. One can only hear the “Remind yourself…” line so many times before it loses its majesty. In short I absolutely love The Darkest Dungeon. It was worth every penny and more. It even got me interested in Lovecraft’s stories. Given the new DLC coming in early 2017, I can’t see any better time to pick up Darkest Dungeon. Is rly gud.			"

												An excellent twist on the turn-based dungeon crawler, Darkest Dingeon is a great game.  Part management sim, part dungeon crawler, the game has you manage a collection of dungeon diving RPG heroes like in many similar games.  The difference is that your warriors are not singularly important.  If you lose a favored hero the game doesn't reload from a save, or let you restart the dungeon.  That hero is gone, and someone else will need to take his place.  Thus it's to your advantage to maintain a stable of heroes instead of that one party of your favorites (a la XCOM).Added to that your heroes aren't delving into high fantasy dungeonscapes  where good guys always win.  Their journeys pit them against eldritch horrors that can drive them mad or reduce them to catatonic helplessness.  The cumulative affects of this end up being worse than mere death.  This is where the management part of the game comes into play.  Your heroes need some time for R&R to help them forget the horrors of the deep, and for that you maintain and upgrade a small town where they can pray to the gods for strength or drown their sorrows in the tavern.In this game a cool idea meets excellent execution.  The art style is very cool, while simultaneously representing the grim, Cthulu aesthetic.  Couple that with the narration, smooth controls, and a UI that leaves all the important info readily available to you while simultaneously leaving the screen uncluttered so you can appreciate the dark beauty of the game.  The worst criticism that I can muster is that the music is forgettable.  Like, I have three hours in game as I write this, and I can't remember what it sounds like.Even with all that, a game that relies on combat so heavily could still fail if that combat is poorly done and otherwise not fun.  Darkest Dungeon has a combat system that's deep enough to offer many choices while not overwhelming you or forcing you to focus on min/maxing to get by.This game is amazing.  My only regret about my purchase is that I didn't find it earlier.			"

												It's the Summer Sales, I decide to write something to let more people experience the cool feeling of exploring dungeons, fighting all kinds of monsters and mind breaking by those hideous creature.In brief, it is a roguelike plus simulation game. In fact, the player is running a small hamlet, which was called... Hamlet of course. This villiage is surrouded by different ""residential area"", where different styles of  ""kind"" neighbours live. The task is simple, recruit your ""villains"" to ""plunder"" those ""neighborhoods"", then use the ""loot"" to reinforce your ""villain party"", and eventually kill the boss of those ""neighbor"", and lead your hamlet to the ""brightest"" world.I've never been so close to the Death… One of the most important feature——Permanent Death. The dead hero is just dead, nothing but a name and a portrait in the graveyard. (Of course, the portait of the hero is almost the same as every other hero with the same class.) Due to the mechanic of the gameplay, every slightest misplay could result in the total team wipe. and also, some of those misplays will absolutely lead the team to  its domesday.I've never felt so terrified… The unfriendly part of this game is way more than just death, the existence of stress meter will provide the team with more challenge. In most of rpg games, every party member faces the death bravely and is ready to jump into the pit for the greater good at any time. Not the same thing will happens here, team member will get stressed during exploration, they will become terrified, angry, selfish and panicky. Although there might be some good mental status, stepping into the deeper dungeon will strikes the hearts of heroes in different ways. Remember, the collapse soul is even more dreadful than the shattered body.I never realized I could be so week…The low level heroes are imbeciles! But of course, the high level heroes are almost the same. Form the very beginning, there is no phase of pleasnt period where the player can beat the game easily. During most of the gameplay, the difficulty is always associated with the game progress, that's to say, the game is to be difficult when you start the game, while during rest of the gameplay, the difficulty is set to impossible.  The attack, hit rate, initiative of the heroes are so low that evey dungeon could only be cleared through hell. With the status, quirks and diseases, every adventure can be fatal to every hero.I've never seen these thing placed in somewhere like here…Apart of the battle, exploring the dungeon will let party discover a lot of curios. Party members can interact will these curio. If party member uses certain item, there is a high chance that they will get some precious traesure or get buffed; whereas just interact with hand will sometimes draw themselve into dilemma,I've never thought this halmet is carring all these stories…The heritage is such a mess…The sin of the ancestor needs to be pay bit by bit. Altough the game is of great openness, the storyline is also attractive. After clearing the ordinary dungeon, it will also add some porgress to the story and when it reaches a check point, a boss dungeon will appear. Before stepping into the boss dungeon, the ancestor will tell you the origin of this boss, and how he had made such a monster, then asks you to get ride of this notorious thing. These thing could be a man, a monster or even an object. Every boss has a attracting story behind it, waiting the exploration of the player.  So this is the Darkest Dungeon, where you can assemble heroes will different classes, equipments and quirks, enter a randomly generated dungeon with different styles with most unfriendly diffculty, develop a weird but unified story.Fans of this kind of games, please do enjoy this game, where you can feel the malevonlence from evey corner of the game play,-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------趁着夏季特卖，我决定好好推一下这个神奇的游戏，让更多的人体会到前往地牢探险打怪却被各式各样怪物虐成抖M的爽快感受。简单地说，这是一个Roguelike+模拟经营类的游戏。实际上，玩家运营着一个小村庄，在这个村庄周围有着各种各样的“居民区”，居住着各种各样“友善”的邻居。任务很简单，招募“恶棍们”前往那些“邻居”的领土烧杀抢掠，然后用得到的“不义之财”强化自己的“恶棍小队”，最终杀死“邻居们”的“头目”，然后前往最“光明”的世界。我从来没有距离死亡如此之近……  这个游戏最重要的要素——永久死亡。英雄死了就是死了，死后他就只变成一个墓地里面的名字（当然了，还有她的照片吗虽然同类的恶棍长得都是一样的）。【不过，好像在最新的更新“城镇事件”中，好像可以复活英雄了，但是技能和装备还是要重新买】。由于游戏各种机制，任何一个细小失误都将成为团灭的开端，当然了，还有一部分细小失误将会毫无疑问地将队伍引向终末。我从来没感受到这样强烈的恐惧……  这个游戏对于玩家的不友好还远不止这一点，压力值的存在对于队伍来说是一个更大的考验。古往今来，大部分游戏里面的队伍成员都是直面人生随时准备慷慨赴死的。但是这里不一样，小队会有压力，会恐惧、愤怒、自私、惊慌，虽然也有好的精神状态存在，但是前往阴暗的地牢总从各种各样的方向打击着英雄的心脏。请记住，精神崩溃比肉体重伤更为恐怖。我从来没发现原来自己这么弱…… 低等级英雄就是个废物！当然了，高等级英雄也同样是个废物。从游戏的一开始，就没有一个低难度的过度期。游戏的大部分时间中，难度等级都是与进度相对应的，也就是说从一开始游戏至少就是高级水平。其余的时间，游戏则是终极水平。英雄们的攻击力、命中率、主动性都很低，低到每一个迷宫都是千辛万苦才能通过的状况。再加上各种异常状态、各种怪癖与疾病、各种小boss的存在，每一次探险都将可能是致命的。我从来没在这种地方看到过这些……除去战斗之外，探索地牢的过程中还会遇到各种各样古董、装饰等物件。这些物件都是能够与小队进行互动的，并且每种物件都有着可以与之互动的道具，使用这些道具将会获得一些财报或有益加成；直接动手的话，则有可能使得小队陷入进度两难的状况。我从来没想过，这个小村庄背后竟背负着这些……获得的遗产，竟然是这样的烂摊子……祖先造的孽，要来一点一点清理干净。这个游戏虽然有着很高的自由度，但是主线剧情还是很吸引人的。在普通的地牢通关后，会增加故事的进度，每到达一个check point就会有boss出现，在进行boss地牢探索前，祖先会告诉你这个boss的来源，他是怎么养出个这样的怪物之类的，然后拜托你清理掉作恶多端的东西。这些东西可能是人、魔物甚至是物件。每个boss背后都有着一段引人入胜的故事，等待玩家的探索。这就是暗黑地牢，你将使用不同职业、技能、装备、癖好的英雄，进入随机生成的各种风格的地牢，伴随着对于新手及其不友好的难度，发展着一个怪异而又统一的故事主题。对于这方面爱好的大家，请一定要来享受从每个角落都散发着无限恶意的游戏吧！ "

Early Access Review
								I don't usally writte a review for something the first day I play it. But this game just game me one hell of a first impression. A well executed concept that is skillfully made in all it's areas. Art, sound, gameplay, interface it all mix in perfectly to provide a complete experiance in a game that is supposed to be incomplete. This is looking out to be the best early access game I've played by far. I can however see it becoming repetious in the long run. There seem to be much grinding to ever stand a chance going into harder battles. But at the moment I am struggeling finding flaws with it. If you can wait to the games full release, things are looking really good at moment. If you really wanna try it right now, then have no fears, except for whatever that lurks in the darkness.			"

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon? More like Dankest Dungeon. This game involves high levels of fun, and well, more fun! I enjoy this game very very very much. Do note that this game is in early access though, so the price will probably raise and the gameplay will get much better.PRO'S:- Dungeon Crawler- Many different moves- Many different classes- Difficulty (resides in skill)- Unrelenting Fun- Bosses- Story Line- Randomly generated mapsCON'S:- Can be more challenging than most people could handle.- The stress meter/levels go up very fast no matter what you try to do- Permanant death is understandable, but when you lose a character you've built up for ages to a 1 HP Skellington... I meeeeaaaan c'mon- Gold does not come easy, and can be spent very quickly due to highly priced... everything.- Should be something more like $15, but $20 is fine.That's it! I hope you do buy and enjoy the game for the price! If the game is ever on sale and you DON'T BUY IT, gurl you crazy.			"

												I should have written something a long, long time ago. I've been playing this since Beta.Reasons I love this game:+ The Atmosphere of the game is perfect. The writing and Narrator tell a great story and the Narrator quotes in battles, interacting with curios, and other cutscenes (Boss battles, town events) is well done. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the dungeon themes descend, with your characters, into madness as the light wanes. + You get a very real sense that your characters grow, suffer, and die. As their stress increases they let you know. They inform you whether they feel up to another run or whether they want to go on a drunken bender. Some of them will ONLY go on drunken benders and do not care if you want them to gamble or go pray. And it makes sense that the guy with Deviant Tastes is no longer allowed in the Brothel so, yes, you do have to address this issue. + The upgrades to the Stage Coach allow for characters to show up at Level 3, which save alot of time and money on levelling and upgrades. Which makes sense because as your Hamlet grows, people are better trained when they arrive and no longer run into the darkness unprepared. + Red Hook is still updating the game. Want to jump right into a harder difficulty? Stygian Mode is arriving soon. Want a shorter game experience because you don't want to farm out 100+ Deeds to fully upgrade The Blacksmith? Radiant Mode is here. And you can customize your experience as well. Don't like the corpses feature? You can disable it. Don't like enemy crits for ridiculous amounts? You can edit that in the options. Want more Town Events? Increase their number. Did you lose an entire party in a boss battle and lose trinkets? There's a special mission to help lessen the complete loss now. + The 'Wolves at the Door' plot mission.+ DLC is planned for the future. Regarding Criticisms:- Yes, the game is difficult. However, I do not think that the difficulty of this game is above your ability to handle. This game teaches you to learn from your failures. I've put more hours into this than the 129 showed because of Offline play, but I still get party-wiped on occasion. Sometimes the enemy just gets lucky and rolls a strong crit. Some things can be planned for: you can bring provisions for interacting with Curios, you can Reinforce positive quirks and remove negative ones. There are 15 classes which all excel in certain areas. Skeletons don't bleed, but the entirety of the Warrens does. Some of the more recent reviews are going on about how difficult/unforgiving the game can be. Again, the game is difficult. But if you are willing to learn from your failures and plan effectively then you can mitigate some of the threats facing you. If you want an easy experience where you walk through the game, this isn't for you. - Yes, negative effects from Curios are strong. If you don't learn from mistakes and insist of repeating them you will have a bad time. Learn what works and what doesn't. If you're into guides there are many great guides on the forums that explain Curio interactions. If you want to go in Blind then take notes.- Rebuilding the town feels like it will take forever in a Non-Radiant Game Mode. Spreading out your resources is a bad idea. Focus on what you need most and really invest in that.If you're interested in a solid RPG with good combat mechanics, a solid story and atmosphere, and understand that there can be no bravery without madness (and enemy stress-crits), this game is probably for you.If you're interested in a game where you can plow through in a quick time and be able to ignore your mistakes, then this game is probably not for you. Hope this helps.			"

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon is an unforgiving RNG-based Dungeon Crawler that is currently in Early Access. In Darkest Dungeon you assemble a team of 'heroes' to try and restore your ancestral estate to its former glory. While travelling through dungeons you not only fight the monsters that lurk there but also stress which can be even more deadly at times.+Really nice hand-drawn art style which suits the game well and looks great+Ten different hero classes each with their own abilities and combat roles+Party order effects what abilities your heroes can use and adds another level of depth to the combat system+You can upgrade your heroes' equipment back at your estate+Lots of loot to find in the dungeons+Many different enemy types including a number of boss-level enemies+Bosses provide a good challenge without feeling overpowered or unbalanced+A few different locations including 'The Darkest Dungeon'+The different parts of your estate can be upgraded to provide more benefits to you+Permadeath really is permanent due to the game frequently saving so every choice has consequences that cannot be undone+Dungeons are procedurally generated so you'll never see the same layout twice+Outstandingly good narrator+/-The combat system is completely reliant on RNG including in what order your heroes and your enemies get their turn. For the most part the combat system is fun (so long as you like RNG) but having no idea when your heroes or enemies will have a turn is incredibly irritating and often leads to the enemy team having numerous attacks before you get your first. Due to the RNG system it is also possible for you entire team to be wiped out before they even have a turn.+/-The stress system, like the combat system is a bit hit and miss as well. Stress increases very quickly when you are playing which is understandable against powerful enemies but when your heroes get stressed after a low-level enemy attacks it can be frustrating. Stress also brings out the best, but usually worst, out of your heroes, when their stress level reaches 100/100 they will either develop a positive trait (increasing their combat effectiveness and boosting your team's morale) or a negative trait. It's the negative traits I have a problem with, when a hero develops a negative trait you lose almost all control over them (for the most part they will either refuse to take their turn or you will have no control over which ability they use on which enemy which can be rather frustrating), as well as this most characters with a negative trait (such as paranoia) will refuse medical help from your other characters even when they are on death's door which can quite easily lead to them dying.-While on a mission you can only heal your characters in combat or by setting up a campfire (only available on certain missions and has a limited number of uses)Verdict:8Despite a couple of flaws this is great dungeon crawling game so long as you know what you're getting in to. If you're unsure what RNG is or haven't played a game involving it before then I suggest you watch a number of gameplay videos before playing the game.*** I used a stemkey provided by the developer for review purpose ***If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Posted: December 1, 2015
												Outdated review. Havent played it before its release. So, please, take this review with a grain of salt.It really pains me to say but i cant recommend this game now. Not because it is hard or unfair sometimes (now many more times after the last update). I actually only lost 5 characters that i cared about in this game in my whole time playing it while the rest were just poor souls i sent to their doom in lower levels to pass the time. So you can see im not one of ""i lost 50 characters, this game is bad"". The problem is is that with the last update they just murdered the sense of progression and the freedom you had to try different strategies, not to mention that there is little reward. I cant feel playing this game right now because i dont want to catch new  heroes, get lucky with some quirks, lock them and see them become useless because almost all enemies now are able to apply debuff. When in a single turn those precious quirks i locked in some characters make them as useless as a character with no positive quirk, i stopped caring for them. Why would i care for a vestal with higher hp, dodge and speed if she can  lose it all in a single turn? Why would i care for a lepper that have extra res in some status since the enemies that apply them buff them? What is the point of making a character unique? There is none, period. The devs just thought it was a good idea to m ake enemies able to debuff with their attacks (note, they didnt get any single new attack. Their attacks can si mply apply debuff and that is it now.) while giving nothing new to players to counter these tactics. ""Oh, there are trinkets that make your character debuff res higher"". Well, that's exactly when they start murdering the freedom. I dont want to go all 4 characters with one of the two slots availables for accesories to carry the same trinket while having only one room available for a trinket i would like. What is the point of getting new trinkets, try nem combinations of trinkets? None. That's that. I dont like being unable to create badass characters just the way i could. FYI, i went with a character with trinkets that gave him around 40 dodge in a level 0 run. That is a great number of dodge if you dont know the game. And the character is very fragile. No high hp, no way to buff his survival. Nothing. GHuess what, engage in a combat, 2 round later, his dodge was greatly decreased. And that was with the caracter with highest dodge from my party, you can imagine how ""open"" the other 3 were. Im not gonna to mention that 2 of these guys got more debuff as well. It sound terrible, right? But, hey, cant you buff your characters? Yes, you can. But here is the thing, EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BUFF SKILL YOU CANT MATCH THE ENEMY'S DEBUFF. Simply as that. I think the aoe debuff i suffered is -10 for stack. and that for low level characters (you cant bring high level characters to lower level dungeons).The highest buff for aoe dodge i can remember is 9. Exactly, 9, from a high level character. And a low level enemy can already outmatch him if im not wrong with the values. Nevertheless, even if the debuffs werent so severe, i dont like the idea of wasting one turn to buff a debuff. Simply because in a wasted turn is just the opportunity for an enemy to wreck you. And in this rng based rpg(dont listen to people that says that this game is very skill dependent. Even with top characters and trinkets, you could face some really bad situations) that can be very, very dangerous. But, hey, that is not over yet. Ohh, you may start thinking ""What, this is worse than it already is?""... And the answer is: yes. Here's the thing, now the devs implemented alongside with this atrocious debuff horde that you should be penalized if you are wasting time in combat. That includes buffing and healing your party. Exactly, it includes it. And it can be even worse than that. I was penalized because i applied a debuff to one guy, used heal in my party and let the two last guys attack the last enemy but it still survived. Oh, i was penalized because the guy survived. No, he didnt attack me or something. I got a stress attack (stress are almost a second health bar in this game. If you let it go too high... You might face serious, serious problems. In some extreme cases, your character dies). I gave up at that point. I was already winning the battle but it just felt i was being penalized even by playing right. What is the point of trying new strategies when the game focus now only on killing your enemies or else you're wasting turns? I dont feel like it anymore, dont want to try new strategies, specially considering ill know that in some fights ill have to ""waste time"" taking care of my group because i dont want to let them die. I have to write more about the trinkets as well, for newcomers, since they are one of the main rewards of the quests. A great number of them, include the most rare ones, ""ancestral trinkets"", are useless or unworthy. Really, the majority of top tier rarity trinkets are useless and easily overshadowed by other ""not so rare"" trinkets. The same rule aplies to the ""Very rare"" trinkets, which is one tier below. This happens because all of them have some drawbacks (- speed, -dodge) that make them less worth to use. And with the new patch, more of them became even more useless, which ends with the game being less rewarding. And, with all the bs the devs put now, there is really no reason for you to go to a boring quest suffer stress just to get an useless trinket. The another reason that made this game even less rewarding is that the gold you get with quests became more useless. You use them to prepare your party for quests and upgrade skills and equipments (you can only get new armor and weapon this way). And you could spend any ammount of gold to prepare your group. Now, the devs got a brilliant idea: let's make the itens you buy limited. Yay. It's not like you already have a very small inventory if you want to be 100% prepared for everything and you want the rewards... Well, you can use gold to buy trinkets as well, but the majority of them are useless. So... No reason anymore to have tons of gold. And even less reason to play this game. Well, that is why i gave up with this patch. Not willing to try finding better trinkets, that are so few. The majority of them you may not use EVER. And that list may have just got bigger since now you'll have to focus on debuff res. Dont feel like trying to make builds for some places. Hero that gets more attacks, hero that endures more damage because i know they will get debuffed some way in most of the times which will render the advantages useless and the time  i waste creating one completly unrewarded. And the freedom i had to try new party compositions, new strategies, finding sinergy with skills is vanished, since i have to focus more than anything at obliterating my enemies before they obliterate me. cant go with a party that is ""slow but safe"". Have to go with higher risk. But, like i said many times, no reward for me. I really enjoyed this game, i really did. even in times i felt it was unfair, i could overlook these moments and still have fun and be glad i overcame them. Now, since the best the devs have done to ""rise the challenge"" is simply make it even more luck based than ever, i gave up. They crossed the line of hard but rewarding  to luck and unrewarding. And i cant feel any longer the will to play it, praying that my group gets luck, that in one round i dont get debuff to oblivion and be left with useless characters for the rest of the fight. That isnt skill reliable. Whoever think it is is completly mistaken. Gonna miss the art, music, dialogue and lore from this game. But, unless the devs do something about this, i guess ill watch the rest of the game on youtube. Far more enjoyable for me and less stressful			"

Early Access Review
								Needs a lot of work before I would recommend it to anyone.  Just SOME things this 100-hour player (including 20 Level 5 heroes with level 5 everything - each class at one point or another, at least twice over) has to say:  - The dev's, like many before, do not understand that RNG cannot be let loose on it’s own - it needs to be there for some games, but it should never be left to it's own devises.  You need to make sure that nothing can Crit over and over and over and over, nor can you have misses happen over and over and over (90% chance to hit misses more than 50% in other games, IOW).  Dear RedHook, learn the same thing that GGG did with their evasion mechanic:  allowing pure rng made the mechanic broken.  They learned that they needed to enact a system where too many missed or too many hits could not happen - you can read about it on the Path of Exile wiki.  PLEASE NOTE:  I AM NOT HAVING AN ISSUE WITH RNG ITSELF, OR HOW MUCH IS LEFT TO RNG - I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY DEV WHO JUST ALLOWS THE RNG TO PURELY DO ALL THE WORK.  CONSTRAIN IT!!!  EX - Any programmer will tell you that if you write code to randomly spit back 0 or 1, and you just use RAND() (or whatever the function/method/class in your favorite language calls it) - you can run it hundreds or thousands of times and check the results, only to see, 1 come out sometimes 20 times in a row.  So your programmed a 50/50 chance, yet what happens?  You get one of the two values repeatedly.  You could have the same thing happen if you randomly generate 0-9 or whatever you want.  My point is, few find unbridled rng to be fun, and I imagine they might like some sales from hardcore lovers who like their hardcore fair, not full of lazy AI and mechanics.- AI needs work!  If the rng wasn't there to give it a kick, and they didn’t hide turn order (with a laughable excuse for why they, RedHook, won’t), it would be a total joke.  The only thing ""smart"" I have seen it do is target a specific player (randomly, it seems) and have most or all the mobs fight him.  Not a bad tactic, I guess, but it feels cheap, and then the AI changes target just when they were close to killing the first.  I have also seen the AI ""pull"" a teammate to the front (there are pull and push abilities), only to push them back the very next round (the AI has no memory of actions, except, I guess, to pick one target and stick to it, until RNG says to move elsewhere.  Lot's more crap like this to experience...  I have zero faith this will be fixed because most gamers are too stupid to notice bad AI, and even if they did, it's that last consideration (possibly below bug fixing, if that is even possible).- The economy is in need of adjustment.  Not really much to say there, I believe the dev thinks so too, just not sure when it will happen (unless you find a ""broken"" party setup that clears content easily) as far too often you feel stalled in progress due to there being lots of ways to spend money but no many ways to earn a nice amount, until late game... which reminds me...- Early game is unforgiving, mid game is brain dead easy, and then end game is ridiculous in how it swings between the two, but when it gets unforgiving (in the bad way), you will litterally want to uninstall the game and swear the devs off.- Trinkets continue to drop that are broken - that is - they provide bonuses for a class that cannot help them (increased chance to blight and bleed for a class that does not have any poison or bleed skills, e.g.).  They say they are aware and will fix it, but update after update, this is still broken.- WAY TOO REPETITIVE (this coming from some that loves randomized-content games).  No matter how many times you run a dungeon, level it up, kill one of the three levels of the boss for that dungeon (same boss, exactly, each time - YAWN!), it’s the same tile sets, and the randomization is rather lackluster in terms of how the rooms and connecting hallways are laid out.  Having the last two dungeons added will alleviate this a tiny amount, but it's just going to end up repetitive again.  Why can't dungeons get altering tile sets and layouts as they level up, or at least for the boss runs?  Why, if this game is supposed to be random in its layout, have I seen the same layout NUMEROUS times?  This is a game that is begging to be paid for hundreds of hours, but I guess the devs don't have the same vision (which is odd, games that give you so much value end up selling post-release content at a way higher rate, and the sequel does better too).  - Stess system is broken. Getting crits give, on average, way more stress than giving them takes away. The walking around stess is also a poor decision. Level 4 heroes with Level 5 skills, armor and weapons should not get random stress from walking around in a Level 3 quest in a level 3 dungeon. Stress received and taken away needs some consistencey. +10 to you +5 to party/close-by friends if received, -10 for your and -5 for party/close-by charecters if you give one. Or have the scaling, since it also seems based on how hard you crit, also be as consistent. While I understand that a character that has hit 100 stress might say thing that bother the others, most of what leaves the mouth of these toons isn't stressful for anyone already in a very stressfull situation (fighting to the death).- Hunger system is purely RNG'd and tiles are secretly labeld ""hunger"" - instead of travling distance and fighting rounds making this something consistant, you can sometimes never get ungry, or get it twicein the same hallway, even right after a fire rest. How does a party who just had a fire and had a feast become hungry two hallway tiles away?- This game can be a performance hog on some system - which is crazy since this game is no way taxing of GPU or CPU based on the graphics.  (the art is good, I just don’t see how this 2d game can made some systems crawl)  My monster gaming rig has zero issues, beyond weird bugs and random hangs, but my tablet with a beefy enough cpu/cpu to plat CiV, has major issues with this game. All in all, there is a great game to come of this prerelease version, I just hope the right changes are made -  at least they are allowing mods so hopefully we can change the things they don't.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, let me say that I respect the devs trying to make the game difficult. I enjoy challenging games...but this game is not challenging in a fun, engaging way, as with games like Super Meat Boy or Dark Souls or whatever else.This game constantly punishes the player in petty ways. Rampant early disease, the expense and limitations on treating disease and stress between levels, the restrictions of your inventory forcing you to leave behind treasure (especially if a character dies and you have to recover their trinkets), and the fact that you can't even use your higher level characters for lower level missions past a certain very early point (I can't send a level 3 character on level 1-2 missions?) are just a few of the things that suck all the fun out of this.Problems also tend to compound such that if you really screw up (especially early) I could see it being insanely difficult to recover. Couple that with the fact that even beyond the beginnings of the game, your high level characters with solid trinkets, armor and weapon upgrades, and upgraded skills can still get one-shot doing same-level dungeons...no thanks.I absolutely adore the style, art, theme, atmosphere, and narration of this game. I want so badly to like it, but Red Hook has really severely missed the distinction between ""fun"" difficult and ""frustrating"" difficult.			"

								There's a reason all this game's negative reviews are right at the top, including this one; The game is great, and I adore it, but the new updates have pretty much ruined it and remove any actual player agency in the aim of forcing one to play as the developers want you to play, and making the game pointless punishing in ways out of your control. It's not fun any more. If you somehow can get a hold of an older version, get that, but the new version is frankly unpleasant (If pretty) to play and kinda depressing remembering how good it used to be.			"

								Exetremely atmospheric and fun. It's balls hard but once you learn hpw to manage resources and make the best of a bad situation you will excel at this game. Expect to lose characters a lot a first and even much later. Each dungeon area has different status effects and troubles you will need to be prepared for which keeps the game fresh as it encourages you to build up multiple characters rather than have one mega party of the same 4-5 characters. Crossbowman, Occulist, and Grave robbers are weird classes that don't seem powerful, but they become extremely useful once you start to learn the flow of the game and how to approach troublesome encounters.

												Excellent turn based dungeon crawler with a punishing difficulty and a great oppressive atmosphere.- Stylish, detailed 2D art style.- H. P. Lovecraft inspired enemies ranging from skeleton warriors to tentacle faced monsters.- GODLIKE voice acting. The narrator sounds like a cross between that dude who does movie trailers and Optimus Prime from Tansformers.- This game is HARD like Ninja Gaiden on the NES hard.- The RNG hates you and you will be screwed over when you think you're doing really well but that's kind of the point.- It runs like a dream and overall feels really well made and polished.- Frequently updated with new content so there's a lot of content here for your money.- Not recommended for people who are easily frustrated.Love it.

								By far one of the best Early Access games I've played to date and worth every penny.  I can't stop thinking about playing more, recruiting more, watching more of my character descend into madness.  Having one of my first characters become a masochist and refuse healing while also a nymphomaniac that couldn't visit the brothel because of his deviant tastes is about as awesome as it gets.  Had him visit the sanitarium where they cured the deviant quirk so I could have him spend time at the brothel which cured his masochism only to have him gain syphilis in the end.  And that was just one character. Pure GOLD!			"

								Lets put it that way: the most recent patch turned the game from an awesome strategic experience into pointless, unrewarding overwhelming movie (since no matter what you do, math is now always against you... to the point where things just flow, regardless of your strategy or will to change outcomes)! Lets put it even simpler - i`ve never seen such a brilliant game destroyed so bad with a single patch! It literally gets worse with every patch, reviews are getting worse with every patch, this time it hit rock bottom. I really hope developers pay some attention. As for me, i really dint find it enjoyable anymore, not the least bit, i`m done with it for now.			"

								Before I bought this game i decided to read some reviews - some people didn't like this game, many more did, but all of them had one thing in common. They said that you should prepare for an unforgiving and painful gaming experience, where all of your heroes are in the constant danger of dying within the next few minutes. I will tell you the same, but that's not all to it!After 6 hours of playtime, watching a bunch of videos and beating the first boss I think I have understood the main concept of the game, though I haven't seen everything of course.It is true, it isn't that casual game for a short round now and then. You have to get into it and you have to understand, that every decision you take might be the last for one of your characters. You must be aware of the items to bring into the dungeon, the special abilities of your enemies and also your own. And then you have to calculate your risks and opportunities. Risk going for the next room? Or rather safe your precious characters and lose quite some gold for getting them good to go for the next run?As it is a rolegame with some features, which take a classical approach, a good part of the game also relies on RNGs. But in my opinion it really is a good part, and not way too much.So far I got just one character who died, but I know that it was my personal fault. RNGs just pointed my mistakes out. I knew it wouldn't be the best decision to take a healer into the dungeon, who already is almost completely stressed out. It was just my only healer who didn't need to recover from an exhausting dungeon run. So I wasn't surprised when she abandoned my tank in the midst of battle cause she just didn't want to heal him anymore... It still was a great experience.What I want to tell you by this is, that in my opinion it really is a skill-based game. Even though RNGs of course can mess you up, it happens mostly after some bad decisions from your side.If you want some succesful dungeon runs and maybe even a decent team of heroes, who survived for quite some time, you must get into this game. From my experience so far, that is totally worth it!It isn't called ""Darkest Dungeon"" for nothing, right?			"

												Darkest Dungeon is an atmospheric and enjoyable dungeon crawler that manages to mask its grindy mechanics with fun game play, attractive art and a perfectly toned narrator.  The premise is simple enough: You, the player, are summoned by a family member known only as The Ancestor to put right what he destroyed in the family estate and surrounding town through his pursuit of forbidden eldritch knowledge.  You're not going to delve into those dangerous places yourself, of course.  Instead you assemble teams of heroes who flow into town in a steady fashion and send them down into the tunnels to return with gold and materials to rebuild the town and strengthen your warriors.  In time, you will have a team powerful enough to dare go beneath the accursed estate itself.Game play is primarily controlling your team as they go about their missions.  Controls are very simple -- movement & combat are 2D and turn-based. Each hero or monster gets a move each turn, the order determined by their Speed stat and you'll choose from four different moves you prepared for the occasion.  Each move can only be performed from select positions in the party and can only hit select positions in the enemy's ranks and the entire effect has an underlying complexity that you learn to appreciate as you fight harder battles: have your occultist summon a monstrous tentacle to pull an archer up front where your crusader can chop him, but be sure your crusader has skills usable from the rear or else he'll be rendered impotent by a push himself.  Your fighters will not only shed blood in combat; they will also become stressed by events and, although it seems minor in comparison to losing 15 hit points, enough stress will cause your hero to act irrationally.  Worse yet, stress remains even after existing the dungeon and you will have to expend gold to place them in the town's abbey or tavern to relax once more.  Upon returning to town, you can put your plundered materials to use in rebuilding the town.  This will make stress recovery cheaper, allow more heroes to arrive on the coach, repair the blacksmith for armor upgrades, etc.  Heroes can unlock new skills as the guild house is repaired but all the available skills can be unlocked early on and upgrades are just small stat increases: extra damage or accuracy.  If there's a criticism here, it's that there's little true feeling of advancement and no moments where you'll learn a great new skill or stunning new weapon.Within a few dungeons, you'll be faced with another game aspect: permadeath.  Do not get too attached to your heroes as they will drop off over time, victims to skeletons or pig-men or claw-armed cultists.  As they perish, you will recruit new heroes from the stagecoach -- thankfully, new heroes come fully armed for their level.  It's hard not to get attached and losing a favored hero with nice quirks (minor +/- traits you'll acquire) hurts, at some point resource management wins the day.  Likewise, a broken and stressed hero may be sent away to open a roster slot for a more capable explorer.On paper, Darkest Dungeon shouldn't have been a game I'd spend much time with; I'm no fan of long grinds or permadeath.  But its presentation and the fun of tinkering with hero & skill combinations kept me interested throughout.			"

								Do you remember that feeling of desperation and loss of hope the first time you set out to conquer every demon and threat and Dark Souls? Well you found a home here. With every step and corner you turn, death waits for your party and looms over them like a cloud of sickness. -Graphics: This game is 2D, but it's 2D done right, the art style is amazing and you feel the weight behind every swing of the sword and throwing of a bomb to take out your foes. The enemies come to life and spew their disease upon you, stab you deep and make your blood paint the ground, and stun you with their screeches of terror. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this. 9/10-Sound: Narration and effects help paint a wonderful picture as you dive into each hole and hope to come out on the other side victorious. The slashes, splashes, clinging and banging of swords against armor and skin are very nice and doesn't feel like some cheap call in for effects. The music for your journey is sometimes overdramatic but it's not supposed to be a joyful trip. Overall, very nice and whenever you hear that tune chime in at the end of a hard fought battle, it's extremely worth it. 8.8/10-Gameplay: The very meat and potatoes of every game and I'm glad to say this shines and keeps me coming back for more. With every journey you take, you will bring back a number of materials and gold to help soothe your warriors, strengthen your stronghold, and tune your party up to face what dangers lie with the next trip. The game centers around this hub and you go forth selecting what members to take, what supplies to carry, and what quest to take on and hopefully succeed. Party members range from brutish fighters to sly and trick filled jesters to help lay waste to the evils that lie underground. The last dungeon is not available to play yet but still there is already 70+ hours of gameplay for you to tackle while you wait in the meantime and prepare your party to take it on. Players experience stress with every negative event they encounter, they will get abusive, they will become masochists and will refuse healing. Managing their effects and taking care of what you need to concerning their minds is key if you want to win.  I've rage quit a few times and lost some very dear veterans but their monuments and achievements still remain with me as I bring some fresh new faces with me to avenge them in the depths. Randomly assembled rooms and dungeons are present and allow for an excellent amount of replayability even if the objectives and boss enemies are the same. Overall this game also shines in the gameplay department and delivers. 10/10-Controls: Very smooth and responsive, the controls haven't presented any frustrations or been the source of any of my failures and that makes me very happy. While there is potential for some tweaks and additions, the controls get the job done and just leave room to add on to and not patch to fix right away and leave it unplayable. Overall, great controls. 9/10-Replayablity: As mentioned previously with the random assembling and roguelike elements, this game allows for multiple revisits even after completing the main game whenever we can. Overall, a decent amount of replayability. 8.8/10Final words: This game is Early Access first and foremost, but just know that this is an extremely polished and fine example of EA done right. You're not taking a chance at being severely disappointed by purchasing this with all the other information you have here. Will you get your 19.99 worth out of this game? Absolutely, this game can only go up from here and is a pleasure to play even if it isn't complete yet. Total rating: 9.1/10			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of my favorite games in my personal top 5 in fact, but i wouldent be able to tell you why so instead i'll list imo the pros and cons of the game.TL:DR treat your first game as a test run to find out what works for you. the games graphics and narration are excellent as is the combat and stress system. however resource manegment and stress system are easily mitigated/ignored late game. due to this being an early access review that is all subject to change.The pros.The art style - i love the art style the enemies and charecters look really good.The narrator - whoever did the voice work imo deserves an award he delivers his lines very well, adds emotonial depth and its absance would have seriously detracted from the game.Combat - during combat postioning is critical certain heroes are only effective in certain postions a leper for example is next to useless in the back spot you might ask why is he in the back spot then? because that damn cultist pushed him there (or that gaint confused your whole squad) if things are going really badly then you can run and the deaths door mechanic means even that hero at 0 health has a chance to finsh the fight and get homeThe town - this will be a pro and a con and you'll see why in the cons section. the town is your base. Here you will upgrade buildings that will allow you to upgrade heroes that will make higher level dungeouns easier, relieve stress and remove negitive quirks. gathering the resources to upgrade your town isent easy and will take some time.the stress system - in most games your heroes look upon the horrers they face and while their diolauge may reflect shock and terror this never effects game play. Here it does, your heroes are not unstopple demi-gods of war who eat 12 story tall deamons for breakfest (at least not at first). here they will panic, devlop quirks that effect them negitavly, positivly or both they can also become virtuous where instead of decending into maddness they find the strength to carry on. with the recent update if the stress bar fills twice then the hero dies from a heart attack, this would be a con imo but due to the way in which stress can be mitigated (and almost ignored later on) i like it as it does make your stress bar somthing to watch.Consthe town - when the town is fully upgraded then thats it, no more resource mangment in fact you'll be tossing resources out of your bag to make way for other things such as gold (which by that point wont be a problem either)your first game (for lack of a better word) - so what does that mean? it means that i suggest you treat your first game as a complete test run, even with the in-game tutoriols and the community on steam (who are very helpful and welcoming for the most part) the game runs off of rng and due to that the game can screw you particualry when you dont know whats what. now i do not think that the rng in this game is all that bad but with the steam community having a few threads on this i feel its worth mentioning. This is not a pick up and play game to an extent it has a learning curve but its not going to be gentle with you while your learning it there is no easy mode and your heroes are going to die untill you get your head around the combat system how heroes work together, which heroes work together and which heroes work for you and what i mean by that is i hate the occultist i cant make him work for me but there are those on the steam fourms who swear by him. when you have that figured out though the game becomes much easier and bearable which is why i suggest that for your first game just use it to learn the game and find out what works and then take it serioulsy for your second attempt.bosses - now i dont mean that the bosses are bad the bosses are very well designed each reqiureing diffreant strats and group comps to beat, so whats the issue? there is absolutly no in-game way of knowing what the strat is untill most likely you've already lost a squad or a hero to it (before you run away). now with hero recuirtment being free and heroes expendable that issue is mitigated but its still worth mentioningStress - stress in the late game almost isent a factor high level heroes have a high ammount of stress resist, i'm in two minds about this on one hand it shows that your heroes have progressed that they have gotten used to the horrers they fight and i like that on the other it makes the mechanic almost a non factor late game which isent a good thing.The questionthis game is in early access as you can see and with games like the stomping lands simply dissapearing without being completed or the game being in early access for years with little to no progress the question is will this game be finished? In my opinion at the time of this review being made 100% yes. The devs have just released a big content patch and in fact released two to three bug fix and balencing patchs on the day of the content release (and several more since) i remeber when i first bought the game months ago that a thread actully popped up on the steam fourm asking them to slow down the ammount of patchs being released (no serioulsy). The devs area passonaite group and i believe they intend to see this thing to the end in fact iirc they plan to release the full game later this year.DiscalaimerEverything said here is subject to change there are still two dungouns to be released the cove and the darkest dungoun (the latter of which the devs promise will be really hard and may fix stress being a non issue) its possible that this review will be of no use a couple of months down the line. But that is the nature of early access.			"

												A flawed but fun dungeon crawler with a fantastic aesthetic theme and an emphasis on tactical combat and roster management.Darkest Dungeon is a very streamlined gameplay experience. The exploration segments have a fairly small number of decision points. Characters have a limited number of moves to select from in combat, and character building is limited to a small number of skill and item choices. On the one hand, the game lacks somewhat for depth as a result of this aggressive minimalism. On the other hand, it's freed of a lot of pointless micromanagement that plagues more detailed games. The concept is that you have a smaller number of more meaningful decisions to make, although I can't say the execution is without its flaws--too many decisions are plagued by trap options, leaving the player with fewer real choices than they should have. It's still fun, but has room to improve.Generally, though, the tactical elements are pretty decent. There is a large element of randomness, but the game does a good job of providing tools to mitigate risks. Careful and thoughtful play is consistently rewarded, but there is a strong risk/reward element to the gameplay, so if you play fast and loose you can still accomplish amazing things if you're lucky--or die horribly if you're not. The highlight of the game is definitely the aesthetics. The art direction is awesome, the voice work is superb, and the story (while sparse) is surprisingly good. The tactile feel of combat is extremely enjoyable. The game's themes and motifs are woven throughout the art, story, and gameplay in a really satisfying and cohesive way. The ending, while somewhat predictable, is executed brilliantly. Most dungeon crawlers have the bare minimum of story necessary to explain why the player is off to kill monsters and collect loot, so getting an interesting narrative out of the ending sequence was a pleasant surprise. It's a very well done piece of horror.That does bring us to the elephant in the room: the grind. Dungeon crawlers generally tend to be largely about grinding when you get down to it, and Darkest Dungeon is not really an exception. It's got 14 classes to play with and heavily encourages (eventually outright forces) you to use more than 4 characters, so there's enough diversity in the roster to keep gameplay somewhat fresh and interesting. And the difficulty curve is well done, with enemies picking up new tricks to challenge you throughout the game. Even so, there are points where the game ends up dragging. A full campaign is likely to take 30-40+ hours, which is a huge time commitment for a relatively simple game. The game could really have been shaved down by 5 or 10 hours without really losing anything. In general, I would recommend Darkest Dungeon if......you want to play a streamlined version of old school dungeon crawlers with a major roster management component....you'd like to see a game pull off a gritty gothic horror theme and turn classic RPG archetypes on their head....you enjoy tactical combat optimization that doesn't get bogged down in minutiae.On the other hand, you may consider staying away if......you get very attached to your characters in RPGs and hate when bad things happen to them....you enjoy micromanagement and having control over a lot of fine details....you're a fan of traditional heroic fantasy narratives and love seeing the good guys win.

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon is, essentially, a dungeon crawler, but, thanks to the visual style, narration and well-crafted game mechanics, it transcends the bounds of genre and expectations.It should be noted, that, regardless of EA stage, the game is not only playable, but reliably enjoyable. Except for the lack of story ending and access to some of the dungeons, it could totally pass for the feature-complete product. It's nice to know, though, that developers are still going to add even more content - if they accomplish that goal, the finalized game well may reach such remarkable quality level, that it will set a new reference standard among indie game projects.Good things Game mechanics Developers managed to find the fragile balance, making game mechanics deep, but inuitive and easy to grasp at the same time. You won't be completely lost from the very start, but there is a bit of intriguing sophistication to make sense of later. The ""Stress"" system is an especially good addition to the gameplay. Interface The bane of number-crunching, turn-based games, the interface is well-managed here. Well-proporsioned and unobtrusive elements blend into gameplay process fast and easily.  Difficulty and replayabilityIn spite of the waringins about ""making the best of bad situation"", the game is not too hard for a more casual player. Hardcore dungeon explorers may find it a bit lacking for their taste. But the balance is good, and the game finds amusing ways of bringing even the experienced player down to earth sometimes. In my second playthrough, just as soon as I started to think that I'm dealing with things too well, the tide of events made a sudden turn and I found myself escaping the dungeon with only half of the team, badly beaten. And, to my astonishment, it feeled just as a natural matter of hard luck, not a difficulty-balancing smite from the game engine! StyleDespite everything mentioned above, the game could still come out relatively mediocre, if not for the visual, sound and narrative style.The disembodied voice of narrator gently but firmly guides you through the early stages and offers timely comments later, which greatly enriches the atomshpere. Unvoiced phrases of your heroes really make the story shine, though. You'll have a lot of fun watching them express their opinions and emotions while in action. Not to mention the heroes bickering, which is hilarious, but disasterous for their combat effectiveness Visual style is in carefully crafted superposition between self-irony caricature, Lovecraft-ish illustration and all-too-serious dark fantasy. Play the game for a little while, and be engulfed in its atmosphere.Sound only adds to the effect. The soundtrack links to the game events well, but it doesn't leap to the foreground.Things to wish for Minor loading screen glitch fixSometimes the level loading screen seems to be stuck - and if you try to nudge things along with a mouse click or a keystroke, the game may crash. I've only encountered the glitch a couple of times. More contentThe more, the better. More character phrases, more dungeons, more monsters, more bosses with peculiar stratagies!All in all, the game is not only good already, but has a lot of potential to become better! A nice example of a well-made Early Access project, for a change.Absolutely recommended.			"

								A beautifuly constructed addiction.  Brutally difficult, yet you barely notice most of the night has gone.  This is a ""one more turn"" game.  Every aspect seems to have been polished and cinched neatly, from the gorgeous art design, the crunchy sound effects which have that 90's arcade satisfaction when ringing in your newly aquired loots, down to the Bastionesque narrator urging you forward while heralding your doom.Game just needs some balance tuning and any other content is gravy.

												Darkest Dungeon is a 2d turn-based dungeon crawler, created by Red Hook Studios.Upon starting the game you are greeted with the news that a dear estranged relative of yours has been up to some pretty bad stuff and essentially leaves you to clean up his mess. The mess in question being the multitude of ghouls, horrors and other assorted ne’er-do-wells that now inhabit the family manor and the hamlet that surrounds it. This is the premise of Darkest Dungeon and it works as well as any other to start our adventure.The bulk of the game revolves around leading a group of four characters through an assortment of randomly generated dungeons and doing battle with the creatures that inhabit them. Characters traverse the dungeons in single file, their position in the line dictating which abilities are able to be used and the enemies on which they are able to use them. For instance some characters will do better on the front line while others will thrive at the back of the group. Setting up your group is key to a successful endeavour. This is where the games hub comes into play.The Hamlet is a small group of shops and buildings that acts as the games main hub. From here you are able to make use of a wide variety of amenities as you decide which heroes to send out on their next adventure and with what supplies to pack. New heroes are able to be recruited from the stage coach, armour and weapons upgraded at the blacksmith, diseases and quirks cured at the sanatorium as well as many other services being available for the right price. This includes spending money to reduce the effect of one of the games main mechanics - Stress.Stress is an in-game measurement of a particular hero's mental state, a counter that goes from 0 to 200. If the hero's stress reaches 100 they will gain an affliction or have a chance to become virtuous. While a virtuous hero will only benefit your team with buffs and stress reduction. An afflicted hero has the complete opposite effect, increasing the stress of those around them and sometimes actively putting themselves in danger or ignoring your command completely. If your stress becomes too high, your hero is at risk of a heart attack which may kill them outright. This may be compounded by the games quirk system, where in certain situations a hero will develop a positive or negative quirk that will affect how they act, or how you must treat them. These can range from increased stress gain to a compulsive need to examine every item you come across and many more. When it comes to presentation, Darkest Dungeon gets full points. The gothic 2d art style oozes personality without being overly busy or confusing and a good use of depth of field stops the game from feeling flat. The interface is incredibly well designed and remains simple, despite the amount of information housed within. There are a few changes I would make to make viewing information a little easier but overall the interface does what it sets out to do very well.  The graphic style of Darkest Dungeon conveys the mood of the game perfectly and only strengthens its theme, ESPECIALY when paired with the terrific audio design and the phenomenal voice acting of the narrator.The Audio design in this game is on another level when stacked up against its peers. as the light fades so too does the music’s simple nature, giving way to an erratic tune that becomes more maddening the more you venture forth, the weighty sounds of attacks as your group goes toe to toe with all manner of horrors, and of course the absolutely shiver inducing tones of the loquacious narrator as he pontificates about his ""Venerable house"" and the ""arcades of antiquity"".All of these elements come together to make Darkest Dungeon and absolutely unforgettable experience. the feeling of felling an enemy with a perfect strategy leaves you in awe of yourself as a brilliant tactician while other times becoming absolutely downtrodden as you lose the hero you've been cultivating for so very long. Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of what you are given and sometimes when life gives you lemons, well I hope you like lemons.Overall my Experience with Darkest Dungeon has been incredibly satisfying, having put 40 hours into the game I can see that I am in fact not even close to finishing, nor do I feel the fatigue that I usually would after playing most any other game for such a long period of time. When I first saw it in early access I was itching to play it, but decided to hold off and wait until the developers were confident enough to say that it was a finished product, and I am so glad that I did.If you are a fan of X-Com, or don’t mind a bit of punishment to get true satisfaction out of your gaming experience then I don't have any problem telling you thatDarkest Dungeon is a MUST PLAY.If you enjoyed this review consider leaving a thumbs up, or if you have some constructive feedback to leave, feel free to comment.

												Darkest Dungeon is a game that shows you how dangerous and foolhardy it is to grab a torch and go down into dark depths to face the beings who reside there.And I love it, every step I take.Darkest Dungeon is a challenging dungeon crawler where your characters must combat stress (read: Sanity) as well as the beasties that lie in the darkness as they search for fame, fortune and glory.  It really takes heavy cues from H.P. Lovecraft on how man was not meant to see what lies just beyond the torchlight.It uses a turn based system and RPG elements as well as some cues taken from roguelike games, such as permadeath.  The game rewards quick thinking in a bad situation and preparation and priorities can truly determine weather your party comes out from the caves alive, or are ripped to shreds by nameless horrors.The Art style is phenomenal and you'd be hard pressed to find a indie game with such evocative soundtracks and voiceover.  The narrator makes you feel the success of a critical hit and heartache of a fatal blow.  You grow attached to your party members just to see them die from a poor decision.  Some people may cry that the computer can pull these amazing succession of criticals leaving your characters ripe for slaughter next turn, but I've found that if you prepped correctly, prioritized your healing, and use status effects (like bleed and blight) to your advantage, you'll make it by the skin of you teeth and escape the dungeon.In this game, you gotta know when to call it quits and leave the dungeon with what loot you can carry.  It's ok to run and come back another day with a stronger party and better supplies then to lose a character you've upgraded significantly.  And I love that about this game.  In H.P. Lovecraft's stories, it is rarely a happy ending and this game holds to those themes tightly.In the end, I would recommend this game, but only to those that have the patience and understanding of the mindset you have to have when facing the terrors of the abyss.  If you go in foolhardy, you'll end up simply making more loot for the party that comes in after, as they pillage the nameless corpse of another failed adventurer.			"

								A game built around challenging content must be tempered with adequate mechanics to allow the player to overcome adversity but not easily hand the victory over. Red Hook seems to have forgotten this basic concept.

								this is a p. good game, enough so that i wrote a big dumb novella about itit's very punishing and some of its mechanics are circumstantially unfair, but that's what a roguelike is. a lot of recent games have diluted the meaning of roguelike to ""a game with a bunch of random elements and you kill monsters"" and have forgotten that you're going to die a lot and that it's not always going to be fair when you dothis game takes the notion of a viciously cruel game and makes it crueler through its setting and its effect on the characters - it's self-aware in concept without having to be self-referential or even very subversive, which is an impressive thing to have done			"

								Be careful.WATCH SOME LET'S PLAYS BEFORE YOU BUY.It's a very luck based game.  Things can turn on a dime and keyboards will be thrown out windows if you don't control yourself.An edit for some more detail as of Feb 15- If you have patience, you should maybe wait to play this. It's an amazing game, but very grindy, and you might burn out on it. And it's not finished.Although it's technically roguelike, it's very campaign like, so you won't just be doing a run through like with dreadmor, for example.The game is really hard at the start, but, in my opinion, becomes a ROFLSTOMP later on.'Hard to learn, easy to master' is a term I have seen bandied about, and I would agree with that.

												What can I add to some of the great reviews available on this game? Well, nothing really but the message to all potential buyers that here is one of those games that really satisfies in every aspect of gaming. I found the difficulty a breaking point at first but once I  kept at it and learned more and more about the games features (and there are many!!) it became more and more addictive. Lead a party of different warriors into the locations and you will have to deal with all their flawed character traits (they all have some traits to discover that can seriously impact their performance) and rising fear (up till heartattack level) plus fight enemies in turnbased combat.  Luckily you have numerous ways to keep those things in check if prepared well and used well. Potions, bandages, spells and weapon upgades will all be available once you level up and when you're back in town there's all those buildings where you can restore the health, weapons and fear or morale issues. (visit a tavern, gamble away or sneak to a brothel, find blessings and conquer fear in the monastery) This is all just the tip of the iceberg.  The whole game is drenched in atmosphere, the art work is sublime and dark, there are no bugs that I have found and the music is perfectly suited for some dangerous adventuring to find out the curse of the manor. Like I said it takes some time to get to know all the possibilities but that only feels more satisfying once you master those. This is a game that every lover of turnbased RPG's should have... no doubt about it!!			"

												I want to start by saying I had already played this game in the past, before there were even secondary bosses or a Cove area, and I did so for very, very long. it was an intensely fun and rewarding experience, and it absolutely made me think it would be money well spent to acquire it for myself when it was finished. Hell, I'd have payed twice its price tag, to get a completed game which was that enjoyable.I received it as a gift from a friend recently and was positively overjoyed, I could not wait to come back and see all that was added in this past half year. I created a new save file, started playing... and despaired. But I decided to keep playing, and to not stop playing until I had seen all the changes and could properly grasp what the game presently had to offer.So it is now, after over 30 hours of gameplay time, that I want to write this review and say that I do NOT, in any way or form, recommend this game as it currently is. It is no longer the game I played back then. It has changed into something that is barely recognizable; it -is- technically the same game, but it most definitely does not feel the same. And it comes nowhere near what it once was in terms of enjoyment.I've read many bits and pieces of (sometimes conflicting) information as to why this happened, namely:-A highly-vocal group of ""fans"" steering this game into its sad current state-Developers which have a very particular vision for this game, and scour strategy guides and topics for things to nerf in order to take away any and all slight advantages a player could affordSo before I get into any details, I want to make this clear: I am not familiar to any such forum drama, I do not know who holds the blame, and I have no idea whatsoever as to why the game changed into what it is today. The one thing I know for certain is: it did change. Badly.This game is now unquestionably an anti-fun game. By ""anti-fun"" I don't mean overly hard, I don't mean overly grindy, I don't mean overly complex. I mean it is a game that seems carefully tailored to remove all sense of fun from playing it. Practically all enjoyment is gone, all progression feels meaningless for the most part, all achievements help you in basically no way whatsoever.Chief among the worst offenders are two mechanics: corpses and heart attacks. And yes, I know you can turn corpses off, but then we are not playing the game ""the way it's meant to be played"", we are not experiencing all it has to offer. And so, to elaborate: Heart attacks - having a hero reach the 100 stress threshold was already a terrible thing to happen before, in a GOOD way. It was a challenge to be overcome, it was an entertaining encumbrance. That lone hero would bring the entire party down the path of stress soon enough, and you'd usually end up with a group of raving lunatics cutting themselves, refusing heals, shuffling about, acting on their own... and a lone hero who passed the Virtue check going strong and carrying the expedition. It was a predicament, it was not a situation you wanted to be in at all, but it was FUN.This is not the case anymore. Stress accumulation is now roughly 2-3x higher than it once was, everything stresses out our heroes greatly and continuously. And it doesn't stop at 100 with a potentially compromising situation which would force you to seriously consider withdrawal, while still having a chance to go forth in case other conditions were favorable. No, now it NEVER stops, and it is guaranteed to erase hours of game time and tens of thousands of gold that you spent treating, training, and equipping the heroes that WILL inevitably die from it at some point. You used to be able to bring a mildly-stressed hero on an expedition; doing so now is signing a death sentence for that hero and possibly the others as well, and a virtual guarantee that the expedition will failI will not even touch with a 10-foot pole how unrealistic it is for everyone to be getting heart attacks left and right, and will simply leave it at: This is not fun. This is not acceptable, even. It is not enjoyable to have to constantly be worried because stress, something you can't effectively heal from, is an ever-present threat of almost instant death, which, thanks to this game's unforgiving RNG and mechanics, is VERY usually the same as instant death. Heart attacks could maybe, -maybe- be acceptable if they happened at 300 stress. And this is still a VERY big maybe. But as it is, it is undeniably an anti-fun mechanic that serves only to aggravate players for things we are unable to control.-------------------Corpses - This is by far the worst offender of the two, and that's without even touching how stupidly unrealistic it is for a lone, butchered body to be effectively keeping an enemy out of our reach. This mechanic kills the utility of certain classes, artificially inflates the usefulness of certain skills which, for the most part, are otherwise generally useless, and perhaps most importantly it can cause catastrophic situations for essentially no logical reason. Enemies are -never- inconvenienced by corpses unless we use a move skill on them, and even then, most enemies will quickly return to their preferred position since every other skill of theirs causes them to move in their preferred direction. It is simply and legitimately a mechanic meant to drain the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment from the game, causing us to need more turns to take out a priority target that's out of reach, thus taking more damage and stress for, again, -no reason whatsoever-.But I want you to fully appreciate the actual stupidity of this mechanic. Corpses appear when the enemy is killed with regular damage that isn't a critical hit, which is like 90% of all killing blows, give or take. If the enemy is killed by a critical hit, bleed damage, or blight damage, there won't be a corpse. BUT:-If the enemy is bleeding/blighted, and is killed with a regular attack, there will still be a corpse!... that is bleeding/blighted. For some eldritch reason, if the enemy doesn't have those last 2 HP taken by bleed or blight damage, it suddenly turns into a corpse that CAN take a load more bleed and blight damage. Absolutely fantastic.-If the enemy is killed by a critical hit that does 2 damage, there won't be a corpse. If the enemy is killed by a regular attack that does 30 damage, there will be a full HP corpse. Being labelled a critical hit apparently means more than what makes critical hits important, which is their damage.Both of the above points happen for a very simple reason: artificial difficulty. Forcing you to not attack an enemy and kill him instantly this turn, and instead have him bleed out over 2 turns so that you won't be wasting a turn dealing with its corpse. Taking the ability to avoid corpses away from your hands and into the RNG's by making it so the blow has to be a critical hit, and not just a powerful hit. Because attacking bleeding/blighted enemies, or hitting near-death enemies with powerful skills, so that they wouldn't leave corpses behind? Those would be things the player could control, and we wouldn't want that, now would we?In order to make corpses borderline bearable, at -least- the following changes would be needed:-Any enemy that dies while bleeding/blighted would leave no corpse-Any damage beyond what is needed to kill the enemy would be subtracted from the corpse's HP. For example, if you deal a 5 damage blow to an enemy with 2 HP, the corpse would lose 3 HP right as it spawnedAnd again, this is so corpses would be more bearable. It is no substitute for the fact that, much like heart attacks, they shouldn't exist at -all-.This is a game I loved and I'm actually really sad that this is the state it is currently in. But I cannot, at all, recommend this game. Regardless, I will update this review once the game is completedUPDATE: Game is completed, nothing really changed.			"

												This is a tough one. But to sum it up I just can't recommend the game. There are some bright spots. First and foremost the atmosphere is great. The narration is just so on point. And it really gets you going. Then the game starts and its just draws you right in. The game goes great. The rougelike keeps its interesting with permadeath and the random stat changes can keep the characters interesting. The art is fantastic. The areas seem interesting and deep. Then the turn, evetually though the game switches. It really stops being fun it becomes a grind with a capital G. Now I actaully enjoy the grind mostly. Played RPGs all my life and there can be something nice about grinding. However, this game swtiches so hard from the fun of exploring and a very real adventuring sense to this MASSIVE grind that it is jarring and incredibly unfun. The game turns into work there is no progression you feel from anything for a long, long, LONG time. Due to the atrociousness of the grind the other flaws really start to show. The RNG becomes a bit unbearable. RNG can be really fun and leave a sense of the unexpected in the air. However, when its combined with the Mt. Everest of a grind it becomes this ulgy mechanic that can just ruin any gameplay. For instance, you are forced to run the same area for the millionth time just to grind out some charcters when RNG strikes and you lose someone important. This sucks so much, not that permadeath is bad or that RNG + permadeath can't offer really fun games, but because that it wasn't due to ANYTHING you decided. YOU didn't take a risk, YOU didn't overextend, YOU didn't do anything. The game forced you into a boring task and then punished you for it anyways. Then you realize the maps are the same, the monsters are the same, everything is the same. The rougelike randomness and vareity of monsters in each area that started off very cool has become so very boring. Simply becuase you spend a lifetime in each area trying to grind things out. And switching back and forth does little to break this up due to the sheer number of times you have played a map there. It is sad it is an amazing game off the bat. You will love it right away, then it will slowly make you hate it, dread turing it on. It becomes a job you can't stand. The polar oppostie of Civ's ""One more turn"" instead being ""Ugh, do I have to"".			"

												Early access? What early access? This game is amazing as it is... oh, man, I can't even begin to imagine what will it look like when finished!I bought the game during the summer sale 2 days ago and I easily clocked in close to 17 hours already, and that is already telling, don't you think? But let's not get ahead of myself. As usual, I will take a look at the good and the bad. This review is as of build 9007, with the man at arms and the arbalest included, along with the new bosses.The Good:1. Ironman - this game is for true rogue-like genre fans, the ones that do not whine and complain in the face of adversity and overwhelming odds, but for ones who seek options and avenues of advancement to combat this adversity.2. Rogue-like at its best - you never know what the game will offer you. You need to cope with the resources at your disposal. For example, you may be forced into weeks and weeks of hardships simply because the game won't pity you enough to give you another Vestal or Occultist character, but instead shower you with tanks and pitiful healers.3. Procedurally generated dungeons - while you could try to assume and predict, based on the area you chose to explore, layouts they are still largely random, so you need to plan ahead big time. Fight or flee has never been a bigger wrench of a choice before.Or that What if... queston on the back of your mind...4. Memorable stories - the game creates stories on its own, for example, how you got wiped twice, forced into meager runs but managed to get back on your feet and actually complete all the objectives, or, say, how you were forced into a 4 highwayman run cause you had nothing else to use, or, how your cleric went crazy and abusive and started britching(:P) about anything others do, which tunred into an avalanche of abusive stressed out individuals who care not about each other? Those things are in the game. This is one of the few games that makes you go to the forums or post a status about what happened just to vent off or share with your friends.5. Various missions - every time you complete a mission you get a different set of consequential encounters for you to choose, all of them with various objectives and varying rewards.6. Bosses - there are a number of bosses in the game, each one with different mechanics, meaning you need to bleed, boil and hurt till you learn what the boss does best and how to best combat him/her... it.7. Your very own mini-village for you to develop as you see fit. Will you neglect armor and weapons for the sake of more skills and buffs during camping? Will you choose to be skilled and better equipped and protected, but suffer everything the RNGesus throws at you cause you didnt upgrade the amount of new heroes who want to join you and the means of reducing stress through the abbey or the tavern? All up to you, and my, it is a big deal to select a good path of advancement. This alone creates memorable stories to post and share.8. Varying areas each with its own enemies, expectations, and bosses.9. The Light system, which alone makes for very interesting gameplay. More stress, but more loot, a normal run, or a safer run with less loot but little stress and lots of happy characters? Up to you!10. Wonderful level progression system with a set number of skills per character and quirks you gain for completing dungeons or various other conditions.11. Being dark and moody, making you crigne when something happens - it only enhances the experience.12. Value for the money - I like judging my game hours like 1 for 2, or 1 for 3 for bigger games. So, for every 1 euro I pay I expect 2 to 3 hours of gameplay. I can tell you, I could do 10 times the price I paid for this game.13. I have come back to the game since the review and I was absolutely baffled by the amount of content the devs actually dumped in. Well done, people. Let's go Darkest Dungeoning again!The Bad:1. Early access - yeah, many features are still missing, even if the game is great as it is.2. Ironman - the game is extremely punishing, sometimes to the point of frustration. Some enemies can crit you out and kill a character while you're gaping at the screen with a ""holy crap"" ready to roll out of your mouth.3. You get to work with what you're given - you may find yourself sorely lacking in resources, passable heroes, meager parties, and worse.4. Cheesing out - the game can be cheesed out to make more money and save yourself from a dire situation, or to win a mission somehow.5. There is a stupid caretaker that may occupy the only freaking place where your most valuable character has to go to relieve stress.6. Dungeon layouts may completely foil your plans.7. Wipes and bad stuations - yeah, it can happen, especially while you still dont know what you're doing and what each thing does.8. Character balance - characters are not perfectly balanced as of yet. Then again, this game being a rogue-like,  dont mind having an underdog in my party just because I dont have anything else to use.Conclusion:BUY THIS GAME - simple as that. You will spend lots of gameplay hours on it in its early access - I would say 30+ to complete all the caretaker's goals, and lots more when the game gets fully released. That being said, while I am a tad generous with the play time for a single run, I have 2 separate play-throughs (as I wanted to see the game from 2 different standpoints) and I can easily say that those play-throughs are as different as the sun and the moon. This is downright amazing, and I sure as hell hope they will continue adding content this way. There are still 2 more areas to unlock in the future, and they are surely going to be amazing.			"

												It's a neat concept.. but in the end it was getting too frustrating and grindy to finish.  If you like challenge a better thing to do would be pick up some weights and start working out.  Then for the 'final level' go try to benchpress your car.  Doesn't work?  Go do some more weights.  Then try to benchpress a car.  Eventually you'll realise that no matter how good you do at lifting weights you still suck at lifting cars.That's essentially what playing this feels like.  You can get good at every type of dungeon or boss, but when you try the darkest dungeon missions a little bit of bad luck and you're going to lose your best guys.  I'm sorry I spent so much time on this game just to be reminded how bad I hate losing at things.  I'm going to go try to lift my car again now.  bye.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this during Winter 15 sale.  I had been watching the reviews and the price.  I can't speak to the state of the game before I got it, but of the dozen or so games I bought I am hooked on this one first.Although I like D&D type games, I tend not to like the ones that make you feel like you could do it all on a tabletop.  Which this kinda does, but I like it anyway.   Alot.  The production values are good, from small things like being able to use items in inventory as you discard them (it's a small thing, but surprised they thought of it) to voice narration and theme.  Does not feel like a tabletop.  A couple days after I bought it, they released a patch to make the game optionally easier.  I am already used to the current mechanics and they don't feel unbalanced yet, there is a learning curve is all.  It's alot of fun.			"

								Before you play this game, ask yourself just how willing are you to get mad. Yes mad, I mean just absolutely mad. Are you willing to watch a low level mob crit everyone on your crew with an AOE attack?Willing to watch as a goblet full of wine makes your soldiers go insane?Grit your teeth because not a single one of your heroes can hit those damn dogs.I want you to stand up and say, ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore.""And then sit back down and watch as your Vestal refuses to heal your soldier at deaths door and have him die immediately. Do not play this game unless you are ready to get mad as hell. This game is suffering and evil and you will scream at your computer.i'd give it a 9/10.			"

								Fun vs frustration ratio not good enough. I love the art, theme, voice acting, atmosphere, and concept.  I am familiar with grinding and RNG and enjoy other games with them, but this one is a bit much.  I would love a difficulty setting so I can pick Easy and Hard can be for the people carefully following guides and videos and willing to spend hours killing level 0's for gold.  I had fun up until today and then hit a wall and just gave up. "

Early Access Review
								Unless you're a masochist, this game was good originally, and was almost an expert delivery of something unique.. but then they kept adding artificial difficulty and a glass ceiling for new players that makes it completely unenjoyable.  Basically, if you can find a version of this game from a year ago.. I'd play that. Hell I'd pay for someone to patch it so the new dungeon and monsters are in that version.  But I wouldn't play this one organically.			"

												So, after seeing this game released and finished, I can finally say it. It's nice to see the early access state to finished barely changed anything, except add in more fake difficulty.Pros:-REALLY, REALLY good artwork and style, some animations could be a tad better, but they're mostly 99% good most of the time.-An interesting gimmick of stress and the psychological horrors that adventuring could have.-Unique quirks system making every hero feel slightly different.-Interesting classes, all with unique dialogue.-Pretty simple game to grasp.-More game options to get rid of... unwanted gameplay aspects.-Super easy to mod, the devs even encourage modding (In case anyone wants to know, just make a comment in the review asking how, and I will be glad to share on how to mod the game).-Death's door to prevent complete and utter insta-kills/give a fighting chance.-Wayne June does an AMAZING job as the ancestor. Honestly, I would say it's the best thing about this game.Cons:-The gimmick of stress is just one huge annoyance, the chances of actually getting into 100+ is by doing a dark run or getting gimmicked by stress attacks.-Heart attacks, 1. Stress takes many years to actually start having health issues, you don't have a heart attack instantly. 2. If you get hit by it once, you now go to insta-death's door, a second time? Bye bye, hero.-Quirk system, most are just annoyances that, once again, are just gimmicks.-Disease system, most are, again, annoyances, however, it needs more balancing (i.e. hero gets Black Plague, throw hero away or cure it because they literally can't help now. Hero get rabies, leave it, it's more of a buff than anything. Hero gets Griping in the Guts, annoying, but it's easy to get around.)-Afflictions and virtue chances, virtue chances are so low, I think it might be possible for someone to have 100+ hours into the game and never get a virtue. Afflictions are major gimmicks, reducing nearly every stat for the hero and making them do random things. You can generally keep going with an affliction, but if the player has more than about 2 rooms, you will have to cut off the run short, only to do... nothing.-Above, why does it do nothing? It's mainly a farm and grind game, any gold you need can easily be obtained just by slamming heroes into dungeons, with or without supplies. The upgrades to the town make it to were you need less gold. Everything is an infinite amount of gold and heirlooms.-Because everything is an infinite supply, including heroes, it makes it more smart to upgrade your town first rather than try and play normally.-Heroes are on infinite supply, no matter what, this game will never truly be hard if there's no true way to ""lose"" since gold and heirlooms can be farmed. If you lost all heroes without upgrading the stagecoach, what happens? 4 fresh heroes right there.-Champion dungeons become a long, slow, tedious grind to the boss. It also requires some serious number crunching and near perfect min max team comp, leaving barely any room for expirements.-...The only way you can figure out this game is legitimately rolling low numbers on purpose is modding. How? Perfect example, as a joke, I made the Jester (funny stats for a funny character) do 0-9999 damage with a modifier of 100+% damage increase... he would constantly hit from 2000-4000. You start off with 67% of a death resist, I even increased it to about a 75%... they still have a good chance of dying from 1 hit.-The numbers ROUND DOWN. A double edged blade, to an extent, since it also applies to the enemies. Need an example? A vestal can heal for 7-8. Adding a trinket that gives a 33% heal buff, lowest heal she can get is 9 (9.31, to be precise). Highest would be 10 (10.64, precisely). Instead of rounding up when it hits a .5 and above, it rounds down. This effects the player mostly though because even if they still get rounded down, the enemies can outdamage any negative things that happen.-Class balance is fine for the most part, except the classes that outperform the others, outperform them HEAVILY. A vestal can NEVER outheal any damage, only prolong them from death. An occultist? He can not only have the best debuff in the game, but outheal the damage to a character. Hellions? Best meleer in the game. Why? She's the only class in the game that can hit ranks 2-3 while in rank 1-3 and 4 in rank 1. Lepers cry because once they get pushed to rank 3, they literally can't do anything worthwhile. When they're in ranks 1-2? They can only hit enemy ranks 1-2. Does he have the damage to make up for it? For a normal class? Sorta. Hellion though? She's barely a few points off of leper damage except she can add a bleed DoT.-DoTs... bleed is pretty much the only good DoT. Blight upon hit does 0 damage and at max rank does a DoT of a whopping... 7. Yay. A hellion could basically hit for that along with a bleed that does about 3 damage. I don't understand Red Hook's obsession with blight doing no damage.-However, you need some DoTs because of prot and champion dungeons. With all these recent patches, they added prot which was a means of prolonging the fight to make it ""harder"" meaning use some more DoTs just for them. Also, there is no possible way you can get up to the jacked prot the enemies have. The best you will get will probably be 15%, using both trinket slots.-These devs constantly buff enemies while nerfing heroes. Matter of fact, the entire every team is viable has been bogus since the release of the game and has only be stomped more into the ground with these stupid nerfs.-Final level is filled with nothing but stress gimmicks and enemies that tank (granted, they can do a lot of damage, esp. with crits + DoTs) that wants you to min max a team.-There's a slight more, but I won't touch on them except... the crazy, annoying doomsayer. ♥♥♥♥ him. I hope they remove him. His yelling sounds like some bad, cheesey, low budget porno that doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense.TL;DR version: The game is good if you're gonna play a small amount and then move on. If you plan to spend a lot of hours in it, pass or wait for about a... 75% sale, at least............. Also ♥♥♥♥ the doomsayer, ♥♥♥♥ing remove him already.Side note: Before I get♥♥♥♥♥♥stormed by I'm bad, casual, not helpfuls, etc. I have played enough ""hard"" games and even relatively obscure games, Dark Souls (not really obscure, but ""hard, but fair"" which a I call bull and beaten it), Legend of Grimrock 1&2, Pillars of Eternity, a few Ys games, and more. I can say, this game would be good for a mobile, up until champions, which can take up to an hour from the tankiness of enemies. I am very far from bad, casual, etc., it's just the way the game plays, it's just meat grind simulator till you can use heroes leveled etc. (specific heroes too) and then it becomes 95% of the time, the house wins game. Huge time sink to even START in the higher level dungeons. Honestly, veteran is the most fun that can be had, and that was ruined by the crit focus every battle.Side Side Note: I have feeling the people upvoting this generally agree with what I have to say, but if you have read this far, please tell others to not just mindlessly upvote bad and/or good reviews. It doesn't help anyone, and it can possibly even mix opinions and facts. For example, if one says x game is bad because it requires too much number crunching whereas another one says x game is bad because it seems like the devs wanted you to be a 2 year old to play, then... yeah, kinda hard to truly tell where opinions and facts start and end. So, please try to spread the word of don't upvote/downvote till you know where this review is coming from. Also, don't upvote memes and joke reviews, it, once again, hurts to see where facts and opinions mix. Just... vote funny and move on.			"

												I'm not going to tell you what Darkest Dungeon is about in terms of gameplay, since that's something that you can easily learn from the store page, of course. I just want to express my conclusions on the game after beating it.It's wonderful, really, especially if you love Lovecraft like I do. The overall aesthetic, the sound design, the narrative, everything looks great and polished. Combat feels very satisfying and has you literally scream in joy and terror in front of the screen. It's awesome. There's a ton of content too, it took me more than 70 hours to beat the game (it's also very possible to do it in a much shorter time, of course).But this can be quite a stressful experience aswell, not just for your heroes but for you, the player. While I found most of the campaign to be very enjoyable, the endgame really killed most of my enthusiasm and almost got me to the point of giving up playing to just watch the ending on YouTube. This is because the game gets very grindy during the final quests: the Darkest Dungeon is a pretty rough place, and it will probably kill many of your heroes. And unless you send legendary heroes, your party will be dead long before it can explore the dungeon enough to give a clear notion of how the various mobs and bosses fight. And remember that there can be no retreat from that place without at least one dead hero.The grinding aspect kicks in when you realize that you don't have the legendary heroes you need for a particular quest and that you have to train new ones up to level six in order to get a single chance to succeed. Even if you win a Darkest Dungeon quest, the survivors will permanently refuse to embark on the following ones, thus becoming useless. Yet the game does actually provide you with some hints so that you can immediately guess which heroes you should bring in a particular quest in the Dungeon. (let's imagine that you are tasked with killing a boss, and that maybe the name of said boss can help you plan your party composition before you start the mission...)But since I was too dumb to notice such hints, I finally decided to use a guide to beat the last missions of the game. I guess I'm just not that good with this kind of games, I can't come up with particularly good strategies in terms of party composition, so that my chances of victory often depend on RNG and luck. Plus, this is not Dark Souls or Super Meat Boy, you WILL be punished even though you don't deserve it. Many have criticized the importance of RNG in Darkest Dungeon, but it's a necessary element in a game that wants you to feel stressed whenever your heroes do. That said, I did beat the game with default difficulty options: you can toggle off some mechanics in order to make your experience less frustrating if you feel you can't stand the overall difficulty of the game. You'll probably be labelled a ""casual"" from hardcore players and you won't be given a particular achievement when you beat the game, but who cares. Your heroes will go crazy during the adventure, make sure you don't. The fact that you are given an option to customize the overall difficulty of the experience is the main reason why I would recommend Darkest Dungeon to anyone, even those who are not familiar with the genre. It's probably still going to hit you hard even in ""casual mode"" but, as the game tells you, there can be no victory without madness.EDIT (12 March 2016): the Antiquarian Update solved most of the issues I had with the endgame. So most of what I said above about grinding should no longer be of concern. Great job, developers!			"

Early Access Review
								This is early access. There are some rough edges around the slightly unresponsive UI (selecting the rooms which to explore, etc), balance of classes (Jesters are fun but everyone else does what they do so much better at it) and difficulty curve (there's an immensely ugly spike from level 3 to level 5 dungeons and it's not entirely unreasonable that you WILL die during your tutorial battle).But that's Early Access. And even now, even limited to ""only"" 10 out of 16 hero classes, and 3 out of 5 dungeons, the game is absolutely glorious in art and feeling. From the very first time I've set my eyes on the original trailer to accessing Kickstarter-Backer-only Pre-Early Access, I've been in love with the game.Finally there is a meaningful ""flee"" mechanic. It makes sense to abandoning a mission - you won't get the rewards, your heroes will be unhappy about it, but at least you get them out alive and all the loot they've gathered so far. And this loot will determine if you can afford their drinking sprees and self-flagellation practices in town to get them to function like normal beings again. Normal adventurer beings.Don't get too attached to your heroes. They will die, whether in a hag's cooking pot (what an amazing boss fight!), poisoned by sentient fungi or hacked to pieces by giant undead skeletons. They will die, and they will grow mad (or, rarely, heroic) and those who survive will develop most unpleasant traits during the weeks of their adventurers' life.And still you'll be hiring new faces, new classes with new skill sets to send them to their doom underneath your family's ancient manor while using your loot to slowly build up and expand your hamlet and base of operations.It's the best and most complete Early Access game I have every played - if this sounds like something you enjoy, go for it. I certainly do not regret a single cent spent on the Kickstarter. "

Notice: This review was written before the ""Radiant"" update that from hearsay addresses some of my issues. I will update the review further once I have the time to check the update out.tl;dr only get Darkest Dungeon if you enjoy grinding and risk management, which I do.As someone fairly used to absurd RNG+grind (Warframe) and risk management (XCOM), this game, overall, was a fairly enjoyable experience. However, after finishing the game, I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone that isn't used to extreme levels of randomness in game design. Even when employing everything you can to minimize risks, at later levels your characters can die in the span of a single turn to plain bad luck.  And after sinking several hours worth of grind into a single elite-level character, losing one just because of poor luck feels like a punch in the gut, and unless you find grinding soothing, the lost time will be inexcusable to the average player.Allegedly the devs are planning a shorter version of the campaign, which should cut down the completion time to 40 hours from the current average of 80 hours.[www.darkestdungeon.com]The RNG really feels like its without any rhyme or reason, e.g. special items in the Warrens giving your characters traits for adventuring in the Ruins. Thankfully, most RNG checks seem to have a chance for a positive outcome as well, as characters gambling in the tavern can win new trinkets instead of just losing the ones you have.Unless you are really averse for spoilers, I suggest watching this video review by Joseph Anderson to judge whether or not Darkest Dungeon will be worth your time.

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon is the strategy game Lovecraft nerds have been waiting their whole lives for. Your idiot ancestor, in fine Dunwich Horror tradition, opens a portal to unspeakable things in the caves beneath your family estate. This triggers a sort of eldrich Chernobyl, which you seek to battle back with the help of some incredibly suspect mercenaries. You send expeditions down into the corrupted places to battle monsters and secure treasures, at the cost of your team's health and sanity. Back at your hamlet, you manage your people, training them, outfitting them, and treating the different neuroses they pick up from their journeys. This is the heart of the game, the struggle between pushing back the darkness and keeping your troops from succumbing to it. Stress mounts over time if not managed, and adventurers pick up more and more quirks as they gain experience. Some of these are helpful, like familiarity with certain dungeons or stronger wills to resist stress. Most of them are not, and can range from claustrophobia to full-blown insanity.The management half of the game is very much an XCOM affair, training and outfitting your mercs as you upgrade your hamlet. Aside from skill training and forging new gear, there are structures like a bar, a church, and an asylum for helping your team deal with the stresses suffered and treating the different psychoses and maladies they pick up. Successful dungeon crawls will earn you enough money to improve the lives of your crew and still have leftovers for further upgrades. Bad runs can cost you dearly, though there never seems to be a point where the situation is unrecoverable. There are always more hapless souls to send into low-level dungeons, after all. Upgrades to the hamlet reduce costs, improve effectiveness, and open up new options in terms of gearing and skill builds.Once you're ready to venture forth, you pick a mission from one of five dungeons (only three are available now, hence Early Access) and form a party of four. Missions can focus on completing battles, finding artifacts, or scouting rooms, but they all really come down to exploring as much of the dungeon as you can. You spend gold on provisions like food and torches and shovels, and then you're off. I'm glossing over a lot here, because party formation and provisioning is super important for ensuring you don't have to bail on a dungeon. Dungeons themselves are randomized networks of rooms and hallways. Rooms have the major treasures and battles, while hallways can have ambushes, traps, and smaller rewards to find. Once you complete the mission objective you can leave at any time, so if your party isn't coming apart at the seams yet you can keep trawling for loot. In fact, you can retreat at any time, but your adventurers will suffer stress penalties for failing in their duty. Longer dungeons even have a camping mechanic where your party members can tend to each others' needs. Crawls tend to be tense and measured, trying to keep your torchlight up and your progress matching your provisions.Combat is where the game really shines. It's a simple turn-based system; all your people and their people get one action per turn, the order determined by their speed stat. Both parties are in lines of 4, and the skills available to use are dependent largely on position. Melee attacks might only be used from the front two positions and target the front two enemies, or a ranged attack might only be used from the back row and target all enemies except the one in the front. Each class has 8 skills, 4 of which you can have equipped in a dungeon. Skills always have a ton of features, like status effects or interactions with other systems like your torchlight, meaning there's really no basic ""hit with sword"" attack. There's a ton of strategy to using skills in concert, and the interface helps with this, giving you very complete tooltips on the odds and results of one specific attack on one specific enemy before you use it. It's very much the RPG equivalent of XCOM combat, with you forming strategies to minimize risk and overcoming unforeseen consequences. The RNG is out in force in this title, with massive crits and misses swinging battles back and forth wildly. This is mitigated in part by the Death's Door system: If your HP hits 0, you don't die, but any additional damage has a chance to kill. And when that character dies, they're dead for good, so dancing around Death's Door is a pretty thrilling part of any difficult dungeon crawl.HP is healed when you finish a mission, but stress sticks with your characters. Everything from suffering crits to just being in the dungeon for too long stresses your characters, and when that stress reaches the breaking point, things go to hell. Your mercs can get special sanity effects like Paranoia and Masochism. These can lead them to stop listening to your orders, going their own crazy ways, and stressing out your other party members. Back in town you can treat them with sundry activities like drinking, whoring, and self-flagellation, but even these have their drawbacks. My Occultist suffered a paranoid breakdown, and after being assigned to flagellate his fears away, decided to go on a journey of self-discovery and vanished from the roster. Honestly, that was less of an inconvenience than the Plague Doctor who ""achieved a state of profound emptiness"" while meditating and refuses to stop, or my Crusader who suffers religious delusions in battle and won't do anything except pray. We'll see what they have to say when they make it out of the asylum, though.I probably don't need to mention this by now, but the presentation is incredible. The art is a beautifully-animated pastiche of thick lines and limited colors, looking very much like a love-letter to the works of Mike Mignola. The music is bold and oppressive, and the sound effects are rich and impactful. And I can't pass up the chance to talk about the narrator, because he's one of the best this side of Bastion and The Stanley Parable. Every word out of his mouth is the most overwrought, overdramatic thing you could imagine, bordering on parody but working so, so well with the pitch-black airs of the game. I mean, when you light a new torch he says ""THE MATCH IS STRUCK; A BLAZING STAR IS BORN"" for God's sake. Watch the intro if you don't believe me, or just do it anyway because it is brilliant. Aesthetically the game is absolutely dripping in polish, in stark contrast to its Early Access status.If you want to send hapless adventurers into nightmarish hellholes to bring you back ancient treasures at the cost of their sanity, this is the title for you. As far as Early Access goes, there's no real reason to wait on this one. The game is missing two dungeons, one of which is supposed to go in this fall, and is still being balanced but right now plays just fine. In terms of pricing I expect this to be a Kerbal sort of situation, with no greater discounts until the full release (early?) next year. If you get it now you can ruin a whole bunch of peoples' lives for a few dozen hours, forget about it until release, and come back to an even better game.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very solid turn-based dungeon crawler with rogue-lite elements that keeps you coming back for more.TL;DR A fantastic Early Access game that is well worth the asking price, and has the potential to be one of the greatest dungeon-crawlers ever. The game has tons of content, enjoyment, playability, and polish going for it. With the upcoming content additions, I'll definitely be playing this for a long long time. It's relatively bug free already, but I think it does need some minor balancing done here and there.Gameplay:Solid, incredibly hard, but not unfair, and very addicting. Combat is rarely a cakewalk, and you need to be calculating in your choice of classes, their positions, their moves, and targeting. The current classes are pretty varied, but ultimately boil down to melee DPS/tanks, ranged, and support/healer classes that you are used to. The classes are all very good in their own right, but their does definitely need to be some balancing done between them imo, as some classes are objectively better than others. Currently melee classes like Leper, Bounty Hunter, and Crusader are far better than the others. They have high HP+DEF and do far more damage than any other class, so if it weren't for the fact most of their skills can only be used if they are in the first two positions, you'd just want to fill your ranks with them. Ranged DPS sucks for the most part, and the support classes really onli have very weak buffs/debuff, very low damage attacks, and/or very weak healing spells. I don't think the melee should be nerfed entirely, but tanks shouldn't have high dmg output, and vice versa: DPS shouldn't be invincible. Ranged should have low DEF/HP, high damage instead of low HP/DEF and low damage, and support classes should have higher stats on their buffs, and at the very least, do better healing. Healing skills tend to be less than 50% of what a single enemy attack does, so there is almost never a point to using them atm. There are no HP potions, and food doesn't heal for♥♥♥♥♥♥ so something is definitely needed to allow some reasonable degree of healing without removing the games difficulty. Classes like Plague Doctor and Jester are currently not worth the slot they occupy atm, unless you have no other options for those back two slots. That said, the framework and skills of the classes, even the ones I'm complaining about are honestly pretty wonderful, it's just a matter of changing some numbers around slightly, which I do hope happens. It is an Early Access game after all, so these kinds of things are to be expected, and expected to change over time as the final product takes shape. The gameplay tons of fun of even now, it's just frustrating sometimes when you're stuck with one or more party members that can't pull their weight at all.Content: Already there are many hours of content. I'm ten hours in and have barely scratched the surface. (A few bosses down, chars still lowish level, etc.). This is partially do to the game's difficulty, slow pace,high-ish (but not necessarily steep) learning curve, rate of progression, and the fairly large variety of classes and missions already available. The game (currently) definitely requires plenty of grinding, but that's pretty par for the course in the genre.Characters very level slowly (if you can keep them alive in the first place). Upgrades (two kinds - overworld upgrades ala Rogue Legacy, and character skill/gear upgrades through gold) aren't terribly expensive, but much of your gold will be spent de-stressing characters and buying consumables before each dungeon so their isn't much left to spend on character skills/gear, and overworld upgrades are earned pretty slowly through completing dungeons. You can also find random loot items in dungeons, or as a reward for completing certain dungeons. However, of the dozens of items I've found so far I've equipped exactly zero of them. Every item has a benefit (like +dmg) with a cost (-HP, for example), which is good, but currently it seems like every item I've found has, at best, marginally more COST than benefit, and more often than not, is more of a gimp than anything. These items definitely need some balancing as well imo to provide at least somewhat of a net benefit. The idea is already implemented and cool, it just needs some tweaking.Mechanics:This game has lots of cool mechanics, however the two that make it unique are the stress mechanic and the light mechanic. The stress mechanic is awesome and definitely makes sets the game apart, but it might be a little heavy. For most games, you will be lucky to get your characters through a single dungeon without at least one hitting 100% stress (""afflicted""). They then have to be relaxed in the overworld, which takes them out of rotation for a whole dungeon, and costs a significant amount of gold. Even if they don't hit 100% in the first one, you can almost never take them through a second dungeon back to back without relaxing them first, or they will quickly get to 100% in your next run, stressing out your other characters in the process, and often dooming the whole run.This brings me to the light mechanic, which is really cool by itself. The higher the light, the better the chance to scout ahead between rooms, and the higher the chance to 'surprise' any enemies, causing them to skip their attack phase during the first round. Light is based on consumable torches. The light bar decreases as you progress, and you can use torches to replenish it. If you let light fade, you increase your stress levels, but also increase the loot. Sounds cool, and it can be. However, because you get sooooo much stress in dungeons as it is right now, it's almost never wise to not just keep the light topped off, just to delay hitting that inevitable 100% stress level, so you don't really get to use it much.You get stress walking (full light or not) you get stress from mob attacks (like 15+ stress per hit), traps, items, damage, and your other characters. If one char gets crit, HP down to ""1"", or hits 100% stress, guess what? The rest get tons of stress too. It adds up quick really quick, and a few bad hits in an early encounter in a dungeon can send the whole thing snowballing down quickly to the point you have no option but to retreat, abandon the dungeon, and lose any items/gold you had earned, plus now you'll have to send all 4 characters to 'relax' and pay thousands of gold for it. If stress were nerfed just a little bit, even in one area (like not getting random stress when walking at 100% light), then the light mechanic could be utilized a lot more. That said, if it sounds like I'm bashing these mechanics or the game, I'm definitely not. I like them, and I'd definitely recommend the game to anyone who likes the genre, there's just some minor numbers that need to be changed for balance here and there. Or hell, maybe I'm just really bad and just need to L2P. Either way, I wouldn't change a single thing about the functionality of the mechanics or game itself, just tweak the balance a bit Atmosphere:Excellent, the voice acting that exists so far is perfect, and the game has a beautiful graphic novel style Lovecraftian aesthetic. It's hard to overstate how nice this game looks and sounds.Early Access Comments: Game definitely does not feel much like an EA game. The only bugs I've experienced have been very minor, except for two CTD's after several hour play sessions, but since the game autosaves constantly, it was really just a minor inconvenience, and may be fixed already. There is a ton of polish and content already. If it didn't get another update ever again, I think it'd still be worth this price. I don't think that's the case, as Red Hook seems very committed, but ya never know 100% with EA. If this is just the beginning, I can't wait to see what's coming next.			"

Early Access Review
								I got a letter from my Uncle last year saying that he had given up his questionable lifestyle choices in order to blow the family fortune on unearthing what he described as a ""portal of antediluvian evil"" that he proceeded to open.  I thought at first that this was a cry for help regarding a puzzle in Portal 2 so I obligingly came over the the Darkest Estate to help.Along the way I met a shady fellow with a musket and a SCAdian in a coach.  After being waylaid by the local hoodie wearers we arrived at what is known locally as ""the hamlet"".  It comprised a seedy old church, a run down sanitorium, and a tavern, as well as a woebegotten old ""caretaker"" who I am 90% sure is actually undead based on his distinctive ""cologne"".  Take care indeed, he likes to mooch around taking advantage of the facilities on your penny.  Heaven knows but he spends too much time in the brothel and the flagellation chambers.So what can I say ?  Uncle had shot himself with a dueling pistol, the old bandit, and left me with a property that is impossible to insure or sell.  On the other hand there seem to be an endless supply of friendly imported labour eager to go and clean it out for me for the most spurious and ridiculous of reasons, and best of all, they bring back money, family antiques, and even paperwork to help me do up the hamlet.Admittedly it is a bit hard on the folks I send up there.  They generally come home gibbering mad, if they come home at all, but lately as I have been upgarding the hamlet's facilities and sorting out proper training programs and toys for the poor louts they are doing a lot better.  The Sanitorium is immensely helpful at treating all of the stomach complaints they seem to get, (poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s come home spurting from both ends half the time), not to mention how often they come home with syphilis and/or rabies.  Yes !  I checked the Brothel (once I could get those Lezzie Vestals to pull out of for 5 minutes), they are definitely getting the syphilis from their expeditions and don't ask me where.  I am sure it all gets a bit ""Deliverance"" up there at times, what with all the squealing we hear.    We now have extensive facilities and have murdered the full litany of monster royalty in the ruins, weald and warrens.  I am looking forwards to seeing what is in the Cove and the Manor itself.  There are 23 new gravestones in the hamlet's ""boot hill"" and a roster of 20 more likely candidates, but lately they aren't dying nearly as much, which is probably a good thing.  In fact I think I can see the light at the end of the Darkest Dungeon.  I hope to turn the place into a holiday resort and theme park.  Please do come and see for yourself.  You'll love it.   Darkest Dungeon, like cold water, it's great once you get used to it. :)			"

												Steams says 2,7 hours... more like 270 hours.I have played this game since it's early stages.It's one of my favorite games of all time. It is unforgiving and dark, and the artstyle along with the narrator and animation will inmerse you in a hopeless nightmare.My graveyard is full of corpses, and I remember everyone of them. I have lovecraftian PTSD now.Btw, in Options>Gameplay you can set the RNG in a confortable level if you are struggling.Death is feared and unexpected and you are powerless.			"

								FINE!  YOU WIN, STEAM!  You've been throwing this game at me for months!  I see it under “Recommended For You.”  I see it under “Similar to games you play.”  You show it to me in the “Recently Updated.”  You stick it in to my queue pretty much every time I look there!  And where did you stick it this time?!? You know what you did Steam!  You sent it to me in an email saying “An item on your Steam wishlist is on sale!”  How did you sneak it on to my wishlist without my knowing, you jerk!!!So I bought it.  Throw your little “I won” party Steam, because you won.  And... uh... I actually like this game.  It's pretty good.  I guess I can't be too mad at you, Steam.  Thanks for, you know, suggesting this until I broke down and bought it.  I'm getting the grill out tomorrow if you wanted to come over.  The wife says hi.  Just no “I told you so” and the like.  Take your win graciously.   "

Early Access Review
								Had a great start with the game. Early mechanics are fun, the art is amazing and the difficulty is certainly there.However, as soon as one hits the mid-game, difficulty turns into annoyance with ridiculously unbalanced stress on Veteran and higher quests. I didn't feel challenged as much as bullied by the game, ruthlessly telling me that anything besides pure damage is useless, unless I enjoy seeing heroes die of heart attack. For a game that relies on random numbers for power, using cheap tactics like this or monster corpses only make the game more tedious and boring, not requiring of skill.Given Red Hook seems pretty bent on messing up the game with their patches and that any critic on the official forums is met with anger and insult, I see no reason to think these problems will be addressed soon. Hopefully, the new mechanics will be removed, but until then, I will be considering a refund.			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game really early, before the second bosses to each dungeons were introduced. I played through the game and it was a blast. Second time I played through after Men at arms and arbralest were introduced, 2 patches before the cove i guess.So right before the release i started my thrid playthrough to be right at the darkest dungeon as soon as it is released.I am shocked. This is not the same game anymore. I used to be pretty RNG heavy throughout the entire early access phase but RNG was always less important than your decision making. Thats occours to be over now and Redhook failed in a very important aspect.If you try to be hard but rewarding do it like the Dark Souls/Demon Souls/Bloodborne series and be FAIR and dont just try to artificaly incease the difficulty with stupid RNG and bad gimmicks wich represent the awful way of ""quick and dirty"" solutions instead of well thoughtout gameplay as it was in the beginning of the early access period.I am disappointed. Darkest Dungeon used to be my holy grail of the way early access games should be... to bad.If any Redhook Dev reads this here is the hint of your lifetime:Reddit is loud, but doesnt represent your community/customers/fans by any means. Its only a small portion. Make the game as YOU (!) want it, not as some random person on the internet thinks it should be. And if you want to satisfy all the redditors include a difficulty system like Bastion.Long text in short: If i wouldnt have  experienced the good times in early early access i would use the refund option now.

												Even if at the time I purchased this (when everybody and his dog was posting gameplay videos of it on Youtube) this was a unique and very promising title (thus my desire to support the devs even in Early Access), as of late they have started ""balancing"" the game using cheap, illogical and lazyass game mechanics slapped on top of previously slapped cheap, illogical and lazyass mechanics without giving all that much thought whether those would actually fix anything and their impact on the game, not to mention whether lore-wise those would make any sense whatsoever. Which seems to be a trend with this studio - they come up with game mechanics to fix problems, real or imagined, but never actually think whether those would be fun or fit the lore (not to mention being logical), which in the end brings more of a repetitious tedium than anything else without fixing much, if anything. Even worse - some of those new game mechanics introduce new problems which get ""fixed"" in the same fashion... All of that resulted in an illogical, frustrating and very much grindy experience. The truly spot-on art style, music and narrator could no longer offset the tedium and as such the game simply became un-fun. To the point where this happened:http://www.thejimquisition.com/darkest-dungeon-and-the-perils-of-early-access/as a result of which Jim Sterling, as a Steam curator, eventually decided to take down his own Early Access recommendation for this game...(On a related note this is a relevant read as well)The devs’ desire to make the game hard(er) for the sake of it (and there is only one difficulty setting with no plans for adding more) thus meant that for example higher-tier maggots in dungeons had more armor than even your best armored crusaders in one of the previous patches. Maggots! Why? Because this is how this studio decided to increase the game difficulty - where each maggot was basically like a terminator sent back from the future to end your line. They introduced more randomness for the sake of randomness, grinding for the sake of ""prolonging"" the content, and introduced an overall, fake, difficulty increase (clad in the impenetrable armor of tedium) because according to the devs this is supposedly a roguelike game (which it really isn't - this is basically XCOM with Ironman permanently ON but with Cthulhu monsters instead of aliens and a lot more illogical randomness). It has randomly generated (and very generic) dungeon layouts, hero permadeath and a single automatic save – and that’s it. It has no fail state. You literally cannot lose. According to this it also never will. It will have even more grinding though. A lot more - once the last, fifth endgame dungeon is implemented it will require you to finish multiple missions, as it were, in it, only unlike the other four dungeons it would not allow you to retreat in case things get hairy. Which means that if your heroes fail their mission they will perish trying - which is perfectly fine. Problem is - in case your heroes are victorious they will get a perk preventing them from doing more missions in the endgame dungeon effectively forcing you to grind more heroes from level 0 (no, you cannot hire higher level heroes) in the other four dungeons as to attempt to finish the game. Basically you have to grind one full party of heroes per endgame mission and that is assuming you finish them all at first attempt. Yeah...Despite the game being in Early Access and the devs constantly proclaiming that they appreciate and value player feedback such game altering changes are NEVER put out for public testing prior to release, even if Steam allows beta patches to be installed by those who want to do so and test such changes before they make it into the live build. Such changes are also never discussed or even listed (anywhere) prior to coming to the live build. It is literally expected that people would simply take them for what they are, like them and praise the devs for their hard work. “Communication” with these devs is strictly a one-way street and takes the form of their patch notes. Criticism was simply ignored in the past. Now it is actively censored with people often getting banned and their whole post history outright deleted.All of this has had its effect. According to this[steamspy.com] the game sold more than 400 000 copies on Steam so far. But according to this[steamcharts.com] between sales and major patches on average 700-800 people play it. Which put into perspective means that only 0.2% of the owners of this game actively play it for what it is. The other 99.8% do not, and as of writing this the numbers are still falling...In its current state, as an Early Access title, I really cannot recommend this game. As a matter of fact I'd advise you to stay away from it. The developers do not seem to have a clear-cut vision of what their game is to be, seem to be haphazardly throwing illogical and badly though-out game altering patches (sometimes game breaking in terms of fun) and since they neither ask for nor heed any player feedback there doesn't seem to be much hope of them getting this right by the time it is officially released, which as of writing this is 3 months or so away.As a conclusion I'd like to add that this is not my first Early Access game. Nor is it the most expensive.  Some of my other Early Access games have been basically completely abandoned by their devs and never got finished as such.  But despite all that Darkest Dungeon is the Early Access game that managed to convince me, once and for all, to never, ever, buy into Early Access games again.			"

												I gotta say it is the first time I'm making a ""that huge"" review of a game, but this game is really worth doing it.I bought it on the first day of release, after watching a few reviews, I really hoped that all of that was said wasn't that frustrating, because the game really seemed to be unique, well-designed and even drawn as good as a Bob Ross painting.I gotta say that my first impression were excellent, there was absolutely nothing that really dissapointed me. Every dungeons, classes, buildings gave me a great feeling of ""God there's so much different things to do and try"", and the first ten hours (because I like to take my time) were the funniest hours I've spent on a game since a few years.Every characters (or class) feel unique, they all have their quality and flaws, they have damage or debuff or DoT or even heal/protect skills, they have some kind of specialities (like multi-targeting or crit or DoT...) and even some great art. Every building have a good impact on the game and makes you feel ""doing what you are doing for a reason"".There's also Torch management, Inventory and objects management (as some object can be really usefull on fights), stress management, etc... I mean there's a lot of great thought features that will make you be really, REALLY happy at the beginning.Yeah everything was fine, fun, balanced, and so much more, until I reached the level 5 part of the game (The maximum level is 6 by the way).Then monsters began to be completely unfair, most of them are going from 10HP 0% Protection, 10 dodge and 6-10 damage, to 26-50HP, 35% Protection 36 Dodge, and a ridiculous increase of damage (some hits for 30 crit even with 25% damage reduction, no jokes). You might think it's fair if you didn't buy the game yet because you can upgrade your heroes, but the main problem comes from the fact that if you upgrade TO MAXIMUM your characters, overall they'll win 5 damage/10 accuracy (depends of the class though), 10-20HP and 10 dodge, and they still have a completely unbalanced factor of damage/heal (like going from 5-8 damage to 7-14). What that means for real is that THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY MATTERS IS HOW LUCKY YOU ARE. Melee characters can't hit anymore and will miss 40% of their attacks even with a huge accuracy boost, ranged character will deal the same amount of damage to opponent than they previously were on level 1 because of the insane protection boost on monsters and will even miss 1/3 of their attacks, heals will go from 4-6 to 6-10 even fully upgraded which CAN'T follow the damage upgrade of your ennemies. You feel like being completely torn apart every fight, and struggle to make your characters survive even for a single turn. The stress management becomes impossible to handle, as on 100 stress most of your characters will begin to pass their turn, wound themselves, disagree to get healed or use the wrong skill, and you have to surrender most of the dungeons after 4 rooms because even 1 firecamp break wasn't enough to make them feel better, if you didn't lose someone already.Some classes will survive and ""do"" some things, but 60% of the other class (there's 15 on the game) will struggle so much that it's just impossible to use them. You'll have to spend half the gold you made to treat some disease that are impossible to avoid, to treat their stress as even if you are the best coach in the world, it's impossible not to reach the 100 bars on at least 3 of your heroes (and skills that reduce stress are mostly useless btw) which gives the game a more frustrating than hard feeling.After 40 hours of gameplay, I never tried the level 6 dungeon of the game and the only level 5 dungeons I made were short ones. There's a terrible grinding of gold to do because of how much you'll need to spend after every dungeon (but when you think afterwards, it's the most fun part of the game because you'll farm gold on level 1 balanced dungeons with funny/original strats or composition !). I first thought that I was just bad, or making bad decisions, but after trying so much builds, classes, and reading a lot of people reviews, it's just sad to say, but the game is NOT FUN AT ALL on the endgame.Losing character is a point of the game (as the developpers said), but if you lose them because it's really hard, or you took a critical strike, or your heal get stunned on the wrong turn, it's pretty funny actually, it happens, it's a part of the Roleplay, etc..., you'll have to be more careful or change your trinkets to decrease the odds of death happening next time. But here, it's just completely luck based, and you feel like you got absolutely no chances of winning and all the odds are AGAINST you. The only hope you have is if your character land the CRITICAL HIT OF HIS LIFE that you needed, which means that 1/18 of the time it'll be an okay fight only because of luck, none of your management has a real impact.If I can add one last thing, is that your characters have positions, which basicly allows them to use some different skills. Great feature I have to say, but what I find unfortunate is that this positionning has impact on YOUR HEROES ONLY, it's changes nothing for the opponent, they do whatever they want to whoever they want. It would be even more fun if your positions changed the amont of dodge, or damage you take, of even damage you deal or accuracy I don't know, which could make ""tank"" be a real thing, or healer be less vulnerable. It would actually give a certain amount of strategy and credit to the combination of heroes you try to make.Don't get me wrong, I got no regrets for buying this game, and it is still terribly fun on the early part, but there's a huge difference (as everybody said) between ""The games involves dying because it is hard"" and pure frustration, pure madness, pure luck. To make a comparison, when you play Roulette, you choose the amount and the numbers you bet on. Here, it's like watching the bet table, only allowed to bet all your money on a single number, as you are not even changing your odds of winning, dying, or whatever, every time you enter a level 5+ dungeon or equipping different trinkets.I still have to give a huge shout out to the developpers, who did overall an absolutely beautiful and enjoyable game, one that we were waiting for a long time, one that is beating most of the other games out there and even big studios ones. But I hope that the future updates will give a brighter future to the game (and that unfair points will change to hard points), as more and more players are reviewing this game badly because of the sames problems over and over again.EDIT : For all those who says ""You need to watch a playthrough on internet etc..."" well if the point of the game is to take the same characters as an internet guy and do the exact same thing (because other things don't work as intended), it breaks COMPLETELY all the DnD, discover by yourself, experiment, point of the game, which is to me the best point of all. I took the Vestal for healing because it is more constant even if it heals less than the occulist, but everybody told to me ""Naah don't take the vestal, just take the occulist"", then what is the point of the game if it's just to play like hearthstone and brainlesly taking other's people decks ? Where's the fun part ?			"

								To a person considering purchasing this game, I will illuminate a currently mis-used aspect of game play, the invisible timer that is stress:  Imagine that there is a timer over the head of each of your group reading four minutes, when the clock runs out you die.  As you walk forward the clock ticks down.  If you loot something, there is a good chance you will lose 15 seconds.  If you don't have enough torches the clock ticks down even faster as you move.  If you get into a fight and take too long trying to survive, you lose additional time. If you are critically hit, EVERY party member loses fifteen seconds.  If you critically hit someone, one or two of your party members may gain a few seconds back on the clock.One player class has the beneficial ability to sit in the back row and give one team member three more seconds to an individual timer.  In comparison there are common enemy special abilities you will constantly encounter, that deal a small amount of damage , while taking another 15 to 20 seconds off of one party members timer.Enemies have group attacks that hit every party member and removes another 20 seconds from your play timer.  There is no friendly equivalent, not even something small that gives everyone 2 or 3 seconds back.If one character hit's the halfway mark and is down to only two minutes remaining, roll a ten sided dice. If you roll a one through nine, that character instantly loses an additional 30 seconds, and each other group member loses 30 seconds as well.  That character will then randomly take away another 10 seconds from each player while walking, and in combat will continue to drain time away from the entire group about every two rounds.  If this triggers a second group member hitting the 2 minute mark, that person will then have a %90 chance of suffering something similar, and draining even more time from your play.  There is hope though, if you get that slim one-in-ten victory at the halfway point, you will gain a minute and a half back on your timer, and once every six to eight rounds of combat you will give out a party buff.  This experience will feel like winning a five dollar scratcher.  Sure, you won, but now you have to go back to the gas station.  Hooray.This game has a lot going for it, a lot.  Great sound effects, incredible voice-over work, and perfectly moody and atmospheric soundtrack.  The game play is fun and interesting, unique leveling system and very cool buffs and debuff's that can arrive quickly and randomly.  Sadly, if the stress system doesn't get a whole lot more attention, this game will be doomed to bear the ultimate video game sin of being boring.  The stress meter has a lot of potential to create exciting or scary swings towards victory or defeat, akin to the random elements you normally expect from critical hits.  Unfortunately, the only thing the stress meter actually adds to the game, is redundant timer.  Regardless of preparation, or player choice, the stress bar is essentially a one way trip towards character heart attack, and that stress meter can suffer random spikes towards maximum from every single action you take or enemy you face.  There are methods in-game for reducing stress for party or characters, but those are comparitively small when measured against the steady swell of incoming stress.  Initially this feature is quirky and interesting, but when you realize how it works, and that it steadily and reliably defeats you with no recourse, the game becomes boring.  It's similar to knowing that tax season is around the corner, and you are going to owe again.  This game is not as difficult as some make it out to be. There is simply a pre-lit fuse over every action you take and that you can't put out, only slow down, poorly. "

												Darkest Dungeon is a 2D RPG dungeon crawler with a grim premise promising hardship and challenge to anyone who enters.The good:+Fantastic artstyle, narrator and music! The atmosphere of Darkest Dungeon is simply amazing.+The characters the player can recruit are all different and have fun quips and personalities.+Addictive dungeon crawling that will make you go for ""just one more quest.""+The UI is elegant and superbly done.+The devs have added options to remove/toggle corpses, nerf enemy crits and more small tweaks.+Certain heroes now bring items with them when embarking, for example the crusader will bring holy water.The bad:-The difficulty isn't a curve, but a wall, a wall that has been known to be hit even in the tutorial. The game wants to be hard and that's a fine selling point. However, this is not elegant design like Dark Souls, but rather by arbitrarily stacking the odds against you.-You have to juggle gold, experience points and resources for buildings in order to progress, which is fine in theory, but gold will quickly become the least of your worries as you grind away at resources and while doing that you have to avoid overleveling heroes as this makes it impossible for them to participate in missions they will then deem to easy, yes you read that right, your heroes will actually go against your orders.-With a huge variety in heroes imbalance is sure to arise, but the issue is how obvious it is. For example, the plague doctor has been one of the weakest hero types throughout this entire Early Access, and they still are because they simply can't match the healing of the Vestal or the damage of the Arbalist.-Most trinkets are useless. Almost all of them come with one or two bonuses, but also one or two negatives. A select few artifacts only have bonuses, but they usually aren't too great and they are hard to find.-The quirk system is currently stacked against the player, just like everything else. Negative quirks can fester and become extremely expensive to get rid off. Positive quirks don't have this option, so sometimes after leveling you'll lose valuable quirks because your hero leveled up. Furthermore, diseases are now their own seperate thing, but they don't disappear over time and have to be removed as well, once again, it's just tedium for tedium's sake, because now you have to spend even longer on grinding them away too.-Red Hook has so far with every update and without fail nerfed heroes and strategies into oblivion, which is fine, afterall the game should be balanced. However, they have crossed the line where it has now become mandatory to use a walkthrough on how to min-max. Gone are the days where 4 jesters could enter a dungeon and while they wouldn't be a great team they could pull through.-After nearly 50 hours it has become clear to me that one of the biggest issues is the pacing. Upgrading your town takes way too many resources and you never gain the ability to hire heroes higher than level 0. You never truly lose, you're just doing the same thing over and over, always making the same heroes and dismissing them after they become too expensive to make viable.Bottom line:Darkest Dungeon has so much potential and back when I first bought it I was absolutely hooked by the atmosphere and surface gameply, but once you get deeper you realize just how poor the execution truly is. One misstep feels like it can ruin your entire game; forcing you to start over.The game still has immense potential, but the goal of making a hard game has grown and taken over the core design and it's killing the experience. I vehemently hope that I can change this to a recommendation once the next promised update hits.			"

								With this last update, they make it so you are dead from stress WAY TOO EASILY.  I just lost a party from 100-200 stress because 2 people got hit with a stress shot, and they they all had heart attacks.  So, I lost all the trinkets, and all my high level characters.  I am truly disappointed in this game now.  Until they do something to help relieve stress mid-quest, I am done.			"

								This game is so well made, and at the time of writing this its still in early access. Some of the negative reviews have said that this game has an unfair difficulty system, that you will randomly be matched up against enemies that are simply impossible to beat for the level that you are at, and this was the only thing intially holding me back from getting it. This isn't true, the enemies are tough but it is also fair, I am yet to lose a character and I feel that if I ever do it will be down to my own mistakes.I highly recommend this game to anyone who love roguelike games, RPGs, Lovecraftian fiction and horror as this game uses all those elements beautifully. The game looks fantastic with an incredible art style, plays beautifully with a well structured and balanced combat system, and has an awesome narration voice that adds to the overall atmosphere.Get this game, you won't regret it!Update @ 12 hours in:I've now lost 3 important characters and each loss has been emotionally devastating. Each was lost due to my poor tactical choices and greed for more loot and pushing to finish the dungeon when I knew it was taking a massive risk.			"

								One of the most addicting single player games i've played in years.I've already played this more than most AAA games I purchased in the last 5 years.You might be asking -- How the hell do you get that much enjoyment out of another early acess game?1. It doesnt even feel like an early acess game. 2. I've lost my favorite character 2 or 3 times now and I feel legitamatley crushed everytime. << How many games have you played in the last 5 years that actually made you care that much?3. The narrator is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic..I Listen to the damn intro trailer instead of skipping it just to keep hearing his voice.4. The brutality and fight for survival moments keep me on the edge of my seat,5. The victory screen makes me feel I made it through hell.Some cons 1. The RNG can literally destroy your whole team. 2. Needs more bosses before endgame and expanded story *its early acess so plenty of time for both*Verdict -  Everyone should buy and try this game. These guys really gave it their all on this game.

Early Access Review
								Believe the hypeI’ve only been playing a few hours, and my beloved highway man, basically the Bruce Willis of my squad, is stressed to the max and drowning his sorrows in the tavern.  I decide to leave my Plague Doctor at home too; his kleptomania and plutomania make him compulsively raid every chest along the way, which is setting off traps and stressing the hell out of everyone.  In their stead we take a Hellion and an Occultist, and back to the ruins we go.  Storming through the gates, my lads and lassies are crushing everything in sight.  Whatever for evil may take, be it bone soldiers or cultists, all fall before my steel.  Pressing on, however, we realise that we didn’t bring nearly enough food or torches for this mission.  Do we soldier on, or to we turn tail and run home?  By the beard of Poseidon, we go on!  Inevitably, things start going hairy once the torches run out, and a bunch of spiders thrashes us with impunity. We’re all hanging on by threads, the pitiful 1-2 hp from my Vestal’s group heal the only thing between us and oblivion. My crusader’s resolve is tested, but his brush with death awakens his heroism, and he storms back.  My occultist, however, can’t take the heat and turns abusive, berating the other members and stressing them out even more.  We finally manage to squash the bugs, but the whole party is in bad shape.  Stress levels are high, hp is low, and all the food is gone.  We only have one more room to go through to complete the quest, but the odds are that we won’t survive another scrap.  Embracing recklessness, we push on to the next room, where bone soldiers and spiders await.  The enemy surprises us, the shock throwing my Hellion and crusader to the back of the formation where they can’t attack anything.  By the time I’ve got my part into a fighting formation, it is looking particularly grim and frostbitten for us, and that bloody rapscallion of an Occultists constant stream of abuse and slander towards his comrades isn’t helping. My crusader hits a stun on one of the spiders, giving me a brief chance to get back in the game.  I risk it all on my Hellion’s Break Thru ability; if it doesn’t hit, we’re toast.  It hits, and it bloody critical hits, sending our foes back to the nether from whence they came and allowing my heroes to leave the dungeon alive.  The snide Occultist earns a trip to the sanatorium for his crimes; a week in a padded cell might straighten his shenanigans out.  With the loot we earned we can update the town, learn some new skills and beef up a bit. Thankfully, my highwayman has ended his week-long pub crawl and is ready to rip it up again.  I just hope his newfound love of alcohol won’t get the better of him…   How many games let you craft your own stories as good as this game does?Darkest Dungeon is a classic triumph of a small, focused and creative team of indie developers beating the snot out of the AAA market.  From the fantastically grimy art direction to the harrowing baritone narrator, DD is dripping in lovecraftian atmosphere and hammy gothic horror, and has the world has such striking personality and depth that it is always a pleasure to venture into dungeons and watch your heroes die.  I’m not gonna go into details on game play here; just go on you tube and you’ll see what it is all about.  What I will say is:•	This game is addictive as hell!  Once I got a taste for this dungeon crawling rpg gore fest there was no turning back.•	It is not as hard or as punishing as people seem to make out.  There is a steep learning curve, for sure, and you must make careful preparations while wisely choosing which characters will go a questing; more than a few of your party will die before you get the hang of it.  However, in the humble opinion of yours truly, this is not as frustrating or as difficult as people make out•	That said, it is still bloody difficult, and a lot of the time it revolves around the luck of the RNG.  Relish the challenge and come to terms with the fact that sometimes, no degree of skill and planning will save you from death.•	This game is just bad♥♥♥♥♥  Plain and simple.•	This game is SO METAL it is unbelievable.  If you listened to Slayer or Dark Angel during the 1980s you’ll know what I’m talking about.•	You can’t heal outside of combat.  Deal with it.  Healing out of combat would destroy what makes the dungeons so exciting – its about surviving the horrors or succumbing to them.  Also, you can camp and eat to get a small bit of health back, so the game isn’t unjust towards you. •	This game takes the traditional RPG standards and throws them out of the window in favour of things infinitely cooler and more creative.  Sick of the old warrior/mage/rogue trinity that is the foundation of JUST ABOUT EVERY RPG EVER?  How about plague doctors, occultists, jesters and lepers?  And there are more classes on the way….This is the coolest, most bad♥♥♥♥♥RPG I’ve played in ages.  Let it be said that if you play RPGs for the storylines and stuff, and there’s nothing wrong with that, then perhaps DD isn’t your best bet.  If you like challenging RPGS and have a bit of a masochistic streak in you, then this is your destiny.  Embrace the darkness.  (P.s. I found that listening to any good thrash or death (SkeletonWitch, older Slayer, Absu etc) really goes well with this game) "

Early Access Review
								The game when first released was a brutally challenging but fun dungeon crawler with an awesome art style and draw dropping soundtrack. While the latter two remain intact, it's the former that has suffered greatly. The game's recent patching has made it boring and frustrating to play. Enemies have always been unfairly strong, and have always had more and better actions than you, it was how you strategized around this and managed your resources that helped you overcome this. However, each patch has ruined this rewarding of smart thinking more and more. The developers are far too dead set on punishing players for finding loopholes or gimmicks, and the game has become no fun. Unless you run with an online guide with the optimal party and make sure everything is perfect. You will lose, and even if you do all that, the odds are you will still lose. I cannot put into words how frustrating it is to have a boss heal back 20 health in a turn, hit your party for 40 damage, then heal for another 15, then one of your members goes, and he instantly repeats his 3 turn process. It's a joke to call this game ""Strategy"" anymore. It's luck, it's a pure slot machine that I honestly don't want any part of anymore. The new class was interesting and I played around with him, enjoying the man beast concept. But then I was sucked back out of the game when ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG decided that he would be crit, given a disease and 4, count em, 4 different disorders from 3 consecutive attacks. The game is dumb, it doesn't even make any sense. Why does the trader provide less goods for shorter trips? Wouldn't a trader sell as much as he could to make more money? Why can't you stall a fight to heal? It already doesn't make sense you can't heal out of combat, or camp more than the allotted times. The player punishing is just dumb and incessant, and I know it won't stop so I'll be dropping this game. What was once and fun and interesting game to play when I had nothing else to do has become a boring chore that annoys me and sets me back hours regardless of how well I know the game and it's systems. Don't Buy It. Do yourself a favor, try Xcom, it has similiar BS Rng but it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ you nearly as hard. Also, the developers of that game don't punish players for finding strategies that work.

Teal DeerDevelopers: Red Hook Studios Publishers: Red Hook Studios Initial release: Jan 2016Genre: RPG, Turn-based, Dark, Rogueish #Worth/NotWorth: #Worth Exposition, Concurrence and SummationMortality clarified with a single strike! Darkest Dungeon puts you in charge of a city as well as a bunch of ragtag misfits eagerly willing to sacrifice the sanity of their thoughts for the drive that we can all understand which is that of loot and leveling; and of course. Killing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of monsters. GAMEPLAYThis is a turn based up to 4 person party dungeon crawler rogue-like. I know how much you love labeling genres. This game is not easy. It will punish you for making bad decisions, going in with little resources as well as not making a balanced party.As the ruler or I guess maybe Mayor of this town-- no, ambivalent spectator you are given charge of recruiting willing quest takers to lead into the dungeons. You have the ability to upgrade buildings in the town which more or less are the permanent upgrades and what makes this game a rogue-'like' as the characters in your roster suffer from perma-death. There is quite a few class types. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Not only in their ability set but in their personality. Before I delve deeper into this subject, stress management is a very real thing in this game. Simply walking around in the dungeons will stress the characters out. As stress builds to a maximum, that specific character goes through a resolve check which will have 1 of 2 effects. One is that their mind will break, giving them afflictions of being masochistic or paranoid among other things which depending on the severity may have you lose complete control of them. Additionally, almost every time when someones mind breaks the rest of the party becomes all to aware and will likely have a cascading affect on everyone else. However there is a bright side, sometimes when a character goes through a resolve check they get a positive character trait so that they become more courageous or vigorous and boy that feels really good. After every attack that character encourages the others and they receive a small decrease in overall stress level. Once back in town, you are given a few options to treat the stress of questing. Either some proper drinking, gambling or a visit to the brothel or more zealous options for the more religiously inclined including flagellation. And going back to each character having a specific personality some will only have one way to relieve stress and being that there are only so many slots to place characters for specific activities this can become an issue. So plan wisely. Additionally, the stress relief does not always go so well. I have had multiple occasions where a character would cost me additional money because they got too drunk and bought every one a round or had some crisis of conscience during meditation and went missing for weeks. Additionally, there are also blacksmiths for equipment upgrades as well as a Sanitarium for the treatment of diseases and maybe some not so nice ways of getting rid of personality quirks that may not be.. beneficial.   The game also has a an extremely addictive quality in the gameplay loop in that it goes like this; return back to town, put folks into stress relief situations, take B team and start another quest, rinse and repeat. The game is mostly controlled almost entirely with just a  mouse. You can use A and D to move left and right down hallways should you choose to but as the game is mostly menu navigation, I preferred just using the mouse. Its also a dead ringer for a tablet port. Now I'm just going to gushThe art design is possibly one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. It's obviously a completely different game and style really but its on the level of how I felt the about Ori and the Blind Forest. Each character sprite is really cool looking and ever so slightly varied. There is also a narrator that encourages you and sort of lends this 'gameshow' quality to everything. He seems to carry himself in a relatively sort of sadistic way. It reminded me of Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He says some truly awesome things and the voice is great. While I was rummaging through a loot sack “Secrets loom in the most tenebrous reaches of this place.”THE GIST Easily one of my favorites games I've touched thus far in 2016.ADDENDUMAfter being slightly perplexed at the way voting was going I decided to take a gander at the other reviews for this game to discover just what made this game so polarizing. It seems a lot of people have developed a rather large disdain for 'grind-y' things. Yet I do not see this treatment to liberating outposts in far cry or reaching the paragon levels in Diablo 3. Likely due to the fact that those characters can't be wiped by a bad decision or ill preparation. (unless you consider hardcore mode in D3) Either way, a game being grind-y is not indicative of poor quality. It is a design decision. Just because it is a long road of learning mechanics and being properly prepared as well as learning when to cut your losses to reach the final end game does not invalidate the rest. If you only played 10 hours, never killed a boss or even completed a medium length quest and had 3 or more full party wipes I would STILL recommend the experience. I don't like the way people are changing needing to be coddled, that they must be allowed to see the credits roll and this is the developers job to do so. Darkest Dungeon is a difficult game if that's not your cup of tea go play Child of Light. Darkest Dungeon is a phenomenal experience. Even if you do wipe you still have upgraded buildings in town and the knowledge of what makes a balanced team as in bleed effect abilities probably aren't a great idea in the Ruins because Skeletons don't have blood. Or a tactic I tried myself, dwindle a fight down to one weak enemy and stop attacking while using your abilities heath and stress included to try to get back into fighting shape. I myself have lost 2 level 2 fighters that were nearing 3 as well as 2 others half way through 1 because I got greedy on a short quest after completing it. I continued to explore the next 2 rooms. Full party wipe. I went back to the drawing board. Made sure my new recruits had complimentary abilities, upgraded those abilities afforded to me by the guild and pressed on. “Confidence, SURGES as the enemy crumbles. Take advantage of this momentum, give them no quarter!”Follow my curation for more "

Early Access Review
								After seeing Jim Sterling play it for half an hour, this was the first early access game I bought  and I do not regret that decision in the least. As a resuly I have I have become very attached to this game and honestly want to see it so well. So, bad stuff first.Yeah so my squad just got critted a whole bunch of times, went mad and refused heals and I missed 5 escape attempts.  They all died, leaving me with no gold and no future prospects other than using some scrubs from the wagon to get some gold, and up until week 40 I only had 6 deaths. Now it's 13, their blood is on my hands and I'm slowly accumulating a pile of dead lepers and doctors.  Honestly I really love this game, but it makes me sad that a careful style of play is not rewarded (enough) and you just end up treading water to recover failed missions. At it worst it feels like playing a freemium game, but thankfully never for long. I feel like what the dev was going for was to balance your need to go forward against the personal needs of your heroes, and that's great, but I feel like it requires some balance in areas. It skirts the line between unfair and unforgiving and don't get me wrong, that makes for some exhilerating gameplay, but some fail safes on the side of the unfair would be much appreciated for those of us who would like to move forward with the least amount of bloodshed possible.  As an aside, both the conflicting quirks and the removal of incorrect quirks from the abbey were areas where the game could be unforgiving and have it not be a big deal, and they made sense flavour wise( why would medieval medicine be so much more effective than modern medicine and having only one stress outlet is unhealthy respectively).  I think they were removed or tuned down recently and I would be against outright removal.  However an upside chance alongside the downside chance would be nice, especially in regard to removal of quirks.  I realise this is more feedback than review but sure feck it I'm here anyway.That being said, this game is amazing.  The mechanics, tone, atmosphere, voice acting. music, narration, art direction, stability(1 crash on day one, none since) and balance ( mostly!) all emerged fully formed from the developers tepid mind-womb.Also , I talk like that now so that's nice.   9/10 for full release, 11/10 for early access.  Also those of you who are waiting for it to be on sale or waiting for the full release, or both, I wouldn't expect a sale in the next year since the early access period is 6 months.  However, I think if you Nomad level kickstart it for 15 bucks, you get it on release.  Not sure if you can still do that, but you used to be able to. You will not get early access.			"

Early Access Review
								Hello Internet!This is my review of Darkest Dungeon. In short, should you buy it? YES.Important things to know: The game is technically early access and I'm sure you've heard (or been subject to) the horrors that could potentially come from a title with this tag. But one easy way to know if this game is a legitimate seller, or just a shameless grab for money; is to look at the news/updates for the game. The game has very steady updates, which are usually packed with either a lot of fixes and tweaks, or full blown new elements to play with. Overall the developers seem pretty committed and there is a large pool of gamer genres it caters too, making the community reasonably sized. Buy this game if you like:-Challenging yet rewarding game-play-""dungeon crawlers"" (aka Diablo, etc.)-Unforgiving games like Dark Souls (See negatives)-Awesome medieval/gothic art style animations-Strategy gamesSetting:There really aren't many spoilers to give, so long as you've seen the videos offered on the game's store page; you've got the gist of it. You are the heir of a noble bloodline, who's family owned a castle and a big chunk of land, which subsequently became overrun with demons, undead, etc. You are directed by the, amazingly well voice acted, voice of your ancestor to cleanse the grounds of all evil and take back your home. Gameplay:The character you play as (the heir), is never actually seen (except for a brief silhouette in the window of a stage coach). The game is seen mainly through the eyes of the adventurers that get hired to wander the halls, sewers and gardens of the grounds. Their are several different classes to choose from, as well as an enormous number of random traits assigned to every new character arriving on the stage coach (think of Rogue Legends). The explorers are sent in to accomplish various tasks: map the area, kill baddies, purify alters and exterminate bosses; all the while collecting gold, jewels, trinkets and other important things. You control them as they travel from room to room, managing supplies and food consumption. A major mechanic of the game is stress, which regularly proves to be more lethal than most of the enemies by themselves. If an adventurer becomes too stressed they become ""afflicted"", resulting in various negative behaviors including hurting themselves, whimpering in fear, reckless abandonment or just further stress.Once the adventurers stagger out of the dungeons with loot in hand, they return to a small town just outside of the grounds and deliver it to you. It is then your duty to manage your money to fund various important tasks such as: paying to let characters reduce their stress (praying, drinking, etc.), upgrading their gear/skills, investing into town services to upgrade their benefits and a myriad of other things that I'll let you find for yourself.Negatives: -The game is very punishing. When enemies ""Crit""(critical hit) they not only deal extra damage but usually cause the stress of all your party members to go up. VIce versa, your heroes crits will heal some stress; but the enemy do not experience stress so its not much of a loss for them. Also heroes, if not careful, die a lot. It may get to the point where each expedition ends with you hiring an entirely new team.-RNG. Random number generators are used for a lot of the unseen calculations that determine whether an attack hits or misses and how much damage is dealt. Recently they've implemented fixes to make it so enemies can't crit 5 times in a row, completely wiping your party; but like I said, early access.-Trinkets are Unbalanced. Sometimes your adventurers might find a trinket that can enhance certain stats/abilities. Most of the time these trinkets benefits are far outweighed by their negatives, making all but a specific few trinkets essentially useless (except in more advanced play).Positives-Looks great, sounds great. The art style is very gothic and edgy, wrapping up the whole ""Darkest Dungeon"" feel. While the animations themselves are very simple, the game has an excellent audio board full of tasty sound effects. Mainly though your ancestors voice steals the show, narrating just about everything in an aristocratic, gravelly tone. ""A SINGULAR Strike! The fiends must be driven back, and what better place to begin than the seat of our noble line.""-Endless combinations. You can take four adventurers into a dungeon. The various classes, plus the positive/negative traits they all have, plus the trinkets they're carrying, plus the specific dungeon area, plus the various skills they possess; lead to a new experience every crawl. Experimenting on what works well with what is half the fun, giving it a really strong replay value as they add new content all the time.-Intense Crawls. Never before will you look at a dungeon crawler the same way again. The adversity that you must overcome, coupled with trying to keep your characters from ending themselves, is delectably painful. Your characters will seem to take on personas of their own as they single handedly take on a boss or go insane and starting acting manically. Closing statementBuy the game. They just added two new characters for free. You won't regret it.Or maybe you will, once you've entered...The Darkest DungeonUPDATE 8/11Still playing and the game is only getting better...			"

Early Access Review
								*This review is based on the early access* Pros: Excellent atmosphere, Great soundtrack and FXs, Solid core/mechanics, fantastic art design and Grim but fun story.Cons: Poor pacing, Too intense difficulty spike, Not enough loot for effort, Lack of planning because of RNG, Lack of customization, Confusing STATS, and Unbalanced Classes.Short review: Darkest Dungeon at this moment is a frustratingly great game that is muddled down by broken stats, poorly balanced classes, and an incredible for all the wrong reasons difficulty spike.  I recommend you wait till it's final release before purchasing!Full Review: First of all I would like to say that I helped back this game. I absolutely loved the concept and was on board the moment I saw the combat and art style. The soundtrack is done wonderfully by Stuart Chatwood of (Prince of Persia series) fame. The art design is foreboding and dark as it should be and the small touches of dialogue from the Nameless Estate Owner's deep voice evokes fear and tension in every battle and even in respite. This game has everything going for it....until you start playing more than two hours of the game. The start of the game is difficult and the first dungeon teaches you a very powerful lesson. ""In this dark abyss, only thorough forethought and careful execution will you allow yourself to survive"". It's a shame then that the game has yet to fully take it's own advice. This game wants to be Dark Souls or FTL or the Binding of Issac so bad and I do too but here's the thing about those games. They may be incredibly difficult, but they are also phenomenally well designed and balanced which is why even in death you want to try again to do better, to play smarter. I can't tell you the amount of times I've spent playing FTL over and over again. Just one more turn, one more room then I'll go to bed. This isn't one of those games; not yet at least.Lets start with the positives, the combat. The combat is fluid and deep and each battle keeps you on edge and each victory feels great. It's such a satisfactory feeling to kill two enemies at once and have the narrator praise your strike when you were at the brink and you turned the tide of battle. It is equally heartbreaking then when an enemy kills an ally you've grown accustomed to, and like your characters your resolve breaks at the sight. That's whats great about this game what's not great is when you attack five times miss five times and the enemy kills you in one hit despite massive upgrades. For all this game does right the balancing issues comeback and take it all away. The first apprentice levels gets you accustomed to the combat but the moment you level up and move on to the next greater challenge the game slams you back HARD and destroys the flow it had been building. Yes the game is supposed to be hard I get it (comes with being a rougelike game, you know no mercy) but the sometimes sporattic RNG isn't fine tuned enough to warent an honest death. The game advices you ""sometimes its better to run from a fight"", I agree. However when you abandon a quest your allies never receive experience for their effort so not only do you lose money for the supplies that you can't take back you are stuck with stress and nothing to show for it. Wanna an easier level to get back on your feet after a difficult dungeon? Too bad your too strong to go back and too weak to go forward.  They want you to grind for experience and get gold and get stronger to get more skills to be prepared for the next battle. But they punish you for playing it smart and retreating or if you want to do small tasks to make back the money. The game forces your stronger companions to fight more difficult battles alienating them from the rest of your party members. So if you want to get your strongest party to fight the upcoming boss too bad that guy didn't level with the rest of them breaking up the synergy. Speaking of party members each class is unique, you have the Crusader, the Vessel, the Bounty hunter, the Occultist, etc.. The problem is that there are classes that are clearly better than others. Why would I bring a Grave robber when I have a Highwayman? She can randomly get an item when resting, whoopee! The Highwayman has a high dodge chance and can hit three enemies for higher damage, guess which one I'm taking? Each party member gets a good quirk and bad quirk. Some make the character more unique others are diseases that need to be cured. You can get rid of the bad ones for a price but only one. Problem is between all the upgrades, the stress relievers, and the upgrades of skills there is not enough money to do what you need to survive. You can't just take a week off play it smart and weigh your options. Your forced to keep going back in. You never can do what you want efficiently and you ask yourself why you couldn't do things differently.  Why couldn't you have an upgrade where you could take away two bad quirks for a slightly increased price instead wasting an adventurer? Why can't I carry more gold like maybe 2000 per slot instead of 1500 or make this less expensive? Why can't I customize the color of an adventurers look? I know I could lose an adventurer but by the fifth bounty hunter I stopped caring about their names or quirks.Most of the problems probably will be fixed by the time the game is finally released. Which is good but it needed to be said now. This game is still being fixed and balanced. That's why I wrote this review because I want this game to be great it clearly has the potential. I want it to be heralded as the indie Dark Souls or Resident Evil (1-4)  but it doesn't just get it handed to it because it has my money. It has to work at it like everyone else. I believe in Red Hook. It's a great team who clearly want to make a great game and I believe though that by the time it is finished I will be singing it's praises on release day. But for now I will be backing away into the dark night waiting for its foreseeable release.			"

												Want to play a game where you can play as safe and as optimally as possible, and STILL get taken out by the RNG that seems to be tipped against you?Boy, have I got a treat for you!If the enemies get a few lucky rolls, they can take out a character's entire healthbar before you're given the chance to intervene, flushing several hours worth of progress (not to mention a lot of luck!) down the drain. On the flipside, you can play like absolute garbage and have nobody in your party die ever because whether or not a character lives or dies when they're at 0hp is purely down to chance.I get that the design is supposed to force the player to make the best of a bad situation, and I can get behind that, but at this stage (As of today, ""This stage"" is the game as the devs invisioned it on release. There's no hope for change.) there are too many design decisions that force the outcome out of the player's hands. This is probably because the part of the game that is actually up to the player is so easy - if you've got at least a few braincells rubbing together, it doesn't take long to figure out how to play it optimally. So, rather than address that, the developers have decided to make it randomly kick you in the nuts every few minutes. This doesn't make it deep or challenging, just frustrating. The golden moments where the game achieves what it sets out to do with it's chaos management mechanics are few and far between, and most RNG punishment tends to go around instantly eliminating one of your heroes. Rather than requiring you to adapt your strategy because of the loss of a character, you're able to just go back to a level 1 dungeon and start over because all it takes to replace a dead hero is to grind a few levels. It doesn't add any extra challenge, it just forces you to grind more.It fits into the new-wave ""Hardcore"" trend following Dark Souls, where being ""Hardcore"" comes more from marketing and player perspective than actually being a difficult game and, as a result, that's the philosophy that drives the worst elements of it's design. What's more, players who picked up the game based on this marketing are willing to defend these elements to the death, because if the public perception were to change to see the mechanics *the way they are* without the ""omg so hardcore"" veneer, that would invalidate the hardcore gamer cred they feel they've earned by suffering through the game's grind. If you're feeling ""Called out"" at this point, that's great, because I think you're a tool.Art, storytelling and atmosphere are A+, and I'm going to come back to it just for that when the last of the content is added, but the game itself is a grind facilitated by RNG that shouldn't pose any actual challenge to anyone with a reasonable knowledge of CRPG mechanics.I rate this game 2.5 out of 5 loaded dice.

												I would compare this game to a long book that you might really enjoy at first but then by the end you're kind of annoyed at how it drags on. It's just way too long for how little content/progression there is, it's honestly so long that the rare occasion i see story content I don't even remember what I'd been told in the past. Also, when a game is this unforgiving you'll usually crest over a point where your gear/characters starts synergizing really well and that satisfactory dominance makes the strugle all worth it. This game never gives you that, it just gets harder and harder and you'll lose your best guys and items to some rng and have to start a whole group of fresh characters all over again. The styling and gameplay is cool but I can't reccomend this game to anynoe knowing how much drudgery it ends up being. If you do decide to play it make sure you reference the wiki on every single curio/boss fight- trying to play without it by trial and error will extend the game by probably 30+ hours.			"

One of the greatest defeats snatched from the jaws of victory. A tragedy in many parts.Darkest Dungeon was very nearly one of the big wins from Kickstarter alongside Divinity Original Sin, and Wasteland 2 (though opinions do remain a bit divided on that one from time to time). How best to describe it? It's basically the grown up version of Warhammer Quest, except it's the grown up version *done right*. This is probably as close as you'll likely get to a pen and paper roleplaying experience on your computer without actually rolling the dice yourself.The game follows two distinct beats, the first takes place in your hamlet, known simply as the estate - insert the name of your save file between 'the' and 'estate', this leads to all kinds of possible creative humour if you stop to consider the implications, for people over here in Britain, the obvious choices such as ""The Darkest Leeds Council estate"" are going to be too easy to pass up - the estate serves as your hub to manage your roster of adventurers, and it will be a roster, a sizable bunch of misfits drawn from a wide class pool, easily as diverse as you could possibly wish for, and all of them have a slightly grim twist upon their usual fantasy tropes upon which they are based.A grim tale with a bloody end, for everyone involved...For example, in normal roleplay games, one would ordinarily expect the adventuring party to be made up of the holy trinity, that is to say - tanking, damage and healing. Those tenets are more or less followed here within reason, two of the classes offer up healing options in the guise of the Vestal, a priestess who is decked out in more metal than robocop, and the occultist, who can mend with dark powers whilst raining down curses upon his foes. Tanks include a crusader, possibly the only unambiguously ""good"" moral choice in the bunch, and even he can be easily brought down from grace if you send him to the brothel (yes, there's a brothel, and yes, you can get people -banned- from it for ""deviant tastes""), and a leper, a hulking brute of a tank who wears a mask reminiscent of the guy from V for Vendetta.All of the classes have their own unique twist on the usual trope, and their own backstory, a reason for visiting this utterly forsaken place, and as a result you'll likely get attatched to your favourite classes and heroes, all of whom you can name and provide trinkets to adjust their stats a touch here and there. Gear can be upgraded, naturally (though as of the current build, there doesn't seem to be a visual reflection of upgrades, which is a bit saddening, though the art style more than makes up for it), and additional skills can be bought and then shuffled around from the guild hall. Each character gets seven skills, but you can only take four into battle, and some skills are usable only from specific places and only UPON specific targets in the opponents position order, so choose carefully and ensure you have a good spread.Venturing down into the depths...Once you've settled upon your choice of party, skills and core kit, you then move to the provisioning stage, where you select the mission you wish to take on, you then buy up any consumables you wish to take with you for the mission ahead and then deploy, and the game proper begins. You move about between rooms on a map, following ""corridors"" made up of little mapsquares that can contain encounters, loot and other interesting things, the rooms too can contain multiple items and enemy groups, and over time, fighting can build up stress in the group, and as wounds pile up and the group gets taxed, so too does their minds. That's when the stress mechanic begins to take it's toll, eventually as the minds of the adventurers begin to fracture, you'll find they get more... talkative, and less co-operative. Sometimes they'll act on their own, sometimes they'll pass their turn, sometimes they'll refuse healing. It adds a random factor into proceedings that can make the difference between life and death, and combined with the death's door mechanic, can create some genuinely tense and hair raising fights. In this game, death is permanent, and boy will you go through adventurers, even getting one to level -3- is considered a feat in itself, most will die before they even see level 2 or even level 1, and the graveyard will likely be full to bursting within a few months. This is not a game to play if you are expecting to develop long lasting relationships with a lot of heroes, you may get to preserve a select few over time, but most will be as moths to the flame. Thankfully the cart comes weekly, loaded with fresh meat for the grinder, and recruitment is free, so that's nice!The glory of good design and sound...The art style is -glorious-, and the sound and overall design back this up, creating a genuine Tabletop RPG feel that perhaps could only be provided for by a computer, though if there ever was a proper pen and paper version of this game created, I could imagine as a first edition, it'd sell amazingly well. It has all the ingredients for a fantastic atmosphere, and a great evening in, much like a great night with Dungeons and Dragons. The cherry on the cake is the narrator, who lends a thick, grim air to proceedings, and even when things go well, seems to live to take what little hope you have, and smother it in a layer of soot and grime.Did I say this game is grim and contained adult themes? Oh it does. Much flagellation and deviancy await, along with unspeakable horrors that will cause many an adventurer's mind to turn in on itself. There is a but...It very, very nearly got the ""Essential"" badge, but then I got to the end...The endgame however, pulls the most mighty of penile moves. A hardcoded debuff called ""Never again"" applies a ban to heroes that enter the Darkest Dungeon, preventing them from returning. This forcibly extends the playtime of the game by forcing you to grind out a minimum of four complete teams, depending on how your parties have evolved, this may take you significantly longer than you expect. There's very little reason for this other than to pad out the game and to prevent you from blasting the Dungeon with your ""A-team"", but nonetheless, here we are. A lot of needless grind put into the game simply to stop you from finishing the game when the time is right.This turns the game from being fun, to being frustrating. All the work you do up to the Darkest Dungeon gets thrown in your face and you wind up staring down the barrels of long trudge after long trudge. A ceaseless grind that simply exists to make you stick your face in the dirt.I'm sorry, but that's no longer ""fun"". As it stands, it's not fixable either by users. I looked.For this very reason, this game loses it's positive Early Access rating from me, and gains a negative rating, with a final verdict that's much less positive in it's standing.To be clear - ""Never Again"" is the core problem - It's hardcoded - It cannot be modded out, it bans characters from the Darkest Dungeon, meaning you CANNOT re-use them in the Darkest Dungeon again, period. If they complete a Darkest Dungeon map, they become unusable, if they fail, they die. Either way, they're scrapped. That's the issue at hand here. Make sure you are entirely informed of this issue before commenting.Verdict : Wishlist, and pick up on sale, worth considering if you're a fan of -hard- RPG games.Writer and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

								It's fun untill the grind effect kicks in. Which is sooner than it should be. When the grind is mixed up with RNG that is obviously not in your favor to create the illusion of challange it becomes a different kind of grind a grind that can prolong itself whenever it wants.

Early Access Review
 Art and Atmophere Atmosphere of the game is amazing, and the art is very well done. I absolutely adore the camping mechanic in this game. It just oozes personality. Easily my favourite part of the game. In fact, there is a huge amount of tension in trying to keep your party members alive and sane. The stress mechanic is brilliant and adds a lot to the feeling of the game. The Strategic Gameplay The problems with darkest dungeon isn't that its a roguelike with crushing RNG; its the same with the other games of the same genre. The problem is that its is a very grindable rougelike.To make sure your heros have the best equipment and ability available, you will have to upgrade your town with heirlooms. To upgrade your town, you have to find heirlooms in dungeons. To get heirlooms without jeopordizing your best characters, you'll run low level dungeons, repeatedly.There is no check to this. In fact the game encourages you to do this with the tiered dungeon system. Your hero too high level? Well then it can't participate in lower level dungeons, you get this new harder dungeon! Don't have other heroes of the same level, well then you are either going to go into that dungeon disadvantaged (and lose hours of work when they die) or going to have to grind other heroes up before you can use the high level one.Because of this, the tension of the early game completely evaporates when you get to middle and late game. There is absolutely no incentive to push for higher level dungeons until you are completely geared due to perma death and the amount of time needed to reach that point. There is no timed mechanic like in XCOM or FTL that causes you to continue pushing forward. The Tactical Gameplay A huge part of the tactical gameplay depends on party composition. Everyone fights in a line and your available attacks depends on where you are at in the line. I find myself thinking about optimal party lineups well until the end of the game, so well done there. Dungeon Crawling Very uninspired. You move around in rooms and encounter monsters. You can find curios around which spices things up at the begining until you figure how they work. Traps basically just does damage to you. Recommendation Only get if you want to support to support the developers in making this game. I see a lot of potential for this game, but at the moment, the game is just not all there.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game, till they decided we had too much fun. Now u can almost only get negative stats on your heroes. Was fun before, cant recommend it any longer, havent played it after the Devs ruined the game.Details:First it was a real fun game, where you had to grind your way through with stressed out, ill and kleptomanic heroes. Even the the items you got always had a negative impact as well. So it really took time to somehow protect your most beloved hereos through the dungeons and get family heirlooms now and then to finally upgrade your buildings. Slowly but steadily you would get one or two heroes to the next level without them having 10 different negative effects at once, making them unplayable. Then you finally upgraded the armory and you would spend hours to get enough money to get your top group of heroes new weapons.Combine this with completely different hero classes that all have their unique purposes and u had a hell of a fun game. At least for me as a RPG fan by heart. Now, what changed: First, they limited the positive quirks each and every hero can have to 5, which means, that from my best heroes 70% of their positive stats just vanished. It really takes time to build a strong hero in the game and the quirks are the only way to improve them once they got a top weapon and armor. So now it just doesn't make fun anymore playing your best heroes, because you will hit the top ceiling and that's it.Moreover they didn't limit the negative quirks. While u can't make your heroes better, they will become worse and worse if you don't pay hefty gold for it. And finally they installed a corpse system which makes absolutely zero sense at all. A 8 HP monster  leaves a 15hp corpse behind (WTF?!) which just blocks your way from attacking the other monsters (which still can attack you) and just prolongs fights for no reason. Given the fact that you can't boost your hereos anymore and regarding the dragging fights with the corpses I can't recommend the game anymore.Edit: The negative quirks are limited to 5 now. Still, no more fun till the remove the limit of the positive ones again.			"

Early Access Review
								Up until just recently I would have reccomended this game to everyone. However, not long ago they implimented a new patch that seems to effect a great deal of game balance (in the monster's favour). The game, which was already incredibly challenging and unforgiving, became nearly impossibly challenging. My team is surprised more often (even in bright torchlight), critted (what seems like constantly), already debilitative mental conditions have been separated into mental and physical ailments (and then allow those to compound and get harder to remove), and even the damage of the monsters seems to have increased. Some characters (like the occultist) have had their debuffs nerfed and have become an almost useless class compared to others now. What used to be a game that made you strategize your supplies and fight a war of attrition now kills off your (well prepared and equipped) characters before you're even through a second room sometimes. Bosses aren't the only major threat now, a group of mini-bosses seems to be able to wipe you out at any time. It's now nearly impossible to keep a skilled team, and thus you're frequently forced to train up low level characters to replace the ones you've lost. Then, only to lose them again without being able to explore the deeper levels. The difficulty curve ramps up way too much, way too fast. Also, it's hard to raise character levels because you only seem to get advancement experience if you complete a dungeon (which is often VERY difficult now), so even if you complete 90% of the dungeon and are forced to abandon it because most of your characters have been wiped out, the remaining characters recieve ... nothing, no experience at all. You only get more trinkets and money (and lots of it, but it doesn't really help you out much).They've also added this strange corpse mechanic, which seems kind of interesting, but doesn't really function logically. Sometimes you have to ""kill"" the corpses of the enemy that you've already killed just to get at the back row of enemies, yet your own characters never leave corpses, and most enemies can hit all ranks of your characters anyway. All that said, I have hope that this patch will be modified to make the game playable again. It was honestly one of my favourite games that I've ever played before, but I'm going to bench it for now in the hopes that it will become a more balanced game in the updates (and release) still to come. Fingers crossed!!!			"

												There's no way to give this game a fair review anymore.The fanbase for Darkest Dungeon is split so far down the middle that we have two completely extreme views: people praising and loving the game and disregarding any and all faults; then there's the other side with people saying that the game is an utter time waster with no fun, a slew of bugs, and all sorts of other complaints.I'm sure what I have to say at this point will matter to no one. But I'll do my best review it based on my own thoughts, rather than the opinions I have read elsewhere online. But I will delve into those later.I'm not the smartest guy. I'll be up front about that. I rarely go into games and know exactly what things that can be exploited, what must be done to make this or that easy, find loopholes or redundencies. I don't have the patience to go through each and every stat effect and percentage and chart it all out. Its just not something I have interest in or time to do. With this in mind, you can probably tell that I don't actually look into the RNG all that much.Critical hits are critical hits. Misses are misses. I never noticed if one side had an advantage over the other. I never noticed the effects that torches had on the battlefield cuz I always had one lit. I never noticed if one side got more buffs or had resistances or any of that. I just played the game how I thought it should be played.Here is where my biggest issue with the entirety of the game comes into play: the inability to play how you want. Now, I get it. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be difficult. its meant to put you into a corner, but its boot to your jaw and see how you can escape it. Here's a few things I don't like, however, about said difficulty - with personal examples from the game:-battle mechanics, on a defensive side. What do I mean by this? Well, once I was playing through a dungeon. I had a tough time with a wave, and wanted to go on the defensive for a bit, get some health back real quick before I proceeded to the next battle. So I kept an enemy in stunlock/debuff while I used my healer to get my fighters back into a better spot. With this one enemy left completely weak and vulnerable, it seemed like a viable strategy in order to get my footing back and continue strong. But NOPE. Literally two turns after trying this strategy, two enemies randomly come out of the woodwork. Because this game has to be SO HARD that it just throws more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at you.What this said to me was this: no, player, you do not play how you want to play. You cannot use the strategies YOU want to use. You play by OUR rules. You go fast, and kill fast, and if your players die in the process, well TOO BAD. Some players may see this as just another part of the challenge, but I see this as a fundamental flaw: you are not allowed to play this game how you see fit. You are not allowed to go on the defensive, take advantage of a situation and play to your strenghts. You can ONLY play how the devs WANT you to play. And that, to me, isn't fun. It is frustrating. Its tedious. And it lead to me shutting off the game and not playing it ever again.-escaping battle. This is a shorter one, but still a grievance with the game I personally have. So, when you escape battle, you are given a consequence of stress. I saw this as a fair trade. If things are going badly, you have the choice to take the stress in order to fight another day.This brilliant idea was ruined by the timeworn BS cliche of: not being able to escape. So not only do I have to accept the consequence of a massive stress boost when I actually manage to get out of battle, I have to risk my party members in an entire turn that could possibly get any of them killed if the escape attempt fails. That. Is not. Ok. Take one punishment, don't put them all in one basket. And don't give me the ""git gud"" crap everyone else does - we all enter bad situations in this game that we need to escape once in a while. RNG makes it so. Don't corner the player by making them worry if they'll escape or not, and if you want to keep that, fine, but get rid of the added stress issue then. Pick one poison and stick to it.-the stress meter. Now, I have to say, this was actually one of the reasons I was fascinated with this game at first. It seemed like such a neat mechanic that could actually end up with GOOD results, and not bad.Out of the countless times my characters reached full stress, only twice has something heroic happened. This should be a 50/50 chance, and not a 10/90, imo. You're already threatening death with the stress waves (which apparently wasn't in the original EA version), why make it even more challenging by not giving the player a fair shot at feeling amazing? Because you're too busy making it feel frustratingly difficult? That's why? Eh.Now with all that said, you'd think I HATE this game. I'm just another one of those jerks on the internet saying its the worst thing ever. But here's the thing: I don't. With all that said, I still love so much about the game:-The art style. So refreshingly simple, yet bold and interesting. -The music. Tense, adds to the atmosphere, and well composed.-The designs. Goes hand in hand with art style, in a way, but every class looks very unique and stands out in their own way.-the voice acting. Top ♥♥♥♥ing notch, hard not to love. Complex dialogue makes this game feel intelligent (even if the narrator isn't saying anything most of the time other than ""this♥♥♥♥♥♥sucks sometimes yo"").-fascinating game mechanics, like stress and perks/negatives. While some people abbhore some of these things, I am impressed with how many different things your characters can get, both positive and negative.There are things to LOVE about this game. There are things to HATE about this game. I am left torn down the middle. I want to like this game. I want to get swept up inside of it, lose myself for hours on end from dungeon to dungeon but...every time a risky dungeon is presented, I don't want to take it because I fear I have to start from scratch from a different warrior. The fact that people think that the death of your character is a fair punishment just isn't true. All those hours and money into these particular characters you want to crusade through dungeons with are put out within minutes due to bad RNG, bad situations, or just bad planning or poor decision making.And even if it WAS all my fault, even if it WAS misdirection or poor planning or player error or...whatever, even with all that in mind and the fact that my character(s) died, wasting hours of my life because of simple mistakes, is that ok? Does it make it a fun challenge? Or a slog?The answer is that there is no answer. This game is dependent on what you like as a gamer, and as a person, really. You're not a bad person for liking this game. And you're not bad for disliking it. I see the points of people on both sides. And I think everyone should just calm the ♥♥♥♥ down and learn to deal with other people's opinions on the internet (although that probably won't ever happen, even though it should).As for me...this game is interesting. Its stressful. Its tactful. Its challenging. But, in spite of things, it just isn't fun to me. A lot of times it felt like a chore. To the point where I no longer wanted to play. Take that for what its worth.			"

Early Access Review
								As a fan of H.P. Lovercraft, Roguelikes, and difficult RPGs, I might be just a little bit biased when it comes to this title, but if you are a fan of any of those, (Or maybe even if you aren't) Darkest Dungeon might be worth a look.Pros:+Good sound/art design+Difficult (With the option to toggle the more unforgiving features)+Good balance between permadeath and progress; losing characters is extremely painful, but expectedCons:-Extremely unforgiving (Options exist to toggle some of these. Looking at you, Heart Attacks)-Gameplay is somewhat repetetive (But, that's a problem with the genre)-Gameplay flow forces you to have multiple parties, can't focus on just your favoriteWith the overview out of the way, let's a get more indepth.Graphics/sound: 8/10Surprisingly enough, this game's art style and sound direction does a lot for it. The sense of gloom as your torch fizzles, and finally snuffs out, with an accoimpanied change in music drives home the tension and risk. The periodical quips from the narrator give the game a feel akin to a novel or short story, further deepening the illusion of playing a Cosmic Horror Story. It all blends together for a unique experience, fully immersed in gothic, Lovecraftian anxiety and despair.Gameplay: 6/10If you're wondering why the gameplay is recieving a low score, it's not because it's not a fun game. On the contrary, battles are always tense, the difficulty is spot on, every run just beyond your characters level of ability, meaning greed or complacency can always cost you dearly. Battle system is smootyh and refined, and the mechanics reinforce the tension that is the core of the gameplay experience. My main complaint is the quirk/stress system. On one hand, it is a core mechanic that sets this game apart. After each dungeon run, your characters have a chance to develop  a positive trait, negative trait, or disease, which alters their stats, resistances, or what facilities they can use in town to lower their stress.On the other hand, characters must sit out a battle to have their stress lowered, remove a quirk, or cure a disease, (There are a few exc eptions, but this is the genberal rule) resulting in a gameplay cycle of train team A, lower team A's stress, cure team A's diseases, train team A again. It makes sense mechanically, given the constant, expected flow of new members in your roster, but results in it taking 3 times as long to ready a tream for a boss fight. (And you had best be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ready because you WILL wipe if you aren't extremely well prepared.)Tone/playability/immersion: 10/10All things considered, the game has a lot going for it. It's difficult, but fair, it controls well, it has a strong tone and theme throughout, with the gameplay and mechanics reinforcing said themes. It's not just an RPG where you explore a mansion that is the sight of an Eldritch portal, it has the exact same feel as reading, say, The Dunwhich Horror. And wether you're looking for a game that will draw you in like many games can't, or simply a game that will test your tactical mettle against ever-increasingly difficult foes, Darkest Dungeon hits all the right notes, offering something truly interesting and memorable amidst a growing pool of games that draw on Lovecraft lore but miss the ""feel"" of his works entirely.

Early Access Review
								It is my 20th hour trapped here, among Boschian palettes with darks as thick as bitumen and horrors as vivid as Fuselian nightmares. Gothic Romanticism in pixellated form, Pinkham-Ryderesque landscapes, the hopelessness of Poe's ""Eternal sleep"" outlined in a staunch ""et in Arcadia ego"" design philosophy. Did I mention that you will die, almost certainly?Darkest Dungeon is that, and more. For an early access, the game feels near-complete despite minor flaws. It is very nearly a Beta and it remains very playable despite its evident difficulty. Encompassing some classic RPG mechanics made of luck and skill, the game knows how to draw you in right from the beginning; June's booming 'basso profundo' cries desperation, speaks of matters unseen, Lovecraftian tales.Play this game, buy it. This kind of thing restores faith in Early Access.Here is some gameplay:

								I used to recommend this game, however, there was a recent update, which altered the way in which combat works. In my opinion this was a terrible change. Instead of actually having a chance with a solid team when you level up the game is just forever frustrating. Deathblows seem more common, enemy crits ALWAYS happen and doing any kind of comp that deals with darkness well (mooncloak, moonring, etc.) is just not viable. Surprise is also much more common (even with 75%+ torch.) At this point the game doesnt progress well, devs dont know how to deal with a difficulty curve, its that obvious. Sorry.Before patch game was: 7.5/10 After patch game is: 5.75/10			"

								It's a cute game, but once you get the hang of it you realize it's 100% a grind. You just keep doing the same thing over and over taking baby steps towards progress. After almost 100 turns, my city is doing well, but i'm so bored by griding to finish the upgrades and to get more cheap trinkets to sell for hero upgrades. Would be a great game if they could add some more exciement to it after so much of the same.			"

												TL:DR - I don't feel rewarded for the effort that I put into the game. I am disappointed to say the least.So after beating the game I stand by my points since early access. The game just isn't rewarding to play with how much grind and garbage you gotta slog through to reach the end and then it hardly feels like you are overcoming a great evil so much as it feels like you just have to exploit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to pass. I don't feel like I was truly challenged, just constantly had someone trying to cheat me. I genuinely feel like all the positive ratings for the game are a result of the 'git gud' crowd who themselves probably suck. A challenge to overcome is what I live for. Darkest dungeon was less a challenge and more a gamble.Honestly I was hoping the ending dungeons and ending itself would be rewarding, but instead I feel pretty empty. I guess that's the way you feel when you are so mad at a game you are just trying to find something good in it and you just don't.Darkest dungeon is playing a poker game and going all in. You play your hand, clench your teeth and/or buttcheeks, and then you win and get a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of money. After getting home you realize that you spent a crap load of money on cheetos and soda and also you need to spend some money on releiving stress from the ordeal (for some reason) and end up with just enough money in the positives to buy a soda and enough money left over to do it all again. Not very satisfying.As of July 15th I've pretty much given up on the game. There's no point in trying to help anymore. I don't really care that all my saves were deleted. I don't really care that they nerfed the crap outta camping buffs. I don't care heavily that crusader protection is useless. I'm not crying after they ruined any reason to play in the dark. I don't fully care that enemies hit extra hard and do extra stress. I don't really find it awful that being marked is considered a means of protection. I'm not upset that my highwayman was killed in the tutorial. I'm not offended that when the game crashes some buffs/debuffs are gone from characters. It doesn't bother me that you can just Alt + f4 when one of your guys gets deathblowed to avoid it. I'm not sad that the game gets kinda monotonous after a bit and I can let the fact they ignore teaching boss mechanics slide.But the fact you can lose a party member from 100% to 0% just by encountering spiders in the first mission and it's been this way since I started playing? No. Screw this game.In the end, what really matters is your own opinion. The thing is that in my opinion I was not satisfied with the end results of the game.			"

												What greater satisfaction you need than hitting your opponent right after weakening them with a terrible finishing blow?What greater frustration can you suffer than seeing the enemies dog-pile on a single hero, rendering it useless in a single turn?Make no mistake, this game can be incredibly frustrating at times. The difficulty constantly ramps up, as you try to keep your heroes health and stress in check. Enemies poison you and leave you bleeding with ease, and a bad turn can easily screw an entire expedition, and cost you good men.But as soon as you get in rhythm. As soon as you understand how to manage your items, what characters have the better synergy together, how to position them in a fight, and how to counter the monstrosities you find in every mission, what once seemed unfair becomes just a challenge. A hard challenge, that you can still loose; but when you do, you learn to just arm another party and send them to prevail where the others failed.The game makes it's own the despair and hopelessness of the Lovecraft mythos both in aesthetic and theming, while adding a splash of cinical and dark sense of humor.You are not here to become an immortal, unstoppable force of nature, you are here to try and survive an onslaught of horror way beyond what men can really handle. And the game will make sure you feel that in every corner, just as the men you send to fight, and leave the dungeons more and more psychologically crippled every time they go out. But so what? We are all doomed anyway, right?If you like turn-based RPGs, Rogue-like games, or just challenging experiences, this one is worth a shot.			"

												A mutant pig vomited on my character and gave them tapeworm. This made them eat more than their share of food and caused my party to starve at a camp. This caused one of them to become so stressed they abused someone else until they had a heart attack.I had to send the rest back to town and buy them alcohol, women and let one flagellate themself so they felt better. I get a bill the next day from the brothel saying the Occultist can't come back because of his deviant fetishes. I sent him home; no chill, no dungeons.11/10 ruin your life.EDIT / ACTUAL REVIEW:I have spent some time reading other reviews of Darkest Dungeon and here's some real talk addressing the most common complaints:1) ""RNG PLEASE!!!"" - Yes this game contains RNG, why not learn to play around that? Sometimes your Leper will be crit from 100-0 by a fat man in chainmail. Your move Crusader. Man, if only King Arthur, 1st of His Name, Biggest of Jockstraps, Defender of the Realm and Slayer of Harems had thought to bring a band-aid to get Ol' Compost the Leper off of death's door then he might have lived. Oh wait he totally has that skill. You just didn't equip it because biggest sword is best sword. Big RNG crits sink happy little adventurer's ships, so run a very low level heal skill on 3/4 characters and a stun on 1 to keep people alive when terrible things happen. The Leper lives, and you don't have to go home and tell his, ah, remaining foot that the rest won't be coming home. You do get better at the game, you are rewarded by learning from your mistakes. I've run 20-30 level 5 long dungeons in a row without losing a character. To those who say ""TOO MUCH RNG, NOT EVEN A GAME"": proper prior planning prevents♥♥♥♥♥♥(urine) poor performance.2) ""TRINKETS ARE TRASH, NO REWARD!!!"" - Trinkets have upsides and downsides, why not combine two trinkets? *brainexplosion*e.g. +30% heals, +20% stress. ""THIS IS TERRIBLE I'LL DIE OF STRESS"" says big bubba. Oh wait what's this? A trinket that says -20% stress? What if we added those two together and now suddenly we have a dirty dirty healer at the back of the team that'll poke your organs back in to roughly where they should be. Legendary trinkets are legendary, proper use of them and being able to manage the drawbacks make them very powerful. There's no free hand outs, use strategy and planning to win dungeons.3) ""THE GAME IS TOO MUCH OF A GRIND!!!"" - If you're taking forever to finish the game, then you're losing too many people. The game is easily finishable within 60 hours. True end game dungeoning can take a long time, because of certain factors which come into effect. However at the end game there are catch-up mechanics to speed up levelling and get you where you need to be fast. Procedurally generated rogue-like games such as this, you are essentially doing one dungeon after another. The only time it becomes monotonous is when you can play the game safely every time, and by then you should be finishing the end game bosses, which have their own surprises.I wholly recommend this game to people who are fine with:1) Difficult gameplay, where consequences are real.2) Brothels3) Tentacles			"

								I don't typically bother writing reviews, but this one has dragged me out of seclusion just to do so.For a game toting the ""Early Access"" flag, it feels more polished and complete of an experience than most release PC titles I played last year.  The game is stunning not only visually but also in terms of atmosphere and audio design.  Production values are fantastic across the board.The game play is solid, tactical, and unrelentingly difficult.  While a heavy dose of the game revolves around RNG, it never feels like the RNG is straight-up screwing you in quite the same way that XCOM does.  Even the most horrific of situations can often be salvaged with a lot of thought and a little luck.This is not a game for the weak of heart.  The challenge level is high and the possibility of winding up in a state where you are basically doomed to failure is very real.  Forethought and planning are required in order to keep the dungeon-ball rolling safely.If you have a taste for rogue-likes, an interest in the unique, and the idea of a 2D crossbreed of Dark Souls and XCOM sounds magical to you, then you may have just found your game.  May your torches be ever bright.  Try not to die too fast.			"

								This is true story(well in game wise anyway)Its been two months now and despite our attempts to purge the evil in the estate more monsters seem to replace them. there are 16 of us now and only one of the orginal 4 that arrived here have survived and she refuses to go on missions lower then a lvl 3. The owner has finally called us today to hunt down a kill the wizard hag some canibilistic witch. He sent me, a occultist (who was a little wet behind the ears), a plage doctor (slightly more experianced but barely lvl 2), and a bounty hunter whom i worked with before and I the Hellion. We marched through the dungeon and the monsters proved no match for us but when we finally found the hag......that's were things turned for the worst. She grabbed the bounty hunter and thew in the pot, he begged for us to break it open but the hag kept pummeling us until we were all on death's door. The bounty hunter couldn't take it, we all couldn't after we've all seen and felt what its like in the infernal cauldren of hers, and he slew himself gibbering madly as his life blood soaked the dirt covered floor. The occulist sobbed and wailed until he was too silenced by the hag. The doctor stood and stared still her entrails were ripped from her and eaten while the witch chackled with guts running down her mouth. I was alone now, the witch's eye glowed with victory but with the last of my stregth i cleaved her head from her shoulders. I look of shock spread across her face before she was taken to the abyss. I returned to town battred and broken but alive. The owner told me after my stay in the sanaterium that i was hesterical when i arrived but sent me to the tavarn to drink my pain away. I'm better now, stronger but as i see the new recriuts that come in i can't help but feel despair, most of them die but there will always before to replae them always someone foolsih enough to search for fame and fortune in......the darkest dungeon.

								I purchased this game many months ago and quite enjoyed playing it. It was challenging, even daunting at times, but I still a lot of fun. I was really getting into testing different team set ups and planning mob strategies. I happily devoted a whole weekend to it. Then, life happened, and I set the game down for a while. This past weekend I was up for some Graveyard shifts and decided to pick up the game again. Excited, I opted to start a game from scratch and relive the whole experiance. ...But, I couldn't even get an inital team off the ground. I could tell some dynamics had changed, but still, I felt like I was getting unreasonably bad luck. I remembered being able to use thoughtful actions and muddle through most of the dungeons early on. Yes, you would lose someone to stress or death occasionally, but that was to be expected. This time, however, was something else. I tried the first 4-person dungeon 5 different times: I could NOT make it through. I would be slammed again and again by crits, only to have my characters miss for rounds at a time. Not to mention that the listed attack destinations no longer seem to work with mob groups of less than 4. I couldn't believe I was unable to eek through even the first dungeon with more than a single person. Not only was this not fun, I was actually getting angry. I understand the premise of this game, I truly do. But the most recent patches have removed or squahsed all of the things I enjoyed about this game.  I would honestly take an earlier, unpolished version of this game. That game was fun.			"

												I've played over 60 hours of this game and as much as I would love to give this a great review, I just can't do it.This game can truly be one of the greats...Great voice acting, great visual artwork, great story, great dungeon crawling experience. There's just one thing this game is lacking...the very essence of gaming that all rpgers  especially cherish--SOME TYPE OF GOD DAMN REWARD SYSTEM FOR SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS PLAYING THE GAME!!!This game has amazing potential, but the ""reward"" for playing and progressing through the game are almost non-existent. All of the equipable items are almost worthless. Even the legendary items are pretty much worthless! I mean, how do you create a game where the most powerful items have so many drawbacks for equiping them that you might as well just dungeon crawl NAKED. Also, one more thing, this game is so RNG heavy that bad luck alone can wipe your whole party and set you back on hours of gameplay. It's just complete randomness and chaos. Not even realisticly random. more like oppressive, sadistic, everything-is-against-you random where you have no control of anything because the combat system is rediculously imbalanced and the tide of battle can shift at any given time no matter how good a player you are.The hours of frustration playing this game outweigh the good times, which is unfortunate. These developers need to wake up and make some ""adjustments"". Don't buy this game unless you want to pull your hair out. "

								The most annoying thing---and there are a lot of annoying things---is the grind. It's a beautiful game with a lot of challenges, but it is punishing (sometimes unnecessarily), unforgiving, and brutal. You never have enough money, and you always need money. Want to go on an adventure? Spend 3,000+ on supplies, minimum, and get 6,000 back! Profit! Except your 4 characters have 2,000 worth of stress, mental infirmities, and diseases---EACH. So scrimp and save and try to make a team capable of ranking up. Sacrifice inexperienced teams to scrape together a little bit of extra gold. That can work---unless your team dies. Which it does. All the time. Start over! And over! Do you like this team? It's DEAD! Start over. Can you get better? Sure. Trial and error, or get lucky, or spend time researching, I suppose. That might be fun. For somebody. Not me. Too much work, not enough reward.			"

Early Access Review
								I don't usually write reviews. I played this at my sister's for a solid two weeks and thought it was an awesome game. But since the update they did in mid-July, the game is just horrible. Alas that I cannot return it and now am stuck with it. Since I *thought* I was buying a different game than what I got, I really should be able to return it. . .The NEW version of the game is so ridiculous that not only do you have to kill the monsters, but then you have to kill their CORPSES. Seriously? In what universe does a person have to kill a corpse? So while you're clearing the damn corpses, the monsters continue to hit you for oh, 30-50 stress points (no joking, you can actually get that much stress from a single hit). I loved in the original game that my toons died, and not infrequently. Now they die all the time, of course, but what's annoying is that there is no adjustment to be made to prevent it even slightly. It doesn't matter what your torch is anymore. Low torch does not up crits at all (I went through an entire dungeon with about 2 crits at low torch), you get surprised at high torch >50% of the time, etc. The strategy of the game was replaced with luck. SO glad I wasted $20 on this because the developers decided to destroy a perfectly good game. SO glad.			"

								I love hard games, so naturally I thought I would love this game based on reviews. As it turns out, this game is hard...while managing to NOT be fun. It's literally hard for the sake of being hard. It throws completely stupid mechanics at you like incredibly high stress levels and enemy corpses that you must kill AFTER killing the enemy in order to attack the next enemy. It's just a lazy mechanic thrown in just for the sake of making something hard. Flappy bird is hard, XCOM on ironman is hard, Dark Souls is hard, this game is brutal and boring.			"

								Nobody cares about how the members of a party of heroes sent down to investigate a dungeon feel about it. It's not an easy job, you know?; descending into darkness, vanquishing monsters, keeping the torches lit in the damp and drafty corridors... Nobody's SJW-ing for these guys and they kinda deserve it, seeing how they are there at their post in every other game you are playing. Well, no more of this, Darkest Dungeon cares about them and tries to make YOU care as well. It's the most psychologically accurate dungeon raiding simulator to date, hands down, guaranteed to make you aware of their feelings! Can you send another team down there never knowing what they feel like? Can you feel good about yourself knowing their rights are not properly enforced? SJW-ing for all dungeon crawlers everywhere! These guys deserve rights, don't wait for them to become a dying breed, do something about it right now!			"

Early Access Review
								I bought the game some time ago and had some fun with it. I played it when it was a casual dungeon crawler with innovative mechanics and cool art. I took a break to let early access take care of content addition and expansion, reading patch notes about new classes and anticipating making a new run at it with tons of new toys to play with.The mechanics and art remain, but the casual dungeon-crawler has turned into a turgid min-max fest that is much too harsh on all but the most dedicated stat junkies. Corpses completely change party-building mechanics and lengthen fights to an annoying degree. Heart attacks are BS. The game feels much harder than it should be.I feel like the game doesn't even want you to play it and is dedicated to punishing you if you do. It's difficult for me to recommend this game and I'm sad about that. It used to be a fun romp, now it's a slow, plodding stumble through a too-harsh environment.Maybe the devs will clue in and create difficulty levels to appease the whining min-maxers while allowing the rest of gamers to still have a fun experience. Until then, farewell.			"

								Edit - yes the devs have opened up the option to get back to where they were, but that is of little interest to me. In fact, it just furthers the idea of how they are heading in this game's development. The fact they think they can keep 2 separate ways of playing the game in tandem up until release just shows how little progress can possibly be made with the already flawed game mechanics.A few months ago this would have been a guarenteed thumbs up. Now that is not the case, though bear in mind the core game is still very capable, it's just not something I can recommend with the recent and terrible update that changed the combat mechanics.In short, wait until full release to see whether the devs realized they screwed up.

								While initially a great game, it seens with each patch all the good new changes don't make it a better game. Almost impossible to get the characters you want to create a party you want to play. With corpses, the Occultist is a must - goodby to the Vestal. Permanent negative quirks, etc that happen whenever. I could see a permanent negative quirk if stress at/over 100, but.. Once again, good ideals in the patch, but good ideals don't always make for a better game.			"

								Darkest Dungeon is a beautiful mess.Outwardly, it has all the makings of a successful title: gorgeous artistic direction, an engaging score, a delightfully Lovecraftian atmosphere. All of this contributes to a promise of something deep, dark, and deliciously engrossing.The savvy player will go in expecting a challenge. After all, the game stands at a crossroads of several historically demanding genres: RPG, survival, roguelike. These genres are loved for many reasons, but paramount in my book is that they offer a deep, precisely crafted challenge. This is where Darkest Dungeon fails, utterly.The game offers nothing more than an illusion of depth. Class variety, skill selection, inventory management, character-building, team-building... I could go on. DD has it all. But never before has such a plethora of choices been so meaningless.Sink as many hours as you like. There are no real lessons to be learned, no real experience to gain. You will enter the dungeon as a trembling, stupid peon, and come away very much the same. Ultimately, there is only one way to play this game: grind, and grind some more.Sadly, one of the major selling points of DD, its character ""stress"" system, is the very centerpiece of this problem. Stress is unavoidable and inherently boring. Curing it is slow, expensive, and braindead: roll new characters and slog through low-level dungeons to earn money. Rinse, repeat.This pattern replays itself through just about every facet of DD. There are no revelations or breakthroughs; just slow, monotonic progress and the looming shadow of boredom. Increasingly, the game's once-charming aesthetic becomes a reminder of what awaits: joylessness.DD's early access status provides a glimmer of hope. There is still time for the developers to overhaul the game's mechanics and rescue an otherwise promising title. Give us something more to look forward to than a chronic nosedive.			"

Early Access Review
								The following story is based on real events:There was four of you when you first set foot into this cursed dungeon - cleric, warrior, plague doctor and you, a simple rogue.You thought that'd be a simple mission - go in, find some treasure, go out. Oh, how wrong you was!It wasn't bad enough when you ran out of torches, no, no. First real problems started when plague doctor got trapped inside the iron maiden. It took almost an hour to get him out. We wasn't fast enough - poor sod earned claustrophobia and was stressed as hell by the time we got him out.He couldn't get a hold of himself in the next battle - he just.. broke. Started screaming in fear, refused to attack enemies (they was just some stupid maggots!), tried hiding behind us while rambling things that none of us wanted to hear..That was too much for our cleric. All of a sudden she turned paranoid. She was refusing everything - even healing us!That’s when the warrior died because of the critical blow for one of the maggots. Miserable death. After his death both cleric and plague doctor lost it completely. Enemy finished them off without too much of a problem.Luckily for me though the enemy concentrated on those crazed fellas. I could easily pick each and every of those damned maggots one by one.And then I just ran. Ran as fast as I could. To hell with that dungeon, to hell with the loot. When I get back to town, I’m just going to spend next weeks drinking through all my money in tavern.. And I will never go back to that Darkest Dungeon ever again.(Two weeks later rogue went into another dungeon with a different party. He caught blight and died while fighting a necromancer)--If you need more convincing, I'm not even sure what to offer here. The game is fantastic.Aside from a couple of crashes (no progress was lost, kudos for good work here) - it runs perfectly well too.More detailed look on gameplay and underlying mechanics in the video:

								Actually it is not a bad game but the frustration level is so high that I just rage- deinstalled the game.If you like round based strategy as well as (limited) party and base management in a goth medieval setting you can give it a try. But be warned: 30-40 % of the game is just randomized luck. I lost a very high level character due to 3consecutive critical hits of a monster with a crit chance of 10 % !!! Such things happen quite often and destroythe impression of a fair game as well as frustrate a lot.Overall I give this game 6 of 10 points. "

												I wanted to give this game a stellar recommendation. But given what this game has become, I cannot do so in good conscience.When I first bought this game back when it was in early access, it was something really interesting. An incredible aesthetic matched by a gameplay that married the best aspects of RPGs and Dungeon Crawlers, with its own twists and turns that made for a wholly engrossing experience. It wasn't perfect, but it was challenging, enjoyable, and most importantly of all, rewarding. All the way through the development process, I'd periodically start up a new run to see what sort of changes had been made, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. The difficult of the game got ramped up, but so too did the classes themselves. The fights were both terrifying and exhilarating, and taking down a boss felt like a triumphant moment. The new classes were interesting, and the quirks system made them feel like more than just a grouping of mechanics. I didn't mind the introduction of heart attacks and corpses, as they forced me to keep a closer eye on my stress levels and put more thought into my party lineups. As Darkest Dungeon reached its final stage, the very same elements that made it so fun and enjoyable for me have become twisted into something that has turned the game into the exact opposite. Reaching Resolve level 5 and 6 used to be an accomplishment, a marker that these characters/heroes had faced overwhelming odds and achieved a greater state of being. You would face off against some truly powerful and terrifying enemies, but your characters were on par with that power and could exchange blow for blow. There was a balance, and even when the tide of battle turned against you there was still a chance that you could pull off a victory from the jaws of defeat. Now, the odds are stacked overwhelmingly against you. Don't even think about going into a higher level dungeon with even one of your characters not fully upgraded, as they will die. At first, I thought the sudden skyrocketing of my casualty rates were the result of me making a tactical error, but when I looked at play throughs online I found that people who were more or less equally skilled as I was were suffering from similar casualty rates, for similar reasons. I don't mind losing someone because of an error that I made, but losing it because the RNG decided 'they gonna die now' is strikes me as something that is blatantly unfair. Especially when in order to bring them up to the point where they can survive the upper level dungeons requires hours of joyless grinding for resolve and gold, and the fruits of those labors don't seem to have an impact on their overall survivability.In general, Darkest Dungeon does an extremely poor job of explaining the way different features work, or what to expect when going into a new location or facing off against a new type of boss. Which i don't necessarily mind per-say, but when the cost of failure are so high that they will undermine hours of work, then that becomes a problem. And don't even get me started on the final dungeon. There are so many design decisions (like rendering your characters illegible for future expeditions, to name one) that are some high grade cow manure, and exemplarly of just how un-fun the game has become.I guess I'm more disappointed than anything else. There are so many aspects of this game that I love, and that I'm sure other players who are thinking about buying this game will love too. The aesthetic of this game is absolutely phenomenal, the writing is superb, the gameplay is innovative, and there are some genuinely great features. But somewhere along the line, the game has become less about facing off against the eldritch horrors and pulling victory from the jaws of defeat, and more about not losing horribly. It has gone from ‘tough, but fair’ to ‘grueling and frustrating’.Edit:For those of you who are interested, I effectively did three runs of the game. The first I started back in March which went on for roughly 30 hours, in which time I'd completed all the available content. I did a second, much shorter one in mid July that lasted about 20 hours in which I only got about half way through bosses. I started a third one, intended to be my final run of the game, in late October, which took me 45 hours to reach about three-quarters of the way to the end game.This should help show just how much of a grind this game has become			"

												Just when I thought I was finished with gaming, this gem comes out.  In a gaming universe now littered with embarrassingly amateurish ""shovelware,""  insipid ""AAA"" titles that usually amount to little more than more of the same with minor tweaks (but with eye-bleeding super-realistic graphics that require mega-GPUs to get 25 fps - another sad trend as of late), and just plain scams where devs promise one thing, deliver another, and disappear into the ether with your cash, a game like Darkest Dungeon (DD) gives me hope that my once favorite hobby has some life in it yet.What is amazing is that DD treads a well-worn road.  At its heart, DD is just another ""roguelike"" dungeon crawler.  But what elevates DD to its own lofty pedestal is a simple question: would professional dungeon crawlers develop PTSD?  At first, you laugh at the idea.  But then you stop and think about it.  Given how your typical fantasy dungeon crawl not only involves the type of brutal combat that any modern soldier would understand, but also a host of horrors - such as demons, giant spiders, and other abominations- on top of THAT, the answer would seem to be: oh heck yeah.  I guess they really would!That is the heart of Darkest Dungeon.  Darkest Dungeon puts the player not just in charge of clearing dungeons, but also of managing the mental health of their assailed heroes.  In DD, the player must send teams of four adventurers (whom come from a nicely varied assortment of classes) to clear dungeons from around half a dozen thematic designs (ruins, warrens, etc.).  This part of the game is great fun.  Resembling a side-scroller, your adventurers, whom are brought to life with some wonderfully hand drawn artistry reminiscient of a Brothers Grimm fairytale, clear out a series of rooms and passages (randomly generated and populated with monsters, traps and loot, of course) in a dungeon of various sizes, some  so big that your team will need to camp inside a few times.  Such moments are a lot of fun as it involves its own unique gameplay of recuperation and campsite chatter.  Battle is handled in a wonderful turn-based fashion (love it; so glad to see devs getting away from click-fest RTS games) with both sides using their weapons and skills to strike each other down, something wonderfully enhanced by a narrator who comments on the action with a voice right out of, yes!,  a Grimm's fairytale.  But here is the important kicker: as your adventurers explore and battle their way through a dungeon, the game tracks stress points individually.  So, for example, if your man-at-arms suffers a critical hit at the hand of a foe, his stress level will go up, as might the stress of the other party members.  On the other hand, if he deals a devastating riposte, his stress might go down, and so on.  If stress accumulates to a certain degree, the adventurer might have a mental break.  It is here that the game begins to resemble Crusader Kings 2 in that each adventurer can accumulate a mix of up to a dozen vices and virtues that will affect their performance.  So, that man-at-arms who was almost killed might become a coward when he has his mental break, something that might debuff his stats or make him miss a turn.  Or, maybe he overcomes his fear and gets a virtue instead: he becomes heroic and urges his party to fight harder, reducing stress for all and buffing combat stats.  See how it works?  It is quite fun and adds a wonderful novelty to the game!  But be warned: if your adventurer becomes too stressed, he can actually die of a heartattack!  Speaking of heartattacks, that is what might happen to the gamer when he loses one of his star adventurers to permadeath.  Yeah, this game has that.  Personally, I love permadeath because nothing ruins a tale of adventuring heroism when the player can just ""save and restore.""  Face it: S&R is just immortality by another name.  How can there be true heroism if the hero is never truly at risk?  But that is just my two cents.  Be that as it may, this game has permadeath, so be prepared to lose some of your best players to the evil machninations of the ""random number generator"" that governs many aspects of this game.  If you hate such mechanics, than this game is not for you.  What happens when your adventurers leave a dungeon, assuming they survive?  Here, the game takes on an XCOM-like factor where base management comes into play.  In between dungeon crawls, the player can send his adventurers out with bags of gold to help them blow off steam in six different ways, from getting drunk, to praying at the abbey.  Of course, this takes these adventurers out of the game for at least a week - I say ""at least a week"" becayse random events occasionally trigger where, say, your knight gets drunk and wanders the town for two weeks in a state of inebriation!  LOL!  That actually happened to one of my adventurers.  Not only did he go AWOL for an extra week, be he lost the magic trinket I gave him!  Hence, the player needs to have a deep bench of adventurers to keep the gaming moving along, something that is not initially difficult as the local stage coach brings in a steady supply of new victi...er, adventurers.  In addition to managing the stress of your bench, you can also train new skills, upgrade armor and weapons, upgrade facilities, treat the mental and physical ailments your adventurers acquire in the darkest dungeons, and select the next adventure and get kitted out for it.    And that is pretty much the basics of the game in a nutshell.  Again, with the exception of the stress factor, nothing revolutionary.  But RedHook, with feedback from the community (this is EA done right!), applied so much thoughtfulness, attention to detail, and ol' fashioned love to their project that what has emerged out the other end may well be Game of the Year material for the PC.  Frankly, it has been a very long time since I have so thoroughly enjoyed a game.   With the devs already promising a new class of adventurer as well as ""town events"" in the near future gratis - the town does need some enlivening as it feels a little static and dull at times, so I am glad to hear this - I think the Darkest Dungeon has a VERY bright future ahead of it.  It certainly has already rocketed to the top of my favorite games list!			"

								This game is awesome..!  Once you figure out some basic mechanics and which upgrades take priority, ( I almost restarted after a few unwise purchases), it becomes a lot easier and rather fun managing your party of merceneries.Basic Tips.. Get your roster up rather quickly.. then develop a couple builds that work for you. While one team is being cured of stress or diseases, let the other one go in to battle. You will have people die. Take rookies and mix them with more experienced fighters so you dont get wiped out as bad. Experiment with your builds.. theres not too many bad characters they all can bring things to the table and some work better with other characters. My favorite build has to be two Hellions up front- two Vestals in back- or a Occultist and a Vestal in back. Out of my roster of 22, I have 8 or 9 Vestals ready to rock. When you upgrade your Vestal make sure she has the Judgment attack. It comes in handy when she is not healing your party. But dont worry about her mace bash. You dont want your Vestals up front and thats the only time she can use the Mace. Another interesting one is two highwaymen up front and letting them take turns with their point blank shot for serious damage. Also the grapeshot blast is a good one to have in their abilities especially early on. The Crusaders seem rare to find on the fresh meat wagon but they are also good to have. The Leper once powered up can replace a Crusader in my opinion. Just whatever works for you. Advancing in game.. Try to get characters to level 3 and then leave them alone until you get enough of level 3s to take on the medium missions. Save level 3 bosses for level 4 fighters as they are still considered level 3 mission eligible. Makes a lot easier trust me. I just think this is a wonderful and deep game that has tons of potential for future installments or DLC depending on how they want to advance this franchise. They could keep adding new areas and bosses, have daily missions, random loot placements to hunt for and all kinds of endless possibilities..  I am excited for the game but almost more excited for what it can be in the future.Would ""Give Them No Quarter!""  again  10/10			"

												""There can be no hope in this hell... no hope at all."" - The Ancestor.Now that the game is released and I have played it in the... ""finished"" state - I can say that I am quite disappointed.Sure, the difficulty is fine and entertaining, but only for so long: all hero upgrades feel absolutely underwhelming. Now, this might not be obvious at the start, because properly upgraded and geared heroes can easily chew through any easy and medium dungeons. But then come the lvl 5 champion ones... and with them comes utter disaster as monsters start to show up with abominable amounts of PROT(while we still have only TWO heroes who can counter this), SPD and additional effects to their attacks. At this point your tactics and overall preparedness barely matter as everything is purely in the hands of the game: the dice will decide your fate and in the final stages they are loaded against you.Pros:- Stunning and hauntingly beautiful art, music and atmosphere. - One superb, amazing narrator.Cons:- Insane difficulty spike near game end without any reasonable means to offset it, tactics will only get you so far.- Heroes actually start to feel weak as the game progresses: without a crit - you're very likely to end in the gutter. I really don't want to complain, but I simply fail to justify the reason why some filthy pigs, skeletons. bandits and mushroom abominations all have PROT, while my lvl 5 armour, even on Crusader and Man-at-Arms who actually wear plate, provides NONE of it.- It feels terribly grindy. The amount of various relics required, especially Deeds, is atrocious. The amount of gold necessary for upgrades and the quality of upgrades themselves is DISGUSTING.- The game actually ENCOURAGES you to sacrifice your first best group of heroes, as they will accumulate EXP faster than gear and at some point will not be able to handle the dungeons appropriate for them.

												Almost all of the negative reviews point towards the game being too long, frustrating, or hard, and should NOT be taken seriously in most of these aspects.Yes, the game can be difficult, sometimes hair tearingly so, but it's designed to be hard and some of them are overexagerating how difficult it is. Sometimes the RNG will screw you over, sometimes not, but it's not entirely up to RNG. As stated when you enter the title screen; you have to make the best out of a bad situation. The RNG is stacked against you, and it should be.However, don't purchase this if you can't handle stressful situations or hopeless feelings of defeat. I've had weeks where I couldn't play because the stress of losing my best characters.As for how long it is, well.... It can be fairly long, I will admit. They are 100% correct that it is not a short game. If you're new to grinding, or dislike it, I'd advise against playing. It isn't rediculously long, though, as some might say. At about 50-60 hours I was ready to head into the Darkest Dungeon quests ( I haven't, though, because I'm waiting to get Dismas and Reynauld back to get the achievment).It is very, very, very, very, frustrating. Not for the faint of heart or those who don't like harder/longer games.I love this game with all my heart, all my soul, and every fiber of my being, because it's fun, hard, long, and because of the narrator's voice. All in the perfect amounts.			"

												What to say about Darkest Dungeon. I've never played a game before that seemed so determined to kill you, and worse, is actually very good at it until you start to understand the nuances of how it works. That didn't happen for me until my third attempt at playing through.Once you get there, though, the frustration gives way to pure joy as you start manhandling enemies in the dungeon. Your A-Team will do more and more work. The dungeons begin to seem trivial, the outcome guarenteed before you even enter them.Until suddenly they stop being trivial. Complacency will be their downfall. Fresh off a decisive run in which your heroes didn't even seem to get stressed much, you venture into a new dungeon or a new difficulty. That's when it all goes to hell and you'll be happy to escape with any of your prized team.At the end of the day, this game is just a delight. You should figure out the basics on your own, take a few playthroughs to do it. Don't google for any shortcuts or tricks until you get to that point I mentioned. When your heroes are level 5 or so and you're hitting higger level dungeons, knowing what heroes to bring (particularly in boss fights) is very helpful.I can't recommend this game any more than I have, it's worth absolutely every penny and then some. You'll curse the gods of random number generation, but you'll keep coming back for more.			"

								Reconsidering this with more time under my belt; I do agree that my initial review was made in haste.The game has some kind of draw, but it grows very stale very quickly. I have just begun to plumb the depths of the veteran maps, but I can't find the motivation to do much more now than play a run or two in between work. The game greatly lacks variety--in monsters, dungeons, and bosses. Both monsters and bosses are generally just reskinned, so after the initial ""shock"" of facing a deadly new one, most of them become trivial and even gimmicky. The dungeons, likewise, reuse the same maps, layouts, and events compounding the staleness even further.By trying to make the game as difficult as possible, the devs have actually made it incredibly shallow. It is challenging for a time, but that challenge is easily mitigated once you learn the game, spoil yourself, or both. It is a very fine flash game that I could see being a highly successful coffee break game, but even at the $10.00 ""discounted"" sale price, it does not seem worth it. I want to believe that the official release is going to change all this, but for the time being, I would not recommend paying any more than maybe 5 bucks for this.  Now, if I had this game on my Android, and the price-tag had been closer to five dollars, I would suggest it.			"

												Overall gameplay is fun. Buy it if you need an advice on purchasing. It worths the money, though while on sale is somewhat preferred. If someone asks me if this game is 'that' difficult or stressful as others mark - my answer is no. Once you get to know how to deal with the Curios, or how to make a decent party format - well, it gets somehow far less difficult, thus far less interesting. Maybe far less stressful, but what we(or me at least) expect from this game is to get stressed(in a good way), isn't it? Enemies grow at champion+ level dungeons to the point that they are absurdly strong, with the blessing of the Dice God upon them, they can, randomly, literally *randomly* kill any of your party members, however well you've dealt with them until then. But I wouldn't call such misfortune itself as one of the 'stressful' situations. Of course they die, for they have come to die. But when you realize that all this repetition of dungeon crawling doesn't really change, that they are all same after all, that you want something more than bigger health bar, enhanced resistance and additional stress damage on every attack from the enemies - then this game becomes stressful. Stressful in a bad way. It suddenly feels like it's no use to proceed, because you already know what is expecting you. Meaningless repetition. You know how the curios work, how the monsters work, how everything works. Done.Would it have been better if dungeon environments had more diversity? Or somehow different upgrading system for heroes? It's classical. Nothing novel. Or... I don't know. Maybe I'm expecting too much. Hope there is an expansion or a sequel. Seems like the forthcoming DLC(the Crimson Court) isn't going to fulfill further development I expect. Such thing can't be under current system of the game. At least I think so. I feel so.			"

Instead of slowly craawling through dungeons and carefully conserving resources, you're now playing a tedious grindfest that is far too reliant on blind luck.

								When this game came out, I was amazed.  It was excellent, and only needed a few tweeks here and there, as I experienced very few real problems.  I stopped playing the game after a while, simply due to other games coming out, and not being able to devote as much time here.  When I came back to the game, I was severely disappointed with some of the decisions the devs have made regarding gameplay, most especially the clearing of corpses, which ruined the game for me.  Would I have recommended the game when it first came out?  Probably.  Would I now?  Probably not.			"

								The game used to be a hearty ""recommend"" from me, as I had a lot of fun durring previous patches. I feel the game, with the introduction of a lot of new mechanics and the sudden harshness of the RNG that these changes created, has strayed from what used to be a brutal but fun dungeoncrawler to a slow, sluggish grind with each fight taking far too long and critheavy enemies with Prot completely destroying your party half the time. As it stands the random factor has taken over and is actively disrupting the game to a point that simply hollows out the experience.Cannot recommend, check back later.			"

Unique gameplay mechanics (for a turn based game). Amazing lore, voice acting & vocabulary. Challenging.Cons: The hero stats are very confusing. RNG based. Some heros are waaay underpowerd. Some enemies are waay overpowerd and can drain almost all of your hp or kill you in a single turn. Not being able to finish a quest without a healer. The fact that enemy AoE attack have a greater crit chance than yours. Unrewarding quest loot, half of the time.Again, this game is extremely fun, but it will make you rage.			"

								As I look through my games library I see the hallowing name of an early access game. Already the stress seeps into my brain, memories of death, disease and hate flood into my mind. Countless characters lost in mere seconds, their lives dwindling like the countless torches used in these diabolical dungeons. Aside from all this I am compelled to come back for more, to feel the utmost joy of scoring a critical hit, the relief of surviving the horrors being thrown at me and the unforgettable feeling of triumph. This is a thoroughly fun game and I would suggest any person who wants their metal tested to play it. You will hate it, you will feel that it is unforgiving, you will lose your mind but amongst the remains of the dead you will find your valor and your courage and press onwards delving deeper into the hellish abyss we know as the darkest dungeon.

								It sucks to have to echo the reviews of recent.  Buyer beware this game has become unfun by a landslide since the last few patches.  2 mechanics have broken a since fun game by opening a door to tedium.  Corpses, and heartattacks.  I had whole heartedly recommended this game to a friend before realizing the change, and he came back complaining how awful it was because his entire group died from a heart attack after 1 encounter.  Compounded by now you have to defeat enemies twice (they turn into corpses that block attacks and require being killed twice).  It's just not fun.  The devs listened too hard to community complaints and missed an opportunity to polish a great game and instead broke it with mechanics that weren't fully thought through.  Which is mind boggling, when you step back and realize it already had a set of unique mechanics that were.  1/10 would not have heart attack again.			"

								There are much better, more in depth reviews on here, so I'll keep mine brief-ish.Playing Darkest Dungeon, at least at the moment, is like going to the casino; the house always wins.In the patch notes, the developers mention players breaking the game to the point that it's insanely easy. I'd like to know how many people this includes, because it, again, feels much like a visit to the casino: a handful of people win. Everyone else loses. I've reached a point where I'm not sure the game takes much skill, but rather getting on your knees, praying, and then realizing it does nothing. I still like the game. I like the corpses, even--it was frustrating working a monster to the front only for ranged characters to have nothing to do. It can be good. At the moment, however, it's kinda not. And that's my review as it stands. Lots of design decisions that could be good, but just aren't really.Also: while I understand most of the new classes, when first introduced, were OP, the houndmaster strikes me as the absolute worst. I could be missing something, but a group, 1 bleed attack is just worthless. Yes, he can lower protection--another questionable  recently impelentated mechanic--but on the whole he feels like a waste of a slot, and only helps to drag battles on longer. And, given that time and chance are your two biggest obstacles every step of the way, you're better off bringing along someone stronger, who can take enemies out faster. So much for keeping it short. But, if you're interested in the game, ask yourself: how salty do I get? If you get very salty at games, move along. It's not worth the frustration. And that's my real complaint. The developers need to find a balance between their vision and something that's actually fun to play. Unless you like losing money at the casino, find something cheaper, and more rewarding. Something that you feel like you've earned through skill, perhaps, and not just dumb luck. But also know that while I'm not recommending the game, I kinda am. This game could be amazing. Maybe it even was, at one point. Hopefully it will at least be somewhat fun again.			"

												It's a tough game to review, now that's it out of early access. Ideally I'd give it a neutral recommendation, but since I can't it's going to be not recommended. Why? - The game evolved very little since ea started. They added more stuff (heroes, enemies), sure, but they didn't really add more depth or refine the game mechanics in any meaningful way. - The grind. And this is coming from someone who can take a lot of grind in games. This is the worst kind of grind, the grind without any meaningful progress in sight. Most of the game you'll be doing the same medium length missions over and over again to grind gold, deeds and XP, in fact you HAVE TO beat every mission a number of times before a boss fight unlocks. Then each boss has to be killed 3 times (after you fill the GRIND BAR 3 times, obviously). Much like your heroes, the bosses don't get any new skills, they just get stat buffs. Then you beat the final dungeon. That's it. If you cut all the fat the game could be beaten in 20-30 missions, without repeating the same scouting quest 20 times and spending 526 deeds to improve the bar in your village. In fact it would've been better that way. - Incredibly shallow game mechanics. Stress? It was promised to be a core mechanics of the game and it's just another healthbar with random effects at break points. Afflictions? Way too easy to remove. Hero skills? Just bigger numbers from start to finish. Equipment? Again bigger numbers, zero variety. Trinkets? Take the ones that improve the stat you want, sell the rest. Exploration? Doesn't exist. Combat tactics? Shoot the eldritch horror until it dies. - Difficulty. The game seems very difficult at first, but it's an illusion, once you learn to game the system and proper party composition it gets trivial. You'll still lose a hero or be forced to abandon a mission every now and then (the game is RNG heavy), but because the game has no fail-state (!) you're only limited by how much grind you can take. - Now that's it out of ea, I can say that some things seem like placeholders. The hunger mechanic is a joke. Dungeons are mapped from the start (!). Torchlight system is just tedium. Many skills and trinket are complete garbage and essentially serve as a newbie trap. Corpses don't add to the difficulty or tactics, they just prolong fights and look stupid. I could go on, but these are nitpicks that wouldn't matter if the core gameplay had more depth to it.What's good about it? The atmosphere, graphics and narration are excellent. Gameplay... not so much. It's not completely terrible, but they underdelivered, concentrating on meaningless fluff like corpses, heart attacks and fight prolonging penalties instead of adding some choice and depth to gameplay. It's a 5/10 game, if you get it for $10 or less, you might have fun for your money, but that's all it is. A shame, really. "

												Darkest Dungeon in the first 20hrs of play.....is exactly the same as Darkest Dungeon in the 100th hour of play- there is enough class complexity and tactical depth for to be very engaging early but this just doesn't last.Had I quit after the first 20hrs I would have been left with a strongly positive impression. Unfortunately, as  a completionist, I wanted to see the game finished- and thats when I found myself bogged down in an grind of repetitive encounters and contrived hurdles that function only to lengthen, not enhance, the core campaign.While the class depth and balance is very good it is a shame that the combat system is so limited and unimaginative- this is a game that I played, almost in its entirety, with the sound off while watching movies and documentaries.

												A lot of this game's atmosphere will suck you in, but the tragic truth is that this is a game of luck. There are far too many instances where the RNG comes into play and they all involve your party being killed. The thing is, none of those elements can be fixed with a patch. The stress levels of your heroes will not be able to recover within a reasonable amount of time, the healing techniques are sparse and can be randomly refused by your heroes. The roguelike gameplay means that you may spend a half hour sprawling through a dungeon getting lower on supplies until you happen upon the objective by luck. This game may be fun for some, but the tragedy is that most of the problems with this game are because of incompetent design. To criticize the amount of luck involved with the game is to risk being told to ""git gud"".			"

TediousSo before I start, I want to make it clear I really want to like this game. I will continue playing because I believe it will be better at some point. This was not an impulse buy for me. I read through the forums and looked at videos before buying. I waited for a sale to make it easier for me to see value in the purchase. It has nice graphics and interesting mechanics. It has an RPG elements to add some depth to the basic rogue structure. There's a base building mechanic simialr to X-com, which is something I usually like. There's resource management which should lead to interesting decisions. All these things appealed to me and made me decide to buy it.I expected to be greeted by difficult challenges that required me to closely monitor my resources and make difficult choices about my characters and their fates. Ultimately, I'm just faced with a mindless grind over and over.My current state of gaming after 14 hours is: Manage my main party Recruit 4 characters from stagecoach Press embark button Pick a short adventure Put the 4 characters in their slots Press provision button Buy 6 torches Start adventure Adventure until one characters stress gets close to or over 100 Abandon quest Click through a bunch of buttons to get back to the base (Not sure what they say as I click through them as fast as possible) Right click each character and press fire button Manage my main party Go to stagecoach .....And the worst part is there are no shortcuts. You can't fire everyone at the end of an adventure. You can't recruit four characters from the adventure screen. It's like they're trying to convince me that these choices have meaning. They don't and they just add clicks until I get to the ones that do have meaning.That meaning shows up every third week or so.Every few weeks, you'll take your main party on an adventure and you'll try and push them to the end so they gain gain resolve to level up. You'll even equip them with shovels and food like a real party would want. If all goes well, they'll finish an adventure and you'll get some cool things.Of course the party will also be a stressed out wreck and require several weeks of rest to recover enough to go on another adventure. This of course is ok, since you'll need several weeks to gather enough resources to pay for their stress recovery and any upgrades you may want to put on them.This of course means you'll spend several more adventures going through the earlier cycle with a bunch of characters who's names you don't even bother to read. You'll even gloat a bit when the starvation screen comes up as that means you've had a better than average run and should get some decent money out of the adventure. The fact that you're technically starving four people to death in order to make your return on investment worthwhile should never be brought up.Is any of this difficult? Does it make the game challenging?Not really.The monsters so far have posed little or no threat. Even if a character gets to zero health, it's unlikely you'll lose them. You can probably give them a health on the next combat round and they'll usually hang in there long enough for you to finish any really tough battles.The base poses no difficulty once I figured out the grinding part. And since it's clear that in the long term I'll get enough resources to build up to maximum, there's no interesting choices to be made there.What is difficult is stress, and only because the game doesn't give you the resources to deal with it if you keep pushing on. It won't matter most of the time because the throw away characters can get as stressed as they want as long as they don't all die before you abandon the adventure.For your main party, stress is the real enemy. I would go as far as to say your only enemy. From the start of your adventure, you'll be wondering if they'll get to the end before they stress out. There is little chance the monsters will kill your characters, but once one of your characters goes over 100 stress the threat of heart attacks becomes a real and pressing problem. At that point, you're playing with fire while showering in gasoline. The characters will start talking and the stress levels will skyrocket. Then another character will go over 100 and they won't shut up and three turns later someone will fall over dead from a heart attack. Once one goes, it's belly up for all of them and you get to start over. Since you'll quickly learn this lesson, you're unlikely to ever face this problem more than once. At that point, stress then just becomes an annoyance instead of a difficulty. It will quickly come to represent extra weeks of tedious trips through the cycle of collecting resources. What about the times where it really does go bad for your main party? It has happened once to me because I didn't want to go through a medium adventure a second time for two rooms. I pushed on even though I knew heart attacks were close. I started raging against the fates and designers right?No. Remember, you only play with these characters once every 3 weeks. You're not really attached to them. The entire party went belly up and the most I could manage was a tired sigh as I thought about the button presses of tedium while I started a new party to replace .... hmm .... what were their names??? And in case you think I'm exaggerating this point, I give you the following example of my total ambivalence for these characters. One time, I fired one of my main party members by mistake. I had forgotten their name and their stress was high. It was only when I started the next adventure with my main party that I realized what I had done.In all the rogue games that I thought were good, I could remember the names of my characters. I cared what happened to them. I would go so far as to say that's the heart of a good rogue game. Make the player care about what's happening, and then put them in an impossible situation. Most of the times things will go badly and the player will hate the game and the developer.Sometimes though, a miracle will happen. You'll get that perfect set of circumstances to overcome the impossible. And that character will be your hero. The game and developers will be brilliant. That story will be told to everyone who will listen. Of course the character will then be killed by a lowly slime moments later, but the memory of them overcoming the impossible will live on and make you believe you can win. You will honor that character by starting again. You will swear to defeat that game because of all the fallen heroes who did the impossible to get one more level further than you had ever seen before.I wish that was happening in Darkest Dungeon. Unfortunately, the designers have forgotten to make me care.			"

												SNAPSHOTA Lovecraftian game built to mirror the stress and sanity loss between the player and the characters in the game.OVERALL - 6 / 10PROS+ great atmosphere / aesthetics+ satisfying meta progressionCONS- huge emphasis on very poor RNG- game is balanced heavily against the player early on- gameplay gets repetitive quicklyDETAILSI'm going to say this up front: I save scummed the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game, and I don't feel one iota of remorse. Overall, the game has a lot of fun elements to it, but the fun parts are dwarfed by the stress and frustration that it creates due to poor design choices, mostly those that were added post-alpha. Pre-alpha the game was a lot of fun, often pitting the player into darkness but giving them eventual hope and opportunities to climb out of it. Post-alpha the player is pushed into a well with no rope to climb back up. The game is built to be challenging, but what Darkest Dungeon delivers is an iron maiden of epic proportions: the more you play, the more you bleed out what little energy you have left to come back and get slapped in the face by the massive amounts of RNG you have to rely on.Darkest Dungeon pits players against a perpetually stacked deck, which only gets worse the longer you play. The game is built to put the PCs into a dying state quickly and often, which is compounded upon by the heart attack mechanic. Introduced sometime after alpha, and a longstanding point of contention, heart attacks cause a PC to instantly enter a dying state, regardless of health, or die permanently if they are already dying. Because of this, often times the game ends up chaining multiple events together that can easily wipe a party, regardless of how well you are doing.Sanity loss for PCs leads to afflictions, which basically makes the given PC suicidal for the rest of the dungeon. More often than not an afflicted PC will skip their turn, refuse healing, shift the party order around, or somehow injure or debuff themselves. It would be one thing if an affliction only caused one of these things, or even if there was a limit as to how often they could happen, but instead they often happen in succession, which causes other party members to lose sanity and gain an affliction, and the cycle repeats. This quickly leads to an entire party wiped because 75% of your turns are either skipped or used to re-arrange heroes because they can't do anything else (not even defend). This is, in short, not fun whatsoever.Aside from the in-dungeon frustrations, the game also has a level restriction on those that can enter the dungeon, with PCs claiming that they ""wouldn't learn anything from the experience"", or some other ridiculous reasoning. This is actually probably my biggest gripe, even moreso than heart attacks. This level restriction makes it extremely frustrating to try and level up other heroes to replace the ones that die or are otherwise unable to function for the dungeon. Unfortunately, it appears that the lowest level dungeons are also the least well balanced, so the player is forced to trudge through them again and again, re-living the nightmares they thought they had previously overcome.Overall, I do like Darkest Dungeon, when the dice are in my favor. When they aren't (which is ~75% of the time, it seems), the game is just an unending stream of frustration. The thrill, charm, and balance this game had with heroes constantly teetering on the brink of death in pre-alpha has given way to the hopelessness and malaise introduced with the post-launch changes, and given that I play games to relieve stress and have fun, this is the opposite of the desired result. As such I cannot recommend that others willingly subject themselves to it, however if you do make sure you keep the lights on and bring a lot of torches.			"

												I love this game. I've nearly beaten it, it has been very fun. But I can't recommend it in it's current state. It has obviously had a lot of work put into it, but it still needs a lot of work. My main complaint is that for a game that was created with the idea in mind of introducing the player to a world of realism(with fantacy Lovecraftian Eldritch horror themes), of the human mind and body being put to the test and the results of doing so, for some reason they decided the way to do this was with RNG deciding the mechanics they so heavily wanted to emphasize: permadeath and afflictions.PROS: +Very well done visually. +Sound effects, narration, and music are great.+Strategy based gameplay with many party and skill combinations to use.+Difficult in a satisfying way (usually).CONS:-Too heavily dependant on RNG. Mechanics that are the main focus of the game, such as permanent death (Deathblow at Death's Door) and how heroes react to stress(Affliction/Virtue), are entirely up to chance. I'm fine with RNG when it's used to create the quests, but the combat and progress in general is too heavily dependant on it. To add on to this, the game actually becomes more RNG dependant as you progress. Critical Hits become more common and effects decided by RNG (bleed, blight, disease, debuffs, move) become more common. -A total grindfest. Seriously. It takes SO LONG to raise heroes to be able to have any chance at surviving the LVL 6 Darkest Dungeon missions. Heroes come with, and gain throughout their quest through RNG, various negative quirks that render them useless against the extremely unforgiving stress and health damage of the late game enemies. So you have to grind low level dark runs, to gain enough gold to afford the treatments to cure their quirks, to make your higher level heroes even usable.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is very, very good. It started out as a rogue-like with heavy Lovecraftian influences. Great artwork, soundtrack, and very cool and novel concepts such as ""stress"", ""light levels"", and encouraging team work. Sometimes you had to sacrifice a beloved character in order for the rest of the team to finish and level up. No problem there, it actually gave the game personality and added depth to the story. All of these great things are still in the game, but...The game went really off-balance in the July 15 Build Update. Enemies get major boosts in crit damage and frequency, so most of your turns you will be healing. I get the idea behind having a corpse in the way after defeating an enemy, but when 2-3 hits to get rid of it, it gets annoying. Also, I like the fact that you can now die from stress. But, in a dungeon, stress builds up WAY faster than you can get rid of it. And you can only do so in:a) Battle- Some characters can heal stress. During battle is when stress builds up the most, and the amount of stress healed is mostly insignificant. b) Camps- A lot of stress can be relieved here, but you can camp only so many times, and it can feel like a waste of resources if your HP are still high with a long road ahead of you. So good luck with not dying of a heart attack during long dungeons. Please, add a stress relieving item if you are going to have stress be such a major issue. I know this is still Early Access, but hopefully developers pay more attention to negative reviews and actually do something about these issues. Avoid raging at your monitor and come back when these things are fixed.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall:I very much enjoyed my time with Darkest Dungeon. Its strengths lie in the beautiful atmosphere, (mostly) rewarding leveling system, and unforgiving RNG that makes all fights feel important as at any time you could lose a character you’ve invested several hours into. Fans of challenging, turn based rouge likes should be right at home and not hesitate to play. Price Point: This was my biggest deterrent to buying the early access. I believe $20 is a little pricey for an unfinished game and wasn’t sure how much gameplay I’d be getting. However I was able to get at least 40 very fun hours out of that $20. Many games charge a lot more for a lot less and as I write this review I feel my money was well spent.RNG:RNG makes darkest dungeon the challenge it is. Unfortunately many players are claiming they had terrible luck, making the game nearly unplayable. It is possible to miss nearly every attack as some say, it’s just incredibly unlikely. For me, RNG was just punishing enough to make encounters challenging, and only a hand full of times did I feel cheated. It really made my heart pump going on a boss mission with level 5 characters, knowing I could permanently lose characters I’d invested 4-5 hours into if I had a handful of bad rolls. Similarly, its incredible seeing a bounty hunter crit a boss for nearly 80 damage because he hit a 20% crit chance. Character death is permanent and unforgiving. It’s not impossible to beat the game without dying, but it is unlikely. It’s terribly frustrating to see a player get crit’d twice, putting them on death’s door where they can die to another enemies attack or to bleed or blight. But in my experience these cases happened very infrequently and could be avoided by fleeing from battle. Once I figured out the game, maybe around the 10-15 hour mark, I stopped losing characters. For me, the RNG was what made each mission immersive as players are at fortune’s mercy, for others it is a terribly frustrating mechanic.Character and Skill Balance:Having leveled each character to rank 6, I’ve found some characters and skills aren’t as strong as others, this could just be my play style though. Damage is king. The player could spend a turn using the plague doctors 15% damage boost, but on a character that does 10-16 base damage, 15% is only 1 to 2 more damage points which aren’t guaranteed because the buff’d player could still miss. It seems far more sensible to have the plague doctor attack as any damage he does is likely to be more than 2, maybe even getting the kill and saving the player damage next turn as the dead enemy wont attack. Its similar with the jester. The jester’s attacks are weaker but seem to have a higher crit chance and cause bleed damage. But again, I’d rather have a stronger character guaranteed to do more base damage each turn like the bounty hunter. I would not have played the jester or the plague doctor in late game if not to raise them to rank 6. Because they are both weaker characters, but particularly because in late game enemies crit for so much and its very possible for the jester to be on death’s door after one crit from a hard hitting enemy. All other characters I found usable, fun, and different. However, I still only use their damaging or healing skills. Again, I could buff the highway man’s accuracy to maybe hit next turn, or I could just try to do damage both turns. The one exception I found was the occultist. His debuff’s are extremely valuable for boss fights. However, most boost skills are largely too weak to be used and should be buffed.Game Progression:Early game is challenging. Players new to the game mechanics and the RNG could get frustrated easily. Again, this is dependent on the player. I loved the early game, but players should realize this is likely the most difficult part. It’s a perfectly viable strategy early on to send in suicide teams with no provisions assuming they will not complete the mission and end with high stress. However, all the gold they gather will be kept by the player and they can be dismissed from the roster to make room for a new suicide squad. By mid game the player will have upgraded the town enough and found a handful of useful trinkets that the player will feel vastly overpowered compared to the early game. You’ll be overpowered compared to early game, but still be challenged. I had the most fun at this mid game stage. I felt I had built up my players and strategies and was being rewarded for playing the game well. Late game, which I understand was recently buff’d, felt a little cheap to me. It seems enemies are given too much dodge, health, and damage. The late game felt like early game, just with bigger numbers. Enemies have such high dodge, that a crusader’s level 5 smite seemed to hit for almost the same percent chance and do the same proportional amount of damage as it did in early game. I felt this way about all characters. Its fun when games let you feel more powerful as you play on. Darkest Dungeon does so beautifully from early to mid game. You feel rewarded for leveling your players, upgrading the town, and implementing good strategies and teams. Players are robbed of this in late game as the enemies get such high stats that it feels cheap and that the player has regressed back to early game. As if the player never leveled up or got much better at the game. Suggestions to improve the game:1) Tweak the late game to keep the player feeling overpowered, yet challenged. Either nerf the late round enemies, or have another round of powerful upgrades for players that are unlocked at rank 5 or 6. By rank 4, all skills, weapons, and armor can be maxed. Implement one more round of upgrades that come with rank 5 to offset the difficultly of late game enemies.2) Fix inconsistent stats. What does speed do? One would assume it dictates turn order. Sometimes it does sometimes it doesn’t. I’ve had characters with speed 8 go before characters with speed 10, strangely it seemed to only happen when my party surprised the enemy. Both characters were using speed boosting trinkets. This is confusing. If speed doesn’t dictate turn order then there should really be a tool tip when the player mouses over the speed stat explaining what it does. If it does dictate turn order then it should work as expected and the higher number goes before the lower. 3) Not sure if it is intentional, but when moving from one room to the next in a dungeon and approaching the door for the next room. If the player mashes “w”, they can get into the last room without losing some torch light. For example, If the player starts moving from one room to the next, with no interactables in the hallway, but doesn’t mash “w”, they will enter the next room with less than 75 light. However, if the player does mash “w” as they approach the last room, they will enter that room with 76 light. This saves more torches than you’d think in lengthy dungeons.4) Make passive attacks stronger. Damage is too important. Why would someone use a turn to boost a characters attack by 2, rather than attacking to cause more than 2 damage? Maybe 15% damage to the entire party would be worth it. To only one player, it is not. 5) Useless trinkets. Some trinkets have useless combinations. Like 15% blight chance to jester, when the jester doesn’t have any attacks that can cause blight. Also, by late game there were only 3 or 4 trinkets I used. The lepers mask which gave huge boosts to health, and speed for the leper class. The tough ring which gave 20% health and 8% protection, a book that game 15% damage and 2 speed, and a right that gave 15% damage and 8% protection if light was above 75. All other trinkets were garbage. Maybe have a way to sell trinkets to get a little more money.More suggestions in the comments below...			"

Early Access Review
								   After all the hype I had after reading about this game, and watching the my friends play it and even a few streams, I agree with alot of the complaints in the most recent reviews. It's not that the game is too hard, I can deal with hard. It's that the game is unfairly hard. As in, it punishes you at total random with things you had no way to avioid it. Sure RNG helps keep things freash for a short time, but this is a massive overdose of it.     It's just not fun anymore, the reward you get from finsihing a quest hardly ever makes up for the ever rising cost of healing your party's stress and verious illnesses. You don't ever get the feeling of progression. A constant state two steps forward and three steps back looms over you through the entierty of the play session.    The game simply lacks consistancy, it's very hard to learn when you can't tell if the effect was the game giving you yet another middle finger, or it was becuase you did somthing wrong, making this profoundly diffucult for new players to start with the laerning curve.  was an 8/10 to start but with the most recent updates, its bumped down to a 4/10 would not buy.

								Great game, very different RPG game style, if you love roguelike games and turn-based games or just a RPG fan then this is the game for you. WARNING the game is a challenge don't expect to kill this one off quick. This game will make you pull your hair out and thats exactly what its meant to do.Because if it was easy, it wouldn't be any fun.Great artwork and play style, really love this game and would recommend to all.Watch some videos of the gameplay read some reviews and make your own mind up. Thats what i did and i'm glad i purchased this game.Just one thing i find funny about people who moan about a game what is just to hard and others that complain about games that are way to easy and can be finished in a few hours, there has to be a balance somewhere. For me i would like games to be harder.I like to set my games to Hardest, why pay good money for a game that's to easy to complete.Dark Souls /DD and other challeging games are meant to drive you to the point of crazyness this is the thrill in playing.So come with an open mind and leave with a heavy heart.

												It's very easy to get involved into the dark, hopeless and grim atmosphere this game manages to create thanks to the excellent art with a very well-fitting choice of colours and to the immersive musics and FX.I never opened the settings menu to enable or disable game mechanics, because I think this game should be experimented in an artistic and sensorial way, not in a rational one (criticizing mechanics and so on).This game is about the fragile human psyche and the illusion of faith and earthly pleasures used as a placebo in a desperate attempt to avoid its fracture. Strategy is nothing when Fate itself is against you, and this is represented by a lot of game statistics being expressed by percentages. Human skill is useless against timeless horrors: one can only hope to succeed out of a burst of good luck.This game is capable of keeping constantly high my level of anxiety during missions (with even victory resulting in a somewhat negative situation... followed by all the mental and physical consequences the heroes must face) and my level of discouragement while managing the hamlet (with all the heroes getting sick, mad, asking not to be sent again down there...)Maybe I like this game because it ""sees"" life as I do:I'm quite pessimist, thus I think that chances are always against me, hope is just a childish feeling to me (but I'm not completely hopeless), I'm stubborn and tend to recover from setbacks out of pride.But I'm prone to frustration too, so I greatly dislike unfair games, like Darkest Dungeon can be quite often... I could not get frustrated by it till now though, like I could easily get by a bad serie of ""aseptic"" dice rolls for example: in fact in Darkest Dungeon things go terribly wrong in such a dramatic end elegant way that all I can think about is only the epicness of my defeat, with the music that becomes more and more pressing and anxiogenic as the hope of victory fades away...I admit it: Sometimes I ragequit, sometimes I facepalmed, some other times I watched the screen in disappoint and disbelief... as if I really was In that dungeon with those poor souls called ""heroes"" by some townsfolk, and surrendered like them to some nasty mental derangement for just a second...This game awakened in me again the fear of bosses, because they're overpowered and there is permadeath. Characters are designed to be anti-heroes, and this concept reaches its apotheosis when a pious paladin succumbs to his inner selfishness and show himself as the frail human he actually is.And what should that paladin think when a distrusted abomination reacts to his stress with virtue and valor instead (a rare event indeed)?As you have seen, I have not covered any technical aspect in this review because I think that If you look for the gameplay, mechanics or strategy aspects in this game... well this is not the game for you.Edit, November 2016: voted Darkest Dungeon for Autumn sales awards			"

								The game looks, feels, and plays like a shallow mobile game. The depth and difficulty are superficial and short-lived. $20 PC game now, or $5 (or less) on mobile platform.The concept is brilliant and unique, the art and design are inspired. However, everything about the game seems to indicate that its primary purpose is to test out how well it can be ported into mobile formats.Edit:On its Kickstarter page, the game was advertised as ""Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring.""As a backer i am still disappointed by several parts of this description.The game is not challenging. (the game feels and plays more like a slot machine or a game of poker, you have very little input, and what little challenge is there is only exists on the surface. the challenge is easily overcome in a few hours. certain additions have been made to provide more challenge, but they only increased the tedium of the game. making the game require more grinding, and drawing out every battle is not a substitute for depth or difficulty)The game is not a rougelike in any way. (your heroes suffer from permadeath, if you let it go that far, but you as a player suffer NO consequences as a result of letting individual heroes or even whole teams get wiped out. Heroes are a free resource that you can keep obtaining and accumulating)The game is not an RPG. (the game is more like a hero management simulator, you can make improvements to your hero's skills and items, as well as determining the party composition and their position within the group. There is no story nor any role-playing element to the game.)The game has no adventuring. (everything about the game can be seen within a few hours. in each location there are only 5, give or take a few depending on the location, different variations of fights to be had before seeing a boss or fully exploring the dungeon. The misssions themselves have very little variety,and any sort of risk/reward for pressing further into a location is almost non existant.)The game we are being sold certainly doesnt feel like it belongs on PC, nor is it the game that was originally pitched or is currently being advertised.

												After more than twenty hours of gameplay, I have to come to terms with the fact that this game is not for me - which is not the same as saying Darkest Dungeon is bad. It is not a bad game, but I guess it targets a player niche I’m not part of. And that is a shame, because I loved most things about it - the setting, the writing, the atmosphere, the art, and plenty of the gameplay mechanics. I sincerely wanted to see this one to its end. What dissuaded me from doing so was what I consider a serious imbalance between reward and frustration within the game - and I don’t mind difficult games, having played through FTL countless times as well as half the Souls series. What I’m not willing to deal with is how easily you can lose characters (or even have your party wiped out) despite hours of power playing, upgrading and strategizing. The challenge borders on the unfair, but fans of the game seem to revel in that (thus I do not count myself among the game’s target public). And yes, I’d been warned that I’d lose entire parties, that my favorite characters would die, etc. Still, because every other aspect of the game enticed me, I gave it a try - and now I can say, without prejudice and with pain in my heart, that the mandatory grind of Darkest Dungeon is not worth the time and aggravation it would take to beat the game. C’est la vie.Edit: It has been interesting to watch the reaction of Darkest Dunegon fans to negative reviews, most of which come in the form of one (or a variation) of the following:(a)  ""Too hard? Git gud noob!!1!""My reply: It's not that hard, once you learn how to optimize your parties. But that is part of the problem: In order to have a chance, you need optimization, and that leads to a joyless, variety-free grind in spite of all the interesting classes and abilities. (b) ""Only 20 hours? Cr4p review.""My reply: Much like the previous case, this translates into ""waah waah you dislike my favorite game, you suck!"", which is both immature and untrue. Along the same lines, you'll see people saying ""this game is easy if you take the time to actually learn it"", and to these people I say: Not everyone has (or is willing to spend) 100 hours to memorize game patterns, and not all reviewers should be expected to spend that long on the game before they are allowed to give their opinion. Please learn to cope with disagreement. FACT: Despite all its qualities (and there are many!), this game is grindy as hell, and dishes out massive doses of frustration to boot. Review readers will be interested in learning this, and reviews which contain this information are useful. Crying ""Cr4p review"" only because of the red thumb down makes you a whiny fanboy. (c) ""This game is not supposed to make you feel good.""My reply: If this is an honest statement, then we play games for very different reasons - which is fine. Granted: there are games which inspire a range of emotions both positive and negative in a way that is ultimately rewarding, but Darkest Dungeon is not one of them. And anyway, I already spend too many hours on ONE grindy game that gives me more than my fair share of grief and frustration. It's called ""life"", which has a mandatory mini-game called ""work"". Don't judge me for enjoying a little variety.			"

""When you say 'dangerous', how dangerous do you mean?""Welcome to the Darkest Dungeon, young blood. Be warned: many adventurers have ended in the cramped cemetery - covered in the poisoned earth and awaiting merciful oblivion. Vicious foes and traps lie in the dark, preying on such fools.If however you intend to survive and overcome what may be the darkest trial of your short life, then by all means watch your step. Never let your guard down, never take a fight for granted, never allow yourself a moment of easy respite or vain triumph. In the end it will all be worth it: there is gold, glory and knowledge to be secured here... at a dire cost. ""Fan the flames, mold the metal: we are raising an army!""Success requires a forceful strength. The lifeblood of your efforts will come from a crowd of adventurers of various trades and backgrounds, men and women molded by a life in crime, war or arcane. Do not delude yourself with bonds of affection or pity: they will serve as cannon fodder for your ambitions. You’ll need to keep these tools sharp: trained, equipped, and mentally sound - if by sound we mean blind enough to venture through the gates of hell.So ransack everything you can from the dungeons and put your loot to good use. Gold and relics will help you to rebuild the Hamlet and bolster your troops. A visit at the flagellation room or the brothel will raise the mood of your broken men. The sanitarium will purge diseases and negative quirks. The guild house and the blacksmith’s workshop will improve their combat skills and gear of the high level fighters. Preparation is half the battle – the easy half. ""Carelessness will find no clemency in this place...""You may have heard the squeals (or read the reviews) of the weak and the soft-headed calling this adventure overly difficult. Is it so? It has been beaten by myself and many others. Yes, I left my sanity back there and many of my henchmen have lost worse... but the Dungeon of my ancestors has been purged, and those monsters who pretended to bar the way are now laying in pools of their own coagulated blood!Now there is some truth in all this nonsense: survival is a tenuous proposition in this sprawling tomb. The game can harshly punish mistakes, as you will probably learn the hard way. Do not be cheap when packing torches, food or bandages (much needed in the Cove). Never let the light die, unless you really know what you’re doing. Always replace a warrior pushed out of position to make the best of his/her tactical skills. Don't hesitate to abandon a quest and go home if most of your team hit max stress or Death’s Door. There is a solution to every problem you can face. ""Prodigious size alone does not dissuade the sharpened blade!""Deep in the maze shines a glint of mad hope: victory. The road is as long as it is treacherous, but if you keep your eyes peeled at all time you will see the end of it. The Darkest Dungeon is doable and extremely rewarding. Now go forth, madman, and hold your torch high and bright!Listen to this song if you need to lower your stress level:

												I'll start with a warning: If you dislike RNG and it making a big difference, you might wanna skip this game. Even with the right tactics, some well-geared characters and a lot of experience, some encounters might still get your favorite adventurers killed. You should be aware of this, and if you hate having some very unhappy rolls on attacks, then this might be very frustrating.Now... I at first wasn't very interest in DD, but a review and stream by TB made me change my mind and try it. And I was captivated quickly. The game is a LOT of fun.The graphics and animations are very simple, but also, very stylish, so they have character and are nice to look at.The atmosphere is great. There is a certain Lovecraftian vibe to things (not only because madness can become a real problem for your adventurers), and the narrator does SUCH a great job (BTW, check out his readings of HPL-stories, such a cool experience).Even with a lot of training, these dungeons will be risky for your guys. Bad RNG on heals (instead of, say, 8 points, you get 0 or 1 points, which means you kinda lost a turn) or damage (sometimes, you are THAT close to killing a mob, but then, 2-3 of your guys actually MISS, and you actually end up losing), debuffs like selfishness (your character might snag loot for himself), or paranoia (he or she might actually REFUSE to be healed) etc.I did like the darkness-mechanic. There are advantages and disadvantages to letting the light go dim or using torches to get to 100 light. With this mechanic, you kinda pick how you wanna approach the dungeon, a little bit like controlling the difficulty level yourself (not that it is a cakewalk if you spam torches, mind you!), and the increased rewards you get for fights at low light levels come with increased risks too.So, you may ask, why do people play this? Are we all out for punishment? No! The game is just very addictive in that ""Come on, just one more quick dungeon before I head to bed... whoops, it's 3 AM?!?!"" way.It is challenging, it will often feel unfair, but boy, winning battles and completing dungeons feels so very satisfying. You start to care about your chars (and there is an achievement about beating the final boss with the chars you get at the beginning of the game), especially if you name them yourself.A guide might help you get started, as money will be an issue (supplies are expensive, so you wanna pick carefully what to take along), but even if you just dive in and go trial and error, you will learn what to do.Talking about that, here is one complaint I have: The supplies and treatments IMO are TOO expensive. Even when you clear out tons of tough dungeons, you might have low funds due to the prize of upgrades to your buildings, treatments and supplies like bandages and torches. Sure, those supplies shouldnt be so cheap or plentiful that you can spam them at all times, but then, simply limit the amount you can get more. I didn't mind all the bad luck with the RNG and losing fights I thought I'd rather easily win, but I found those prizes frustrating, and IMO, they should be lowered at least a tiny bit. Other than that: It's a great, tactical game, some fights will have you bite your nails, sometimes you will feel disappointed, especially when losing a character you leveled up. The game will eventually become kinda grindy, but at that point, you could just play it casually, like doing half an hour or so and then returning later.Pros:- Atmospheric- Simple, but unique graphics and animations- Great narrator voice- Challenging- You get to choose your ability-loadout- Very satisfying when you beat a boss or dungeon...CONS...and very frustrating when they beat YOU- Expensive supplies- Expensive treatment to get rid of debuffs and stuff- Can get grindy- Not recommended if you hate losing RNG rolls even when your characters are leveled and equipped with good gear- Can feel a bit repetitiveGreat game... watch some playthroughs and maybe a guide, and then decide for yourself. I thoroughly enjoy the game!			"

												Genre - Roguelike Gothic FantasyI waited until the full release to post a review as there were a few key things missing from early access like achievements. Now after playing the game some more I can safely recommend it. Although it is roguelike it plays as a side scrolling dungeon crawler with parties of four. You are situated in a village allowing for weapon and skill upgrades as well as the recruiting of new adventurers (expect some to die along the way). There are quite varied classes, although maybe another tyoe of party healer is required, as there are only two classes that do this role effectively. As you complete each dungeon you get heirlooms, these can then be used to upgrade your village amenites. You can choose out of a few areas at once with bosses along the way to fight, meaning you won't get stuck in just one area with the smae baddies for ages. The combat can be challenging but not impossible (as far as I know, I am still near the start).What makes this game stand out is the stress effect on your characters as you explore each dungeon. Some are positive but most are negative. For instance they might become abusive to other adventurers increasing their stress or paranoid and avoid being healed etc. To help with this you use the tavern or the abbey to calm them down. Meaning you will constantly be rotating your party for each mission. There are also disease effects to account for and sometimes personal preference like being god fearing etc.The art style itself is fairly unique and very atmospheric and the voice acting of the plot driver is fantastic.It is a fun game that pushes the boundaries of the genre and can be played in short doses with persistent progression to your village and characters, if they survive that is...

												Some Good, Some BadThe general gameplay is pretty decent, a turn-based dungeon explorer. That said, there's a lot of elements that are really just frustrating to deal with. The stress system, while sometimes fun (It feels pretty awesome when you hit 100 stress and your character gets a heroic bonus instead of crumbling under the stress like the majority of characters do) is more annoying than anything. When maximum stress hits the character has a heart attack, dropping their health to zero and debuffing them for the remainder of the dungeon, which can be a group killing experience. To avoid this you're expected to ""treat"" the character's stress by leaving them in the local bar or church while you go on your next adventure. This leads to a lot of characters leveling up at different rates. This wouldn't be too bad, but there's invisible barriers between characters of certain levels. For instance, level 3 characters can't embark with level 2 characters. This causes problems where the only characters available on your roster are two level 3s, and two level 2s, because everyone else is healing from stress or illness. Except you can't embark with that group, because theyre separate level groups. So what do you do? Well, you can either take a highly stressed character out of the bar or church because you need some lower leveled guys to adventure with to get some people up to level 3. I realize its supposed to be a matter of how to manage the team, but it's more frustrating than anything. A high stressed character IS going to have a heart attack during the dungeon and ruin the run, and dismissing them to hire a new recruit is just really annoying. Then there's the spontaneous difficulty spikes. For instance one dungeon, suggested for level 1 characters, asks you to kill a specific character, a ""boss"". The ""boss"" character all of a sudden is able to knock two characters down to 1 health in one attack, and gets multiple attack turns in one round. Meanwhile all before this I had been playing level 1 dungeons, others with boss characters that were nowhere near this difficulty. It's just ridiculous, because there's no reason or expectation of such power in a level 1 dungeon.There's also the low drop rates of gold, which you need to spend more and more of on supplies just to survive the dungeon, but then also need to use to upgrade characters and heal their stress and ailments. There's barely enough money to go around, which makes advancing characters a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ especially when they'll just die to an encounter with an enemy like I mentioned in the last paragraph. Overall, I find the game frustrating, but there are redeeming aspects, like having a solid team making dungeons a challenging, but rewarding experience (but like I mentioned with the level-tier separations that can get messed up really quickly) I'd recommend it to people that like repeating tedious elements, because you will be losing characters, and re-running the same dungeons to level up new characters again. I've read that the game is more of a team-management game than a dungeon crawler, which kind of rings true. The important part of the game seems to be more in how you handle healing characters and the meager funds you get. If you're into that aspect, and dont care that much about whether your characters survive in the long run then you might like the game. I feel the game is misrepresented as a dungeon crawler RPG, and thats only a part of the game, which is more often frustrating than enjoyable. If all you want is to dungeon crawl, a different game might be more up your ally. If you want to manage your team of weaklings, and can accept that most of them are going to die then you might like the game.Generally, I don't recommend the game, because I don't think it appeals to a wide audience and most people are going to go into it expecting an experience much different than what it actually is, but if you fall within a specific niche of gamers that prefer team-management games and grim-dark fantasy you might be one of the people that really like Darkest dungeon.

Early Access Review
								Initial few hours were amazing. But after that the game feels like a mess. Needs a lot more changes made to it. This game has done well and been in early access for a year and there doesn't seem to be any meaningful changes, which is why im giving it a negative review.  Most changes have been nerfing strategies. Instead of actually improving the core experience. This game feels more on tedious side rather than true difficulty. My personal problems were ;--maintenance costs for stress and ailments too high.-The Ideal way to play is to recruit disposable scrubs every week to run them through easy dungeons.-Game-time spent playing feels unrewarding.-progression feels unwhelming-RNG should toned down, You should not be ambushed at max torch.Some design choices i dislike-The stress system has been overtuned.-LvL 3 or higher not being able to enter low level dungeons. This is just another layer of  pointless tedium added. Which contributes nothing in terms of gameplay. If you can defeat dungeons with a level 3 you can do the same with level 0s. -The trait system is punishing not rewarding. Good traits disappear without your control. But red traits will just keep piling on. To remove the bad traits its tedious since you can only 1 per week.Certain heroes need some help. Like the plague doctor and the jester.			"

Early Access Review
Luck-based mission: The gameThe verdict: I wanted to like this game, but I can't. This is the game for you if you're a supernaturally lucky person. Otherwise, can't recommend.The good: The writing is excellent. The graphics do a very good job of getting the overall mood across and are creepy without getting overboard. The character classes are quite interesting. The music and sound effects are also pretty cool, and I love the overall idea of this game. However...The bad: Success or failure is mostly random. This makes the game difficult, as advertised, but it is an extremely frustrating sort of difficulty. The game may give you a mission with eight combat rooms and corridors full of further combats and traps, or it may generate a mission with tons of loot and maybe a single fight. In combat, one crit from your enemy - or even an enemy using a particular attack, chosen at random - will often lead to a situation going rapidly out of control. If your party ever gets surprised (random chance), you may as well pack in then and there. You'll frequently have to skip a full turn to get everyone into a position where they can actually do something, and by that time your party will have a crippling amount of damage inflicted on it. It is generally not possible to salvage a bad situation. Some afflictions are utterly crippling, some stressed-out characters will skip their turns, whether a character who is ""at Death's Door"" will live is up to chance and so forth. Abandoning a mission (if you can roll a success on your flee-from-combat attempt!) will leave you with a group of stressed-out characters and not enough money to outfit a worthwhile expedition, so you'll have to go back to grinding the Ruins for a while so you can get another shot at the success roulette. Most combat skills also have random effects (apart from miss chance and dodge chance); the Occultist's heal skill, for instance, can do anything from ""heal 10"" to ""inflict 3"". This is not good gameplay. This is a slot machine. "

Early Access Review
								Do not get attached to a character. I recommend names like expendable1-99, youwilldie, and nottodaychump. Playthrough1I named my first characters after me and two of my best friends. We all died. We didn't all die peacefully, no that's too easy. Bestfriend1 went insane and starting abusing us for everything. Naturally we all got sad and depressed. I joined crazytrain next, I was fearful of everything and basically cried every fight. Bestfriendtwo finally went insane when I got stabbed to death. He was paranoid and didn't accept healing because he thought people were going to kill him, which ended up killing him... Oh that random guy that was in my party? yea he became virtuous and tried to coral the remaining members until everyone died.So I got mad and deleted that entire save. I couldn't take seeing us in the graveyard.Playthrough2  went almost exactly the same except I got a little further. Deletedon Playthrough3 after reading up on some tips on survival, doing great only two random people died. (also don't delete your playthrough, I wasn't really aware that you could upgrade your town and everything)On a serious note the game is really fun right now. I've put I think 18 hours or so into it and haven't even searched the other regions (I think there are 4-5 of them) I'm a noob I know but I like to take my games slow and max stuff out.I'd like them to add armor and weapon drops to the game instead of just leveling up your current armor. Turn the game into a semi-dungeon diver type game where you not only complete the story but search for the best items. Just my personal opinion. BETA RATING8.0/10 Still highly recommend, the developer(s) are constantly updating it so I'm sure there is more to come.			"

Early Access Review
								I can not recommend this game, because it is no fun but you will get angry.There is nothing really do achieve, everything you earn you will loose again.This game is not difficult, it is just cheating in order to keep you from advancing.The game is very repetitive, you prepare, go in, get out, heal up...and start again...Imagine you spend like five to six hours to prepare your group to take on that boss, level them up, get them items, lock in the right quirks and get rid of the real bad ones...then you are one room before the boss fight, you rest and get all hitpoints up, get rid off almost all of the stress and buff your group. During the rest you get jumped by a group of monsters you killed off by the dozents before. But this group is the ""cheating"" one, almost all of their hits are criticals and they dodge most of your attacks. Before you can even take your first action, one of your group gets critted by the first mob, the second mob does an AoE and kills him off. It´s your turn but your stun doesnt stick (despite the +40% stun chance trinket) and your second attack gets dodged. Enemy turn, critical, next AoE and another one of the group is dead. You try to retreat on your next turn, of course you dont get away, next guy is down to zero hitpoints, then dies in the next round. Your last guy gets lucky and away in the next round. First time I thought: ""Oh well, bad luck. I´ll just try again."" So I start again to prepare that group, this time with a different mix of heroes...and now after the fourth of fifth time I can tell when that one fight comes and retreat just before I get wiped again. I wonder if that tactic is intended by the devs, but I guess not. It´s a build in mechanic to f*** you over as soon as you have a bit more cash, some high level characters or what god knows. Anyway, it feels like work and not like a game. It kept me busy, sure, but there are much better games out there that wont frustrate you and instead relax you and give you a good experience and not that kind of deep down angry feeling you get when you are getting cheated over and over.

Early Access Review
								I am afraid that, in its current state, I cannot recommend this game. The shortest way to put it is the game is far too unforgiving, to the point that it will punish you even after a good performance. I will begin with the negatives and wrap up with the positives at the end, seeing as how I prefer to get the bad out before the good.Games like X-COM allow you to comfortably mitigate the randomness with proper strategy, skill, and caution. This game has many of the same elements: you need to know when to cut your losses on a mission or quest, you need to have good squad composition and know how to effectively use each class, you need to plan your missions and battles, and you need to use upgrades, abilities, and items to their fullest extent. The seeds are planted here for an excellent game.What lacks, however, is fairness and logic. When my entire squad misses their attacks or puts out a pittance, while the enemy continues to pummel me with a wealthy stream of critical hits several rounds and battles in a row - sometimes for an entire dungeon crawl - the game just becomes hard for the sake of it. It's also really ridiculous how an enemy critical hit will cause huge stress in the 10 and 20's for the entire team, while critical hits by my party reduces stress by maybe 5 if I'm lucky, and I'll be even luckier if it affects 2 or more party members. It all occurs too often.Then, in this game, the abilities your party uses are affected by positioning, and it's very common for sudden effects at the beginning of a battle to jumble where everyone is, and it's not entirely clear how this is factored. Not even initiatives are clear to me, with turn order going all over the place (although I may not be looking at the right places). Considering that it seems to always be random, and in favor of the AI, it ends up punishing players who do plan ahead with party positioning and composition. Even when your characters find maps or do (again, completely random) scouting and you know where the enemies are, they can still ambush you and throw your party into disarray despite their preparedness. Certain enemies have skills that do this and you can plan depending on where you are deploying, since enemy types differ by location, but the randomness is unfair.Sure, there are the few dungeons or battles that went in my favor. I managed to surprise the enemy (how this works I do not know), pummel them all, and then walk away unscathed or with almost no damage. In fact, I've managed to have a few dungeons go like this, even if they're not as common as my party leaving the depths of my family's ruins with under 20% health and going insane from stress. You'd think that such a positive mission would be rewarded? Wrong. When your characters level up, they get completely random Quirks that are overwhelmingly negative and require a great deal of time and money to reverse.So, even if the mission goes incredibly well, your adventurers suffering minimal to no stress or damage at the end, and you walked away with an immense amount of loot, the game does not reward your prudence and strategy. Instead, in most instances, it will still punish you. There is no logic. I had one of my adventurers with minimal damage and almost no stress at the end of a mission receive both the ""On Guard"" and ""Off Guard"" Quirks upon leveling up. This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.It is also possible for adventurers to gain both positive and negative Quirks by interacting with different objects while exploring, such as book cases, urns, and corpses. You will almost always get a heaping helping of negative ones, some of which can render your adventurer completely useless for in-game weeks as you dump thousands of gold into Sanitorium visits, which are used to remove negative Quirks. This renders the huge number of objects on missions utterly pointless as the risk of toying with them is far too high. This means that a great deal of what the developers have put in is, in fact, completely useless. The slim possibility that you will receive a positive trait that almost always offers little benefit stands in stark, bold-faced, italicized, and underlined contrast to the oft-crippling effects of negative Quirks.Then there is the confusing and counter-intuitive Provisions system. At the beginning of every mission, you must purchase food, torches, and any other items you think that you may need for the mission, such as bandages, healing herbs, skeleton keys (for locked chests), and shovels (for debris, which otherwise cost Health and Stress to remove). These items, however, are useless after the mission. There are permanent items in the form of charms and trinkets you can keep in a party inventory at home base (almost none of which you will use because the drawbacks of these trinkets render their buffs useless), but apparently your characters just throw away torches, potions, shovels, and other items that could last for months after leaving the dungeons. I could totally understand food being useless between the weeks, but it's really frustrating to buy items only to find they're useless in one particular crawl, and then to eschew them the next only to see that you need the items you did not buy in abundance.There are still some real positives about the game. The issues I have mentioned are things that can be fixed with tweaking and do not require the developers to throw out huge chunks of what they've already made in order to rebuild. As it currently stands, the developers have an admirable piece of work. The art is very crisp and appealing, making the game just nice to look at. The upgrading system is not ovely punishing and even having to grind low-level dungeons for the items you need for upgrades is not terrible as it gives you the chance to level up newly-recruited adventurers and learn how they best function together (aforementioned issues notwithstanding).Even money seems to be balanced enough at the moment. The music is well produced and the game runs perfectly, at least on my rig, and it does not seem to be particularly demanding - which thus makes it an appealing game for people who have economy rigs. Animations are smooth and the narrator is interesting (although that son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ can be really patronizing when you're losing, not to mention repetitive), offering commentary and even some bits of lore throughout your travels. There are a plethora of classes and skills which keep things interesting and give you a lot to play with as the in-game weeks press on and you continue to delve into the corrupted ruins your ancestor so feverishly pursued.What I love most about the Narrator's is his commentary about the player themselves: how far are you willing to go to redeem your fictitious family's honor, and do you really care about it versus the divers shinies you uncover in your wake? Admitting my own hubris, I have had an entire party wipe because I delved into the ruins for more goodies even after completing the quest goals.My advice to the developers would be to make the game more fair and balanced. If you're going to make it punishing, make it punishing for a reason. There are far too many aspects of the game which are decided by pure chance, and this is both frustrating and insulting. It is frustrating to find yourself often punished even if you have a successful mission or make the strategically correct decisions, and it's insulting that the developers added in clear artificial difficulty at every chance, instead of fine tuning their game.It deserves to be stressed yet again that I see a great deal of potential in this game and its developers. I like having some randomness to my games, or else they become easy and predictable once you figure out how it works. What Darkest Dungeon does, however, it is takes the randomness way too far. Should the developers make satisfactory changes, I will update my review in kind, and change my recommendation as such.			"

Early Access Review
								Game mechanics are still unbalanced in my opinion.Stress builds up way too fast without a reliable healing method - one stressed character often causes a chain reaction to ramp the stress for the party up to +30 a turn. HP heal is also poorly designed. The only way to heal is in-combat as each food heals only one HP. Having to grind 5 mins in a combat by chain-stunning an enemy is not the way to go. Also, there are not enough stun and heal skills to reliably pull this off early-game. Items are way too expensive. The item pouch is too small, given the plethora of mechanics in this game (torch level, stress, bleed, blight, HP, artifact cleansing, path clearing, etc). Even after ending a dungeon, players should be able to keep the items for the next quest.The combat mechanics are too RNG-based, rather than skill-based. Opponents seem to dodge a significantly larger amount than the player. Keep in mind that the villains' attacks also out-hit the players in HP and stress, which makes it tough as you will need to heal for two categories at a large cost. "

												At first, I thought the negative reviews on this game were unfair. Complaining about the grind or RNG? It was like these people had never played a roguelike before. However, after sinking close to 100 hours on this game, I sadly have to agree with their sentiments.This game's atmosphere is excellent. Its presentation is top-notch. The actual gameplay is intuitive yet complex (and so, of course, incredibly fun). It really does quite a bit right. But the game demands an incredible amount of time. And considering the many, many different ways it can set you back, it feels like a waste rather than an investment. A single hero's death can set you back hours. Retreating from a quest--usually a necessary and reasonable precaution--becomes an infuriating experience after you've spent the last hour and a half trying to chase down an objective that spawned at the very end of a very long map. Random town events can hinder--or even undo--your progress. Shoot, even the mechanics behind completing the eponymous Darkest Dungeon--which I will keep relatively unspoiled--is geared to extending the already extremely long grind.This game takes skill, without question. Many mishaps after embark that appear like the cruel hand of RNGesus can actually be traced to small--often ostensibly innocuous--errors of judgment earlier along the adventure. However, like any game involving chance, sometimes luck isn't on your side. And RNGesus help you when it's not. Really, I feel this is a great game, but it is also a game that overstays its welcome (in addition to eating all your food, spilling chili on your carpet, and stealing your last $20.00 bill from the wallet you had left on the counter).

Early Access Review
								Ok so while I really like the game and the general idea there are couple reason why I will again give this a negative review. Yes, the game is a challenge, the game is tactic based and yes the game has a big replay value until a certain point. While you might feel you mastered the dynamics, the trinkets/spells/camping setup, the RNG and unbalanced minions will eventually beat you after you start doing the champion challenges. You might feel that everything is doing fine after you realize that the minions stats do not really scale with your heroes stats meaning that the higher level you get, the lower damage you deal due to the fact that every minion now has ridiculou dodge/prot/crit ratings which makes the no longer a challenge but a dice roll. The size 2 minions can one shot you with non crit atacks (treebranch smackdown from the troll hits for 30+ non crit, 55+ crit), the bleed/blight now deals an insane amount of damage per turn while the game absolutely ignores your resists. I have for example 90%+ on both bleed and blight but I would still only resists those kind of atacks about 2/10 times. As for today I lost 4  lvl 6 characters in only an hour gameplay (dont have to mention how long it takes to pimp out your heroes) because I just wouldnt beat the dice rolls (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instagibs, bleed/blight dealing 12 per tick..) which makes it utterly frustrating experience. There is just still so much work to be done on this game and if you dont want to rage destroy your rig I suggest you play something where only your decisions and skills have the impact on the game. This game so far is fairly both luck based and improperly mechanized while being pretty unrewarding at the same time. I am pretty sure that once proper changes are made this game will kick asses but as for now that is not the case. It is still early acces so I do have high hopes for this.			"

												Some other reviewers have done a great job highlighting the game's quality. I may only focus on arguing with the common negative arguments.1. ""Only RNG ! No skill !""Rules and RNG are tough and you need to plan carefully and know when to withdraw.Leave the loot, spend much less to fix the characters ; use the extra left to harden them instead.Discipline, planning, analysis are mandatory when approaching late game.Greed == Casulaties + Bankrupt2. ""It's mostly grind, hence dull""Not untrue. But art quality and the plenty variable parameters make things fresh and surprising on most runs. I personally hate grinding-based gameplay, but this game doesn't feel like that to me.3. ""I am on Windows 10 and it keeps crashing""TL;DR: Don't be too tough on that one, W10 made many older things break.Please consider in your reviews the game initially targetted Windows 7/8 (runs fine on 7 BTW) and many prior-existing games and software titles are no longer  (and still not)  stable on Windows 10 as of writing.Microsoft made some weird/aggressive choices addressing the retrocompatibility with Win8/7. One of those apparently being: the user is now a software tester.What that really means here, is that the devs have to spend extra bucks on working around ""novelties"" on W10, rather than making new contents or fixing their own bugs.Edited: style, less ranting, more TL;DR "

								After fifteen hours of play, I must admit a game I started out enjoying has simply become unending frustratiom. The combat in my opinion seems unbalanced highly favoring the enemy modes you will face. The rewards are always two edged and exploration usually leads to ruin. Another annoying factor is more powerful heros can't help lower level ones after a point. If your looking for  an extremely difficult, frustrating game that has more defeats than victories this is the game for you, it is very true to its name. It just frankly gets old after awhile  failing more than you succeed.			"

								While the wonderful artsyle and unique concepts are what originally pulled me in to this game, the completely jumbled and unrewarding gameplay are what I find ultimately ruins the experience. This game is a constant random dice roll. Nothing is satisfying when random chance carries more weight in the game than actual strategy and planning. The combat is simply a dps/crit race that punishes any and all defensive type tactics. The quirks each character gains at the end of a dungeon have no rhyme or reason, it is complete chance what postitive or negative buffs each character will gain at the end of a dungeon. The game is trivially easy if you simply put your ""A"" team on a pedestal and just have your ""B"" team, made up of completely free and expendable newly hired's, grind suicide missions.			"

								Many other reviews sufficiently extol the virtues of this excellent game, so I'll say what nails it for me.I have quite a demanding full time job; as a result, I don't get long periods of time where I can commit to sitting down and gaming (much to the chagrin of my DOTA allies).  The fact that you can quit a dungeon at any time, and return to the exact place, means that I can get my 15-minute fix without fear of losing progress.  It is a brilliant feature.Beyond that, the art, audio, and gameplay are some of the best I've encountered in my 25 years of gaming.If I were to offer some constructive criticism, I'd suggest including the following:- the ability to lock/remove positive quirks, as they're currently randomly replaced; this can limit one's opportunity to hone specific characters for specific areas.- the ability to sell trinkets, and for more varied ones to be offered in the shop; currently there aren't that many different ones on offer.- an option to swap weapons to gamble or min-max abilities.  For example, swapping a Crusader's sword for a warhammer might boost his attack but limit his accuracy.  Giving a Leper a pike could do the opposite.I can't wait for the new areas and the new classes.  A SINGULAR STRIKE!			"

												A game thats all about luck.. bad luck that is. You can enjoy this game for a hundred hours but inevitably you will face a ciruation where you will have a charecter or an entire party die simply to terrible luck and bad game mechanics, and you will throw your hands up in frustration because you will face the terrible grind to recover. This is an incredibly fun and beutifully made game, everything from the charecters to the evironment is fantastic so think about how terrible the grind must be to invalidate all that... Save yourself the frustration you will envariably feel and pass on this...			"

								This game is absolutely 100% broken, through and through. There are hard games at which one has to ""git gud,"" and then there are games that are so unbelievably dominated by random number generators that even the smallest degree of success is more appropriately credited to a coin flip than any particular skill or strategy. Darkest Dungeon is absolutely in the latter category.""Stress"" is perhaps this game's most important element and key mechanic. In simple terms, stress wrecks your characters' performance and can make them do things like skip their turns, self-harm, or even attack one another. Stress is bad; stress is evil; stress is a game-over-you-may-delete-your-entire-campaign-now button. It is also 100% unavoidable, and will constantly be inflicted upon you even throughout the tutorial.Your characters begin their first missions pre-stressed, and light fades so quickly that you cannot travel from one single room to the next nearly without burning two fresh torches, lest you begin taking enormous stress penalties. Enemies constantly land critical hits that inflict insane stress on you, and many of them have standard attacks that do so simply as an added effect. In many missions there is no way to mitigate the accumulation of stress, leading to key characters' unavoidable meltdowns. Healing spells are incredibly weak, unreliable, and few and far between. I've missed more attacks than I can count against enemies with dodge ratings of ZERO. There are no healing items or stress reducing items consumable between battles, save for *occasional* camping in select missions—and even then the abilities you have available (at least initially) are randomly selected for you when your characters are created. Invisible traps randomly damage your heroes and—you guessed it!—increase their stress levels. When enemies land critical hits it tends to increase the victim's stress by 10-20 at a time; however, when YOU crit against an enemy you'll be lucky to see yours reduced by 5 as a ""bonus."" Honestly, I could go on and on and on and not even begin to crack the surface of just how broken this game is. It's not just salt: the game is a nigh-unplayable mess.Darkest Dungeon opens up with the promise that the game will beat you, permanently kill your characters, and otherwise make you cry. What it doesn't tell you is that this will ALWAYS happen to EVERY party you organize, regardless of what time and care you invest in them—or that even leveling up after successful missions has a large chance of adding debilitating ""quirks"" to your characters. (You then have to pay thousands of gold and spend an entire mission without them available to remove said afflictions. You'll go bankrupt overnight doing this once or twice early on.)I wanted so badly to love this game but I've been forced to restart my campaign upwards of ten times and have never beaten the second boss. I've upgrated armor, weapons, finely-tuned my abilities, but nothing matters in the end. Everything fails, always. Twice I've completely quit playing for a month or more just to see if when I return a patch has better balanced the game. If anything, it has gotten more abusive over time.I want the developers to know that this is the most sorely cheated I have ever felt as a gamer. I'm a Dark Souls veteran who loves a challenge, but THIS is not challgening. It's just flat-out cheap and blatantly unbalanced. This game is fundamentally broken and its designers owe us all personal, handwritten apologies along with full refunds.DO NOT PAY FOR THIS GAME! You have been amply warned.			"

								Artistic direction is top notch, the atmosphere is awesome, excellent ideas.got 19/22 Legend Characters. Hamlet is fully upgraded. played a 100h with multiple playthroughsI love the game a little less than I hate it. And I can safely say the experience with this game was dreadfull, the learning curve is ludacriss (difficulty is backwards the level 1-3 are the hardest).And once you've learned it, you don't feel good about it, like you've achieved anything, you're just jadded. You won't feel like you are headed anywhere, or achieving anything.I don't recommend it in it's current state, nor later if it desperatly chases it's ultra punishing low reward, high risk angle.I am not new to challenging RNG turn based tactical games, but this game is just looking to ruin your team. -It will look for every occasion / excuse to screw you and your team over, outside and inside dungeons.-Heroes will leave for random amounts of time or pick up quirks from stress relief. -Your line-up is dictated to you depending on who is stressed, who's left, who had to be cured, who died.- Your higher level heroes can't help your lower level hereos to level up, got 3 level 1 caracters in a full roster?Tough break Rowena ! you need to be 4 to go in a dungeon, or just wait to a level 6 caracter dies ! Oh It will happen, don't worry from some convenient and suspicious accumulation of bad luck , or as of yet unseen and unsuspected and equally sudden and surprising enemy coordination.-Didn't do the bosses at level 1 and 3 to keep your roster alive? Oh well ! no bosses for you at level 6 you can delete them saves and start over cupcake !-You can enter and leave a dungeon without touching anything and gets quirks and sicknesses.-you can get syphilis and scurvy by reading books (probably a pirate themed book). -It will on one hand commend you for being wise when retreating to keep your heroes alive, while plaging them with stress, diseases and quirks if you do so. -It will take away control away from you very often, systematically to punish you.-Every hard earned trinket's bonusses are offset with equaly crippling minuses or conditions for use.to the point were in some instances I do wonder if they don't just cancel themselves out on the long run.-You will gain 18 stress from a crit received, loose 3 for a crit delivered. -Enemies most devastating mooves have no cooldown and they can spam you with it if you are unlucky.-You will feel like your legendary heroes in artifact gear are the same mighty wimps and spineless weasels you started with.It is weighted to go south, for you to go from bad to worse. It's more concerned about earning a reputation of a really hard game than actually making it fun to play, it was a few months back. This isn't your regular very hard but fair kind of game, it's mostly about probability defying buIIshit RNG than making the right calls. If you are looking for a good time, I'd look elsewhere if I were you.			"

												I'll start with the fact that I can't say I've enjoyed this game. I've tried. I played it and I've played it.People might like it because it's hard, but it is not hard in a fair way. It's just hard from a RNG point of view. Here's 20 percent chance of you having to grind another 10 hours of the game because the game decided to ♥♥♥♥ you over.I kinda think that somewhere along the line the developers sat down together and thought, oh gee, this game is kinda short... let us just add all these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things so that we make it longer. From the fact that you heroes are divas and don't want to go into lower level dungeons to the fact that you can use them once in the endgame, it's all there.People might argue that it's in the them of the game, yeah sure, but theres atmosphere and there's enjoyment. This lacks on the latter.			"

								After having my fully healed party die in the second room of my second dungeon run (I had to abandon the *very first* one due to my party getting wiped with little to no meds left to heal themselves, which is okay, I expected that coming into the game) from STUPID amounts of stress hitting them every second which in turn caused them to have heart attacks and have my whole party wipe, I think I'm done with this game until that gets fixed, or from what I've been reading up on, UNFIXED. (the amount of stress that was coming from my own party was insane, every single turn one ♥♥♥♥er was bickering at another over something, and then the whole 4 person party decided to take on truck loads of stress.)Please tell me, how the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to ""get new heroes"" when the new ones are ♥♥♥♥ing killing themselves from stress when I can't even make it through one dungeon due to getting wiped before I can even complete one quest?!?! Everything I've been reading makes it sound like this game used to be fun and a decent ""challenge"" at the start, but now it's just an illogical mess. I kickstarted this game and it REALLY seems like a good game is underneath it all, but ♥♥♥♥ if I can find it.I'm expecting the ""git gud"" comments, but I'd like some actual thought out help or thought processes on to why the dev did this.

								I really want to like this game. The idea behind it is very very cool - the effects of dungeoneering on your heroes' minds.BUT, the game itself is RIDICULOUSLY hard, and not in a clever way either. No matter what you do - what level or upgrades your party has or what character classes you put in a party - the game ALWAYS stacks the odds against you. There's nothing that can be done if you have a bad roll. Or 2. Or 10. Or 20. I hope the devs can figure out an intelligent way to make the game hard without the RNG cheating all the time, because as it stands, there's just no point at even attempting to play the game. You will die. Popintlessly. Over and over again. Once in a blue moon you may win a dungeon or two, however, after a certain point the game starts cheating and that's it.Would I recommend this game? NO WAY!			"

												While I really liked the dark gothic tone of the story it's refelection in the mechanics really starts to grate after a while. Tense battles are all well and good but party wipes just start to become infuriating especially when you lose all your good trinkets. I can't even bother to play manipulating the game files to skip leveling characters, I'm that sick of it after one week. Would dearly like some sort of fast foward/skip animations button to the combat towards the end...At the end of the day if I'm actively feeling down due to a game, even if I liked it, then I can't reccomend it.

								It makes me very sad to give this game a thumbs down - there is so much potential. The gorgeous hand-drawn aesthetic and comically overwrought prose of the story really stand out as unique. Big, smart-sounding words will be misused (swarthy means dark-skinned, you guys), the low-low-low gamma will make you squint at your screen, and the 'heroes' will dodder around on-screen like children playing dress-up. The hamfistedness really works out favorably overall, though you may tire of the rasping narrator after the 50th time he tells you about the “dancing steps of war”.The heroes themselves are diverse and unique, and the sheer number of classes (10 and counting), skills, and personality quirks mean that no two are ever quite alike. Your nymphomaniac  Plague Doctor will save you cash by being… efficient at the brothel, but his Fear of Beasts will make him pretty damned worthless in the Weald (where he probably acquired the Fear in the first place after contracting rabies from a dog). Luckily, you can forcibly remove his phobia (for a steep fee) at the Sanitarium, where you can also cure the rabies. In addition, there is also a really great gameplay mechanic called ‘Stress’. As they’re subjected to more and more horrors in the dungeons, each heroes’ stress level increases until a critical point at which they crumble, becoming an abusive, cowardly, selfish, or (extremely rarely) more heroic version of themselves. In between dungeon runs, the heroes can spend a week or two blowing off steam at the Tavern or Church (though I’m still not sure how self-flagellation can possibly be as effective as a visit to the brothel).  Thus, even though you can only use 4 heroes at any given time, you’ll want a sizable roster to rotate them in and out of your lineup. This also forces you to use vastly different combinations; sometimes you’re  just stuck with three healers and a mage with the red plague on a given week and you have to make a dungeon run anyway. All of this sounds great, doesn’t it? Why am I giving this a thumbs down? Unfortunately, the gameplay is entirely dominated by compounding randomness. The damage ranges are wide as a barn, critical hit and dodge percentages are huge; even aoe’s can be completely dodged or be complete critical hits. Blight, bleeding, and disease resistances similarly operate on an all-or-nothing percentage basis. The net result is that your careful strategic choices, character development plans, and painstaking expenditures have very little bearing on success or failure. Your awesome high-hp crusader could be killed from full health by the very first group of enemies you encounter on a dungeon run before you even get a turn. This is true of *any* group of enemies you encounter, whether the first or the 20th, whether you’ve been dominating all of them or not, whether you’ve made wise choices or simply clicked on whatever skill seemed cool at the time. I don’t mind punishing difficulty when it can be circumvented by skill and strategy (e.g., Dark Souls; XCOM), but neither of those traits need apply here.Because of this, it feels less like a game and more like a spectator sport. You’re on a rollercoaster, watching various heroes die. There isn’t any significant progression in strength, and micromanaging the various traits becomes a chore because really, what does it all matter? The repetitive runs through the dark dungeons yield nothing permanent or tangible. Worse, there is never any doubt that you’ll prevail eventually; throw enough heroes at it and eventually the dungeon will divulge its secrets through sheer numerical luck. The feelings of difficulty and danger *aren’t even real*.  Perhaps this will change through development, but I doubt it. The game designers seem to have embraced randomness as difficulty instead of more complex gameplay mechanics. But, that’s life – sometimes your lead programmer is fearless but flatulent, your head designer has photomania and misanthropy, while your story writer is lazy-eyed, a clutch hitter, and a known cheat. If only they could have assembled the perfect team… but life just doesn’t work that way. Maybe video games should, though.			"

												Ok, I have now played this game A LOT! So that should suggest that I really like the game?Well, no.The problem is that the challenge/difficultly doesn't scale. Starting out at lower levels the game is fair, even easy once you know the combination of classes and abilities to take into each different dungeon. The middle levels become more challenging: you'll lose people, have to quit quests to save surviving characters, and so on. Tough but doable.The problem is the final level. Here nothing is balanced. The RNG coupled with enemies having high dodge, high resistances, and crippling damage and critical hit chances makes every enemy hell to fight. Meanwhile your characters do not get significantly more powerful, it costs far more to get rid of stress and disease, and the trinkets you find don't get any more powerful.Net result is every battle at the highest level is one bad round away from disaster. Quiting costs too much and you soon have no gold to destress characters. You can sack everyone and return to the easy level but that justs adds to the grind, and you'll hit that top level lottery eventually.Until the devs balance the top level better this game will not reach the quality that it is aiming for. I know that they are working on things but the Steam achivements tell you all you need to know - almost no one plays through to the end.I will have another look after the next update and will Update this review if things are improved.

								For early access, where they've been making good steady progress on developement,  this game is remarkably far along.  It feels like I could play over 100 hours and still not be done with the content already in the game.The gameplay is difficult but mostly fair once you get a hang of it. There is a HUGE learning curve, but it's fun to figure it out as you go.  Each new trick learned rewards you immediately and gives a sense of accomplishment.The art style is awesome and unique, the setting is dark and engaging, and the narrator is a breath of fresh air.I'd like to see a shop or something to sell the items you accrue, since you get an enormous amount of ones you'll never use.I'm hoping they add a stronger sense of direction/story.  It's tons of fun but the world starts to feel small and the engaging setting/story isn't utilized nearly enough after the beginning of the game.These cons are vastly outweighed by the pros, especially considering this game is still early access.

												This game hates you!No matter how much I love it, this game always puts me in harsh situations, shows me how weak I am and brutally slaughters everyone I like. Kinda like my ex.But that's what makes the game so incredibly good: It's incredibly DARK. Your enemies are wretched creatures, mad, undead or the disgusting outcomes of the most horrible experiments since that one time when Metallica decided to make an album with Lou Reed.Your 'heroes' are a band of outcasts, fight for their own causes, have wierd manias and personalities, go mad and endanger all that you have been working for.There is NO SAVE HAVEN! When you come back to town with your decimated party, your B-team that was recovering from the last quest, has turned into a band of PTSD-ridden wierdos. Your Crusader has run off with a hooker, the Bandit is hungover, the Nun has an STD and the jester gambled away all your money. And then there is also your Plague doctor, who refuses to leave the local church and the Graverobber who has become addicted to more substances than Lindsey Lohan.Now pick your four favourite adventurers and watch them die in the dungeon, just because one of them got a disease, because he thought that half-rotten corpse over there was still edible. Or because your Arbalest went mad and wanted to try his crossbow from the front ranks, or because you did not bring enough torches, or because you didn't retreat that harsh battle, or because you took the wrong turn...This game is UNFORGIVING, the most trivial mistake or wrong decision can cost you your whole team.But that's what makes it still interresting after several weeks strolling through the very repetetive dungeons, doing the same old quests. Every single battle can turn the tide. Every quest can completely change your strategies, roster and motivation.I got his game on a sale for 11€ and it has been woth every single cent of it.TL/DRAtmosphere 9/10+dark and gritty Lovecraftian tone+scary monsters, wretched heroes+'heroes' have personalities+constant threat, even outside the dungeon+awesome dark-comic-style+excellent narrator...-... who has some over-the-top lines since the new updateGameplay(7/10)+strategy meets RPG+permadeath makes every situation intense+you can always improve something+even after 20+ hours there is some new detail to learn+stress-mechanic is a great innovation+-unforgiving-at times unfair (luck-based)-repetetiveI highly recommend this game!

												The primary reason for people not recommending this game is because the difficulty got ramped up for release and it now requires actual thinking.  This is a difficult game and it was advertised as such, so people should stop whining and get good.If you don't like punishing games then there's no shame in passing on Darkest Dungeon, it's a matter of preference. But criticising this game for being difficult is like complaining over My Little Pony having too many ugly ponies - it's literally the entire ♥♥♥♥ing point of the stupid thing.Hate it or love it - what Darkest Dungeon intends to do it does really well.

												Out of the hundreds of games I played for the last 20-25 years few games made me feel the thrill and rush of experiencing something new, and yet here this game accomplishes the same sensation after all these years. But there is a catch, you will surely have lots of fun for the first 10 to 20 hours and after a while as you progress in the game your fun will diminish slowly and convert to frustration as you reach end game content. The game mechanics for the last dungeon (Darkest Dungeon) are what gamers has been complaining about. I have to admit that they are right, the game turns to be an absolute grinding cycle in the end.I have started new games several times just to fiddle with different team compositions, different trinkets and different sets of skills. After all this hours of deep playing into the game I can surely say; Yes there are balance issues, and surely the end game grinding kills the fun out of it but if you ignore the last dungeon (at least until the devs decide to rebalance or change it) you are definitely looking at a gem.Ps: The narration (although it gets repetitive after a while) is simply astonishing. I have to admit that I may have watched the intro at least a dozen times and started at least half a dozen new games just to watch the beginning cinematic :)			"

The narrator is fun without being a non-stop noise machine like in Bastion.  Game play is brutal, things can go to♥♥♥♥♥♥in an instant or succeed marvelously.  It really is half strategy half luck.  It really works with the style of the game though to feel less cheep and more of ""this world is a horrible place"".  It's one of those games where you have to be ok with working really hard on something and then watching it die a horrible death in an instant.			"

								This is an early access review. Before buying, you have to know that THIS IS A GREAT GAME, BUT ONLY WHEN IT WORKS. There are still numerous bugs  which may cause crashes or prevent the game from loading. Take a look at the forums and see how many people are having problems.The dev team is working hard to fix these problems, but at the moment, they are still numerous and hazardous to the player experience.My advice would be to wait for a more stable build.

								This game is amazing. It remains challenging and frustrating even after hours of running the same area in the dungeons. Managing the team is straigtforward enough, but quickly becomes a balancing act as the horrors of the darkness take their toll on your adventurers. 8/10 Very solid game.			"

												This game starts off great but becomes borderline unplayable mid- to late game. Artstyle, narration and atmosphere are pretty much 10/10 and the first maybe 10-20 hours of the game (though I'm generally a slow player) are a ton of fun. The dungeons are hard but also rewarding and interesting, your characters grow or die, develop their individual traits and get on your nerves with their quirks (in a good way). The fun ends once your characters level up to the higher quest tiers. There are level 1, 3, 5 and with the Darkest Dungeon presumably level 6 quests. Once your characters reach the respective level, they refuse to go on lower level quests, which generally would be fine. The problem is that the difficulty scaling from one tier to the other is insane and level ups themselves don't do anything for the characters. You will therefore be massively ""underleveled"", if you haven't been extremely successfull in upgrading your guild and your smithy and getting loads of money to then actually upgrade your heroes. You can then either send your best guys on runs they're not prepared for and either see them die or spend most of the money you get on their recovery OR you grind ridiculously small rewards with new arrivals.   A lot of people are complaining about the RNG but I honestly didn't have any issues with that. Yes, sometimes it can feel unfair and your party gets ♥♥♥♥ed because of a series of terrible rolls, but other times you'll see them destroy a boss with him barely being able to get a hit in, so... yeah, that's RNG for you. What really ruins this game for me is its insane difficulty scaling and artificially stretched length. I have started a couple of runs and have never gotten past the level 3 quests. To be fair, I can be pretty bad at video games but it seems like a lot of people are having similar experiences, so I don't think it's just entirely that. The game still has a lot of good elements and I can't say I completely advice people not to buy it. It's just that actually finishing it is an enormous pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and I'd reckon most people won't actually see the end if they're not extremely determined and have a very high tolerance for frustration. Makes for great streams though.			"

												I love Lovecraft. I love brutal games. I love strategic turn based RP.And I loved this game...when it first came out. And to be honest, I still do love it....but it isn't fun anymore. This game is no longer fun. The difficulty curve, as of recent patches, is just crazy now, and skill wont offset it. YOu just have to hope for good rolls of the dice. And thats fine, if the grind to breed heroes wasnt so great. That alone, as well as the fact that there isn't a way to 'loose'. At least XCOM difficulty scaled. At least you could prepare for losses and it felt urned. At least you could actually loose the game and know you were crushed. Darkest Dungeon? It just waits for you to stop playing it.DEVELOPERS: Fix late game gameplay. Fix the difficulty swing to something actually fun. Going insane and dying used to be fun. I WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME AGAIN! I recommend what this game used to be...but I do not recomment what it has become.			"

								An interesting idea turned into a massive timesink with very little reward.I hadn't played in quite a while due to the feel that it was more of a chore than a game, but I decided to give it a bit more of a go. There's a mechanic that has been added to hero stress since I played last, which feels like a massive kick in the teeth at this point. Now not only do characters max out their stress bar and develop what is usually a mental illness or other negative character trait that requires time and money to cure, but the maxed out bar can now fill up a second time and give the character a heart attack if it fills the bar again. And now there are corpses left to keep enemy positions the same, whereas before they would move up when allies died. You have to go through their hit points again (if you want to waste your already precious time) to get rid of them. I'm sorry, but... whuh?So... now the game is pretty much unplayable. It was already frustrating when it took a lot of time to mash groups of garbage heroes through dungeons and chuck them after, waiting until there was enough money to take my good groups into dungeons so they could finally get some xp (which is literally THE strategy for getting anywhere in this game)... now it's just gratuitous punishment and a complete waste of time. So very disappointing.			"

												Bought early access, thoroughly enjoyed it.  Game has become worse and worse each update, the fact that you can't take heroes into the final dungeon more than once means you have to grind 5 different teams to level 6 and then equip them with proper trinkets to survive.  Complete time sink and not fun at all.  I am well past day 100, I don't want to have to play hours of the same repetitive missions just so I can complete the game.  It seems I will not be finishing darkest dungeon after all these hours I enjoyed the game how unfortunate.			"

Early Access Review
								I like roguelike elements in games, but this game punishes you not by needing to start over a 8 hour game, but by setting back your existing 8 hour game by 4 hours of playtime. Allow me to explain: Your characters level when you take them into the dungeon, but around level 4 your higher level characters will refuse to go to the lower level dungeons to help escort and level your lower-level characters. It's more or less suicide/disaster when you bring your lower level characters to higher level dungeons. This took me several hours to discover, otherwise I would have continued escorting all my low-level characters up to a decent level. It requires careful planning to make sure the exp gets spread out so no one char gets too high and becomes unusable until the rest of your team catches up(or fails to catch up because an A-lister can't go in your dungeons anymore). The problem occurs when some of your A-team chars die or are out of commision for awhile and your B-team can't compete in the current dungeons. Painstakingly raising rookies to even B-team status will literally take hours, assuming all goes well. It gets to a point where instead of ""oh crap, a char died, I'll just start over my 2-8 hour game"" you go ""oh crap, a char died, I can either trash my 8-12 hour game, or try to get back into it by investing 3 hours into a rookie and try to salvage all the time I put in"". It becomes quite tedious.ALLLLLL this could be alleviated if you could buy higher level characters(for a higher price, or not even characters that rival your high level chars, maybe just level 2 so you don't need to spend 2-3 hours grinding a few levels for your rookies).All in all, I think this game needs work. I like a roguelike, but I want punishment to be DEATH not limbo.			"

Early Access Review
								so this is the game that made me realise that gaming is a waste of time. That horrible realisation came to me when I had yet another one of my characters die because the game's mechanics are so utterly arbitrary, convoluted and befuddling that I can have my most skilled warriors miss attacks time after time and there is literally no way to anticipate or counter the sheer randomness of the game's rules. Accomplishments in this game are treated as insults, I have never seen another game be so utterly meanspirited when it comes to making progress; high level characters suddenly refuse to go on missions and become so ""stressed"" that they actually become a liability, wasting time and money trying to heal them. I lost two of my best characters killing a boss and when the mission was completed I got almost no reward, no new areas, no special equipment, buffs or any sign of progress. The game just went ""♥♥♥♥ you for killing our boss. Now do it again. And again. And again."" Combat in this game only gives the vague illusion of strategy; so much of the game is based on chance, which would be fine but the parts that are based on skill are almost impossible to work out and are governed by random factors which basically make it poinltess to even try. To top it off the enemies are just overpowered to the point of idiocy; the very few rules that actually govern combat just don't apply to your opponents, character positioning, buffs and targetting just get left by the wayside while they continue to rain hell on your characters with no indication that you're going part way to killling them. Meanwhile your characters get subjected to all sorts of pointless and petty rules and factors which just limit the entire game experience completely. The turn timer is a particular favourite; I once had two enemeis have four turns one after the other before my characters had even had their first go and there is literally nothing that can be done about it, apparently speed is a governing factor but its nigh on impossible to find your character's speed nor is it possible to actually understand what is considered good speed or find out how it compares to the speed of your enemies.The thing is I like a challenging game and turn based combat is good fun but this game makes challenge and combat frustrating and utterly boring. Xcom is one of my favourite games but in that game you can understand the limitations and rules governing the game, similarly with darksouls the game is unbelievably hard but you can work strategy into your game and when you make progress you actually make progress, the game rewards you in ways Darkest Dungeon just refuses to. I will say that this is one of the most beautifully designed and atmospheric games I've ever played, for several hours the game can fully immerse you in its world delightfully and then you just find yourself fighting stupidly frustrating and drawn out battles and while initially the sense of triumph after completing a level will keep you going for a while there comes a point where it just stops being fun. I know that responses to this post are going to be the same standard of ""lol git gud"" or ""you just need to keep going"" but at this point I have to ask...why? Why should I keep going with a game where combat is so ridiculous and frustrating and there is just no real reward. Every mission is just the same basic nightmarish grind and when they're completed the game gives you nothing new except more grind. No new characters get unlocked (characters appear randomly and don't really bring anything new) and after the first handful of missions you'll have unlocked all the buildings and after that progress becomes meaningless. There's no benefit to completing missions apart from ""do it more"" and after a while even the analysis of the stress mechanic becomes boring, when the only interesting part of the game is ""what random negative effect has my character received now"" then I just can't see the point of the game. With combat this frustrating and such little reward even the great atmosphere starts to pall, not lest because the game kinda stops world building and just drops you into the same basic locations with the same basic enemies with no real sense of anything changing. I will say that this game is great to play with friends, not least because you can get someone else to do the grinding while you do something else for a bittl;dr this game is like great foreplay that results in terrible sex...and instead of getting to♥♥♥♥♥at the end you're told you have to have even more terrible sex again and again with only the vaguest hint of a payoff at the end, except at the end you're told you need to keep doing it over and over again. After a while you just want to stop and walk away, although if you can get more people involved it can improve somewhat. I do want to say that this is by no means a bad game, its just not fun in the end.			"

												Beyond the artistic merits, I was largely unimpressed.The game is inexplicably punishing to the point of frustration. Here me out. I am no meek gamer in the strategy world. I have completed Shogun 2 on Legendary and Xcom on Impossible Iron-man. I can take the beatings if the game world and mechanics make sense, and I get a feeling that I am contributing to my goal.In Darkest Dungeon there is one difficulty. I suppose the designers have tried to incorporate what is known as cognitive flow in game theory [1], by allowing your to choose the level of dungeon you enter with your party. You can roughly match your party to a suitable dungeon in level-wise as well as tactics wise (if you go ruins, don’t take bleed damage, for one example).Then it becomes apparent that the designers have know idea what they are doing and then BREAK the cognitive flow by not allowing you to 'game the game'. You can't take a level 3 character into a level 1 dungeon. You can't use your 'battle' skills outside of battle, but then you can't take an extra 2-3 rounds in battle to heal wounds and stress... because the game will punish you with more stress for bothering to try. Entering a level 5 dungeon is less like a move from 3 to 5, and more like a move from 3 to 10 if you know what I mean.Beyond the obvious imbalance in the game, the game will then double and triple punish you with the inane random dice that I wonder why even try in the first place? It feels like my skill and knowledge of the game becomes more irreverent the higher the dungeon level. Ironically the stress attacks in the game cause real stress to the player -- that is they are so frequent and critically boosted that it causes no-end to frustrations. Where is the fun lads?Minor gripes include the carry space is far too small for the amount of item types in the game, forcing more contrived choices with the only goal of annoying me further. There is not enough gold earned in the game, used for nearly everything useful. There are too many heirloom item drops in the game (used to unlock and build up your town).I am left to assume that the refusal to balance the game properly and provide either adequate difficulty modes or a proper working cognitive game flow, is a sign of artificially inflating the playtime of the title. Taken into account the annoying slow pop-ups that lock the control on the party, the tedious animation loops, and the drawn out combat; all of which compound to my suspicions.I hope with their financial success, they make another game and address these issues forthwith, but for me I didn't like this game despite really trying and pouring 50 hours into it. This is the counter point to looking for 'long games' to use as an example of 'good games'. This is the same problem with games like Counter Strike GO; were I clocked up 200 hours before a realisation of 'WTF am I doing'; I didn't actually enjoy nearly all of my time in those worlds. To me, they will be be forgotten and never explored again.What both these titles have in common is the overuse of catchy gimmicks in game-play and exploit this fully with shallow quest/rewards. The length of the game is not equal to the quality of my enjoyment. I was annoyed, frustrated, bored and wishing I would just find a better game to play.[1] http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/166972/cognitive_flow_the_psychology_of_.php "

												Pretty generic dungeon crawler with lots of RNG-elements up to a point where the game resembles gambling with the options you are given at your proposal. Gameplay and fights are solid but nothing special. You are usually pretty low on ressources and manpower but that's the kick you get out of these games.The game catches the atmosphere pretty well. Music, dialogue and drawings are spectacular for an indie production.If you are on a search for a nice rogue like dungeon crawler here are some alternatives which I'd recommend over Darkest Dungeon:South Park: the Stick of Truth(roguelike? no; dungeon brawler? yes)Hilarious story, pretty good immersion and the fighting is similar as in Darkest Dungeon. Not truly a rogue like as it is static by design but still a good game overall.Invisible Inc(roguelike? yes; dungeon brawler? no)Less fighting than Darkest Dungeon but very rogue like. This is also a very tense game where ressources are notoriously scarce. Instead of brawling through the stages  and killing stuff you have to make up your mind to get your job done quickly with as few encounters with enemies as possible because things can quickly run out of control. Also RNG dependent but in a much better and calculable way.Get Darkest Dungeon if you're into games like poker or when it is on sale.			"

The dialogue your characters spill out when they've lost their marbles is wonderful. This has revitalized my feelings on the current state of turn based combat. This game truly does stress you out. The art, music, and narration are a breath of fresh air. If you are a LoveCraft fan, be it his writings or games based on his works, then you will appreciate the game mechanics even more. This game is worth way more than $20. Thank you Red Hook. I look forward to giving you more money for the Vita and PS4 versions.			"

								I loved this game several versions ago.  This is one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played.  Unfortunately the developers have increased the difficulty level to the point that the game is no fun anymore.  Many of the changes the made to up the difficulty are so arbitrary and unrealistic that they break the game immersion.  At this point I wish I could get a refund.Pros:- Love the artwork, very atmospheric.- The guy who did the narration/voice work is fantastic.Cons:- The last few updates have made the game very difficult.  Some missions are borderline impossible.  - The developers are adding game elements (ie corpses) that are utterly unrealistic and break immersion, just to up the difficulty.- The game is becoming very unbalanced and unrealistic (giant worms have 80% resistance, while my crusader in maxed out plate armor has 0% resistance, really?) again just to up the difficulty level.- The game is very random.  Combat is often dominated by wild swings of extreme good luck or bad luck.  Gear and items make almost no difference. "

The Short of It: If you like permadeath, RPGs that have much tactical depth without a steep learning curve, and gorgeous, if slightly static, art, Darkest Dungeon will not disappoint you. It's punishing and difficult, but these nightmarish creatures can be felled, they can be beaten.The Long of It: Throughout Early Access, people's opinions on the game have shifted harder than a Cultist being bombarded by a Bounty Hunter's Flash Bang, which is the main reason you'll still see negative reviews, but the solution the developers finally settled on has been the absolute best one, and people not updating their reviews to reflect this is the main reason some reviews are still negative.Darkest Dungeon is a dark dungeon crawler (heh), where you lead a party of four heroes and the items you provide for them into the depths, time and again, hoping every time they'll make it out alive, knowing the possibility is very real that they won't - and if they do, they might be so traumatized and mentally scarred that you decide to let them spend the rest of their lives wandering, impoverished and unhinged. The entire game balances on the question, 'what are your heroes worth'? Given the constant influx of new hopefuls, it'll be very tempting to dismiss heroes or send them on a suicide mission to recover as much loot as possible, simply because you can't afford to take care of them. Because while wounds of the body heal, wounds of the mind do not, at least not without a sizeable cost in gold.That is not to say all your heroes are doomed. They can win fights and clear dungeons, grow stronger and become Heroes worthy of a capital 'H', champions honed and trained for one purpose: to brave the depths of the eponymous Darkest Dungeon.When your characters aren't delving in the depths of the Dankest Dungeon, you have 'free' time to upgrade the hamlet, adding some modest but interesting base building to the mix. With the heirlooms your heroes collect from the dungeons, you can upgrade buildings, whose functions range from upgrading weapons and armour to curing stress and disease or selling trinkets. Unless of course, the heirlooms remain forever in the dark, clutched in the dead hands of your adventurers.The Right of ItYou will get attached to your heroes, and the threat of them dying when they set out into the depths is always very real, but good preparation can minimize that risk. Darkest Dungeon uses a Random Number God who may throw a wrench in even the best-laid plans, but with the game's immensely clever and dynamic combat system, good planning and calculated responses to unexpected circumstances will do much to win the day. So no, you have no direct control over the numbers, but yes, you can make a very significant difference as the player without success or failure hinging on die rolls. Character classes are so diverse (and individually customizable) that the possibilities of combining them are endless, and a good combination and positioning of characters is a fun challenge every time you assemble a team, as is a clear-headed response when enemies mess up your formation and heroes start having to fight in positions they're not accustomed to.The base building aspect, while slightly grindy, is a streamlined but functional and efficient element, and seeing your hamlet get restored from a ruined ghost town to a thriving community is a joy to watch - even though the graveyards are packed with heroes who died to make it happen. All this takes place in a world full of gothic, dark beauty, with an art style that never bores, even though the game consists mostly of still images, animated and moved to reflect what happens. This isn't to say that the game is a boring slideshow - the camera moves and pans, visual effects splatter off the screen, and thanks to good animation, the entire world is moving and alive.Add a highly evocative narrator, Wayne June, who provides tons of atmosphere while hamming it up to just the right levels, and you've got a gripping experience that'll keep you engaged during every moment.The Wrong of ItIf you like high-poly 3D-models, motion capped animations and lighting that makes your 980TI Titan chug, then you'll probably want to pass on this. But it would be your loss, since the amazing art style and execution is more efficient and powerful than any amount of realism could ever be. The animators did a wonderful job too, making the still images come alive as the action unfolds.Also, be aware that Darkest Dungeon is difficult. You'll need to stay focused if you wish to survive, because even trash mobs (and there aren't many of those) can devastate a party if the player's concentration lapses. Because of this, heroes will die. If you get attached to your heroes, like I do, this can be difficult to deal with. All players so far consider Darkest Dungeon's difficulty to be a plus, but if you want to just play a game and have fun without thinking too much, you might consider the difficulty a stumbling block.Be aware that you can - and probably should - turn off many difficulty options introduced by the devs in Early Access to discourage certain tactics or make the game more hardcore, and that's a good thing. Some of those options were, with good reason, seriously disliked by most EA players, including myself, for making the game unfairly difficult. The Last of ItDarkest Dungeon is a must have for any role player, save-scum hater, tactics fan, or really anyone who likes a solid challenge (s)he can overcome with clever and tactical thinking. In fact, I can recommend it to everyone except people who play video games purely as a relaxing distraction after a hard work day, because it does require concentration and active thinking. Seriously, people, Red Hook created a masterpiece.			"

												Great game marred by questionable design decisions. Claims that the game is completely unbalanced are overstated, as once you get a hang of the mechancis, you'll be able to overcome about seventy-five to ninty percent of the game's challenges whether you happen to be particularly good at the game or not. And then, you'll spawn a dimensional shambler, randomly, not by interacting with the curio,walking down the hall in a short level one dungeon with a party that couldn't hope to deal with such a creature at full health, not to mention while exploring the very last hallway on low health after 'completing'  the dungeon. You won't be allowed to run away or withdraw and your stressed out heroes will do stupid things that will get the whole party killed. You'll watch helplessly as your party dies. It will have nothing to do with your knowledge of the game or your personal ability, it'll just be random bad luck and either you'll suck it up 'git gud' by senselessly griding out another party of adventurers or you'll go play games that are actually challenging because of the decisions you make rather than completely random rolls on the encounter table. Beating this game isn't so much a question of skill as it is persistence. It is a testament to how otherwise fun this game is that I'll probably come back in a week or two and pointlessly bang my head against the pseudorandom challenge that is Darkest Dungeon again.			"

Early Access Review
								Forget what you've learned from previous games. Rethink your views on party management. Accept the fact that you will abandon a quest or run away from battle.This game is hard, maybe a little unfair (as of writing, this game is only in Early Access and doesn't have a final release date) but only to those who bite over more than they can chew.Forget about bonding with your mercenaries, they are replacable should they prove too expensive to keep sane. Stress, supplies and torches are more important than your pride.This is one of the most fun games I've played in quite a while and unlike Demon's Souls, this game is a lot more fair despite not holding your hand. The tutorial is short, shorter than short to be honest, compared to many other modern games and this could be seen as a weakness, but I see it as a strength. It weeds out the weak, like the rest of the game, culling you mercilessly if you forget yourself.The tools to success is money, knowing how to spend your resources and knowing when to run rather than fighting to the last man.Red Hook studios have created a gothic, enticing, cartoony horror-esque game with clever and punishing mechanics, should you fail to take into account your resources, your heroes and your stress levels.The art style is cute, but still manages to be grotesque to the point of giving me the chills, as some monsters makes me FridgeHorror about their fate.Despite being Early Access, this is a must for any RPG fan with a masochistic streak.The few dislikes that I have so far are insignificant, as I have faith in the developers that they will have fixed them before release.

EDITS AT BOTTOMDarkest Dungeon is a fantastic game, however I cannot recommend it to everybody. To truly play Darkest Dungeon you must be prepared to be flogged, punished and beaten to a pulp by the game and it's harsh rules. I cannot recommend Darkest Dungeon to everybody, because not everybody is a flagellant who revels in abuse and hardship, who can withstand the stress and push on with their resolve tested and steadfast but be wary, as your great ancestor says triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall.A big part of Darkest Dungeon, and another reason why I cannot recommend it to everybody, is that you must learn harshly from your mistakes and correct them in future endeavors. Not everybody has the stubbornness, not everybody can get over a setback, because after all failure tests the mettle of heart, brain and body but heart most of all. I consider myself masochistic enough to enjoy this game but even I have had moments of quiet contemplation wondering whether it really was worth it to continue.There is another component of Darkest Dungeon which will shy a lot of weaker-willed people away. Luck. I don't consider myself a gambler, and I don't get thrills from playing the numbers, so personally, I'm not a huge fan of the way that luck is used in Darkest Dungeon. If you are not prepared to take risks, to compromise for chance and to expect the worst Darkest Dungeon is going to walk all over you. Almost literally every factor in the entire game is dictated by a roll of the dice and dice being the fickle ivory cuboids that they are, have no allegiance. One dungeon you might roll full sixes with a great layout and constant critical hits but in another, snake eyes.Now that I have outlined what makes this game challenging I would like to address the other reviews for Darkest Dungeon. You may be confused when you see the amount of negative reviews in the helpful section. I don't want to say that they're salty and that the people who vote them as helpful are salty, but what I will say is that many of them call for a rebalance patch, quite often on the grounds that the game used to be easier, now it's harder or it's just difficult or unreasonable or a grindfest and therefore not fun. Personally I don't believe that darkest dungeon is meant to be fun, at least not to everybody. Darkest Dungeon is meant to be a challenge, an obstacle to overcome something to work at. The game is far from impossible and if you lack the mettle, courage and perserverance to withstand the effort to triumph, you need to try harder and learn from your mistakes before slapping a ""boo-hoo I failed and had to restart but I refuse to learn from my mistakes and improve"" negative review on it TLDR: The game isn't meant to be fun for everybody get over yourself and realize not every game is tailor made to your preferred difficulty cap before you post a heavily opinionated review that doesn't help anybody understand jack.Darkest Dungeon is a fantastic, hellish experience which will push you to your limits and beyond, but be warned that it is not for everybody, as the Old Road will take you to Hell, but in that gaping abyss, you will find your redemption. So, steel yourself, and remember, there can be no bravery without madness, because truly, this is the Darkest DungeonPros- Fantastic Soundtrack- Extremely well styled art.- Narrator Wayne June- Rewarding strategy gameplay- Psychological Warfare- Gambling- Lovecraftian storytelling, themes and monster design- Heart Pounding suspense- Just the right amount of unpredictability to be remedied by experience and compromiseCons - Insane difficulty spikes - Sometimes Victory can feel hollow, trifling even when stacked to the hardships to come - Extremely stressfulEDIT 01: Just Read the 6th of February patch notes Heroes with the Never Again trait (prevents hero from re-entering final stage) now gives other party members a 30% XP buff when running dungeons as well as reduced the amount of XP required to reach resolve 6. Never again and being forced to level new heroes to 6 for the final stage was one of those things people used as an excuse to call Darkest Dungeon a ""grindfest"" and I understand why they would think that. I'm glad they patched those and gave whiners one less thing to complain about.			"

								When I took over responsibility of the family estate, I had big dreams. Those dreams were quickly shattered as the first adventurers emerged from the dungeon highly stressed and borderline crazy raving about ungodly abominations. They pleaded not to be sent back in, but I didn't listen. They never came back. Months later, I've come to accept that it's best not to ask names nor look at their faces. I look away, pointing to the pile of cheap torches and shake my head.They're not coming back... at least the lucky ones don't.The less unfortunate ones will never be the same.This is Grimdark.			"

								Breaks the Rules.The first rule of any game is Tho shalt be FUN.  Which this game sorta of is early on.  But, after your 6th complete restart of the game it breaks the second rule of a game, Tho shalt not be frustrating.  Of which this game certainly is.  Third Rule is Tho shalt be Logical.  Kill a monster, Great.  Now kill its dead body which has the same hit points as its living self so you can get to the monster firing arrows at you behind it.   Tho shalt not be absurd.  Yea i get the stress thing.  Its cool.  But after 3 weeks of having a guy sitting at home doing nothing his stress don't change at all let alone the negative quirks.  The deaths door wounds to his body heal instantly but not the stress.  The economy is absurd also.  10 torches = 750 gold.  Uhm, their burning sticks...  Game is early and has HUGE potential to be a GREAT GAME.  But right now its just not fun.			"

								Fun, but challenging which is just the way i like it.There was plenty of negative feedback in previous updates, but now that we have the ability to tweak the game, it's much better for everyone. (It's a single player game so why not include that.)Personally, I'll just stick with the default version leaving everything in, but i understand why some would want to change some mechanics around.Overall, it's pretty great, despite how unfair it seems at times. As long as the devs balance the game well as new updates come out, I think the final version will turn out pretty solid.			"

								I loved the sound of this game, and when it went on reduced price this weekend, I thought I'd give it a shot.  I really wish I hadn't.I do love a good, challenging game that you can really get your teeth into and feel a corresponding level of satisfaction when you succeed.  But there's a thin line between that sort of game and one that is just plain unfair to the player and becomes annoying rather than satisfying.The difficulty level in this game is such that you've about as much chance of succeding as you would have of standing in front of a speeding train and brushing it off the tracks with a swipe of your hand.It's a real pity, because APART from that, it could be a great game.  Personally, I'm done with it, and uninstalling it now.  Life's too short to waste so much of it getting kicked in the teeth while trying to do the impossible.			"

												This game has enormous potential, all of which is ruined by the combination of its two biggest weaknesses: RNG and lvl 5 dungeons.Starting off the game, it will most likely feel difficult for most people, however, after a few introductory dungeons, you're gonna get a feel for the general strategy the game forces upon you. All is going fine and dandy (except for a few bosses), until you get to the max level (lvl 5) dungeons, which provide the pre-endgame of Darkest Dungeon.This is where the intro screen isntructions of the game come in at full force. You're not trying to beat a dungeon, you're trying to get through it by the skin of your teeth, almost always losing at least one hero. You are at the mercy of RNGsus, praying so that the enemy unit doesn't crit you twice in a row, instantly resulting in death if you fail your death's door check.I've put over 80 hours into this game. I've read through most of the wiki, I watch youtubers on a daily basis who mostly play this game. I haven't even reached the final dungeon. You might say ""well, git gud"", but herein lies the other big issue with this game. The easiest comparison you could make is with Dark Souls: both games are extremely challenging, provide little to no information for the player, and at points seem completely unfair. The biggest difference is that in Dark Souls, most deaths that occur, can be attributed to misplays on the player's side. Here, most of my failed dungeons come from being chain-critted in the second fight of a long dungeon. At best, you're trying to minimalize the losses you're going to suffer at level 5. I've always liked challenging games, but this one is simply unfair.The new town events somehow, after the community's outrage, emphasize these weaknesses even more (RNG playing a huge part in your success). I'm baffled by the fact that not only does the developer not give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the biggest problems with an otherwise extremely promising game, they even boost those issues further in newer content.

Early Access Review
								I love this game. A lot of the percieved difficulty I see others describe seems to be a combination of not understanding the game (or taking the time to learn it) and not being willing to use a variety of strategies and approaches.The art is great. The characters are fun and interesting.But its the tactical depth that really gives the game super high ratings from me. Yes its hard and sometimes the RNG will seem unfair (the nature of RNG). But thats a whole intentional element of the strategic depth of the game. The disclaimer at the start of the games tells you that DD is about making the best of a bad situation.You will be on dungeon runs that are going great and quickly start going horribly wrong. You are forced on the fly to make strategic adaptations to survive and continue or risk/reward analysis about fleeing the combat or abandoning the dungeon run entirely. I love that. I want to be challenged. I want to sometimes be put it what some describe as ""unfair situations"" despite my best planning and preparation. Thats an opportunity strategically delicious decision making. Few games do this.If you are into X-Com played on Ironman mode you will probably like this game as there is no save scumming allowed. X-com is by for the game whose RNG and its effect on your tactical decision making most closely mirrors DD of games I have played. I am like 80 hours or so in and am still learning different ways to combo the heros, their abilities, and the lineup.For the first 20 hours or so I didnt even realize this game was in beta. Sure I have run into at least one odd bug but its remarkably polished for a beta, I am excited to see Redhooks take on endgame content once they release that with the actual release of the game.Honestly while the game is on the challenging side, its not nearly as hard as some reviewers make it out to be. If you are willing to change/evaluate your tactics, run from fights/abandon quests when things go terribly RNG wrong, and use the info on forums and the wiki to make better tactical decisions in group composition for the dungeon you are tackling and curios you activate you are probably the type of gamer who will really enjoy this game.Also, it captures the Call of Cthulhu feel very well, especially with all the insanity stuff and real risk of death of your heros.This is a true gem. Best game I have tried in quite some time.			"

								This game is pretty stellar, and is already a great example of the Early Access model done right.It's very difficult to tell that this isn't already the finished product. Gameplay is fun, fairly simple, and definitely gives you that ""just... one... more... turn..."" feeling (I wanted to pause playing like three dungeon runs ago). The art style/music/voice acting are all spectacular, and the game can be pretty brutal.Definitely pick it up, it's well worth the 20 bucks.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has amazing potential for an early access title, however there are just decisions in this game that are mind boggilingly stupid. First of all let me say that I loved this game, it's seriously a lot of fun. It has a lot of customization, many different hero classes to play as and many different moves for each of your party members. The atmosphere and artstyle are also fantastic with a dark comic book feel that really immerses you while you play. The dialouge is also fantastic! The person doing the voice acting does a really nice job. Now, for the negatives, after a while playing this game I was having a blast and I was really enjoying it. I had gotten up to level 3 people and I was having a blast. But I started realizing that I had very little impact on how my people die. RNG dictates COMPLETELY how any run goes, not your skill. For example I got into a fight after I was done camping (no, not an ambush in the next room over) and all of my people were either at or damn near max HP and very low stress. Upon entering the room I went about the fight as I had for 5 hours prior, nothing seemed different during turn one. However then my plauge doctor got hit with a 37 HP critical attack and had bleed inflicted, and then died when his turn came. I can deal with that, one unlucky death, oh well. However then on the next turn the same enemy attack 2 of my men with one move and guess what! Another crit! Except this time it was a double critical attack that dealt nearly 20 damage to both my party members, putting them at high stress and low HP. Then immediately after my party was blanket fired and guess what, ANOTHER CRIT 5-6 damage dealt to every one of my party members and even more stress. At this point 2 of my guys were on deaths door and were broken with stress. I promptly left the dungeon and got a quest failed. I'm not writing this review to cry about one incident, throughout my playtime I found that in combat my choices didn't dictate who survived and how well I did, but rather it was ALL based on RNG. Why continue to play a game where ultimately you don't have any control on what plays out, as one string of ridiculous crits can wipe out your entire party? I don't know what the devs can do to patch this, because RNG is based around every event in the dugeon so there's not much they could do to remove it. PROS-Awesome art style-Excellent dialouge-Diverse selection of characters and skills-Cool town mechanics-AddictiveCONS-The game crashes every now and then-Some UI quirks-RNG based everything makes the game feel more like a slot machine than a rougelike			"

												Dang♥♥♥♥♥Dungeon is a gritty dungeon crawler thats appealed to a person that usually doesn't like turn based games. The artwork is talented and disturbing, the music fits the atmosphere (I love how daunting and 'uphill battle' the combat music sounds) and the game design is clever in its own unique ways.As a game dev myself I especially enjoyed the clever game design to keep the player challenged. The game clearly has an agenda to break any sort of easy routine and strategy in managing your roster and money, and makes sure the player knows this through mechanics. For example, in the game you are forced to send a party out each week to advance time. However to prevent the player from endlessly farming easy quests with the same heroes, to prevent them from advancing a week with no effort, your heroes will eventually grow bored of the apprentice quests and refuse to take part, so you will have to spend resources to send out rookies which won't be able to easily roll those quests as much as your vets.While the game has a lot going for it for game design, there are still a few flaws. It feels like the game's difficulty agenda gets ahead of itself, and bad stuff can happen to you for seemingly no reason just to throw you for a loop. This would be fine if the game would outright state its trying to ♥♥♥♥ you, but instead it does it in ways that seem to resist its own rules. For example, for no reason at all, even without being Marked, the 4-creature party will continually focus one of your squishier heroes into the ground. You can try using a Man-At-Arms or Crusader to mark themselves, but when this is happening it usually doesn't help and they'll continue to slaughter the one character. You have all of these abilities but occasionally the game refuses to listen and will throw any advantages you have from those abilities out the window. Despite the negative reviews, a frustrating set back once in a while should not really overshadow the game's polish, well thought out game play and clear love the developers have for it. A game is not bad because you can't beat it.I haven't been too far along yet but I'll definitely play more, however I've seen some complaints about the end-game and it sounds incredibly unpleasant, so unless something REALLY clicks I only really see myself playing this until I succeed in my first assault.

								I've only got a few hours into this game, and there's a lot to love about it.  Atmosphere, Story, Difficulty, Art and Sound.However, as a person with only a limited amount of time to play games - I can't recommend this one, in its current state.  I'm done with work for the day; I've got dinner in the oven; my wife isn't home yet - I've got some time to play through a dungeon.  But, I can't even get through one battle before my oven timer has gone off!    Why won't you just go faster!    No matter how many times I smack my hand into the keyboard the combat just won't go any faster! I can't even pause the combat;  do you want my house to burn, Red Hook Studios, is that what it will take to make you happy?!... yes i just quit and it saves my place, which is nice;  but if I can do that, why can't i just pause it?I'm only 9 hours in and I'm am absolutely sick of the slow as molasses combat.  I'm not playing XCOM on my 386 on Summer break!   The slow speed isn't a processor limitation;  and it doesn't add anything to the games atmosphere after the 20-100th time you've seen the same attack or skill animation.  ... And this is about 75% of the time you spend in the game.  I've seen it a dozen times, make it go away!  Please why won't you just make it go away!   Give me a button to click to make it go faster!  Is this some kind of Meta endgame by Red Hook Studios to drive its customers' stress levels into a real state of madness? Well maybe it has worked!  Maybe I've become hopeless, or selfish, or maybe a little paraniod.  But there are no maybe's with my thoughts on Darkest Dungeon -- I am definitely done with this game until someone mods combat faster or its fixed (hopefully) in the official release.			"

												What a punishingly cruel and fantastic game. I'm on my third attempt at a play through without having used any guides or anything of the sort so far and I can't break myself away from this game. My first few attempts were heartbreaking and miserable at best, and I mean that in the best way possible. If you're looking for a game that will challenge you and beat you down into the ground for little mistakes, look no further. I hear a lot that it's entirely luck based, and there is a great deal of luck to it as with any rpg game with random modifiers. However, proper planning and well thought out tactics can save you from the most perilous of unlucky occurrences. This game is strictly 100% based on how well you can manage a team and make good decisions based on very bad circumstances. If you hate games that will stress you out, please don't play this game. But if you revel in triumph through great trial and tribulation, definitely pick this game up. It's worth every penny.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a good example of devs going too far, and listening to the very small minority of people who wanted the game to become slightly more difficult, before recent updates I was playing this game daily, it was an immersive, challenging and brutal game with new and inventive game mechanics that made this game so addictive and fun to play.However due to recent updates, the game has strayed from ""Difficult"" to ""Near enough impossible"". Now,  I'm aware of the fact that if this game was easy, it would not be near enough as rewarding or fun, however a large proportion of players (As seen in the other reviews) see the almost impossibility of the game just a waste of time and effort, it's a shame such a great game has turned into a grinding simulator, that mostly lacks some common sense (No corpses from your party, leaving a dungeon with supplies and them dissapearing).Before the recent updates I would have recomended this game to anyone on my friends list, now I'll have to ask them to avoid it if they ask, hopefully the devs will makes some changes that are mentioned in the other reviews, other than that, there's really no point in buying the game, unless you enjoy investing time and money into characters that can die later on in an instant.

								I'm not normally into turn-based strategy games, but I can't get enough Darkest Dungeon.  The artwork is pretty damn sweet, the narrator has the coolest voice, and the combat is so intense and grueling.  In the beginning, you are basically at the mercy of RNG, and people will die.  But the higher level you get and the better trinkets you earn, you will learn what combinations work well together and you will turn the RNG in your favor.  For only $20 at the time of this review, I would definitely say it is worth every cent.  The game is Early Access at this point, but it is already developed enough to provide hours and hours of entertainment.			"

												Full Review You know how good of a feeling you get one an early access game finally releases and it's better than what you initially expect? Well, this is a prime example. Darkest Dungeon is a side-scrolling turn-based dungeon-crawling RPG where you take a small team of 4 into increasingly difficult dungeons trying to save your Family's Estate. You'll face both physical challenges involving zombies, hellbeasts and bandits yet you'll also have to conquer mental challenges such as fear, insanity and death from stress. This game puts a huge emphasis on the terrifying nature of exploring the dungeons, where games like Diablo show your adventurer as a fearless battletank, the characters you get in Darkest Dungeon are individuals who will eventually become broken by traits like masochism or other mental illnesses. Don't worry though, there are ways to allow your characters to rest, whether it be the brothel, drowning sorrows in the tavern or repenting in the church... after all, everything can be forgotten for a price. It should also be mentioned that players can level up, gain skills and become incredibly powerful but like other Rogue-likes, death is permanent and focusing too much on one hero can lead to the death of all the others. Gameplay aside, you've also got an epic gothic/comic artstyle that really brings this game to life and further immerses you in the world. I can't help but think back to the dark and dank of the original Diablos while playing this game. Also, the narrator in this game is disturbingly amazing. Seriously, pay that guy more to do more lines because he undoubtedly deserves it and more. It's like if the Bastion narrator lost his mind and merged with a demon or something. Freaking epic. In summary, this game is great. One of the better indie games of the year and I'm glad to see it has finally released. One final word of advice, don't be afraid of restarting a few times. You'll probably need to. Early Access ReviewDark, dank, a badass narrator, epic soundtrack and the keys to my heart. Losing heroes has never proven so gloriously fun. Where in X-COM the game would showcase the achievements and build a connection with you and your soldiers, Darkest Dungeon seeks to make you cautious of forming that connection. After all, insanity is just around the corner for those who delve into the dungeons without a light. If you haven't played this game, you owe it to yourself to. Absolutely phenomenal.

Journal excerpt, Week 70I had just completed my prime objective for a dungeon: exploring 90% of it's rooms. The strain of this gruelling expedition manifested itself in their faces. My exemplary team of seasoned veterans, equipped with the best set of skills, perks (virtues), armors, weapons and trinkets, was weary and on the brink of madness. Yet there I still was, down to my last torch and enveloped in absolute darkness, tenaciously rummaging those cavernous depths.Out of ambition, or perhaps mere compulsion, I just had to explore the remaining rooms. In the corridor leading to the final chamber, I stumbled upon a ""Shambler's Altar"". With promise of splendid treasure within, my inquisitiveness and greed took their toll. Despite my better judgement, I activated it with my remaining torch. Like a mollusc drawn into an anglerfish's hellish jaws by a shimmering light, I would come to regret my reckless decision. A hideous abomination spawned before us! It's ear shattering shreeks instilled horror and hopelessness among my heroes. This took the battle to another level, now not only were they combating the demon in front of them, but their inner demons as well - who festered at a galloping rate. To make matters worse, the monstrosity kept calling forth tentacles which relentlessly molested my champions. Relishing our doom, these excited appendages strengthened with every lash whilst the nightmarish fiend spewed corrosive slime and lacerated my band of unfortunate souls.They fought valorously, given the ungraceful circumstances, but unfortunately their luck had turned. Amidst the calamity and dissonnance, I tried retreating - to no avail! Like a cold chill, dread overwhelmed me as I felt death creeping around the corner - innescapable, ready to make it's claim. My heart sunk and my spirit faltered as I helplessly witnessed their excruciating demise, the sound of defeat maddeningly reverberating like a throbbing tambour within the contours of my mind. One by one, they met their dire end: choking on blood, bludgeoned, torn to pieces, shattered by that eldtrich thing and it's slimy extremities. Livid, bereaved and devastated, hysteria engulfed me, followed by an extended spell of violent tremors and frantic bellowing. I have caught a glimse of a terrible truth and there was little I could do but to frolic in it's folly. This wasn't the first time such occurences came to be, nor will this one be the last. Despite orchestrating the ruinous predicament of my chosen heroes, and lucidity forsaking me, I cannot abandon this burdensome path. For in the wake of these catastrophic maelstroms, I revel in the voyage ahead, or perhaps, have been mesmerized by the macabre aura emitted by this place...I cannot dissuade you from partaking in this harduous journey; certainly, there are rewards and moments of delectation to be found, but they are few and far between when compared to the unspeakably wicked, transcendent horrors and constant tribulations you will come to endure. You've been warned, do so at your own peril! And most importantly, remember that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.			"

												I'm not gonna deny, I am a massive fan of this game. Come to think of it, it would certainly be in my top 15 games of all time. But, before I sing this game any praises, I want to share my thoughts on some criticisms people bring up when talking about Darkest Dungeon and how I feel about gameplay in general. This is going to be a long one, but I just feel the need to talk about this in detail.Many people like to compare Darkest Dungeon to Dark Souls. And I think it is fair to a degree - both games have dark, brooding aesthetics and pose a significant challenge to the player, while having a steep learning curve. But I don't think the core principles of these games are alike. In Dark Souls, the player is in control all the time, the game will not offer you help, nor will it deliberately undermine your progress and make your life harder. There are no unknown variables either, as soon as you are comfortable with your character and know all the patterns, that's it, you will never lose if your mechanical execution is perfect. It is not the case with Darkest Dungeon however. There is only so much you can do to succeed, but it is not entirely up to you. This is why a major component of the game is risk management. Since you can't outskill your enemies with perfect tactics when your party is at the brink of death, sometimes you just have to cut your losses and escape. This is a big part of getting good at Darkest Dungeon, learning when you should and, more importantly, shouldn't press on. To be fair, if you get good at this game, you will succeed at the overwhelming majority of your quests, but sometimes the game will destroy you. This is why I think an apt comparison would be online poker (an important distinction, because in ordinary poker there is a whole another level of mind games). You have to play smart and hedge your bets, if the odds are not in your favour, it isn't worth committing in many cases. Of course, there are times, when you have full house, but the game has straight flush. The thing about Darkest Dungeon however, it lets you stack the ""deck"" in your favor by effectively utilizing party combinations, properly equipping your characters, and using tactics to your advantage. Why am I telling you this and why is it important? I feel like a lot of people go into game with false expectations, feeling that it's gonna be a Dark Souls experience to the letter and end up being disappointed or thinking they were misled. Which is often followed by criticizing the game for not being what it never supposed to be. The game does well what it was created to do and it never pretended it is something more than it is. So before you post an angry review, blaming ""stupid RNG"", remember that it was a part of the deal and you agreed to it. I think RNG is pretty well-tuned actually, fringe cases don't happen that often. Does RNG makes the game worse than similar games that don't rely on it? I don't think so, and the good thing is there is plenty of room for all kinds of games, with RNG or without it. Now, let's talk about the game being grindy. By nature, many games are grindy in one way or another, because all of them have some sort of gameplay loop. If you don't enjoy the loop itself or have no incentive to continue, you will be bored, and it is, of course, very subjective. I'm gonna be honest here, via gameplay means the game doesn't do a very good job of motivating you to keep playing. It doesn't make you feel empowered as you progress, nor does it let you essentially overpower the game by putting in time, like some RPG games that let you get the best equipment and faceroll through hordes of previously challenging enemies. What did it for me is that I actually enjoy said gameplay loop and the fact that the world of the game and the story intrigue me greatly, so I was very excited to uncover bits and pieces about it as I go. With gameplay out of the way, it's time to talk about other things the game has to offer, and boy, it has to offer a lot. It is hard to me to separate from each other elements like music, visuals, sound design and story, because they work together so well. Yeah, let's call it presentation and it is mindblowingly good. If I had to name a game I played that nail its aesthetic and presentation the most, I'd name Darkest Dungeon in a heartbeat. The art in this game is great and consistently dark and depressing, enemy design is terrifying and intimidating, accompanied by wonderful sound design and music that gets progressively more intense as your torch runs out of steam. The story is intriguing and for the most part told by the narrator, voiced by one and only Wayne June. It is so ridiculously well-written and voiced that I'd dare to say that it is even better than narrators from games like Bastion and The Stanley Parable and believe me, it hurts to admit it, because I absolutely love Bastion and Rucks, but the Ancestor is just too good. Did I already tell you how well-written it is? Even if I did, it is worth mentioning twice. I don't know how they haven't tun out of pompous words to use, the writing is chock full of them. I wouldn't be surprised if a typical dinner at Red Hook consists of Oxford Paperback Thesaurus, a couple of entries form H. P. Lovecraft: The Complete Collection and for the dessert, a vintage Webster's Third New International Dictionary '61 (that was a good year). In conclusion, I absolutely recommend you to buy the game, unless you don't like challenging games, hate any degree of RNG in games or don't like playing games, unless they constantly motivate you to keep playing.Maybe this review is too long and nobody will read it or it will be downvoted into oblivion just because, I am happy I said whet I wanted to say.

Early Access Review
								This game will force you to make difficult choices. The game drops you in an estate with a ruined town, very little money, and only a few glory hungry fools at your command.  Every step will be paid for in blood and you have no choice but to move forward regardless.  You will need to see everything in context and pick what is worth preserving and what resource is the most important at the time.  I won’t go deep into exactly how the game and all its mechanics work because,1: it’s early access and might change2: half the fun is figuring those things out and mastering themThis game pulls no punches, there is no easy mode here and you will lose adventurers but with each quest done you learn more and get better at the game.  You figure out what the cultists moves are, how to build a strong party, how to respond to finding an iron madden, etc.  Sometimes, even the most prepared party gets messed up by the random factor but that just make every win feel real, significant and earned.  The entire appeal of this game for me is plucking victories from the gaping maw of crushing defeat no matter the cost and making the best of a bad situation.  To push an adventure gone bad just a little bit farther, to get through just one more room and somehow eek out that victory after losing your healer in the 3rd fight feels so satisfying.  This game will challenge you.  This game will most likely frustrate you at some points.  But I think that this game is defiantly worth the time to play if you enjoy dark and unique worlds, easy to understand yet deep mechanics, and being challenged in a way few other games do.			"

Early Access Review
								Short Review:  7/10.  Buy if one sale.Long version:  Darkest dungeon is a roguelike dungeon crawler.  You recruit heros and try to level them up (with varying degrees of sucess) in the various dungeons.  Completing a quest/foray will give your guys some loot.  All pretty standard stuff.Like pretty much all RPG's, you will spend a lot of time grinding through dungeons, trying to level up characters.  In this game, it feels much more like a meat grinder.  Your characters WILL die, and the time and money you invested in each one will be lost.  Sometimes you wont have a choice but to send a team of expendables down on a suicide mission to gather that little bit of loot for your prime rib characters.Most of the game's fun is here, managing a roster, choosing upgrades, saving gold to build an effective budget team to tackle bosses.  It's essentially football manager, Rogue Cathulu style.There is a definite muffin top to the game.  Once you get your guys get strong enough to do high level missions, collect the right trinkets, and upgraded all the buildings, you can really start crushing the game and building a fortune.  You start getting fat (stacks).  Personally I enjoy this.  What's the point of grinding it out if the rewards don’t help?  In all fairness though some of your currency does become useless, (all non-gold currency is pretty much worthless when you've upgraded all buildings)Unfortunately the pendulum of updates has swung to the side of (personally) too hard/not fun.  That comfortable muffin top has just shrunk a whole bunch, and a lot of people are butt hurt over the whole thing.  That being said, the DD developers have been very receptive (on the whole) to the community, and I for one have faith they will fix it eventually.  Right now I'm just waiting around for the tide to turn so I can get my Level 6's off the bench again and into the game.If certain things get fixed or added, i would change to a buy at full price.  As it is though, pick up this game at 50% off.  It's worth the price at $10. $20 seems a bit much unless you are a REALLY big fan of Dungeon Crawling RPG's.Some big pros:-Stylistic game, cool looking characters, dungeons, etc. -some diversity between characters.-receptive Devs who appear to genuinely care what the community say/think.  (they haven't grown large♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥out of their forheads yet at least)-interesting story line, -narrator’s voice is chocolate fun times.Some big Cons: -Recent updates put a damper on things. (corpses suck. protection is the devil, new trinks are useless)-Major content still missing. (currently 2 dungeons of the 5 total not here including the actual Darkest dungeon)-Some lack of characters/enemies.  Characters of the same class are exactly the same.  (i expect enemies at least to be added slowly over time to an acceptable number)Things I want added: -Customizable towns.  (gives me something to do with my hard earned seals, crests, etc.)-Heros that feel more like individuals rather than being defined so much by their class.  (I'm not lying, class IS hero, there is no difference between 2 same level, same class characters)-Some reversion of recent Corpse, Trink, Prot upgrades.-Obviously those 2 new zones. -More enemies, more champs, etc.-More narrator voice, because it's awesome.-Buff that PD! (just make her stun 4 instead of 2, same with plague grenade, and/or a 1 person crit buff.) -also different gendered characters?			"

												I had a lot of fun in the beginning, but at the moment it is far too unbalanced. Up to lvl 3 dungeons the game is too easy and lvl 5 dungeons are too much influenced by randomness and luck. The game needs to be re-balanced then i would highly recommend it to other players.			"

												Was one of my favorite games when it first came out as Early Access.Was widely considered Earyl Access done right, unfortunately thats not the case anymore. The developers added too many features that made the game very ""grindy"" in the name of their ""vision"". I know this is what they intended to do but the game is no longer fun. It used to be enjoyable to get frustrated at taking a risk and getting brutally punished for it. Now its just play it safe and pray to RNGesus. I've gotten increadible stupid luck when it comes to some battles where I was stuck in loops of high crit attacks (5 enemy crits in a row on the same character) and healing them every round so I wont loose them.It used to be stressful in a smart way. Now its just infuriating and annoying.			"

Early Access Review
								Game has massive potential. Problem is the RNG/difficulty gives absolutely no way of counter playing. Literally, if you get a bad RNG in a dungeon prepare to start over and throw 15+ hours down the drain. It wouldn't be so bad if there was some form of progression, but once your top team dies you are set so far behind in gold and supplies you will really never recover.Using crushing RNG as fulcrum for ""difficulty"" just feels like a cope out from the devs. Enemies and bosses have SOME unique mechanics, but very little encourage any kind of thoughtful counterplay. As I said earlier, if you get ambushed (RNG), and all the ambush party's abilities crit/hit(RNG again), you pretty much lose by no fault of your own.Again, the art style and set up is amazing. Unfortunately, it's less of a ""game"" and more of an RNG simulator.			"

												While any good roguelike serves to punish you for make mistakes, Darkest Dungeon takes this a step further. The game is designed to punish you regardless as to your choices--not just by making the game more difficult, but my making the game pointlessly long. The game forces you to continually grind lower level quests while your highest level heros have to relieve stress (possibly for multiple weeks). Late game forces you to only use your heros once for the final quests, meaning if you have a great team comp and you complete one of the final quests, you have to start from square one if you want that team comp again. Certain quests sack your village causing you to have to restore it--yes you can stop this, but after beating it the first time it offers you no reward for doing so, making the game even longer.I would say that 3/4ths of my play time was spent mindlessly grinding just so that I could get on with the story, only to fail because of a bad miss and have to start again. The core concept and gameplay is interesting, albeit repetitive, but it is unneedingly punishing in ways that don't make the game interesting. Punishment should come due to making bad decisions, but in The Darkest Dungeon, punishment comes because they want to keep you playing longer. And that just isn't fun.			"

												if you like being mad all the time then this is your game.  the game randomly decides to wipe out your party or some of its members when it chooses, regardless of strategy or party strengths.  stats like crit or hit chance etc... mean almost nothing.  an enemy with a 1% crit chance, can crit 4 or 5 times in a 5 or 6 round fight for example.  this happens often and you'll lose party members you worked hard on to it, guaranteed.   when this game was early access it was much better, and alot of the positive reviews come from that era.  including my original review.  i feel the reviews will balance once more and more people see whats wrong with the game, which is that it's unenjoyable overall.  the stress factor is an aweful implementation.  for example,  you draft a warrior, and he stresses out walking down an empty hallway.   i'm not training a 16 year old kid to BE a warrior, he WAS already a warrior when i drafted him. are you saying he passed warrior school by being afraid of a hallway with nothing in it. and heavens forbid you walk backwards down that same empty hallway, your party members will end up having a coronary in seconds.  and heart attacks are a part of the game.  my party became so stressed out one time that the game took over their actions (refusing to fight, skipping turns, refusing healing, running to the back of the line) till they were all dead.  and all i could do was watch.  and this was a battle hardened group that had been through countless encounters.  theres a long list of things like this in the game and the uber fans will fight to the death to defend the game, and i'm not saying overall that this is a bad game, but i promise, you will always be mad playing this game. its not fun to play compared to the amount of work and grinding you have to put in to level up your characters. the fact that the game just arbitrarily decides when to give you ""bad luck"" during encounters is why i don't recommend it.

Early Access Review
								This game seemed intriguing during the first couple of hours - an interesting story, great artwork, decent voiceover and audio effects, and then the mechanics and implementation of the gameplay ruined the experience.  As it stands today - If the nature of the horrid gameplay isn't clear, I'll try to explain: Roll a 6-sided dice.  If you get a 1, some character you have will horribly and inexplicably die in one turn before you can act due to monster crits or stress bombs. If you get a 2, some random and unavoidable effect in battle or in the environment will basically force you out of play into a town with fewer resources and more afflictions.  3-5 you may be able to progress a room, maybe a few!, before again being the victim of traps, environment blockage, or randomly scaled mobs that have one of the paper-rock-scissors skill that ruin your party no matter what.  A 6, followed by another 6 and you may beat a quest allowing you to recover maybe 25% of the damage and cost it took you to get there.  And all this while having slow, interrupted, low-interaction gameplay watching animations on how screwed your characters are.I get challenge.  I like challenge.  But if all I wanted out of an experience was to be punished with no skill dependency or possibility of success, I'd just study more tax law.  I get the dark nature of the game and trying to create the horror and detachment from your characters by unavoidably killing and maiming them along the way.  But this game has created 2 conflicting goals that make it a failure - on one side, trying to encourage role playing, progression, and advancement for a player, and on the other side destroying that progression by beating the player into submission by making resource acquisition and advancement so temporary and volatile both positively and negatively that you might as well just be fighting a low-variability random number generator.  The way the game stands today, just throw a fresh party into the grinder every week in the hopes you'll get a lucky loot drop early on before they die horribly and randomly.  There are ways to mask, and even make fun, the second aspect that this game has not grasped yet or evidently ruined from past versions.Buyer's remorse at this point.			"

Early Access Review
								I played this game a lot when I first got into the Early Access, just checked it out again and started from scratch.  It was significantly less enjoyable.  I noted the new corpse and heart attack thing, and I see that it has been much discussed.  I did nto super mind them really.  But it is worse than that, the math just seems bad.  I played the game enough to note a variety of strategies to do well in the past, or at least to keep my head above water.  Now, when starting the game it is just very random.  You absolutely have to have several full groups that can all hit the same level dungeons since they go mad so very easily they will never be able to run more than one mission in a row.  But how many characters you have and their classes are luck of the draw.  Wrong hand?  You lost.  Oh, but it will take you hours before we let you know that you lost already.  The game feels balanced against a best-case-scenario player, it has been made hard enough for the guy who has memorized every system and is willing to grind, grind, grind until the dice roll in their favor and they get a run of easy missions long enough to build up their troops.  I am not that guy.  So, for now I am going from thumbs up to thumbs down.  Hope some work goes into making the game harder to actually PLAY rather than hard to get lucky at.			"

												It happened first about 7 hours in. I had just started feeling good about my chances with this game. I had learned the main mechanics, put together a party I was confident in, and was on the way to beating my most difficult quest to date.Then, something unexpected happened. The boss, exploiting a mechanic I had not seen yet, decimited the health of all my heros in one round. One. Round.In an instant my entire situation had flipped. From full health to everyone suddenly knocking at deaths door. From feeling optomisticly confident, to feeling like I had no chance in hell. One, round. The next few rounds I tried diligently to staunch the bleeding that had occured to no avail, my whole party wiped, as I could never recover. And not only did I lose the time and money invested in grooming those heros, I lost the few pieces of legendary gear I had that had enabled most of my smooth progress. It was a beyond devestating defeat.This is normally the point of a game where I reload, start from scratch, or begin a new save to correct refine my tactics and correct my failure. The magic of this game is the fact that the way it is designed, reloading and restarting is completely un-necessary. You gain exctly nothing from starting over a new campaign, which I think is a brilliant design point to make. And since there is no way to reload, you have to learn how to accept defeat and move on. Brilliant.There's only one problem. That wouldn't be my first wipe.The next day, I got back on the proverbial horse and started again. I groomed fresh troops to go back to the same mission and eventually avenge my original fallen party. It took a few days, but I did it. The confidence was back, the swagger regained. And unfortunately, sadly, pathetically, the same unavoidable cycle repetead itself 2 more times, each failure successively more demoralizing than the one before it. 3 total times, my party wiped from some previously unforseen mechanic activating that totally flipped the tables no matter how well provisoned and prepared I might have been. The very last wipe I slammed my desk and haven't opened the game since.Herein lies the question.Ultimately, is the game at times gorgeous, wonder-inducing, challenging, and terror-invoking?Yes. Without question, yes.And at other times, is the game gimmicky, niche, and disengenuous in the sense that, it may lead to believe that you are prepared for what lies ahead, but unless you sink hours into trial in error wipes or research fights in advance, you will ultimately have the tables turned upside-down on you no matter what, because the developers specifically want you to fail in such a devestating way? In other words, are you okay with walking into a trap that you have no way to counter without some research and some good rng? Some people may not like the feeling of being setup, as I certainly did not. In fact, I haven't re-opened the game since that last wipe. And while I might one day muster up the pride to go back, I could also very well choose not to and maybe live a life better off for it.Only time can tell.For now, though it is a great game, I'm advising no as a reccomendation simply because I've had it, after 27hrs. Maybe I'll go back one day and get to 100, and then in terms of value I will change the review to yes. Maybe other reviewers got their moneys worth already despite all I've said and will put yes.For me, and my rng karma though, the answer for now is no.			"

Early Access Review
								An accurate look into the psyche of dungeon-delvers!After backing the kickstarter, I have long waited for this to come into a form of playable release. I can safely say that it does NOT squander this optimism. The art is fantastic and appropriate to the setting (low fantasy, so you've got crude alchemy and such instead of elves) whilst the audio direction - in particular, the narration - is fantastic.For an early access release, the game is also extremely fleshed out. Implemented systems work very well, which is crucial given the game being based around the psychological ramifications of what your dungeon-going party witnesses, and the stress accrued from fighting eldritch horrors.All in all, this is highly recommended!

												This is the type of game where you are meant to expect catastrophe, if you don't have a permadeath attitude toward gaming then you would likely be best to delete it off of your computer before you break your monitor.I can see why people might give it a negative review because they got way too frustrated by it, but I believe many of those players might not be part of the audience this game was designed for. Just read the descriptors the devs use: ""psychological stresses"", ""flawed heroes"", ""unimaginable horrors"", ""stress"", ""famine"", ""disease"", ""ever-encroaching dark"", ""all hope is lost"".If you dislike movies where the heroes all end up dead, trapped without hope, horribly disfigured, or minds insanely twisted then I would say don't bother with it.This is less akin to a Steven King horror scenario than an H.P. Lovecraft world....now if you are yourself a bit twisted and ready to walk away from your computer for a week or two after losing your best hero because after receiving 3 crits in a row he becomes mentally unstable while fighting an Eldritch horror in the darkness and becomes masochistic, refuses healing, and then suffers a self-inflicted deathblow, then buy it for the morbid gothic hardcore experience.

								This game is an unholy marriage of Lovecraft mythos with Warhammer Fantasy RPG's pox-ridden dirty heroes done in the graphical style of Hellboy comics. Add some permadeath, crippling afflictions and stress and insanity to the mix and stir until done, serve as turn-based combat spiced with Bastion's narrator. And it's just as awesome as it sounds, not to mention that despite being an Early Access title it is mostly very polished already. I've had one crash (game's autosaving meant I lost no progress), some minor graphical bugs that I think they fixed already and a few balance concerns the first patch already mostly fixed. The game is very playable and tons of fun.			"

												I didn't know what to expect with Darkest Dungeon,and now it's one of my favorite games!It's hard, and  it actually makes you think about the best options and how to optimize your party. Addictive!: ... ""One more Dungeon and that's it"" ...3 hours later:  ...  ...well... ""One more Dungeon and that's it""...The weak and the lazy won't like this game,there's quite a lot to endure and learn throughout...It's good!, thumbs Up!:)			"

Early Access Review
								okay i come from 2 ways. the very first time i played this game i played for roughly 24 hours of total. that game was kinda hard in the beginning but enjoying the later you got however the easyer it got. after beating the game i heared that it was hard after a few updates.  now comes the problem i have with the current version-it crahses sometimes most times at turtorial. new to me completely as the game didn't crash before. if it crash the safe file corrupts and i got to start over. i finely managed to get a hold of a safe copy past week 0 so i got to play a bit noticing after another few weeks it crashes and corrupts again.- the game got honestly to hard at the first few weeks. you need very good luck with the persons you get and debuffs on your charactars. you will be slain and as a completely new player you most certain underrate the amount of stress you get. even i who came back after a few months was ripped apart the first few times- as i could not get past week 11 without crashing- yes the game tend to get easier once you get a few upgrades in your town yet again many of my characters wondered off making me form parties while being forced kicking charactars of my list. -meaning after i tried reducing their stress they stayed away-- the amount of stress is way to fast you recieve.     - you got no good way relieving the stress in your whole party -was the jester i believe-    - the crits you make does not even cover a slight part of stress as an enemy would make if they crit.    - you should maybe get a buff to be more immune or reduced stress amount after you just got some.   - as many others mentioned. enemys have no stress,- a good feature in my eyes is the corpses and the combat system. stress is indeed a concern of huge but beside that i find it still enjoyeble.- very good narrorator- good drawed			"

I read the most popular revies and find it really suprising that most of the popular votes are negative. So i decided to do a review myself, cause this game deserves better. many of which cry about the game being too hard, RNG based and grindyChallenging and hardIt is a really challenging game, where RNG (luck) is a big part of it, it has alot of high risk small rewards, which makes this game far more challenging then any game that i have played. And you must use alot of time and affort to even come close to getting far.Repetetive to a certain pointIt is also a bit repetetive which alot of players tend to cry about, but that is what you get when the game is all based on random generated events and maps, which i personaly love alot more than short story based game, you can replay the game without it being the same, so replay value is high. And it will take a long time for you to finnish this game. This including myself not even close to finnishing it.High risk low reward and GrindingIt takes a long time to level up your characters, and when they are full level and fully upgraded, all it takes it 3 deadly blows from an oponent, and the character is dead forever. I find this aspect of the game real challenging and fun. Becouse for once in my life, it is a game which is truly challenging and punished bad mistakes.As an extra, you need to spend your money in the right way, upgrading and fixing units are quite expencive, which makes money management quite important and hard, considering how little gold you tend to get. The game has alot of grinding, and if you do big risks and you loose it's level and items, you are back to start with a new hero (which cost alot of gold upgrading with better gear). This is a factor which im also a fan of. You get punished for stupid risks and rewarded for doing the right calls.Should/shouldn't you get this game?If you like easy games where you can play on easy difficulty, and where you just wounder around with tons of gold. Without a care or challenge and obstacles. DONT get this game.If you like a game that takes a long time to complete, a game where you will get punished alot for risks you take and being unlucky can ♥♥♥♥ you hard in the butt. Then get this game. But i warn you, if you are planing of finnishing the game, you gonne have a bad time. The further you get, the more imposible it seems to finnish "

								The game is a relentless deluge of negative reinforcement. I like to feel I accomplish things in a game, I just feel like this game is designed to make the player perpetually loose. If you like that type of game, it may be for you. I don't enjoy that style of gameplay. Additionally, the tutorial is lacking, I made several critical errors game after game that had no tooltips or assistance in game to help avoid.

								Not many games can hook me, and demand my attention. This game accomplished that and more. It has just the right blend of Challenge, Compulsion, Atmosphere, and Customization to stand as a truly excellent game. The unforgiving autosave works brilliantly, the stress system and negative/positive perks add a fun additional dynamic. The column positioning based combat system allows for a solid depth of tactics. I give it a 9/10, and that's based solely on Early Access.			"

								Many others have said it well, and I've posted enough walls of text on the matter, so I'll keep this short.Back when Cove came out, and they added all the new stuff to it, Darkest Dungeon honestly felt like genuine fun and, while VERY challenging, was quite manageable and workable with good preparation and forethought. A game of managing your risk and working hard with your team of Heroes against a terrible evil.Then we players made the big mistake in Red Hook's eyes. We learned how to do exactly what they ""expected"" of us, and began posting guides so we could help new players beat the game too.Red Hook proceeded to jump up the Random Number Generator of the game until, honestly, your efforts mean nothing. No amount of preparations has any observable effect anymore, and they've stooped to micromanaging player strategies in the name of their ""vision"". Namely, that everything is on a dice roll and preparations against the terrors below is a farce.I was fooled by their responsiveness. But responsiveness in the forums also means ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. It took outside media attention and serious damage to their sales to make key and very controversial changes to their game optional, and Red Hook is becoming increasingly...dismissive of their players.Hardcore gamers will hate the utterly arbitrary RNG that is designed, DESIGNED to deny any efforts on your part for success. Everyone else will hate the inability to actually win anything.Don't be fooled by the ""easy"" low level dungeons. Red Hook knows what its done, so they made sure the first 2 hours of gameplay seemed quite reasonable and easy so you couldn't refund it when you got to the harder dungeons.Don't let them lie to you. Don't buy this game. Looks, music, ideas aside, it's not fun. At all.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is this game's greatest crime. Doesn't matter how pretty something is, if a game isn't fun there's no point to it.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, there are a lot of great things about this game: the style, the tone, the writing, and the concept are all pretty amazing. But, as far as execution goes, this otherwise great game is broken.First off, the difficulty is a huge problem - and this is coming from a guy whose favorite games are Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, and Xcom. The difference between those games and Darkest Dungeon is that, while those games are punishing, they are also fair. There is nothing fair about Darkest Dungeon. There is nothing fair about fighting a roomful of standard enemies and to inexplicably miss every attack while they hit you with four consecutive criticals. This happens all the time, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. Bring your max-leveled team with fully upgraded skills, equipment, and trinkets, and you will still be decimated by random dice rolls. I wonder how random it truly is, though, since the odds of such catostrophically bad series of rolls are pretty astronomical, yet seem to happen pretty frequently.The other problem related to the difficulty is the stress, quirks, and disease mechanics. Every mission your heroes undertake give them a certain amount of stress, negative personality traits, and diseases that severely effect their performance. It is, like everything in Darkest Dungeon, random. So, if it costs 4,000 gold to provision for a mission, the mission rewards you 7,000 gold, but you must spend 4,000 gold to cure the stress, diseases, and negative quirks your heroes picked up over the mission, you're left with a net loss of 1,000 gold and unable to provision for the next mission. Your only choices are to quit the game, or send a team into the next mission with no supplies (guaranteed death). Even if you play perfectly, eventually you will get some bad rolls of the dice and see total financial ruin. This is mitigated somewhat by the ability to sell trinkets collected during the mission... which is where the bugs come in. For some reason, I am suddenly unable to access the trinket menu, so not only can I not access this crucial financial resource, but I cannot give my characters vital equipment. I haven't recieved word from Red Hook's tech support about this yet, but the game is already hard enough without bugs and glitches making it impossible to manage your characters' inventories.  Oh and I feel I should mention the new corpse mechanic. It's awful. It's a transparent and artificial attempt at further increasing the difficulty. Basically, when you kill an enemy, it's corpse stays on the battlefield and blocks your ability to hit enemies behind it. Because it makes total sense that my team of heroes who leap around smiting foes with magic swords can't just step over the body of a dead maggot to attack their enemies. Nope, it makes much more sense that you'd have to spend a round fully dismembering a corpse before you can attack the enemy standing two feet behind it.What a disappointment. Red Hook has the makings of a truly great game, but the random catastrophic events, the bugs, and the unfair difficulty make it practically unplayable.			"

								The game used to be good.  Then the Devs just listen* to the most hardcore of the hardcore players on the forums who complained that the game was ""too easy"" - whether it was true or not, I don't know.All I know now is that the game is RNG heavy and too difficult and frustrating to waste my time on anymore.It's a shame really.* - obviously my opinion here, I have no special insight on who the Devs listen to, if they listen to anyone at all.  My experience in following this game, was to see a very few people here complain about the game being too easy - and the next thing I know the Devs are adding things like corpses that are essentially cover for the other enemies - and for the longest time, you could miss those corpses.  Thanfully they changed that.It used to be that even if your stress got maxed out - you could possibly press on if you were near the end of the dungeon -  then they added heart attacks into the game, so if that goblet splash keeps hitting you for 20 to 30 stress damage, while my Jester heals for 1 to 2 stress damage...  pressing on is just not an option if you value your characters.Then they added permanent negative traits which cost a large fortune for a chance to remove them...I really feel like the game has amazing potential, a wonderful atmosphere, beautifully dark art, and clever writing.  Lately reading the patch notes reads like a list of forthcoming nut punching and I just don't like getting punched in the nuts anymore.			"

								This is just fantastic. Early Access and still utterly engrossing and playable without feeling that anything is missing. The art is gorgeous, the environment and atmosphere are suitably moody, dark and tense, the narration is great (I'm not usually a fan of in-game voices but this game, much like Bastion did, pulls it off wonderfully). I'm hesitant to use the word 'unique' to describe the gameplay mechanics because it seems like such a buzzword, but it certainly stands apart from anything else I've played - the Quirks mechanic brings an interesting new mechanism to the table and adds a nice new depth to a very well executed combat and party management system.Really, just pick it up. It's lovely.			"

								I have very mixed feelings about this game. The gameplay, art, and concepts are all fantastic. But it is pretty much impossible to make any progress in the game. I am all for a hard game, that's fine. But let me feel like I am making a forward motion. After 5 hours, I am no closer to finishing the game than when I first started. The only upgrades I made were with the gold one has when you start. Would love to continue this game, but it has a constant unrelenting habit of one step forward, three steps back. May come back if the game changes. But doubtful.			"

												Pros and cons below, but summary first:As a turn-based rpg - it's clever. Not awesome or revolutionary, but certainly clever and can hold a person for a while; and it's a good game for fifteen minute sessions or for sessions of an hour or two, because it's broken up into dungeon crawls of bite-sized lengths. What it does awesomely is that it is wrapped in pitch-perfect flavor, art, and sound. It's a 'buy' - particularly if Hallowe'en is a holiday you enjoy!Pros: - For any fan of Lovecraft, there's just tons of clever homage.- Fantastic art style and atmosphere- Great voice-over- A good variety of skills for each class leads to an impressive amount of different viable tactics - building synnergies between heroes is important. Quirks layer onto this effectively.- The battle system manages to make even turn-based combat be stressful.Cons:- The gameplay doesn't really change a huge amount once you figure out the tactics.- There is a moderate amount of grind, particularly in replacing lost heroes and in affording the higher-tier upgrades to your hamletMixed:- The randomness factor. It's not a con, per se, but it does require a different mindset to deal with effectively - the more you can deal with loss, and hedge against it with your tactics, the better you can put yourself into the 'manager of a team of heroes' role you need to be in rather than playing as a hero yourself. I have a feeling that most of the complaint comes from people who don't realize that .. yes, sometimes it's better to cut losses and retreat from a quest than try to shove through. That instinct to try to win is hard to resist, and it leads to frustrating party kills. "

												I'm a big fan of hard games, but Darkest Dungeon is just oppressive.  You barely make enough gold on a success to heal off the stress and unsustainable quirks from your last run, effectively breaking even.  A failure may cause you to lose several heroes you have invested many hours into.  I spent significant time learning the game's mechanics and increasing my chances, but it still just takes a few bad rolls of the RNG to burn it all down.  It's easy to party wipe in the final stages leading to a loss of 30+ hours, often out of your control due to the random factor.It's inexcusable that Darkest Dungeon does not have an easier setting for players just starting to learn the mechanics.  Early mistakes will put you in the hole and often force you to abandon those heroes.Even though many parts of the game are phenomenal, like the art, music and combat system, I cannot recommend it due to the oppressive chance-based difficulty.  It's ultimately an excercise in frustration.			"

												To preface my review (one of the few I've ever left) let me say I've never been one of those gamers that says ""git gud"". I'm not ""hardcore"" and whilst I certainly don't think I'm a ""casual"" I'm sure many would say I am. I dislike hard games overall. Games that are difficult just for the sake of it. I like games that punish me for my mistakes, where there is a constant back and forth. Games shouldn't essentially complete themselves and nor should they make completing them a chore. Darkest Dungeon manages this perfectly. There are punishing mechanics that will constantly knock you down if you make a mistake. I see reviews from people who have encountered this not recommending this game and it physically angers me. Put in some time to learn the game, to learn how it works and you can deal with those mechanics. Nothing is unfair in Darkest Dungeon. Everything is in your control.People who turn others away from this game because of the difficulty I say this to you: Not everyone is you. Most people will put in the effort to actually play a game and figure out an actual solution to the problem they're faced with. If you want a turn based combat game then yes, this will let you down purely because it is so much more, and it is wrong to refuse to accept what you are offered. Darkest Dungeon would be an awful game if it was less than it is but all the parts come together to make one well oiled machine that will make a worthy player come back for more time and time again. If you like this you may also like: Sunless Sea, FTL: Faster Than Light.			"

								At the moment this game has great atmosphere, great art, and a good narrorator.This might be thought of as me ♥♥♥♥♥ing, bit the fact of the matter is that the game's combat system is hilariously flawed.The game is difficult, but not because of lack of planning on the player's part, or poor choices. No, it is hard because of RNG, like most roguelike games. In combat, there is nothing to tell you who is going first. Sure, you could look at every party member's speed rating and every enemy's speed rating, but wouldn't it be easier to tell the player so he can plan, and not rely on RNG?The game has extreme difficulty spikes, often wiping your entire party out even when they enter a boss battle with full health / no stress because of.. reasons. Enemies get two or three turns per round, and can often wipe your whole party in the FIRST TURN. Losing characters is a part of roguelikes, but this game has far too many cheap deaths to make their deaths feel as though you did something wrong.The hunger mechanic is broken. I just fed each of my party members to recover some health, WHY are they hungry, and why is the only option to starve?  Why can I not chose who starves, and instead feed the party members who I want?The game prevents you from having any veterans, as those who get to the higher levels are often loaded with disproportionate amounts of negative quirks, making it so it would be more cost effective to toss them out than to heal their injuries. There is no out-of-combat healing system aside from food, and for some reason bandages don't heal your wounds?Ranting aside, the game has a lot of potential and is already really fun. I don't recommend it because by it's nature it is the pure embodiment of blind RNG. When you finish a level, it does not feel rewarding because you feel as though you've gotten lucky. When you fail a level, or lose all your party members, it is often because you feel cheated by the game.Also there are some critical glitches that absolutely destroy your save. Since the game autosaves after each action, if you are stuck in a loop where you can't get back to town / it crashes during certain stages of combat, you are forced to watch as hours of your time are thrown away. Pretty terrible, but it's early access and I guess they'll fix it.			"

Here we have a boring, repetitive clicker game, ruled by RNG and artificially extended by one of the most tedious grindfest you'll experience in your gaming ""career"".Game isn't hard for real, as long as grinding the same enemies for dozens of hours is ok for you, considering that the combat is a tedious clicker game that might force you to repeat hours of grind over and over again if the RNG decides to screw with one of your heroes.Arbitrary desing choices like the heroes not going to lesser dungeons once they level over a certain cap or never going back to the Darkest Dungeon artificially extend the lenght of the adventure, forcing you into a spiral of grind that will make you hate every second you wasted on this very mediocre game.It had some potential, but it's lack of deph and it's horrible design choices kills it as soon as you picture the full scope of it.It took me some time to realize that this game was garbage, because it certainly doesn't look bad at first sight.Learn from my mistake.EDIT post Radiant update: the new update cuts in half the grinding time and allows higher level heroes to grind lower level dungeons, removing some of the atrocius artificial difficulty of the original release. The core simplistic and boring combat grind stays the same, but if you are willing to waste a few dozens of hours (as opposed to many dozens of hours) the unforgivable RNG is now less punishing from a wasted grinding hours point of view.I still don't recommend wasting your time with it, there are plenty of hard games that are also fair, this one still isn't. Still, devs deserve praise for putting some effort trying to improve the game.			"

YouTube™ Video: First Impressions: Darkest Dungeon

(This is a first impressions look at the game, i have not completed it yet)Darkest Dungeon kicks so much♥♥♥♥♥ It's a turn-based, dark RPG with a lot of depth. One thing I absolutely love about this game is that despite being a complex RPG, it's relatively easy to get into and it doesn't bombard you with popups and tutorials. You do have 1 quick tutorialish area at the beginning which tells you the basics. When something is about to happen in the game that is a key mechanic, the game gives a window with a brief explanation of how it works. it doesn't give you a 5 paragraphic essay that you have to read through with tons of examples you don't need. It does a good job of explaining these things within a paragraph or two, and that's great because this game is HARD. However, it's also fair for the most part.What makes this game special compared to most turn-based RPGs is how placement works. Most games might have a few usable abilities like a cleave that will affect a few people in the front, an aoe that affects everyone and that's usually it. Darkest Dungeon takes a leap forward with mechanics such as switching, large enemy types and corpses. Certain characters work best at certain positions and while it would be nice to see enemy unit move tables, it feel it would make the game much easier but still add depth. Certain abilities used by your characters can only be used while that character is at a certain position (far left, left, right, far right) and those abilities can sometimes only be used on enemies in certain positions (far left, left, right, etc). The game does a great job of telling you where characters would prefer to fight. These are always shown in the character menus which you can view by clicking on portraits or hitting the 'C' key when a portrait is highlighted. The switching mechanic also plays into this. You can switch the placements of characters in and otuside of battle, but in battle costs a character turn. Attacks can also switch people around (both on your side and on the enemy team's side). This adds a new level of depth, you could plow your way from the front to the back but there could be a annoying stress-damage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the back who might be super week to a sword attack your knight might use because it's good again'st unhoy enemies.That's another thing I should mention. There are a lot of modifiers in this game. From the debufs you get from playing (like getting stressed) to all your character abiltiies with various mods that can cause conditions like bleeding or blight. There are so many variables and team compositions to play around with adding so much customization for how you move out your party. God, we haven't even talked about the item system or the weapon/armor/spell upgrade system. THERE IS SO MUCH IN THIS GAME TO TALK ABOUT!Animation, sound and art quality are outstanding. This game sucks you in to its dark and depressing world hard. Every completion of a dungeon feels stressful, as it should as stress is the main mechanic of the game. Stress can afflict debuffs to your party or even buffs at rare times. Your companions are not only battling monsters but also battling thier own psyche. You can relieve stress in the town but you have to still do dungeons if you want their stress to go down. They only lose stress when they are treated for a full in-game week, so it's a desperate struggle where you sometimes have to throw green-as-grass new characters at high level dungeons. Thankfully, new recruits are free and you can upgrade your roster. THAT'S ANOTHER THING, SO MUCH HNGGGGGG. You can upgrade buildings in town (treating more characters at a time in one area, better upgrades, etc) and you are still not even safe in towns. Stuff can happen when you are trying to relieve stress. Sending one of your guys off to gamble to relieve the pain of losing a comrad? Well he gambled away a rare item GG.Overall, this is a great value at 20USD. You are totally getting your moneys work. If games stress you out easily, stay clear because you will die of a heart attack faster than your characters will.If you are the type of person that needs a score, I'd give the game a 9/10. Extra information in my video review.			"

												This game IS the darkest dungeon game iv ever played. Your Heroes will die... You name your heroes a friend's name, you will be sad when they die. What's that? You see a carcase and want to collect its meat? BOOM! syphilis!  Never once have i EVER seen a game like this. Moral of your party is crucial, there hunger and light level is just as important,  and if you expect to get a healer in every party you make, guese again, because it's rare, and its not only about the heals, its about damage output and stunning your enemies and knowing there weekness such as blight/bleed/stun.  Nowhere near finished the game, but iv played quite alot to know most of it, and give my honest rating.  With the estimated 100+ hours of gameplay, and the intense fight for your life situation. i would give this game...10/10! YUP!eNjoy ^-^			"

								Game was fun when it was first released. You could put certain groups together to take advantage of their skills in combos. had a nice balance of Risk vs Reward. The Dev's have now went the way of so many before, the game is talored toward abuse in guise of challenge all in the disillusioned idealism or excuse that the game is supposed to be hard. Seriously.. we made the game suck and frustrating because we wanted it to be hard...If i wanted a sucky frustration game i would just buy most of EA's unfinished/half released products. I just dont have gaming time to dedicate or support more frustrating games instead of fun ones. Sad really as this game had promise.			"

												I follow the game since it's been spotlighted even before arriving in steam EA. I finally got it last year, I don't know when exactly but I play at least since april. Thing is, I don't play often. Actually out of my total 75h of playing, I easely played 50h before summer. I don't want to start my review as is, but here it is : I liked the game ""before"". Back in april/may, I could only talk about DD to my friends, because it was a big deal for me. Telling truth I got the game because I'm a turn-based rpg fan. But all the squirks, dialogs, lore, classes specs, village upgrades, and even the rng (back then) was all I loved about the title. The identity was there anyway.Back then, DD was fairly controlable, with some bad luck at times. Sometimes some very bad luck i must say. But it was part of the game! And it felt fun! I could talk about how my lvl3 vestal died starving in middle of a corridor cuz I ain't no food anymore! About my alchoholic highwayman havng not much acc and failing 90% of his shot, my knight afraid of the dark, etc. I made myself kind of a picture of those characters in a dark humorous way, and it was great!So many stories to share. And yet, I could, sometime, manage dungeon till the end, losing 1 or 2 dudes in the process. I felt the game was like kind of a fair trade and it was addictive somehow. My main goal was to lvl max my favorite characters. It was hard enough to me.But today the game is about how to lose an entire team after 1 or 2 fights, thanks to the mad RNG, the stats nerf, the stress augmentation and the enemies luck. I get the game is about how terrible a quest can turn for your characters, but there is a ""can"" in this sentence. It tells you then that it can aslo NOT be so bad. So not only the game is gone into ""every single quest will be a pain in the @ss from now on"" (not joking, my % of success went down and down for the very same quests since last spring), but it also gets the player rid of any control of what is happening. Your character should be alright with his lvl 6 stats and equipped items? Nooooo let's get him the worst possible scenario, because RNG is more important than the choices you made for your character. So characters have stats and skills, but in the end they are not relevant for you can't decently plan anything to happen ""almost"" as expected. Your most violent warrior can become a ♥♥♥♥♥ and your vestal can destroy suns for wtf reason. It's not the problem that bad things happen, I loved the game for that. The problem is that it always happen, to the point you have nothing left to enjoy anymore! Even victory tastes like crap most of the time. The fun in DD is dead within 6 months.So to make it simple : the game, to me, went from a :50% lucky stuff 50% bad stuffTo a 10% lucky stuff 90% bad stuff happening (without logical reason, I repeat).You can't count on characters specs, skills, stats, items and strategies these days, it's all up to randomness, even in the easiest dungeon. Everything can happen to you, but be sure it's gonna be bad no matter how you know the game.It's not harder, it's more non-sense. It's less controlable. You lose for more reasons than before, you surrender more quickly and more often. You earn less things and need to farm madly to save what's left from your previous disasters. The game never rewards the player in the way I didn't smile since June while playing it! It's only about frustration and guilt. I only play here and then to see what's up and it's sad to said it is not the fun game I used to spend my life on.TL;DR : game went from enjoyable, memorable, fun and strategic to some lifeless russian roulette for the sake of difficulty poorly executed and understood. Needs a lot of balancing until it might justify it's price. DD was one of my favorite game experience ever, but it's one of the most disappointing now.			"

												Far too difficult and unforgiving.Now I understand that this game was intended to be challenging so it is by design that the game is as brutal as it is, but brutally challenging does not, a good game make.First I'll go over what I like about the game.-The setting is pretty cool. Now, I've not gotten very far into the game, as it just constantly makes me frustrated and unhappy, But from what I've seen of it, it's a pretty neat setting and I just wish that I could enjoy it more.-The art style is pretty fantastic, I love the art style and look of the game.-There are quite a variety of heroe types to choose from and there seems to be a great deal of customizability to the game.Now what I don't like.-Stress is incredibly difficult to manage. Stress causes all kinds of negative stuff to your heroes, some times devestating stuff, it's expensive to get rid of and is accumulated all of the damn time. The more stress your heroes have, the more bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane they get and the more stat penalties they incur. Stat penalties are also expensive to get rid of.-The torch system in this game is also very difficult to manage. You have to buy torches at the beginning of an expedition and you have to use them to recharge your light as you make your way through the dungeon. My issue with them is that the lower your light gets the more stress your heroes suffer from and the more difficult the monsters become, and torches do not last long at all, I often times will have to use up two of them just to get between rooms.-My biggest complaint and the primary reason I keep quitting out of frustration, is how you constantly have to micromanage your expenses. You get gold from completing expeditions and you must spend that gold on upgrading the abilities and gear for your heroes, providing leasure activities for your heroes so they don't go bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane and on consumable items used during expeditions.Not that big of a deal, the problem for me is specifically in reguard to the consumable items, you have to do some major guess work(or clever statistical calculation) in order to make sure you have enough to keep your party from dying horribly or going insane. Now, I am not a statistician so I cannot do the clever statistical calculating to make sure I have enough to stay alive and even if I could, there's a very serious randomness to the entire game. Even if you math out the most efficient use of your gold to gear to abilities to leasure to items, you still will probably get screwed over during the expedition. Perhaps you didn't pack enough food to feed your heroes(yes you have to feed your heroes at least a couple times, if not more, during an expedition) and the RNG didn't provide you with food as treasure, or perhaps you didn't pack enough torches so you run out of torches and your heroes either go totally bonkers or die horribly in battle. Maybe you couldn't afford enough bandages and that damn pig creature just kept making your heroes bleed and they died of blood loss. Maybe you couldn't afford enough antivenom to heal the poison(or blight as it's called) that the mushroom mutants constantly cause. There is no item to heal the huge stress that the undead inflict to your heroes, the only time you can do that is when you spend gold and keep the hero out of the following expedition(and you must attempt an expedition every single day(or week as they call it), you can't skip weeks!).Every time I play I feel like I'm beating my head endlessly against a wall. It is very stressful to have to guess so much about what to expect or plan for in a given dungeon because more often than not, the random number generator will completely screw you over. In fact, everything about this game seems to be random, everything from what heroes you get to pick from after the introduction to how much and of what types of loot you aquire in a dungeon. Everything from what happens to your heroes during combat to what groups of enemies you run into. Even the effects of stress on your heroes is random. Sometimes you just get an amusing phobia, other times your hero gets a debilitating debuff that will have a real, sometimes crippling effect in game.I understand that the developers wanted to create a challenging game, I understand that they wanted to create a game that elicits a sense of crushing hopelessness. They very much succeeded, perhaps they succeeded a too well. The randomness coupled with the micromanagment this game expects just overwhelms and frustrates me to the point where I simply don't enjoy myself and enjoyment is the whole reason one plays a video game.I'd play the hell out of this game if they just allowed us to customize the difficulty, but the only way to make the game less difficult is through a mod that alters the game files and that mod doesn't really do much to lessen the cruelty built into this game.

 Easily the current 2015 GOTY I don't even know where to start. This game is amazing in nearly every way and the devs are very active and consistently updating it and improving the game as a whole.You're thrown right in and left to fend for yourself for the most part when the game begins. After you complete to tutorial you start grabbing up the masses of hopeful men and women on the quest for gold and glory, throw them in the deep dark ruins of your estate and watch it spit them back out. No longer hopeful but psychically and mentally scared beyond the point of repair. Rinse and repeat.  Early Access This game is very much still being devolved and worked on day in and day out. The end game is still not available, artwork is missing and there have been a fair amount of bugs, but the devs are always fixing them almost as soon as they are noticed sometimes reasing several patches in a matter of a few hours. Game play The game play is amazing. They have taken a system that has been done plenty of times before and turned it into something unforgettable. While combat is heavily effected by RNG strategy and planning can deiced weather you party makes it out alive, goes insane, or all perish to the evil that lies below. Pros Engaging combat that will keep you on your toes.Stratigic ""overworld"" decision making and planning.Amazing artwork.Stress mechanic to make the game that much more challenging.Spot on atmosphere. Cons Right now the game is pretty grindy and repetitive.RNG can and will ♥♥♥♥ you right in the♥♥♥♥♥ (As to be expected).Theres just not enough time to play!Overall this is a very solid turn based RPG that is worth every penny. Get ready to waste away hours of your life in this game and don't forget, always bring a shovel.			"

												This game has several good points, unfortunately the bad points outweight them.1. RNG. Many of those giving the game a ""recommend"" instead of a ""non-recommend"" claim that the problem is that people are upset that their characters die. Well, no. Not really. I don't care that my characters die. What I care about is that they are not dying because of a lack of skill (which can get better through practice and thus make the grindfest rewarding) but that they die through sheer chance. Gamers like to know that we have succeeded, that we are able to triumph, and while Cthulu is supposed to make things hopeless, this is a game not a book. You have to consider enjoyment of the players. And when whether you live or die has nothing to do with how you play, and everything to do with the dice rolls? You have a problem. There should be a balance between what the dice do and what the players do causing success or failure. Always.2. Goals. The characters are hired help. Yet apparently once they are higher level they will refuse to go into lower leveled dungeons. This is an arbitrary mechanic just to make the game harder for no reason. It also breaks immersion since it has no lore reasoning. What hired guard refuses to go somewhere because ""it's too easy?"" No such thing. Mercenaries love easy jobs that guarantee cash for little risk.3. Characters that enter the final dungeon refuse to return. This is the final killer. You finally grind up enough people to be suitable, and then a dungeon that you MUST enter more than once to complete the game, is no longer accessible by those you specially molded to be used in it.Between these three features, the only way the game is any fun is to cheat so as to make the grind-fest as limiting as possible, and just enjoy the story. Waste of something that held great potential.			"

								Initially i loved this game , lovely presentation and very polished , as you can see from the hours played i got my money's worth but i went back to play it recently and the game has changed so much , and not for the better.It's gone from a fun challenge to a tedious grind. The devs seems insistant on forcing in game mechanics and features that are simply not fun and force you into a grind.It's a shame as it was a great game and things like the UI and hero balance have got better but the core game is just tedious now for me. I welcome a difficult challenge but forcing in features that dont actually make the fights harder but just adding negative things constantly that you have to grind gold to get rid of has ruined the game.The devs lost there way with this game.

								When I first saw this game I figured it was just another side-scrolling dungeon crawl, and to be honest, I haven't really been big on the dungeon crawl genre in the past. I bought it following a recommendation from a friend. I've barely touched any of the other games I bought during the steam sale. I ended up playing about 24 hours in the first week. I think it's the challenge. The fact that knowing that at any moment, everything could just go to♥♥♥♥♥♥- ""Bugs, huh? I gotta fight bugs? I think I'm a little old for Spider Stompin' (TM?), but ya gotta love those arcade classics!""                                                             [mark - crit - crit - blight - ded]- ""The boss is a hag? And she doesn't summon? Pfffft. Cake walk.""[I recovered the remains of my best Man-At-Arms in a Campbell's soup can.]- ""Place a torch on the alter? This looks ominous. But there's *no way* it could be *that* tough.""                                                         [Death was swift]- I burst out laughing when I first saw a ""swinetaur"". [Still have not played a veteran level dungeon since that terrible, terrible night...]I'll admit, I can see how mistakes could be made due to naivete of game mechanics. Like when all my characters died of heart attacks all at the same time. Who knew the Apprentice Necromancer was also a Krispy Kreme vendor? (also registered trademark) It may require some patience to endure the painful ""learning experiences"" of the game (although from what little I've seen of the most recent update, it looks like they're working to make the game less mysterious), but I never really considered the momentary confusion or unpleasant sudden realizations to ever outweigh the fun of playing. Honestly I rather enjoyed discovering the mechanics for myself.All in all, the game is very challenging, highly addictive, pleasing to the eye and the sanity mechanics add an extra dynamic both in terms of game mechanic and in developing an emotional attachment to your cannon fodder (I mean...when you're one Obdurous Advancement away from a party wipe and your sexy booty ♥♥♥♥♥ hellion becomes Heroic and lets loose a raucous war cry as she cleaves a shamblers head off with one well placed justice crit it's kinda hard NOT to buy her a drink afterwards and offer to bear her children, yano?)Highly Recommended/10Play your way to madness.

								Let me begin with saying I do enjoy the concept of this game. I wanted to be someone who enjoyed it despite all the critisms I read before buying it. The randomness isn't my problem, really- it's the game being able to completely ruin you without any input on your part. Too many times I've set out to a dungeon and the first battle someone is killed before I even have a chance to react. The gold system is frustrating, and some of the currency seems pointless because it needs the same amount of another currency always. Why can't you keep the items you don't use each week? That makes little to no sense to me. I love the hero classes, the art, the voices, the abilities, the items- but the game is just far too cruel in some ways. Watching a hero die before I even get to make any choices or actions is really frustrating, and ruins a whole game week- because 3 heroes is a massive handicap and you're doomed to retreat or die soon into the dungeon. Another thing that was frustrating is finally getting to camp, and then being attacked for it so you lose all the health, stress reduction, and other benefits of camping. A couple times I've ended up worse for camping. I really like what I see from the devs of this game, I've gone back and read a lot of the updates and such- so I'm sure they'll iron it out they seem very committed but honestly, at the moment, I don't recommend this game.

								Look, let me just say this: This game has a mechanic called Stress. Stress does Bad Things to your characters. Stress is inevitable. Much of the game is trying to slow down your losing battle against Stress.When the game came out, however, Stress could not (usually) kill off your characters.Now it can. If I had known Heart Attacks were part of Red Hook's ""vision"" back when I bought this game, I would not have bought it. Period.			"

Less than the sum of its partsThe game tries to mix tactical, management, roguelike and RPG elements, but the actual gameplay design is quite incoherent, irregular and ultimately not very enjoyable. It fails to live up to its potential as an interesting roguelike, or RPG. The shallow gameplay simply doesn't provide the entertainment and replayability, that other, good games of these genres offer:- Dungeon-crawling and the tactical combat quickly become repetitive.- There is no real story, interactions, or meaningful choices. The ""world"" feels very static.- Leveling up and managing your characters is not fun.- Superb art style and audio.The single good thing about this game is the excellent art and presentation. It captures the depressing, horror atmosphere, although some of the very illogical, random gameplay elements detract from this and make the atmosphere frustrating and tedious instead.The psychological stress system, which was one of the most hyped aspects of the game also falls short: Stress is pretty much just a second HP bar, watching a character go insane is totally unfun, and all the quirks and traits they acquire are completely randomized. There is no psychology, no cause and effect, it's all randomness and grinding for gold, in order to regularly remove stress and quirks.I have finished the game, it takes about 50 hours from a fresh start, without guides. Unfortunately, about half of those 50 hours aren't exactly entertaining, but clunky micromanagement, looking at slow animations and simply repeating the same tasks / fights a lot.4/10, a big disappointment.

												I love this game because I understand RNG and have learned to accept, mourn, and almost enjoy the permanent deaths of my favorite characters...Pros: - great atmosphere and narration - wide variety of party setup - very few boss fights are any-tank any-spank - proper use of challenging RNG - haters are used to RNG stacked very heavily in their favor from most games - wide variety of character setup (and can change setup on the fly outside of combat) - good variety of enemies and theme for the major questing areas - (my 3 year old son shouts BOOOM! whenever enemies die especially to our Leper's sword)Neutral: - most of the typical ""loot"" of other games is handled through upgrading gear in town.  So loot drops in dungeons feel less important - stress management - it has a harsh learning curve but once managed is very easy to cruise through most missions and bosses coming out with no one above 15 stress.  Odds of positive stress results very very low - could be a little higher and still be uncommon.Cons: - when RNG goes against your favor you can hit frustrating streaks of you missing and them critting.  The short numbers it seems like cheating, the long numbers the RNG is fair - steep initial learning curve - learning curve resvisited at higher difficulties - final dungeon no loot/curious/etc? - to fully upgrade town/characters can be a bit of a grind in the last 1-2 levels of upgrades.I've only played a small handful of games that had harsh RNG which was not heavily balanced in the player's favor.  I appreciate it's use here.  It's not for everyone though.  My favorite tank is the Leper who has the worst accuracy in the game, but two trinkets that increase accuracy the cost of other stat penalties I'm not worried about (reduce dodge, reduce speed... sure).  Basically you can shift the numbers in your favor based on character class strengths/weaknesses through trinkets, skill choices (and training), and through camp buffs.  Without proper planning, you truly are throwing yourself at the mercy of RNG.My first trip into the final dungeon, I thought I'd send my A-team of favorite named characters, rather than a scout party.  I sent in a party of characters just not suited to it and did not camp prepare them properly.  I lost three of my favorite characters and did not quit.  My own fault and I will get my revenge with the next team.  This is where I found what 200 stress does.  1 (my poor Leper) even died of a Heart Attack because I didn't have a chance to heal him between stress aoe crits.The game takes the right mindset and an understanding of RNG and planning otherwise it will be too frustrating to be fun.  However with that understanding and past the basic stress management learning curve			"

												Very nice, very unique turn based RPGRisk management that hits just the right difficulty for me.+Artwork and Sound are superb, very moody+Lots of depth in choosing your party composition and provisions for every mission+Not afraid of challenging the player+Permadeath is not too punishing, you can always raise new victims. But you CAN and WILL lose adventurers, and it will hurt. No save scumming.+Pretty unique setting and mental health system, at least for this genre. You have to manage mental and physical health, as well as diseases and character quirks+Many classes~Didn't find much depth in how to approach battles once you've choosen your party, eliminate the current highest threat quickly. But maybe that's just me.~Grinding feels a little to powerful, but lets you manage the difficulty according to your preference. There is a level cap for the participating charachters in every mission, though. Send noobs to their death to farm ressources.-Dungeon structures are a little bit simplistic. Limited number of fixed tilesets you can encounter. This would be a good area to add content to the game.-Town/Base management is tedious enough to be a grind, but easy enough to not make your choices matter that much. You just pick the order in which you want the things that make your life easier.			"

												The concept behind it is good, but I don't think it's finished. The tutorial should be much longer - as it is, it doesn't teach you very many mechanics at all. I thought that staying on a high light level made your light go down faster, as a penalty for the extra safety - nope. Apparently, when hunger puts someone on death's door, you heal them off it, then hunger happens again, they die. Didn't understand that through the tutorial. What is this caregiver doing occupying random slots? Why does my hero have a ? next to him and why can't I click him? How do I group heros into squads?The game's tutorial leaves many questions unanswered, which has made it hard for me to progress through the game. With an updated tutorial, I'd recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon, are the extremly good example of how modern roguelike games supposed to be, without giving up principles of old days, and turning in rouglite.Deep, complex and unforgiving game mechanics only benefits from good graphic, clear interface and simple controls (all you need is mouse), making gaming experience only stronger.Every step in dungeon will make you feel a deep thrill of danger and hostility. Every battle feels like it could by the last for some of characters, no metter how good they are, and simple monsters can turn to by a stronger then a whole party. All of this quickly clears out, that characters are not usual gaming godlike-immortal-safeloaders, but are the natural part of the world, and it is so rare in modern games :(The victories comes from carefull planning and understanding of game, and overconfidence lead to permadeath. And this is what a true roguelike is and loved for.Despite being in the early access, game fills finished and fine, although there is only 2/3 of planed content. I encounter zero bugs for 5 hours of playing.			"

												This game is what RNGesus prays to.I am not recommending this game because I don't believe that it is for everyone. At least the very least, I recommend waiting for a decent Steam sale.I currently sit at 9.2 hours clocked into this game which is not a lot, I know, but every one of those hours were played separately after having to step away for breaks from the grinding. Not solely because of the grind, mind you. I have an affinity for reptative and tedious tasks in general. BUT I draw the line when said tasks result in absolutely no personal skill improvement or in-game reward.As far as personal skill is concerned: all of the meticulous memorizing and party/skill combo experiments are thwarted against the game's RNG.For in-game progress: I've yet to complete a dungeon. Most of my time has been spent so far purely farming for curing characters enough to continue farming. The game has a very minimalistic approach to leveling and upgrading. There's no stat or trait selections, no large armour, weapon, jewlery, trinket, and silk panty customization. It seems that a little is meant to go a long way when upgrading which should make it exciting when you finally get the cash and/or materials to upgrade...But that just has not been the case. Not only is it very hard to gain the cash/materials needed for upgrading when you can only complete 3 or 4 rooms per run, but I've also realized quite early on that spending money on upgrading characters is pointless. They WILL die. I believe I have only 1 original character left and that is mostly by chance. Not to mention that the skill upgrades seem very low. Buffing helps a lot but when enemies are throwing out an average 10 damage per hit (not including dot damage like bleeds), sometimes raw healing is needed. But the healing skill I have is upgraded from 5 to 6 points for one character per turn. No matter how I spam, it is impossible to keep up with the damage output of many enemies across all of my characters.Not being able to upgrade characters has lead to a real stagnation in any progress. I have spent about 9 of the 9.2 hours just grinding the same enemies in the same dungeons which is just getting dull. Yes, I have been able to upgrade my little Hamlet place a bit, but saving a couple hundred gold on curing afflictions has not made a significant dent in my ability to keep up with curing. Most of my cash goes to this, recruitment, and food that doesn't do anything anyway except negate occasional 20% damage hits in the middle of crawling.I get what the developers were trying to do here. The game has cool visuals, the audio is great and the idea of dungeon crawling taking a toll on the average adventurer both physically and psycologically is an interesting concept. I just don't believe that the execution was very good. The story, or what little there is of a story, has really been stamped out by the mechanics and I would prefer a more in-depth, story-driven look at the affects of taking on your nightmares than this. As it stands, I don't care if my characters go mad. The only reason it bothers me is it messes up my combat strategies. At that point, I'd rather just let the person die because it's cheaper to just recruit a carbon copy than care about the psycholical stresses and recovery from them for that character.I will likely continue playing this game for many hours into the future just to see if I can progress anywhere and learn any sound strategies as I simply enjoy the environment and ambiance offered by the visual and audal work that has been implemented.With that, I did have a pretty funny experience at the time of losing most of my starting characters. And this might contain some spoilers if you can consider a cautionary tail about one of the game's surprise prostate exams a spoiler.I approached this strange, glowing stone that was wrapped by a twisted tendril protruding from the floor. There was a bit of information that popped up on my screen--perhaps as one of my character's dialogue boxes--that mentioned I should use an item on this cute piece of contemporary art. Upon doing so, my entire party was sucked into some vortex and trapped in an abyss with quite the impressive-looking boss which I could best describe as a wonderful rendition of an actual purple people-eater. After a couple of love taps to the monster's belly, I realized my quest to loot this guy was going to be futile. Even the game itself was quite aware of what a s**t storm I had gotten myself into. My first tool tip informing me of the ""retreat"" mechanic popped up on screen. ""Thank God!"" I thought as I began spamming that bad boy before the monster could lay another finger/tentacle/whatever on my party; the same party that was now looking more like that box of raisins that have been floating about at the bottom of a juniour high kid's backpack for an entire semester. That is to say, there wasn't much left of my party at this point. My relief was quickly dashed, however, when the message that the attempt to run away had failed! With a well-recorded ""slap"" from the boss (love the audio), one of my party members fell dead...permenantly. My next couple of turns were spent just trying to run away with the message that the attempt had failed popping up on my screen before it could even completely dissolve after the last click. Just before my party was about to be completely wiped, the game had the audacity to pop another tool-tip up for me to REMIND me that the retreat function exists and that if my party wipes, it will be entirely my fault for not timing the get-away properly. I would have been livid if I weren't laughing through my face-palm. The next couple of minutes were spent by me sipping mineral water and enjoying the high quality recordings of people dying and the monster blurgeling while the narrator chastised me in his low, sensual voice. Needless to say, I've since avoided all future art school projects that I've come across in the hallways of the Darkest Dungeon.			"

								If Saving Private Ryan didn't make you cry, this game certainly will. Some fights you get by without a scratch, others manage to punch out all your blood in under a minute. When I wasn't outright killed in a fight, everyone in my party certainly wished they were. When 3 crits in a row wipe out 3 members of the party and the last one abandons the quest and leaves the dungeon insane, you know you're in the wrong hood.11/10 - It's ok.			"

 Warning: this review will be quite lengthy. This game… ahhhhhhhh, it filled me with such wondrous feelings! The art style, the exceptional diction of the narrator, the atmosphere—all of this was well executed. Sadly, this is where the merits of Darkest Dungeon end. Gameplay Kill all the creatures in rooms, explore this amount of territory, find these items, kill this boss—there is some variety in the missions. However, they all feel the same—none of the choices are unique enough to change up how you approach the areas and play the game.Playstyle… that reminds me of random number generation! An abhorrent string of words, oft applied to the darkest of debacles. Answer this inquiry: how in the hell do I go into a mission fully provisioned, decked out in magnificent trinkets, and using a squad that is recommended by the developers of the game (certain team combinations have names attached to them) and still lose everybody?You know, such execrable failures wouldn’t be so bad if it didn’t take forever to pull my heroes back to the summit of strenght. Later in the game you are able to recruit new team members that are experienced… but there are six levels in Darkest Dungeon and new guys can only be found from 0 to 3.Putting more time in wouldn’t be as bad if there was more variety to the game. The amount of hours I put into Darkest Dungeon is enough for you to witness everything several times. If I’ve mastered something then why do I have to go back and do it again and again because the RNG decided to execute me? Utterly risible and devoid of ratiocinating.Trudging through worn soil wouldn’t be so bad if you didn’t have to beat the last area in the game four times. This is the very definition of artificial lengthening. Broken Promises Some of this repetition could have been fixed if the developers decided to actually follow through with the very first sentence of the game’s blurb: “Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike turn-based RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring.”A complete lie. Stress does not come from adventuring: the ever present feeling that death could occur at any moment, horrid sights, injuries, brushes with death. Instead, stress comes from witches casting spells. From the blurb I was also led to believe there would be a narrative in the game, but the story and characterization was so weak it basically did not exist. Characters Some of the troops have a comic strip that gives insight into what lead them to the hamlet. This makes it seem like the heroes are individuals… but they are not. They are clones, soldiers fresh from a vat and ready to fight. Why not take away the infinite supply of people? Then, there would be room to characterize these heroes and show that stress is affecting them through dialogue, which is more interesting than random barks.Through characterization, the heroes’ motives could have been shown. These could then influence mission objections and create unique quests that aren’t spat out by a random number generator. Maybe these motives could toy with the chemistry of the party and abilities the heroes are capable of utilizing. Perhaps by taking care of these unique missions the heroes could gain resolve levels. Stress System Remove or weaken witches and skeletons with goblets of liquid stress. It makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense when adventuring should be the source of worry. Make it a slow climb—unless something awful like a hero’s death occurs—and make it difficult to get rid of. Conclusion This game was teeming with good ideas. Sadly, Red Hook did not take the time to contemplate how they could make combat less reliant on RNG. They also failed to take the time to flesh out their characters, story, and stress system. Darkest Dungeon is too long for the amount of content that it contains and could use more time in development.			"

												Great combat system, art, and style;mediocre everything else. The narrator has WAY too little variety basically making it a necessity to mute him, while the lore and story are better left ignored. That doesn’t matter too much in a game like this, since the gameplay is what’s important. Unfortunately, the exploration mechanics are so obtuse and set against the player with cheap RNG to the extent that you can't even capitalize off of what’s supposed to be a positive result. For example being surprised basically dooms your party in certain circumstances, and almost always results in a hero dying or being brought down to 0 hp based on the order they’re put in, while surprising the enemy just results in the enemies going twice in a row, which means you're still taking more unmanageable and frankly unreasonable damage considering that you have to survive consecutive fights and losing heroes has lasting effects on what you have to do next. Each time you lose a hero or they become inflicted with something you need to heal, it is not money you primarily lose, it is time. Not a resource in the game, but your actual free time. Whenever you lose a hero, you more or less have to play a couple more hours just to grind out new heroes to replace dead ones, which can easily result in you losing more heroes due to bad rolls, making it so you need to grind even more. The game is just a perpetual meat grinder where you’re going to spend 10 hours just trying to reach where you were before a bad roll killed your party. This reliance on RNG for the main difficulty ruins the fun of the combat, since whenever you do beat a difficult run it feels less like something you earned, and more like you just got lucky.  In the end for a game that expects you to put 50 hours into it to beat, it doesn't nearly make itself feel worthwhile enough to bother finishing. While I enjoy a lot of the time I put into it and I will probably put more time into it in the future, considering how frustrating it can be to play, how much of a time investment it is, and the repetitive nature of the game, I cannot recommend Darkest Dungeon, as I cannot recommend a game that doesn’t feel worthwhile to beat.

You start out wide-eyed and excited by all the cool moments. ""Yeah my main hero became virtuous!"" By the end you've had to deal with so much absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t dice rolling you no longer notice or even care when it goes in your favor. To make matters worse, when the dice rolling doesn't go in your favor you then have to do an insane amount of grinding through recycled content to get back to where you were.			"

												Sorry, I really want to like this game but I can't I get you want the game to be hard but there is hard and there is pointless. The rng in this is overwhelming so that even if you try your best and do everything correctly your skill is not rewarded, as such the game is really just about luck. You can prepare all you want but it is pointless.There's also the issue with the difficulty. Here's what happened to me, as soon as I started (after the first area) I ran into a weird squid boss which pummeled me. I had to retreat and all my heroes were stressed out, was forced to create a rag tag group. As soon as I went in my heroes became stressed immediately and was hit by four enemies crits in a row and all of my heroes attacks missed.My advice, wait until they sort out the rng and game mechanics. Until then I would recommend not buying as at the moment it's just a game of luck and not skill. Music's nice, characters are interesting, enemy design is interesting but game play is just broken and unfair.Can I get my money back?			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing great...... for about the first 30 hours.Then you slowly realize how horribly grindy this game becomes, with not much variety to spark as you go through the same mazes 100+ tmes just to get better gear/upgrade your facilites (which in turn could get screwed anyways due to RNG events that have no right to be how hard they are)also RNG in this game is just horrible it isnt funny. Stats on your characters are almost usless as none of them transist into the game. So expect one of your best chaaracter to get crited 3 times in a row and die withtout you being able to do anything.Bosses are one of the few things in this game that spices it up, HOWEVER it turns into just fighting the same boss 3 times in different difficulties, almost no variety or changes.However the art/voices/atmopshere in this game is literally 10/10. Redhook just needs to laern that unfair hard does not equal fun. You have throw your players a bone otherwise boredom sets in when youre doing the same thing over...and over, all the while getting ♥♥♥♥ed when you shouldnt deserved to be for doing semi ok.			"

												I've tried really hard to beat this game but I just cannot do it, as the biggest problem with this game is how actively it plays against you. I am very a much of fan of these tough-as-nails perma-death ironman games, XCOM is even my favorite game series, but this game just does not handle that formula properly. One of the first things you'll see the game tell you is that you have to ""make the best of a bad situation"", but that's a complete joke. Every now and then you'll come up against a challenging fight and sure you can salvage a tough fight but when the game starts throwing the dice against your favor you just can't win. Most of my squad wipes have come from purely random crits decimating my team without me being able to do anything to fight back.Honestly, this wouldn't really be a problem if the game actually provided you with the the ability to come back from squad wipes. Sure, early on a few deaths here and there don't impact you that much, but if you have your four best heroes equipped with your best trinkets and get a squad wipe you will lose all of those trinkets and essentially have to start from scratch, making all future missions harder without the bonuses provided by those trinkets. When you're a decent way into the game you can get completely crippled by squad wipes rather than just set back like in other perma-death games. The combat is pretty solid and will keep you entertained for a while, but once you've assembled a good army and know which squads synergize best it just becomes a rather bland repetitive experience of cycling through attacks that only ever gets spiced up if your squad randomly gets surprised which causes them to shuffle positions. It's really unfortunate that so many of the enemies are just identical and far too easy to exploit weaknesses on, which is then made extremely frustrating when your entire strategy falls apart due to the aforementioned random dice rolls that ruin everything.This game is just so beautiful though, the art is fantastic and sets a devilishly good tone for the grim and daunting environments you are put in. The narrator adds some much appreciated flair to the events you'll come across and the many Lovecraft-esque monsters will make you just as stressed and terrified as your heroes fighting them. If I could recommend the game for this alone I absolutely would, but there are just too many debilitating pitfalls all over the game that simply ruin the whole experience.			"

								Simply put, the games stress mechanic works great, and is an amazing example of gameplay story integration. As a reality ensues version of a dungeon crawler, it succeeds amazingly. Alot of minor things may not be explained at first, and some things that work you may not even try because of thinking about what you can do, because you think of it as a game and dont try something you would do irl (see using bandages as handwraps for investigating a kniferack). The heros are varied and never seem to be just carbon copies of eachother, and the position based strategy like combat is fun and interesting. But be careful that the stress doesnt get to even you, rushing your judgement and making mistakes as a consequence of stress, again, that stress based mechanic is well implemented, an amazingly interesting theme, and adds alot to the gameplay. Though some might find the RNG a bit too powerful.The game leaves an impression when you just look at it that it will be overcomplicated but really its not, its the same effect as FTL, a cursory glance at the variety of features gives an illusion of overcomplication. Certain moves work in certain positions, and you remember them reasonably well, and some are more suited for the front or back of your lineup due to being a tanking melee or a healer/ranged for instance. The stress makes you go insane at first and eventually a heart attack, but camping, jesters, critical hits, disarming traps and sometimes kills heal it, with a bit of skill its not that bad. They can get negative traits to debuff them that cost a bit of money to remove, and you take them to buildings to upgrade armor and moves and relieve stress. Even the trinkets I found to be relatively intuitive, upsides and downsides use them to buff or compensate, try not to leave to big a weakness, at the very least stuff like the blight stones and archers rings are easily understood.The game doesnt ever tell you what you feel, despite what some may think, it tells you what they feel, and they can get stressed, go mad and have heart attacks. Stress can feel like more of a danger than the health, as its alot harder to cure. Death functions a bit differently, if someone loses all their health they go onto ""Death's Door"", where they theoretically could live forever, but every hit could strike them down, basically its a 67% chance that they dont die forever every time, and bleeding and blight count as hits every time they activate. Do you keep risking the fight? Do you abandon the mission to save them lest they die forever. I'm about to explain why you should care about just another Vestal or Crusader, but heres how camping works first, you get 12 ""Time"" Everyone has 3 camping skills at once, each requires time, they can grant buffs, stress heal, and heals, you use firewood granted on longer missions to camp, you can be ambushed while you camp every once in awhile with lower light, messing up your lineup, etc. Now, onto individuality.The game is also very good about letting you have time to care even with minimal individual traits. Theres 7 different possible camping and combat moves which you can unlock and upgrade for customization. You can switch them from a few palette swaps, change their names. Upgrade weapons armor, equip trinkets. Despite being just another Vestal the positive and negative quirks grant a bit of functional not just aesthetic individuality. Sheer force of time lets you humanize and invest in them. You give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if they die. Though its not only possible but profitable to get a ton of new guys for free, throw them in a mission with barely any supplies, let them go insane and die, grab a ton of money and things like Busts, Crests, Portraits and Deeds (what you use to upgrade the town) and fire them neglecting to cure their diseases and psychological damage, as thats not free. You monster.One thing I neglected to mention is the light, you use torches to keep the lights higher, as lights high, you have a higher chance of scouting around and knowing whats around you on the map ahead of time, suprising enemies, and everyone friend or foe gets less crits. But you get less treasure and cause less crits. Lower light gets more treasure, your less likely to scout and more likely to be suprised, and theres more treasure. By the way, Crits you deal stress heal, Crits that hurt you cause stress.For some the darker tone reaches Narm Charm levels, personally I disagree, but its a subjective thing. The game switches between saying the world is♥♥♥♥♥♥ or the world is♥♥♥♥♥♥but not beyond redeeming. Alot of your party isnt exactly noble. Bounty Hunters, Grave Robbers, Occultists, Crusaders, Highwaymen. Some only seek payment, they arent all in it for the heroism. People die and stay dead, the art styles appealing and gloomy, the whole stress mechanic and reality ensues theme isnt exactly idealistic. The animations isnt that present, when you attack it switches their images, centers them in the middle of the screen enlarged, and tilts the camera. Some might call that simpler style a problem, but personally it could easily be considered a stylistic choice and they make it work VERY well. the art style is definitely pleasent to look at, and its definitely easy to run because of it. So *I* consider it a positive, but dont expect to many extravagent animations, but frankly making something like that a dealbreaker especially when the game isnt even ugly is a ♥♥♥♥ing stupid desicion.Ultimately it has interesting mechanics, intergrates gameplay and story masterfully, has an interesting theme, tons of replayability, and its just really fun to play and really easy to get invested in. For those of you concerned about whether or not to get it yet cause its in early access, waiting till full release I can understand, wanting the whole experience all at once yknow, but if you dont care, its definitely interesting, well put together and fun, even in early access. Its worth buying as it is NOW, is what im saying. I recommend it. Also the musics well done. As the light gets darker the music gets more intense or chaotic, you can hear more unnerving ambience in the background. The tracks strings can really capture the stress of your situation. It composition covering the seriousness of every encounter. The music of your Estate is soft and sad, but not hopeless. The lighter keys making you feel at least like you have a chance.			"

												I've tried really hard to beat this game but I just cannot do it, as the biggest problem with this game is how actively it plays against you. I am very a much of fan of these tough-as-nails perma-death ironman games, XCOM is even my favorite game series, but this game just does not handle that formula properly. One of the first things you'll see the game tell you is that you have to ""make the best of a bad situation"", but that's a complete joke. Every now and then you'll come up against a challenging fight and sure you can salvage a tough fight but when the game starts throwing the dice against your favor you just can't win. Most of my squad wipes have come from purely random crits decimating my team without me being able to do anything to fight back.Honestly, this wouldn't really be a problem if the game actually provided you with the the ability to come back from squad wipes. Sure, early on a few deaths here and there don't impact you that much, but if you have your four best heroes equipped with your best trinkets and get a squad wipe you will lose all of those trinkets and essentially have to start from scratch, making all future missions harder without the bonuses provided by those trinkets. When you're a decent way into the game you can get completely crippled by squad wipes rather than just set back like in other perma-death games. The combat is pretty solid and will keep you entertained for a while, but once you've assembled a good army and know which squads synergize best it just becomes a rather bland repetitive experience of cycling through attacks that only ever gets spiced up if your squad randomly gets surprised which causes them to shuffle positions. It's really unfortunate that so many of the enemies are just identical and far too easy to exploit weaknesses on, which is then made extremely frustrating when your entire strategy falls apart due to the aforementioned random dice rolls that ruin everything.This game is just so beautiful though, the art is fantastic and sets a devilishly good tone for the grim and daunting environments you are put in. The narrator adds some much appreciated flair to the events you'll come across and the many Lovecraft-esque monsters will make you just as stressed and terrified as your heroes fighting them. If I could recommend the game for this alone I absolutely would, but there are just too many debilitating pitfalls all over the game that simply ruin the whole experience.			"

								Welp, I will start by saying I've been on the fence about this game for a while. Truthfully, unlike a lot of people I didn't start this game when it was considered its golden days, I started after corpses and heart attacks were allowed to be disabled, which I did from the get go and never looked back. That being said, I really enjoyed this game, and I still do to some extent. But every recent patch has just made the game more and more unbearable, with enemy crit chance being so damn high, prot being frickin ridiculous, and enemies in general having too much dodge. I could live with enemies in champion level dungeons having 40+ base dodge if my characters could get that much. When they do, it's with trinkets and it rarely seems to help. Enemies also have perfect skills, which pretty much make move skills only good for them. If your arbalest or healer, or plague doctor gets pulled to rank 1, well, unless you work fast they will die fast. What happens if I pull one of their ranged rank 4 units? He starts using close range moves, that, while weaker, still allow him to do something all while those who were moved back use moves pushing them forward/don't give a single crap about the rules and continue using their moves from back rows. I understand they don't want move to be op, but if my leper gets to rank 4 what does he do? Slowly walk his way up? Champion level dungeons right now are the biggest chore, with enemies having so much life/dodge/prot it takes forever to kill things. Oh, and disregard the tooltip telling you to use blight on high prot enemies, 9/10 times good classes can just do a melee swing and apply a bleed totalling to way more than the blight. The only time I would recommend blight is against the formless flesh in champion. Class balance; I haven't gotten to try the abomination out yet, but when I saw my cousin using him in apprentice dungeons he seemed really good. Whether or not that will last into champion who knows. But unfortunately, for class balance in general, it's not that good. In normal dungeon crawling scenarios, I'd argue it's ok. Any class can manage on normal runs. Hell, until champion, I'd even argue most classes can do most bosses. But unfortunately, even with that being said, there will always be classes better. My top pick would easily be Hellion, as this class has enough hp and dodge to function as a tank while easily outdamaging any other class in the game and even being able to hit further ranks of enemies, which is very important on bosses in champion level dungeons. Lepers, crusaders, a load of classes just won't cut it in champion. Also, most bosses cheat in champion dungeons too - the swine god still managed to do damage to my party when his damage was debuffed to -160%. So, in conclusion, I think this game had potential. It was fun, and to some extent now it's still fun. It's a lot more unique than the cookie cutter crafting games on steam early access, but unfortunately, these devs disregarded fun at one point and tried to make it as gimmicky and ""hars"" as possible. Take it from me, I've spent a lot of time in this game, maxed every estate building, and beaten almost every boss. Don't waste the time or money people - pass.Tl;dr - Unfair, unfun, RNG, stupid patches that only make it worse.			"

								I'm currently writing this in a fit of salty rage over how cheatted Darkest Dungeon has made me feel, so you can consider this completely biased. However I just don't really give a single ♥♥♥♥ right now.Yes, yes Darkest Dungeon is a hard game. You can expect RNG to ruin a run, that your heroes are expendable, and that you know all of this to be true right when you buy the game. This does not change the fact that when all your hours of progess results in a monumental loss that makes your entire campaign trashed thats when I draw the line. Let me explain the absolute trainwreck that was my latest campaign.See this was actually my second campaign after my short introductory one that I fully conceded failed on my behalf. So I set off on the next one and I'm doing fantastic, it's going great. However a simingly mundane roadblock comes right out of nowhere putting my entire strategy in jepordy. Party members LV3 or above can't enter any dungeons below their level, even against bosses. *WHAT*?! So since the game doesn't tell me this absolutely massive detail my entire strategy is in upheaval. Well, I say to myself thats really big, but I can push past this. I've got plenty of time to build my forces, getting high LV 2s (but not too high) for bosses and a LV 3 team for veteran runs.While doing this I ran into an astonishingly bad development choice surronding ambush mechanics on medium/ long dungeons. When camping you have the option to eat, heal, and stress heal which is a life saver. The kicker is that you have a chance of being ambushed after camping where the game arbitrary takes away all your torch light, even though camping firewood gives you 100 light while surprsing nearly every party member. For those uninitiated when you have low torch light enemies do faaaaaar more damage, you gain stress at a much higher rate, and when you are surprised enemies get a whole free turn to attack. So after camping and getting everyone to full HP on two seperate occasions I lost a total of 1-2 party memebers to low level mobs since they all decide to gang bang the healer or what have you. Oh and don't even think about using a torch because when ambushed you can't use torches, DUH, obviously!But despite all that I had done it, 6-9 party members all at LV 3 a complete truimph. Persevering despite the horrific odds that's what Darkest Dungeon is all about!Oh I just failed both of my 2 raids to LV 3 dungeons along with my priceless trinckets... Well, it would have been nice if I could've leveled them up before entering the meat grinder, but ehehe that's not how this game wants you to play. In my latest failure ending just about 30 minutes ago I suffered 3 crits in a row, rabies, 2 occultist heals resulting in 0 HP with characters on death's door, and 3 misses since the veteran enemies have higher dodge + HP, accumulating in a complete wipe. You know I was ready to give this a complete and undivided recommendation. I loved it even while I hated it, and with so many games holding your hand to an obessesive degree Darkest Dungeon was truly refreshing. Plus its a game that handles its Lovecraftian atmosphere and world perfectly with gameplay reflecting that. However there is just so many times you can handle what feels like the game blatently cheating you over on factors you have no control over. So while this review might be unrecommended there is certainly a ton of value to be had, just be warry of the Darkest RNG.			"

								If you are interest with this game, good! I am more than willing  to recommend it to you . Awesome 1Have no doubt it is a rouge-like syle game with higly replayable elements.  The gameplay is unique and fun, even it is on early access atm. Awesome 2You don't like to see the enemy dodge your attack, and then return you with another critical strike?Oh, dont worry. You will get that a lot in the game! Oh Yes, if you are lucky enough you can dodge their attack too... but no such  luck can last forever.Awesome 3Not only the heros in dungeon, this game can also dirve the player into madness. When player get 100%stress, most likely they will be doing..........  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  like me.But hey, think in the good way~That make you feel real in the game,isn't it? So I suggest you better have another set of keyboard and monitor before you play. After all, Good Luck!You will need it.			"

								This game is painfully unrewarding. I have spent hours learning how to play it from walkthroughs and forums.... Hours and hours completely wasted.Ive completed darksouls so I'm not shy of a challenging game but at least Dark souls made you feel like you were achieving something, even when taking 1 step back for every 2 steps forward, But Darkest dungeon is just irritatingly hard, obnoxiously difficult, it makes me want to smash my own face in. I couldnt pass the first 3 rooms on the first level for the entire first day that I owned the game and thats not due to lack of skill, because this game doesnt require much skill to play, after all its completely luck based. Everything that happens is based off of luck and the odds are stacked against you.I can not recommend this game to anyone simply because if they buy it, then they will be new to the game, and darkest dungeon HATES new players, absolutely wants to qiss and zhit all over new players faces and just expects them to learn all the tricks off everyone else via youtube and wiki's instead of in game advice/turorials/help/hints that should be there to help out new players but isnt. This is an unforgiving, unrewarding game that can ruin your entire day if you waste too much time on it.			"

												The game has wonderful atmosphere, great naration and a bunch of different character types. It also has samey dungeons that become massive tedious RNG grind-fests, with an endgame that forces you back into the grind over and over and over through RNG, learning what works in the final fights and the in-game mechanic that makes it so any team that fights in the last dungeon never returns. Do you like grinding character levels for hours and hours on end, constantly min-maxing in the same 3-4 dungeons against the same 3-4 enemies in each dungeon? Boy do I have a tedious, boring, annoying game for you!			"

								I have to say that this game is one of my favorites. 9.3/10You will face hard♥♥♥♥♥enemies, you will fail probably even more than win, you will get frustrated because you let your higher level, well-equiped and fully upgraded hero die. But in the end, when you complete a dungeon alive a smile will pop in you face.The game is all about grinding. The more dungeons you complete, the more gold you have to spend in upgrades and trinkets (equipments for your heroes). Each dungeon has a reward, and there are three kinds of dungeons: you have a short dungeon - it has fewer rooms - and its easier to complete, you also have medium dungeons - it has an considerable amount of rooms - and you get a campfire, with you can set a camp and rest/buff you heroes mid-quest, and last but no least you have long dungeons - it has a lot of rooms - you will have to go through a huge amount of rooms in order to complete those kind of dungeons. You also have to set a strategy before going into an adventure. In certain areas of the game, monster will be more resistent as certain kind of DoT (damage over time) than others. Keep it in mind when you`re think in bring a Plague Doctor to the Weald, or remember to have a Crusader in you party when you`re going to the cursed Ruins. You will also have to manage resources before going to an adventure. You can buy torches, food, antivenom, bandages etc. Everything to raise the chances of your crew to return alive to the town. I`d say that is still possible to complete a dungeon without bringing anything, but you`ll have to retreat 99% of the time.Well, if world isn`t perfect, why should this game be?After about 100 hours I`ve reached the max level with every class in the game, killed all the bosses, collected all the ancestral items and my town was fully upgraded. Well, there was anything more to do. You still have dungeons to complete, but as I said the fun part is the grinding, and when you finish grinding you don`t have much to do. You definitely can still have fun, challenging yourself to do a dark run (without torches) and so on, but that`s up to you.I`d highly recommend this game for everyone who enjoy play RPG, turn-based like games. This game is totally worth the $15 you have to pay.			"

												I really liked the game during early access because the constant updates changed the balance of the game and you had to adapt. But Red Hook was never able to fix the core problem of the game: grinding. You spend over 90% of the time grinding. The boss fights are really fun but there just a very small part of the game.I got my money's worth with darkest dungeon because I played since the very beginning of the early access. The major balance updates kept the game interesting and kinda fixed it's repetitive nature during early access. But I can't recommend the release version of Darkest Dungeon to new players because the game has actually not that much content and the grinding just artificially lengthens it. You are doing always the same thing. The dungeons, the fights are pretty much always the same.			"

												Too hard? Probably not. Too random and time consuming? Yes. 100% yes.I love RNG based games, especially Isaac, Nuclear Throne and XCOM, but this is plain annoying and unfair. I went into it having read the disclaimers and after seeing lots of gameplay, but unless you're into early Gygax style killing off of characters you will NOT enjoy this, the rebuilding takes sooo long and is all about grinding.That is the only reason for the negative review, but it was enough for me.Artwork, the other mechanics, sound, style are top notch, which makes me even madder at the difficulty.I'll continue watching Let's Plays and streams for Darkest Dungeon, but that will only be to see people suffer...

												The Darkest Dungeon is an intially fresh RPG with a rich gothic aesthetic, but it slowly turns into a deeply unenjoyable soul-crushing experience. Calling the Darkest Dungeon a ""strategy"" game or ""difficult"" is deceptive. Both these terms imply navigating and problem solving within some matrix of information you are given, and rather in the Darkest Dungeon pretty much all valuable information you need is only given to you after post-hoc trial-and-error. This might be fine given the games self-described morbidity, but unfortunately each ""mistake"" creates such a setback that the real pain doesn't come from a character that you lost, but from the thought of how many hours you were just set back. The most succint way I can describe the Darkest Dungeon is to picure a game of chess where you perpetually only know 3/4ths of the rules, random spaces on the board are booby trapped, and your prospects of either winning (or losing) appear to approach infinity. While I certainly enjoyed the first 20+ hours of the game (and hence technically I got my money's worth) the next 20 were so egregious that like matter meeting anti-matter, anything nice I would have to say about this game was cancelled out by the real horror that lies inside the Darkest Dungeon: its game design.

								Simple adventurer management paired with rough roguelike dungeon crawling wrapped in amazing atmosphere sums up as Darkest Dungeon!It is a fascinating, even hypnotic game to play. From UI to gameplay everything transfers swiftly, yet without breaking the immersion or atmosphere. The story is simple and goes well with the gameplay. Enviromental design, art style, narrator voice and the choice of words paint an awesome, yet grim, Warhammer Fantasy-style feeling in the canvas of your mind. Several times, I have found myself sitting in front of my screen playing ""one more dungeon"" and doing ""little more management"".In it's core Darkest Dungeon is a hardcore gaming experience that needs time and dedication to learn and master. More I learn, more I realize the outcome is in my hands. There is surprisingly little weight on RNG when compared on many other roguelikes. At times things have felt unfair but later the realization of mistakes has stroke me. For a singleplayer game, such as Darkest Dungeon, the feelings of victory and defeat are strong and enjoyable. They remind me of Dark Souls, Faster Than Light and This War of Mine.PS. I recommend renaming or adding nicknames to  your subjects whenever you feel like so. It creates a nice bond between You and your lackeys. However, I must warn that the feeling of loss is unavoidable and brings up all kinds of emotions. ;-)			"

												My opinion on this game is that it is good- to a point. That point being the Veteran level dungeons. The early game is fun, interesting, challenging and good, but by even the mid-game the problems start to show. First off, your heros become locked away once they are high enough level to go to the next dungeon tier - in others words, you finally got that hero up to max level without one of the many crippling debilitations screwing them over (or paying money to fix them when you can) NOPE! Cant use them now, go to the next elvel of dungeon where they are back to being weak in comparision to the monsters. Second off, as with everyone else, I have to complain about the RNG. Forget cuthulu, you need to be building your shrines to RNGesus for you to really get anywhere, as basically everything in this game passes by him at LEAST once, if not more. Not that this is a problem in the earlier levels - the game doesn't expect you to be using any of the advanced tactics (which rely on RNG more heavily than just hitting the enemies), so if RNG betrays you a few times while using them, it's not a big deal, you aren't punished (you only aren't rewarded). Any of the later missions though - the game NEEDS you to be using the RNG reliant advanced tactics. This means that, even if you play the more intricate sytle perfectly, should RNG ever betray you, you're suddenly utterly obliterated becuase you apparently didn't know how to use the advanced tactics correctly - never mind if you're in a bad position and have to not spend turns doing things like shuffling openents in order to heal (becuase RNG screwed you over last time). The game is interesting and fun, and RNG is an important part of it, too, just like many other games. The problem lies in combat that does just involve RNG - it RELIES on RNG, and one failure means that the dungeon run is scrapped, do not continue, hope you didn't get too much stress/diseases/negative-quirks, better luck (litterally) next time, chap. The game can be either one of two things - forgiving of RNG screwing you over, or not letting RNG screw you over completely. Unfortunately, the game si currently a third thing - BAD, unfun, and punishing in the bad way (especially becuase it will punish you for RNG rather than your actions). Overall, I think that beucase of the games good comcept, ideas, and character, it makes for a good 7-10 hours or so in the quite great early game before you hit the veteran RNG-wall. I think it's a great 10 hours, though, so I recond buying the game but only if you're willing to spend it on only 8-10 hours of pretty good content. If you're looking for a longer life out of you game, look elsewhere. The game is basically a fun evening, but one you leave with a bad taste in your mouth.			"

												Darkest Dungeon promised a lot of things that you often see associated with the ""Rogue-like"" tag; ""Challenging"", ""difficult"", ""dark"", ""rewarding of skill"", and the usual malarky. It even seemed like it might deliver on these. Playing through its Early Access was usually enjoyable, even when bugs interfered. Still, there was always this nagging feeling that the developers could not quite get the balance of player power versus the game's environment down. There were many times where the game simply decided that you could not win, no matter how well equipped and pre-planned you went in; enemies would land critical strings constantly and dodge far more than they should even after being debuffed, or the foes would relentlessly target one specific unit even when the targeting system is meant to be randomized (aside from certain rare encounters). This feeling grew as release version after release version added more to the enemy's side but did nothing to bring up the player's tools to match. No amount of skill or planning can save you against terrible luck, especially when the abilities available to you just can not measure up to the enemies'.What I'm trying to say is, the game fell prey to the most common pitfall of the tag: the Random Number God trumps anything you might do, as the developers confused biased dice systems and overpowered enemies with genuine challenge. The early game will let you pass if you use tactics, but the mid and late game are all about praying that the dice land in your favor.On top of luck being the deciding factor in combat and exploration, the game constantly stacks even the menus against you. Healing higher leveled heroes of stress, illnesses, or mental ailments becomes increasingly expensive just because they are a higher level than the scrubs fresh off the stagecoach; it's an arbitrary punishment for progressing with them! You may get stuck in a cycle of needing to do low level missions to pay for stress relief or illness removal on your higher level characters just so that you can play the missions that actually advance the story. Alternatively, you could just straight up dismiss characters that you already invested money in so that you can hire a fresh batch of heroes off the stagecoach to try again from the start.Imbalanced gameplay aside, the game does present a very nice... errr, grim atmosphere. The gloomy graphics, subdued sounds, and sudden spikes of noise when something dramatic happens are great at setting the mood. Character animations are rather limited (for example, you get the same animation whether a character dodges or gets hit by something), but they do get the idea of the move or action across. The narrator, your character's ancestor who kicked off the plot, is usually entertaining with his comments, but they do become stale after you've heard every comment many times.On a final note, major bugs are still seemingly common with the game, as it only recently left Early Access at the time of this review. My patience for it was finally ruined after my saves became corrupted. Such issues may be resolved in time, but until then you're risking all progress if you play in its current state.TLDR: It's luck-based, and still buggy. Wait to see if it gets fixed and rebalanced before you buy.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a beautifully polished game filled with eldritch horrors alongside campy humor. Each of the bucketful of character classes plays differently, and finding combinations of types that work together is a joy. The art and animation is a clever use of low-budget (other ""indie"" gamemakers take note); it fits the game theme beautifully. The whole game is dark and difficult and weird.Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, you are at the mercy of a RNG. The game itself has a disclaimer when you first start; it warns you that the game is never going to be easy, and will always be about managing terrible situations. Fine.The trouble is, though, that the game is a mix of ""perfect"" strategy (each character class has best-in-slot items and abilities and positions and partners) and utter hands-off randomness. There's nothing you can do to respond to a situation; the dungeons are random, the combats are random, and the rolls are random. So even if you have a plan for addressing a certain type of situation, there's literally nothing you can do to react to a problem when it comes up. The perfect strategy is also frustrating - there's no point in trying a first-slot Vestal, for example. There's a use and pairing for each class. You'll need to get all of them, but it still won't matter.Overall, this is a great start, but needed to go back to the drawing board on mechanics.I will be downvoted for this review.			"

												It is a wonderful game, until you get to champion dungeons (which require characters with more experience). It then takes these great game mechanics and tarnishes them with some legitimately awful stat changes, which creates a difficulty curve beyond even my comprehension. Speaking of this difficulty, Darkest Dungeon does not handle difficulty in a very consistent way. Being as prepared as you can be for a quest will eventually mean nothing to a set of unlucky random chances, especially when the stakes are so high during later game excursions.If you get it, stick with a lower difficulty. Otherwise, you will not enjoy it. It is a shame because they managed to ♥♥♥♥ up such a fantastic baseline for an addictive experience.			"

												The game mechanics suck. I don't mind playing difficult games, but when you invest hours of game play and this game just decides when you are going to lose. No matter what your numbers are, no matter how much planning went into your team, you are just going to lose because the game decides you need to lose your good squad. The gameplay is artificially being extended by creating impossible battles so you can lose your best squad and have to start over. The game has some good ideas, it's just too bad the developers got lazy and took the easy way out by forcing your squad to get killed off artificially instead of having actual realistic game mechanics. There are instances in many games that involve good and bad luck and then there are games like Darkest Dungeon where the outcomes are predetermined. Predetermined outcomes are lazy and unenjoyable for the player. I won't play this game again and I wouldn't recoomend that anyone buy it either unless you enjoy frustration and being manipulated. Gotta go delete this garbage. Bye... "

								This game is very fun, features a cool art style, and a dark souls-like experience, featuring permadeath and learning to manage stress, as well as your own health. Do you continue venturing forward, despite all adversity? Do you decide to end the mission early and count your losses? You will be asking these questions a lot as you play.You can also use items you recover from dungeons to upgrade and improve your town, which all is necessary to unlock more features, or create new weapons and armor, and better stress relief with the church and the tavern.Overall, I find this game very fun, difficult, and a great story. The voice narrator is amazing and really sells the game as well!			"

								This just isn't what I expected it would be. Games are supposed to give you control, but this game just makes you feel like everything is beyond your control. Every time something good happens, I can't enjoy it because right around the corner, something twice as bad happens. I feel like no matter the effort I put into the game, it will still screw me in the end. And that's just no fun. Dark Souls is hard, but it's a satisfying kind of hard because you are in full control of your actions. A lot of people seem to like the punishment of Darkest Dungeon, but I only accept punishment when I've made an informed mistake. This game is just sadistic for the sake of being sadistic. Only buy if you don't like being in control of your games.And yeah, I'm super disappointed. I wanted to like this game and have a great time with it so I could validate my purchase, but it's just no good for me.(Edit:  Please understand that I am not unimpressed by the quality of the game. The sound design and artwork were both very exceptional. I merely can't recommend the game because for me, it is a miserable and unenjoyable experience.)			"

								A unique, fun and challenging game. The atmosphere is quite dark :)  you can actually take care about your characters  mental health, or else they go completely crazy over time.The game gets frequent updates and the devs added some features that made the game even harder. I was suprised by a minority of vocal players who write negative reviews just because they can't adapt to gameplay changes. As the devs said it's an early access game and the actual gameplay mechanics change with each update. The developers listen to feedback seriously, with a recent update they made some features optional to calm down some players.Overall i highly recommend it it's more than worth the price.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a party based dungeon crawler experience with a twist in its core setting: Stress.Not every game puts on such an important topic in to a game as a core mechanic, and Darkest Dungeon shows it is an interesting mechanic that gets along with the whole game very well. The sad part is this game is not for everyone, especially for people who cannot take randomness or prone to making mistakes. Every action you do is permanent, and overcoming the RNG is the major part in Darkest Dungeon. Though these elements really do make the game way harder, it is very satisfying to see yourself overcome the Darkest Dungeon. Artwork is unique and fits the game perfectly. The soundtrack is intense and makes you think twice before pulling a trigger. As far as I know, there is only one voice actor, and he does his job so well. Every comment he makes, in battle or in town, gives you goosebumps.Darkest Dungeon may not be for everyone, but if you have a little bit of courage to make the best of the worst situations, you should buy this game.

Early Access Review
								Great game when I first bought it, but a recent patch having introduced a frankly inconvenient and unfun mechanic (corpses) in a game that's already dangerously RNG and frustration prone makes me have to change my review. If you hate yourself or play nothing but difficult and frustrating games that function off high risk low reward, you'll still love this game, but if you're a casual gamer or generally don't enjoy RNG-driven difficulty spikes then avoid this for now.This IS a fun game, but it could really use a difficulty toggle that doesn't penalize your gains so much that playing on easy actually makes you suck more in the long run, since you gain less loot and gold, for only a small decrease in difficulty.The game would greatly benefit from letting you play on easy for the first few dungeons you run and clear, and then gradually ramping up the reward curve for playing on hard so as to incite you to get comfortable and increase difficulty at your own pace. But also, it would benefit from easy being easier. As it is right now it really is just a self-imposed penalty on gains for only a tiny decrease in difficulty, and RNG can still totally screw you over anyway.TL;DR: Easy mode not easy enough, imposes huge penalty for almost no gain, especially combined with RNG. Latest patches have been pandering to the vocal minority asking for a harder more tedious game, alienating casual players. Game desperately in need of a game mode to separate players.			"

												This game seems to be good, and I really like the gameplay, but there is one mechanic that completly breaks the game, making it still possible, but it turns it into an endless dungeon-grind mode which is not fun at all.Basically, in this game you can get items (with rarity) to equip onto your characters, but these items even though they grant some bonus stats, also gives debuff stats. On the principle it's good, but when the debuff stat is equal to a bonus stat (+40% something / -40% something really troublesome) on some legendary items, you just can't equip them.I found some green items being more relevant than some legendaries, and hell no this is not correct.Unless the devs change that, and I assume they won't because you know how people are, this game won't be worth your time. Sure it will be fun for a couple hours, but then the price makes it not worth it.I hope some people read this and avoid the horrific experience of realizing you wasted your time.Nuff said.			"

								This is one of the few early access indie titles that I didn't hesitate to purchase after doing some research and it does not dissapoint.  Although it is still early access, Darkest Dungeon is well into development, has plenty of content, and is more then worth the asking price of $20.As for the gameplay itself, it is just as described:  A roguelike turn-based dungeon crawler rpg.  There is a good amount of depth and strategy involved, both in and out of battles.  Choosing how to spend your money and resources on upgrades and provisions, deciding which of your heroes to bring and which of their abilities to equip,  and choosing how to act during battles and other random events, etc...The art style is absolutely gorgeous, in a gritty, atmospheric kind of way.  The art and music come together perfectly to set a dark undertone.Oh, by the way, this game is hard.  You will always be struggling in one way or another while exploring a dungeon, and very rarely does a situation play out as planned, forcing you to change tactics and make decisions one turn at a time.  Although difficult and random (as expected from a roguelike) Darkest Dungeon never feels unfair.Overall this game is super dank and earns 8/10 bomb nuggets.  The final product will likely be a 9 or 10.			"

												Do you like a difficult and unforgiven game? How about:-Getting your heroes killed by RNG and loosing hours of progress building up your characters.-Grinding endlessly on low level dungeons to upgrade your town and your high level characters?-Spending all of your money on keeping the characters sane and slowly spending any extra gold (if any) to upgrade your heroes.-Trying and experimenting just to die and loose a lot of progress-Getting faced with a Difficulty wall in some point of the game.it's so grindy that It just feel that the Devs wanted to put a ingame store for you to buy and spend in order to advance in a  normal rate. On the plus side, learning the dungeons and building a party with the right skill is toughfull and makes things interesting. And the battle are strategic and engaging. I like Darkest Dungeon but it needs to be more forgiving or to the least remove the grind a bit and have the players experiment and have fun.			"

												However this game has tons of really nice aspects, like the combat mechanism, the stunning graphics and the cool narrative, I cannot go past the fact that the gameplay is farr too repetitive to keep me interested.Darkest Dungeon is one of those games where you will find yourself frinding endlessly in order to build-up for the next big challenge. This wouldn't have been an issue if there were a bit more variety in the encounters or with the possible situations the game puts you into.I'm eager to see what kind of updates this game will have in the future, and I may try this game again when more content is added to make the grinding phases less tedious.

Early Access Review
								This game is utterly fantastic, and I am super happy that I backed it when it came out. Let me start off by saying the devs are extremely responsive and constantly show up in the forums. Which is a huge plus, especially for an early access game. They listen to our feedback, and are quick to fix issues within the game. Just wanted throw a kudos to Red Hook. Y'all are awesome.On to the game now. The game is extremely high risk/high reward. Your team is low, but you've got one room left and you'll finish the quest. Do you risk it and attempt to see if the room is clear/fight the battle, or do you haul it back to town with your team in-tact and the treasure you've collected so far? There are interactable objects that can also save your run, or set you back which adds a lot to do while crawling through the dungeons. The game is extremely difficult, but in the best possible way.Starting off you're going to die, a lot. Until you learn the mechanics, learn how to build a balanced team for each dungeon. Learn how the abilities work and function. You will die, but that's ok. In Darkest Dungeon every death is a new lesson. The variety of heroes we've been given is pretty vast so far including the Grave Robber, Vestal, Occultist, Crusader, Highwayman, Hellion, Jester, and Leper. All of them work differentlky and do their jobs well.A tag you won't see on this game that is a major part of it is, Puzzle. Every fight is a puzzle of sorts, especially boss fights. They all have weaknesses and different attacks/combinations that mess up the enemies momentum and attacks. Got a dude sniping you from the back? Use Eldritch Pull to yank him to the front and knock him out. Got a Plague Doctor? Use Flash Powder to stun the back line while you eat their beefy front line leaving them open.There is so many to go through a dungeon and it's just an all-around fantastic game. The community is very helpful and we're all learning and helping each out. If you're into difficult, but rewarding games with a dark atmosphere, and Cthulhu/Eldritch creatures, then Darkest Dungeon is the game for you.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a brilliant turn based game loosely based off of lovecraftian lore. You are summoned to your ancestor's home that has fallen in disrepair and corruption to a force that is revealed as you progress through the storyline and fight bosses. With stunning graphical design and amazing voice acting by Wayne June you'll be instantly drawn in... however.From the very beginning the player is warned that this game is extremely hard, you will be forced to make tough decisions and not to grow overly attached to characters, THEY WILL DIE. Normally this is not an issue but...The game mechanics are flawed in many aspects. Your characters have an HP meter and a Stress meter. Once your stress meter reaches 100 out of 200, your characters can and will most of the time develop some sort of side effect from the horrors witnessed throughout combat. Too many times have I witnessed my healer become paranoid and refuse to act all together, and whenever a stressful event happens, ANYTHING at all stress related, all your other companions will get more stress aswell, quickly developing into a failscade, and many times these happen outside of your control. At 200 stress your character has a heartattack and immediately hits 0 HP. This also stresses out the party. I have on multiple occasions seen one character hit 200, heartattack, stressing out everyone else into a heartattack, while all four where under some sort of bleed or poison and watched 4 party members die in one go. RNG rules this game and will create nightmarish situations for you to witness. The ability for your team to failscade due to bad RNG is all too present, Heals are underwhelming and in no way will keep up with the ludicrous damage monsters put out. Debuffs and buffs dont last long enough, turn order is badly calculated and gives the ""House"" the advantage, stuns are lackluster and have diminishing returns (which is good) but because of turn order shenanigans, cannot be counted on or managed in any way. Due to these gameplay issues, creating any significant interesting team builds or strategies is highly impossible as nothing can be predicted and even the best team can have a bad day. The most prevalent build is a high spike damage team that is boring to play and takes advantage of the highwayman point blank shot ability. Characters also need to constantly undergo ""psych"" treatment to be viable in the next mission which constantly means benching and using a different team. Once a character hits lvl 3 Resolve he cannot ever go back to doing apprentice level missions (Resolve 0-2) which means you can't grind an A-team and go back to do bosses you left so you could grind, you HAVE to fight a boss at the approriate lvl. Character can also level at different speeds, meaning one member of your A-team might have to be benched while others catch up. God forbid one of them dies and you have to level them again...Ugh what else? I'm already getting tired of writing this review. Characters have flaws too, those suck and can make a good character turn into a bad one pretty quick, those also need to be managed and purged constantly.Eating in this game is a terrible mechanic that makes no sense, I've had a completely full character die from hunger. Overall, fun, crisp, and beautiful game, but an extreme grind fest with no real reward for your work and only a headache when RNG gives you bad luck and wipes your party, there will be a lot of setbacks, be prepared for them.P.S. Boss fights where designed by a demon from hell itself as they subject you to sadistic forms of actual torture both in real life and in game. Also I broke two mice and a keyboard while playing.			"

Early Access Review
								If I had given a review after one hour I would have given this a thumb's up.  There are things about this game I really like and I hope this review will help the developers add some things (this is still in early release) to really make this game special.  I'll list various pros and cons.Positive - Combat positioning: Your characters and the enemy characters stand in a line (1-4).  Certain skills can only be used from certain positions and skills can only target certain enemy positions.  Some skills attempt to move an enemy to a new position.  This adds a nice strategic element to traditional turn-based RPG combat.Positive - Overall Graphics: Generally rather nice.  Game has a good feel to it graphically.Negative - Hero Uniqueness:  You basically recruit random heroes of a certain class.  These heroes stay with you until they die (very possible) or you dismiss them (can be a good idea at times).  These heroes start with a random assortment of skills and gain random quirks (both positive and negative) that separate them from other heroes of the same class.  The problem is several-fold: (1) Heroes don't have random base stats (e.g., strength) that allows separation; (2) All heroes of the same class can learn the same skills if you spend gold to upgrade them, leading heroes to be less unique; (3) Quirks don't do a great job of separation.  Sometimes a quirk is so bad you won't want to use the hero until its removed but other than that the most important thing is class composition on a dungeon run.Negative - Equipment:  The equipment system is about as rudimentary as you can get.  You don't find weapons and armor but improve it through town upgrades (requiring relics) and then spending gold.  All equipment for a certain class is the exact same, the only difference is the upgrade level (upgrading adds no random stats).  The only room for variation in equipment is two trinket slots.  While you find trinkets in dungeons and there appear to be a good number of them, the problem is that trinkets always have one positive effect and one negative effect.  While the positive effect tends to outweigh the negative effect, often I find myself not using trinkets because I don't want the negative effect.  Trinkets essentially boil down to knowing the dungeons and choosing a trinket whose positive effect will be valuable against those monsters and whose negative effect won't matter much.			"

Early Access Review
								The game was enjoyable at first. Mostly because of unlockables and trying new abilities and character types. Once the initial discoveries have been made only a semi-insane completionist like myself would consider continuing to play. The battles are not really anything special or different from an old super nintendo turn based jrpg and the quests your characters go on don't actually vary much.I got to the point where I had four level 5 characters and took them on a veteran mission (level 6 is the max, veteran level missions are the hardest). I took a few risks because my armor and weapons weren't at max level. It was tough but no one was dying. Then I faced a fat ectoplasm with 70 health and 2 of the smaller ones. I killed the big one. A smaller one spawned another big one with 70 more health. I killed that one. More small ectoplasms were spawned since I couldn't one hit them or stun them. I also couldn't run away from the battle. After killing 3 fat ectoplasms and about 7 small ones my characters were given death blows and all died by about round 20. I suppose I should have known better and played it safe by taking other characters on another 3 - 6 quests to get the money and artifacts to max out my armor, levels, and skills.It may seem like I am giving the game a negative review out of frustration, I had done well up to that point, but losing my highest level characters and having no money left made me realize that a game that will set you back 4 - 6 hours while asking you to continue the same repetitive tasks over and over just to level is just poorly designed. Unfortunately I compulsively play games and want to see them through even if they aren't offering anything new. I thank the game for breaking its hold on me but would not recommend playing it for more than 5 - 10 hours. Why do so many games nowadays want you to keep playing them long after they have stopped being enjoyable? Is it a requirement that every game have 30 – 60 hours of playtime to create the illusion that you’re getting your money’s worth?Think of a game where you have like 12 different pokemon. At first it's interesting to test them out and get new abilities and make them stronger. Now imagine you have to level all those pokemon to progress as well as level a few duplicates since survival without a healer is unlikely. Now imagine some of those pokemon just die and you have to start leveling them from level 0 again. Aside from level 0 to 1, it takes 2 - 4 quests to gain a level. If repeating 50 - 80 mostly monotonous quests for 16 - 20 pokemon (since some will die) to complete this game sound like fun to you, then I highly recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								My review after playing 6 hours:One of the best things about it is the setting. I really love how dark and hopeless the game feels, the available classes, skills and status effects. I also like the way you need to manage your team with 2 different health bars (hp and stress), taking care of resource management (torch, food and gold) and a big amount of status effects in battles.However, there are some issues with the current build, most notably the amount of grind required. Since you can't keep using the same heroes over and over (firstly because you need to let them rest to recover stress, and secondly because you can outlevel the content and not be able to use them anymore!), you need to train other squards, which takes a huge amount of time. If a hero dies, you also lose it forever, meaning a bunch of hours training him were tossed out of the window.I feel like a few of these mechanincs were created to make you care more about your characters and decisions, but they accomplish the opposite of what was intended. After the first time your character dies and you recruit a substitute you treat them as disposable thrash. You know that if the worst happens and a character dies you only need a few more hours playing to replace him, so he isn't ""unique"" in a true sense. There's also some squad compositions which are clearly supperior to others, so after you find one that work, you are likely to just repeat it over and over again, because you can't really afford to make a mistake with a ""bad"" squad (since a failure may means several hours os setback).Instead of the current system, I would prefer if I could have manual saves and make character death truly permanent, meaning there's only one character of each class, and if he dies you will never find the same class again. This would enable me to:1) Experiment with different team compositions, because I could load an earlier save if I screw up with a bad team2) Truly care about my character's death, and give me the choice to either keep playing without that character or lose a few hours and load an earlier save3) It would make me create other squad compositions, since I won't be able to use the same classes againI would also like if dungeons were to scale accordingly with party level, because it makes no sense that in a world of terror and disease an experienced team would refuse to do easy content for some quick cash. I also think upgrades costs too much and need to be reduced to avoid endless grinding.			"

Early Access Review
								An extremely challenging and extremely addictive dungeon crawler.  Gambling on that next step in a dungeon can either leave you exhilarated with your success or crying as you leave empty handed with 4 dead adventurers that you spent hours leveling.  That risk verse reward is what makes games like these great.  The moments where you finish a dungeon by the slightest of margins against what seemed like impossible odds are some of the best in gaming and this game has plenty of them.			"

												Tl;drPros+ Devestatingly good narration+ The best atmosphere I've seen+ Excellent soundtrack and sound design+ Dripping with Lovecraft, if that's your bag+ All characters have personalities and individual quirks+ Lots of different strategies to play through with each class+ The game isn't broken. You are broken.+ THESE FIENDS CAN BE DRIVEN BACK, THEY CAN BE BEATENCons- This game will make you either angry or upset, guaranteed- There is an element of luck that can ruin everything, but that isn't a downside for me- All characters look identical to everyone in their class, even if they do have individual personalities- This game can make you feel fatigued if you're used to faster games.- I COULD NOT BEAR THIS BURDEN""We are not the flame, we are but moths.""This game is not about winning, it is about surviving. Darkest Dungeons is about preparing for everything, being the very best and brightest, or getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed in. Even if you think you can keep it together, your party members are living breathing people with hopes and dreams. Can you really push them into a dungeon and force them to fight horrifying, cyclopean eldritch horrors for days on end?Yeah, yeah you can do that. But will they let you? Not a chance in a frozen hell.This is the only game that made me feel true and utter despair. Not defeat or regret. Despair. The feeling that all hope is lost and that there is nothing more that can be done except watch everything you've worked for disintergrate before you.Is the game fun? Extremely, but only if are willing to rise above instant gratifcation and push for the long victory. If you die in this place, where light is foreign, your bones will never be found.			"

												This game sprang forth from He Who Shall Not Be Named. A quick venture to the weald, a delve into the ruins, should only take moments. Instead one stares into the infinite blackness of one's own soul, driven to quest ever onward. We know our toil is senseless, but onward we push. Psyche cracking, personality crumbling, will the disolution of the ego offer any respite? No! The digital King in Yellow, its obscene depths are terrifying yet strangely inviting.			"

												This is still a work in progress while I slowly cover topics as I come by. If you need anything make a post on the forums and I'll probably be there.The upperpart of my review is of the game below that I will address the points of some of the negative reviews.Darkest Dungeon is fairly straightforward, multiple heroes with varying skills and abilities that you send off to a dark lovecraftian dungeon to fend off creatures battling to keep your health, hunger and sanity in check. In a sense it plays a little like an old Final Fantasy game, but without any pheonix downs and every monster matters.There are four seperate dungeons (and then the end game dungeon) that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and thus who you send into each area is often unique. As you select your four heroes you need to make some tough decisions. Will you send the Plague doctor? The only hero to boast both a double stun and double poison skill. The Bounty Hunter who can uppercut your enemies into different ranks? Or a mighty Man at Arms who can guard another while boosting his own defense and then next round can activate a counter attack! Rather than just a simple ""Me am warrior me am stronk!"" teams who can work together and take out the nasty healers and stress dealers, who hide in the back rank, fast and first will leave the dungeon sane while the slow teams with very little reach into the back rows will teem with madness and disease.Darkest Dungeon features a fairly linear weapon and armor system (coupled with some reasonable D&D type factors in how speed and other mechanics work) but offers a unique trinket system that can spice up combat. A disease and quirk system, diseases are obviously bad while quirks come in good and bad qualities.The final piece is the stress system, while dungeoneering your Heroes will gain stress through various means, will they crack under pressure? Or will they stand steady as a beacon of hope?In its entirety the game offers a well known system but adds several unique mechanics to really make it stand out.I would highly recommend anyone interested in this game but still unsure to watch some playthroughs on youtube.Also, check out some of the reviews with large comment chains and you'll see downvoters calling upvoters ""shills"". They're absolutely paranoid that people can like this game. It's pretty funny.For a while I thought this game was too hard, that I was doing everything right and that RNG was screwing me over.Then I got gud and realized that I had everything wrong. It is tough and RNG will kick you while you're down but many of these downvotes are blatant lies and I would like to address them here.""You lose 10-20 hours per character that dies"" I have lost about 4 max rank characters, and a few rank 3-4 ones aswell, at time of posting this I have 88 hours gameplay. My roster is almost full of max rank characters and I beat the game. The roster has 28 slots (+12 due to end game reasons), by his/her maths I'd need about 400-800 hours to do that.""I was 1-hit by a non crit"" utter lies. Maybe, just maybe, they had a plague doctor in the front row with double -HP trinkets... but why have some one who is essentially protected by a tissue and as weak as a kitten in that situation and then act like it's not your fault when a GIANT hits you?Many, many of the complaints are ""I don't have a good team set up and I can't hit some one at the back!"" Well that's probably their fault for bringing three units who can only hit the front two ranks and a healer.Several complaints are that the characters aren't equally powered and some outshine others, but I 100% believe the characters are extremely well balaned - it's all about using the characters correctly. For example the Plague Doctor isn't supposed to deal damage like a crusader/leper or heal HP like a Vestal, but a support class that can stun and poison (even two people at once) and stop heavy bleed/poison damage. Many - if not most - the complaints come from an update that causes stops enemies at the back from instantly moving forward when you kill a front unit. So rather than an open varied team they get upset their insanely powerful double leper set up (that guy 100% strongest solo character) can't just one hit everything.I have felt their pain but I can gaurantee that many of the complaints are biased and just frustrated that they couldn't get it right - even the forums get ""I attacked Wilbur and my characters said 'No don't do that you're upsetting the big one' and then the big one got angry WTF RNG I AM LEET PRO"" (youtube darkest dungeons wilbur fails).I am not saying that their reviews are without merit, but the devolopers have made leaps and bounds to meet in the middle.Now you can hire higher leveled heroes, bonus XP under certain conditions and some units bring resources for dungeons and even a new class that adds some risk V reward.And if all else fails, ask for help on the forums. I sure have, the people there are (mostly) friendly and are willing to help.I have yet to find a bug or skill working improperly.If you find flaw within my review (and my review of negative reviews) please feel free to criticize or offer advice.

Early Access Review
								DD is a strategic turn-based dungeon crawler, with a very unique art work and mechanics.The narration is really good and gameplay is filled with gore, gotic and intense atmosphere.It has some rogue-like elements , permadeath and all decision taken produces great effect, so you have to think wisely every step, every character selection and move you're going to take next.Several classes/characters to choose from, each with personality. They will ""come alive"" as your journey unfolds. For the good and for the bad.You've acess to a creepy town where u can heal wounds, lower stress , evolve, recruit and reagroup for the next battle. Game can be very dramatic, you will feel attached to your characters, and they will die. And you will rage.I have to mention though, at the end of 5h, that i dont feel the character stats helpful or useful, for now.. Yet, if you really want to experience something different and refreshing, grab this title. The rest.. you'll get to know. Eventually.Although being in early acess, it puts to shame plenty of AAA titles out there.  Dungeon Crawling has never been so fun.			"

												Being overconfident is totally cool, and not at all a bad idea. What are the chances of something bad happening...Well this game punishes you hard for being to greedy.If there is one flaw the game becomes quite grind heavy after a while...I feel this is a legit complaint.The actual combat system is pretty damn good though same goes for the stress/mental aspect.Art and soundeffects (especially the narrator) are top notch.The game is not as difficult as some people make it seem to be though.A lot of it comes down to knowing the classes and the dungeons+ having the right compositon.On top of that there is no real way to lose the game ...even if you lose everything there will be always fresh adventurers ready to die for you.This review is a mess ...the game is pretty good though.Consider watching someone play it and decide for yourself (usually the best thing to do)			"

												I own this game since early access, and I have seen it progress through several stages of EA-development, all of which I am rather fond of. I figured I might as well write a review, because why not..? Core concept	Your task is to take control of a group of 4 heroes, which you assemble on your own, and lead them through different, randomly generated dungeons, with different inhabitants, and objects to interact with. A lot of loot awaits, both powerful and valuable. While doing your dungeon-crawling, you will not only have to defeat enemies in turn-based-combat to keep your merrymen alive, you will also need to keep them from getting stressed out. Health and sanity are both valuable resources, which you will need to handle with care.Before moving out you can buy provisions, food, medical herbs, holy water, shovels, you name it. Said provisions allow you to use certain interactive objects more safely and/or effectively.Upon completing a dungeon, your heroes will be given XP, which leads to level-ups sooner or later. Higher level heroes can use higher tier armour and weaponry, as well as improve their skills.To provide the best possible care for your crews, you will need to upgrade your very own, small village, to unlock more efficient methods of curing mental deseases, quirks, or sicknesses, like the black plague, for example. Training and gearing up also takes place in town, in corresponding buildings. Difficulty	Well, this has been discussed a lot, and everybody has a different point of view on that subject. My point of view is, that this game is neither too difficult at all, nor does it contain ""false difficulty"" (I always have to laugh when someone uses that term. A game is either difficult or it is not, and how difficulty is ""created"" is purely a choice of design).What makes this game challenging is that, no matter what you do, everything is based on odds, or RNG as some might say. One does not simply hit/stun/crit all the time. Your job as a player is to identify threats, and prioritize targets according to the current state of your party at any given point in time, as well as playing the odds in your favour as much as you possibly can. That being said, even if you are doing everything ""right"", your mileage may vary, such is the way of things. If the thought of that happening throws you off, this is the wrong game for you. Should you enjoy having success, eventhough your heroes lives are constantly at risk, stop reading my wall of text, pick up the game, and dive right in. Heroic diversity	You have an abundance of hero classes to choose from when you want to assemble a party. Tanks, healers, dmg-dealers, debuffers, stunners, etc allow you to be creative with your lineups. All your heroes start out with at least 4 combat skills, and some camping skills for longer endeavours, but they can learn, and master seven different skills during their careers. You will, however, always have to choose 4 skills for combat, all of which define the role your hero plays in conjunction with other party members. Furthermore certain skills are only useable from a certain position.There is a lot of creative leeway here, and experimenting with different lineups is highly recommended and encouraged by the diversity of encounters in the different dungeons. Combat	The actual combat plays the most significant role as far as gameplay goes. Each area has a different roster of enemies which you may or may not encounter. Some enemy lineups are rather straightforward: A couple melee brawlers with ranged support, for example. Other lineups, on first glance, are a bit more subtle as to what what manner of threat they pose, but be warned: Some enemies are pretty much designed to ""attack"" your heroes mental stability, trying to drive them insane. Furthermore there are lineups which are based on certain combinations of the monsters' individual abilities. Your job is to dismantle them all. Did I mention bosses already? No? Well, this game has bosses too, so be sure to think fast on your feet, when you encounter them for the first time.Not only is the composition of your party a relevant factor, also the order in which you assemble them plays a huge role. The same logic is applied to your enemies as well. If you manage to shuffle enemy groups, you can capitalize on that by taking out high-dmg monsters with lower health quickly, for example, your enemies might attempt the same however. Atmosphere	Art-style sure is a matter of personal preference, be it visual, or audio. I believe it is safe to say that the overall style of this game is very appealing, because visuals and audio go hand in hand, add a really good narrator to the mix, and you're in for quite an immersive experience.

Early Access Review
								Reading most reviews here, the difficulty of the game seems to be the major hinderance to most players. It is true that characters (even your godly characters) are pretty much expandable, and accidents (mostly unfortunate ones) that kill them are really frustrating and sometimes unforseen (thus unfair). Yet, with the wisdom of our great humanity, the guides about this game are very abundant online right now. I would seriouly recommand any players who dare to venture into the darkest dungeon do read about those works of other players' pain and lessons. They would make you evade a lot of traps (due to designs, I feel like some features of the game are simply DESIGNED to be that horrible to go through).However, this is still a quite difficult and intricate games that require very meticulous planning and exceuting at every step. One misstep, especially at high levels, can mean the demise of your ""powerful"" characters. The designers want this game to be dark, gloomy, and excrucitaing, and they succeed greatly, Mistakes are not tolerated, and odds are hardly in your favor. Do I recommend this game then? It is really not the question, I would still ""recommend"" simply because It is a greatly designed game that deserves some respect and applause. However, please think twice before deciding to launch your adventure into the darkest dungeon, it is not a game for lesiure fun. If you want to trully enjoy the experience the game offers, you need to treat this game seriously and with respect. Doing so, you will certainly be rewarded by this masterfully crafted work of art.

												様々なステータス・スキルを持ったキャラクターの中から4人を選び、ダンジョンに潜るローグライク。ヘルス以外に正気度の概念があり、ダンジョンクリア後のインターバルで治療する必要性があるため、いつも同じパターンで攻略する、ということができない調整になっている。そのため、限られたリソースの中で効果的な組み合わせを模索する楽しさがある。大事に育てたキャラクターも自分の判断ミスですぐに死んだり発狂して使い物にならなくなるし、ダンジョン攻略はたびたび失敗し、ストレスの治療費すらままならなくなる。ゲーム途中のセーブ・リセットはできず、常にオートセーブで選択の一つ一つに重みがある。かなりオススメです。			"

												Darkest Dungeon has become the unfortunate example of ""The game that the devs messed up"". Not everyone obviously agrees with that statement, but the almost infamous interactions between Developer RedHook and the most hardcore parts of their community have put the game in a rather unhealthy state.So what is Darkest Dungeon? It's a Cthulhu-inspired turn-based roguelike-like in which the player controls a party of four not necessarily very brave adventurers on their journeys through the horrible parts of the family estate, which has been overrun by corruption after the players now deceased ancestor opened some door to a hellish place in his crazy search for power near the end of his life. The story is very well narrated, but paced poorly, as only boss-kills actually reward the player with new lore-bits, and those boss-encounters are not only rare, but repetetive, as each areas 3 bosses are literally the same with various stat-upgrades.Graphically, this game is absolutely amazing. The artstyle, the very distinct single-frame-animations really make the turnbased and thus not exactly hectic combat feels heavy, impacts and crits sound and ""feel"" devastating. And a large variety of classes with customizable skills, as well as a vast variety of quirks (both positive and negative) that they acquire until their semi-inevitable permadeath is highly entertaining. It's one of those games that writes its miniature stories through its heroes and gameplay.Unfortunately, that's where the glaring balancing problems come in. Your party members need respite, otherwise the stress they accumulate in combat will make them freak out and lead to them doing stupid things, before they instantly die of a heart attack once their stress meter fills a second time. This change alone has been highly controversial and makes the game VERY difficult to complete unless you had a highly leveled bunch of characters before the patch in question was implemented. If a character is struck by lethal force in normal combat, they will teeter on ""Death's Door"" and can be healed, or even withstand some more blows with lucky dicerolls, or die immediatly. This creates tense but also VERY luck-heavy scenarios, especially if your characters are suffering from damage over time effects like poison or bleeding. It can be quite literally impossible to save someone who suffers an unlucky crit and then gets to take your first go while bleeding.To prevent this, the pretty much only available tactic to the player is to constantly recruit new sets of heroes, to burn them on a run that basically no supplies are bought for, and to then discard them and recruit the next bunch (for free) while investing the gained gold into the actual ""main"" team they're trying to progress with. This kind of grinding can be incredibly tedious.Put on top of that the fact that some ridicolous rare enemies which are by far mightier than bosses might just randomly walk into you on any mission and you have a recipe for disaster, as your entire savefile (namely your main team) might be screwed at any moment if you simply roll a 1-5% chance badly. Sure, it's not really possible to permanently lose, but having to start 40+ grinding runs all over again to flesh out a new alpha team is more annoying than entertaining.Overall, If you want a REALLY hardcore roguelite dungeon crawling experience, this could be your game. But do yourself a favor and turn off the added changes in the options menu. And while you're doing it, be happy the devs even added an option to turn them off, something the most hardcore fans of the game declared to be heresy, even blasphemy. Trust someone who enjoyed the game a lot in its launch state, you neither want Heart Attacks, nor Corpses blocking you from attacking in combat, nor permanent debuffs for fighters you rescued off deaths door if you have any intentions of finishing this game in under 500 hours of mostly grinding on throwaway freshmeat parties. At that point you might as well be using a trainer or cheat engine to generate gold instead of banging fresh recruits into pointless runs repeatedly.The problems simply outweight the enormous potential and atmossphere that the game did a great job delivering at the start. If there's anything to be taken from this game as a long term example, it's not to listen too much to a small group of your audience unless they're forking over hundreds of dollars into your budget, and to get an awesome narrator into every indie game ever. He's truely great, even after all the changes.			"

												Doesn't matter how good your party is.Doesn't matter what abilities they have or what level they are.Doesn't matter how many resources you brought.Doesn't matter how much time and gold you've invested.Doesn't matter who you have in your party.They will all die. Painfully. You'll lose everything… and yet you can't help but love it.Welcome to Darkest Dungeon, a brutal and unforgiving turn-based Lovecraftian dungeon-crawler from the team at Red Hook. The rogue-like design makes for near infinite replay value. But your biggest enemy here, however, is RNG and, similar to the XCOM franchise, you'll watch your favourite heroes fall and suffer party wipes again and again.Having picked this up a few days after the launch of Early Access last year and knowing very little of it, the level of detail, depth and polish that the small developer team has put into this was instantly engrossing. It wouldn't be that much of a stretch to say that this is one of the most unique games to emerge in recent years, especially from Kickstarter, and DD has earned a passionate cult following to show for it, even with a modding community to boot. As one who has never really enjoyed turn-based or strategy games in general, (with exception to XCOM and some cRPGs), I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this, and still do, in fact. Must have sunk hours and hours into it within the first week; it's addictive and can't help but pull you back in for another shot at taking down that seemingly invincible boss. Darkest Dungeon is, undoubtedly, a great game, with an excellent gothic atmosphere that adds to the bleakness of your heroes' plight. The narration, especially in combat, can be repetitive at times, yet immensely satisfying when you land a game-changing critical hit as your party desperately clings to life. Classes are great and each come with unique and interesting abilities and styles, complementing the gritty and dark design nicely. The micro-management and balancing of resources also adds further to the almost survival-like aspects of general gameplay, so success depends on watching your gold deposits closely and the strength of the torch as you delve deeper still into the heart of darkness..The most fascinating addition, however, is the stress mechanic which implements psychological, (as well as physical), diseases and maladies to reflect the extremely punishing nature of the game world. These can be alleviated and cured through lore-friendly outlets in your Hamlet, (which acts as the main player hub), such as the Tavern, Abbey and Sanatorium. All these buildings and more can be upgraded, as well as your party's armour and gear in a typical RPG fashion, once again complementing the depth and just how time-consuming this can be. As you can no doubt imagine, the emphasis on such risk/reward stats in nearly all aspects of gameplay leaves you to the mercy of the random number generation (RNG) and it is this dependency on pure luck rather than skill or tactics that is the game's biggest fault.While it certainly isn't punishing to the point of being broken or unfair, how much you're willing to endure at the whim of chance is ultimately whether or not I can recommend this game to you personally. Darkest Dungeon is certainly worth a purchase at full price but is equally crippled for some by the punishing nature of the RNG mechanics. I am thus torn between both an up and down vote for a recommendation. If you've played a (traditional) cRPG before or the likes of XCOM, then you should be right at home for an immensely satisfying, albeit hard-core, experience. But for the average, ""new age"" gamer then it once again comes down to how much you're willing to risk in Darkest Dungeon to enjoy the gameplay reward. Is it worth it? You must find out for yourself. Proceed with caution; both treasure and death, friend and foe, await at every turn.			"

												Darkest Dungeon drips style but sinks into rote repetition despite all of its clever ideas. It ultimately feels like a highly polished smartphone game: all treadmill and no destination.Fundamentally, the game wants you to toy with villainy, tasking you with renovating your haunted estate on the backs of an endless supply of expendable heroes. At first glance, this works pretty well. You send a colorful cast of characters through four zones of procedurally-generated room progressions, encountering spooky doodads, slaughtering monsters, and collecting loot as you protect your heroes' bodies and minds. But after a short while, it drifts into purposelessness. Clear an expedition and you're rewarded with another one that's no different. Defeat a boss only to learn that he has a palette swap (two, actually) standing a dozen missions behind him. Level up a hero and (after jumping though entirely too many hoops) raise all of his numbers a tiny amount while leaving him functionally the same. Lose a hero and replace him with another barely different one. Even the system of perks fails to individualize units, since you'll usually end up selecting for ""better at the only thing this class does"" traits that don't exactly scream personality.The expeditions themselves fare no better. Most of your time will be spent in the innovative combat system, which restricts units' abilities and targeting capabilities by marching order. But as before, this makes a great first impression before sinking into drudgery. Heroes generally have little mobility and even less desire for it, encouraging a static formation that spams its most effective abilities. Enemy formations consist almost entirely of meaty tanks up front and stress-inducing mage types in back. It doesn't take long to realize that every fight has you stunning a few folks, killing the back, mopping up the front line, rinse and repeat. When not fighting, you have scattered opportunities to set camp for the night and recuperate or to investigate madness-inducing curios littering the estate, but as with everything else the volume of ideas fails to hide the lack of depth. When each decrepit hall looks and demands the same approach as the last, the tension gives way to tedium.It bears repeating Darkest Dungeon presents a wealth of excellent ideas worth exploring. It's just a pity that it didn't bother to.			"

												This is one of those love it or hate it games.  Your characters will die, a lot.  You will grind, a lot.  Battles will turn on you without warning, a lot.  In the end - just wasn't for me.  This is a punishing game, and just when you think you're getting the hang of it, you lose 4 of your most developed characters to a boss battle that turned bad in a couple turns.  It's a brutal game - if you're into that, you'll probably love it.  It just wasn't for me.If you're thinking of buying it, make sure to read a selection of the most recent reviews.  Some recent patches changed up some play mechanics and also impacted endgame economy and advancement.			"

												You guys...don't listen to all these naysayers.This is an excellent game.I will admit, the beginning of the game is probably the hardest part. Although, I say this without having actually gone to the final dungeons yet. The trick is to spend your money wisely and to try and build up your town as quickly as possible. Once you start racking up some heirlooms to spend on buildings in town and gather some extra money, you can start upgrading your characters regularly. I would highly recommend upgrading the stagecoach first so that you can recruit more characters more often. After that, I focused on the guild and the blacksmith discounts heavily. Once those are upgraded to a higher level, you can beef up your characters without spending very much money at all!It seems like a lot of people aren’t approaching this game from a tactical standpoint which is entirely necessary in order to be successful. I would say in the last 20 Dungeons that I've attempted, I didn't have any characters come close to going over their stress limit. There are plenty of characters that heal stress in the middle of the dungeon and that's key. The Jester has become one of my favorite characters simply because he can heal stress. This also means you should be targeting the most dangerous enemies at the beginning of the battle, which tend to be those who inflict a lot of stress damage. When you're coming out of dungeons without having to send your characters to heal their stress you can save a ton of money. If you want to make this game more enjoyable, then look up a guide of what curios require which items based on location. You can save yourself a hell of a lot of headaches by doing this.People are right. This game does take a lot of grinding. But there's something satisfying about being able to absolutely ruin enemies that were previously ruining you. PROS:+ The story is fun. The monologues have great voice acting and add to the atmosphere. I find myself quoting them whenever I play the game.+ It’s challenging. I get tired of people giving games a bad review because it's hard (Dark Souls etc.). Is this game unfair at times? Absolutely. But never so much that it made me want to stop playing.+ There are lots of characters with lots of abilities. You will quickly learn which trinkets work best with which character and which characters form the best group for that particular area.+ There is very little more satisfying than a critical hit in this game. ASTONISHING!+ I would consider this game casual. I play it while I'm watching sports or movies all the time. It doesn't take all of your attention all the time. You can take breaks during the action.+ The artwork is absolutely beautiful for those who enjoy comic book art.CONS:+ Can come off a little bit repetitive at times because of the grinding. If you're grinding intelligently then you can rack up a lot of money fairly quickly.+ Without a guide on inspecting curios, you're going to have a hell of a time. They can inflict a lot of stress or negative attributes to your character. Sometimes it's just better to leave them alone.+ The boss fights can seem overwhelming at times, but if you really think, you can find a good strategy. One thing to remember about this game is that getting to zero HP does not kill you. In fact hovering just above zero HP is sometimes all you can do with certain bosses and that's OK. I think some of us are trained to panic when our characters get close to zero HP, but that's not a huge issue in this game.If you're not sure about this game, then wait for a discount. But don't let all these people tell you it's a broken game just because it's hard. Be ready to play for many hours, but don't get the discouraged. Find good tactics and put them to use. You got this.			"

												Thought I'd make a quick edit to the review now that the game has come out of Early Access.Darkest Dungeon lets you assemble a roster of dungeon adventurers and send them into dungeons in order to defeat pestilent creatures that have plagued the land in order to fully restore a hamlet back to its former glory. The game is not so much a pure dungeon crawler, but more of a dungeon crawl management simulator (for lack of a better word). You do not only navigate the heroes through a dungeon. You also take full responsibility for their wellbeing. As heroes go through dungeons, they accumulate stress and could even get diseases, and you have to make sure you bring them back to top shape in between your dungeon runs. You do not just control a single party of heroes. You have to rotate several different heroes around and pick the ones most suitable for the job at hand.There are 4 areas where you can take your expedition: Ruins, Warrens, Weald, and Cove, and each one has its own dangers and challenges, what means that you need to prepare your team accordingly. The dungeons also come in different lengths (Short, Medium, and Long) and of different difficulty (Apprentice, Veteran, and Champion). As of the final release, the final dungeon has been added too (have not yet had the bravery to try it out).The combat is really fun and in my opinion has a lot of tactical depth to it. It's not just a simple turn-based battle system, but each position within your party setup is important. Some hero classes prefer frontal positions in the squad (like the melee tanks), others prefer to hang back (like healers or ranged attackers).The game has been balanced around loads during Early Access, and though some aspects of it might feel unfair still, overall the gameplay feels pretty solid and requires a lot of strategising and adjusting to the situation when bad things start to happen. The game can be pretty punishing towards those who do not take caution. And even if you do everything right, things can still go wrong at times, and part of the gameplay is also having to deal with that. The game encourages tip-top preparation and contingency planning. That means that the game is easily not for everyone, but those who do enjoy that sort of thing will be up for a real treat.Art, music, and voice acting are also superb. Easily a cherry on an already delicious cake.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and doesn't mind it when a game occasionally throws them some curve balls. I can't remember the last time a game has kept me interested for 70 hours and counting.			"

												[ EDIT ]  As you can see below, I recommended this game prior to reaching the level 5 dungeons. After equipping my characters to maximum efforts, the nightmare of what many have described this game as 'unbalanced' has finally rung true, sadly. All time and effort battling with my characters, the last of hard earned gold purchasing much needed upgrades to venture the 5th level dungeons.. All.. for.. null. I have changed my tune and am no longer recommending Darkest Dungeon. I will put DD away until I find there is a much needed update to balance the 5th and 6th level dungeons. I can't imagine why anyone would continue playing this game. What's most upsetting is that I truly wanted to believe the negative reviews wrong..sigh-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What feels to be a dark side-scrolling dungeon crawler - bringing to mind games of past that I enjoyed, gathering them into one tough ultra strategic D&D RPG of sorts. I've found Darkest Dungeon (through trial and error) to be very tough on the unprepared. The game is brutal to both seasoned and unseasoned player who dive in with set goal in mind to conquer with a 'record time' mindset. If you do find yourself wanting to give this game a go, then you must know that your characters will die, every time, as long as they aren't developed enough through the lower stages while finding and equipping proper trinkets, leveling, and simply understanding correct placement in the line. Placement in the line is probably the most important factor to survive and thrive in Darkest Dungeon, as there are 4 spots front to back where you will place your characters, each placement tailored specifically for different characters to maximize their individual strengths. Patience is needed to enjoy this title. If you don't have patience I suggest not purchasing this game as you will have a very difficult and stressful experience. You must study the characters and discover each of their strengths over time, while simultaneously learning by trial and error - dying, and starting over again - until you understand each characters abilities, placements and weaknesses. The game is fun, I'm sincerely having a blast, and knowing there is permadeath keeps the intensity very high.   I cannot stress enough that Patience, once again, is key to enjoying this game. You cannot rush a game of chess, in Darkest Dungeon you must understand your pieces and respect the unspoken rules of the game first before gaining any glimpse of an advantage. Take it slow and enjoy the game.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like rogue-like/management games with a quickly drawn dark fantasy settings that offer some depth and replayability, i guess it's an interesting game to look at but for me it was quite a disapointment.I mean, the only reason you'd want to buy this game is if you like atrocious RNG, push-your-luck mecanic and horrible dice rolls. In my opinion, the graphics tries way too hard to make itself feel dynamic and ""dark"" (because it's dark fantasy, you see) with an overload of camera zoom, layers of shaders and blurry, shaky effect everywhere that can become infuriating after more than ten hours in. It's sad because the hand drawn inked aesthetic was charming at first glance and could have been a great touch if the animation wasn't that cheaply done.The background starts off as a good idea but is ultimatly used as an excuse to put you in a dungeon and do stuff without really getting into too much details, making the whole game not subtle at all if not forgettable.The UI is sometimes messy and the tutorial just give you basic knowledge about generic stuff without getting into more details than just ""click here to open the tab or here to move to another room"", when it should be explaining you a few stuff about what's going on with every heroes you can recruit, what the hell is all these numbers and why every single usefull skill a caracter have that could help you out of combat has to proc randomly if you want to progress without pain in the dungeons. In fact, the game is all about numbers, making it more a management game with a dungeon theme rather than an actual rogue-like or dungeon crawler. And this is mainly because most of the push-your-luck and progression in the game will resolve around how balanced and prepared your party will be, how well you manage your gold in upgrades and when you'll decide to go back to town before it's too late while exploring or questing, but even that will usually get reduced to simple dice rolls and bad lucks when the game decides it's okay to whipe 15hours of grinding (and the game is all about grinding) in just 1 encounter.It's not about how well you'll do in the actual dungeon when facing dangerous enemy and defeating them thanks for a good strategy or reflexes, for there's too little skills for each character (being a turn based game) and nothing like well-timed attacks or stuff that will requires you, the player, to interract with the game to get the best out of every fight. It's all about gambling, and hope for the best.And that's pretty much where the game fail to be interesting, for me at least. Everything looks like a mobile game, from the way it presents missions with quest jauge that fills every 'run' you take and rewards when clicking things to the way it tackles the caracter and hub progression. I'm actually quite surprised there's no cash shop or, you know, a set limit of tasks to perform before being able to keep playing the next day.But it boast and advertise itself about how hard and challenging it is when it's just all extremly unfair RNG and bad difficulty.It's not about being casual or blaming tje die and retry mecanic, for i do beleive some games like that are actually really enjoyable (ie meatboy), but more about what purpose the difficulty serve to your game. For there's different kind of diffilcuty and so no, ""Hard"" doesn't necessarily mean ""Good"".You see, Games like volgarr the viking, crypt of the necrodancer, the binding of isaac or even dark souls are really hard games too but they're fair, because they use difficulty as a challenge you have to overcome instead of making it completly arbitrary and unforgiving. They don't throw you backward in your progression and tell you ""it's because it's hard, it's fun !"". There's a feeling of accomplishement or pride once you've overcome an obstacle that you couldn't handle by making you learn and that's what makes them good games.In DD, the difficulty is just something that randomly happens, sometimes, and you can't do things about it, making it pointless to some degree : when you finish a quest or manage to survive, you don't feel like you deserve it, in fact it just feel like that you either got lucky or that it's just the regular way the game is supposed to happens. And then you encounter a fight when suddenly everything miss and you have to wait about 20 minute for every small text bubble and zoom effect and shaking camera and death blow or alteration announcing without being able to touch or speed anything when you party just decide to kill itself, and you can't change a thing about it.It's sad because it's quite a pretty well executed indy game besides that, considering all the trash that pass through the greenlight system.Such a waste of potential.

												The art style is beautiful and the ambience and general aesthetic is strong and compelling. It has a great, quirky, Vincent Price feel that I found endearing.There's some progression in the form of skills and gear, that presumably characters can live long enough to actually use.But the RNG makes this more frustrating than rewarding for me. I get that the entire core of the game is based on this. I get it. When your character dies, if you tend to think: ""awesome, this is really fun, I hope I can spend even more time and money on the next character before they get RNG'd to death!"", then you'll love this game. If you don't tend to think that way, you'll probably hate it.			"

												The game is actually very nice. But there are several reasons why I chose not to recommend it:- the gameplay is very repetitive, there are new monsters after a time but no new challenges. Although it is fun to play, after like 12 hours it starts to feel like grinding, which is something some of us old folks just do not have the time anymore- getting into the higher levels, you depend too much on chance. Consequtive crits can and will end things no matter how well prepared you are. And therein lies the problem: skill is only relevant in the beginning of the game (maybe also in the end, I will never know). Until then you have seen most of the mechanics and somehow understood the stat system. But that will not help you anymore because too much relies on chance.I like roguelikes and I do not mind dying when it is my fault. Some chance is also acceptable on both sides, but here 'mindless' grinding AND RNG ruin maybe not the entire gameplay but surely much of the fun for older ex-hc gamers with limited time. A pity.			"

If the developers had paced the game for 20 hours or so I would recommend it. As they tried to make a 10-20 hour game into 50+ hours I definitely think it's not worth anyone's time.			"

												Despite its pretensions, this is by-the-numbers dungeon crawling wrapped in a typical upgrades grind. In theory, I like the way stress acts as a persistent form of damage across runs, but it doesn't amount to anything. Somebody's numbers get too high, and then something bad happens, and then you pay gold to make it go away. It's just another HP bar to manage. Also in theory, the fact that it forces you to swap out party members should make things more dynamic, but it doesn't. While the classes do have different abilities, the only thing that actually matters is damage output. There's no point in buffing and defending when you can just kill things before they can hurt you. Crucially, the game doesn't get interesting when it gets hard; it just gets annoying. Non-damage-dealing abilites aren't effective enough to allow you to manage stronger opponents, so there's ultimately no real gameplay outside of the grind. Which, ironically, completely kills the horror effect, because you're never really at risk of losing anything. It's all one big grind, it'll just take more or less time to finish depending on how lucky you are. This is why grafting an upgrades system onto a roguelike fundamentally doesn't work. Meanwhile, the story is generic pop-Lovecraft (pro tip: Lovecraft sucks, get over it), and whoever wrote the narration needs to have their thesaurus privileges revoked.The graphics are good, though.

												The game is based around RNG which in my opinion is stupid. I'm either spending the gold to get rid of negitive effects or I'm spending it on trying to get rid of stress leaving me with little gold to but provisions. Oh and if you do make it through a dungeon with extra provisions to spare you get a fraction of gold back that you spent it on instead of keeping it. Having to get a new character and start back from zero after a character dies from too much stress in a dungeon is a pain, you sink time into characters having them die either quickly or slowly it's all RNG. I know the characters are meant to die but it's not fun watching something you build get destroyed by a series of randoms actions, the game is fun at first but it got old pretty quick.			"

												On Facebook, and bear with me on this, there is a game called Avengers Alliance.  It's a Marvel Comics game where you assemble a team of Marvel characters, choose a mission to send them on, then engage in turn-based combat against a series of enemies until you reach the boss.  Defeating that boss progresses you to the next missions, and gives you experience that levels up your characters.  Despite being a Facebook game, it was one of my favorite games for a long time.  I dropped some real money on that game.So what does that have to do with Darkest Dungeon?  Well, this game takes that same concept of building a party and advancing through increasingly difficult missions, and marries that to a Lovecraft theme.  As you progress through the dungeons in this game, you have the same tough decisions on how to deal with certain enemies, the benefits of various party compositions, and who you choose to level up.  With that, though, you also have the nail-biting events that can throw all your plans into disarray or lead your party to a miraculous victory.  I love it.The graphics are a comic art aesthetic, and as you might expect all of the colors are dark and suitably gothic.  The sound effects are evocative of the theme, and the music is chilling at times.  One thing stands above all else when I think of this game, though, and that's the narration by Wayne June.  This is a man who has narrated countless Lovecraft audiobooks, and there's no other word to describe his effect on the game other than perfection.  If you do not like an element of random chance, avoid this game.  If you do not appreciate the fact that you will suffer setbacks despite your best efforts, avoid this game.  If you do not enjoy gothic lovecraftian themes, avoid this game.  If you like watching the heroes that you've recruited slowly succumb to the insanity of your ancestral home, eventually meeting a grotesque end at the hands (or tentacles) of ancient horrors, then embrace the Darkest Dungeon.

												Having played this for some time now I could not recommend it in good taste. There is simply too many times where the games major mechanics are shown to be shallow and unfinished, or enemy types bland and uninteresting. The stress system seems interesting at first but quickly devolves into a second health bar that you can't reliably heal back to acceptable levels, combined with every other enemy having massive stress damage attacks makes progression painful and unrewarding.Another issue is player control. In one of Valves in game commentaries for Half-Life 2 they stated that the best thing a developer can do is to never take control away from the player, even if they aren't actually in control they should at least feel as if they have some say in what happens in a situation. Darkest Dungeon takes player control away so often that it's bordering on absurdity. Randomly given quirks randomly cause your character to make random arbitrary choices in combat and at town, making it seem like you have no say at all in what happens in your party. Even if you complete a hard dungeon with 0 stress across the board theres still a hefty chance of your characters gaining up to two character destroying traits that make them dead weight and functionally dead to you.The next issue is the diversity and balance of each of the dungeons. There's a forest, a ruin, a cove, and a city for the main dungeons. Each of these supposedly has a diverse set of enemies and challenges to face, but if you examine them closely they are nearly carbon copies of one another. The ruins has skeletons that act the same as the coves fish people, the cultists have a spellcaster that has nearly the same spells as the coves fish spellcaster, the pigs have the same support abilities as the fungal growths in the forest.The main cause of all this sameness stems from the games shallow combat system, there are only two DOT's, one stun type, forced movement attacks and then normal damage with crits. This is not a recipe for replayability at all. There are simply too few ways for the enemy to fight the player, leading to stagnation. The game tries to add another layer of complexity in its stress system, but it falls flat, with it being a near unmanagable mess of too much stress and too few ways to mitigate it within the dungeon itself. The few characters that can mend stress heal it for so little as to not be worth it, why waste turns stress healing when you could be killing the enemy to stop the stress from being placed to begin with? The stress system is also very bottom heavy, it mostly affects newer characters and seems to dissappear by level 2-3, mostly serving to kill off fresh characters by having a skeleton splash wine on them for 10 rounds.The stat system is also very oddly designed. Dodge works like in most games, by serving as a way to completely mitigate damage in echange for reliability, but most characters will not high high enough dodge stats to take advantage of it, and will instead opt in for the much more realiable and plentiful PROT stat which functions as a flat damage reduction. Most enemies also seems to have either 100% accuracy attacks, or attacks that hit so hard that even taking the chance of focusing on dodge and having it fail makes prot all the more worth while. Why even have the chance of taking a 20 damage attack on a 22 Health character when you can always reduce that 20 damage to 10 or less?Sadly Darkest Dungeon is a trainwreck of balance issues and poorly implemented game mechanics overlaid with amazing art and stellar sound and voice work. It simply isn't worth the $20 in its current state, and likely never will be.			"

								The darkest dungeon is not fun and rewarding. Visually and Aurally it's flawless. - the dark reds and blacks perfectly complementing the endlessly grim atmosphere. As someone that collects rougelikes, I can handle random turn of events and sudden death - yet in this game there is a constant elongation of that death. You are slowly losing. Slowly being eaten away like a bunch of flies digesting a almost dead warrior with no eyes on a empty battlefield. Even in dark souls, a game known for its punishment - there is some degree of immediacy. This is quite literally - torture. I admire that. I admire that some team of indie developers went out there, made a game so far departed from the norm. There is no game that quite feels like the darkest dungeon. And for that uniqueness, combined with the flawless presentation - This review is uniformly positive. However subjectively, I don't often want to actually play the damned thing. Because my time spent will involve slowly becoming as stressed as the protaganists as I am torn apart until there is nothing but an empty husk hobbling along a worn path of nothingness. While enemies point and laugh at my feeble attempts at carrying on. And in the end, that's what you do. Even if you win. You carry on. You don't come out powerful. Or even slightly enhanced. You survive another day of stress and hate. Sounds a bit too much like my life.			"

								Its a huge shame this game put's itself in the sacrificial camp of the RPG genre. It would be fantastic to be able to build a handpicked team up and train them to be ready to face the darkest dungeon. Ultimately it would seem that the game will just decide to kill one of your team and there is nothing you can do about it.  So not so much about being prepared and training as about grinding until you get lucky. Not the sort of RPG I enjoy - folk who are less attached to the people they command would certainly enjoy it more thanks to the fantastic artwork and psychology mechanics.			"

								I wrote up a big review but apparently 16000 character is more than Steam will allow. Here's a link.http://pastebin.com/WwDbZ4ACAn outtake to sum up my review:Here is what I expected when I purchased Darkest Dungeon: a modern take on roguelikes with interesting attrition-based mechanics that require clever tactics to overcome, a variety of hero classes which can be combined into parties that capitalize on different ways of playing the game, and a challenge which was meaningful and fulfilling to overcome.I did not get these things. What I got was a sub-standard dungeon crawler with masochistic tendencies and a design philosophy that discourages strategic and tactical thinking. Alongside this is a meaningless progression grind that would make any mobile tower defense game proud.It's an exercise in rolling dice that requires a large investment of time for little to no satisfaction.You will grind for hours to kit out a team to take on the end bosses but your victory rarely feels earned - careful planning and team structure will not win the day, lucky crits and blasting everything with all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you can muster will.

												I'll go ahead and put my biggest problem with this game as my review.It's the same game at max level as it is at first level. Nothing really changes, as you progress the only thing that happens is that numbers get bigger. There's no real strategy, just grind until your numbers get high enough to go to the next dungeon.It's dissappointing, because the setup and art direction are excellent. But there's more depth in free facebook games than there is here. There's not even much of a story to make up for how shallow the gameplay is. Might be worth it to grab on sale for a couple hours of time wasting, but definitely not full price.			"

Early Access Review
								Alright, the fights are in theory kind of fun. But there is so much in this game that makes no sense and annoys the heck out of me:1. To much luck, to much randomness:You have no indicator at all what will await you in a dungeon and what items you might need. No idea at all if the box you look into will be good or bad. The quirks your heroes get on every corner are also something you cannot control, doesn't matter if it's a good or negative one, no idea what enemies will await you. No idea or control about who the enemy will attack in your group. Pure frustration2. Slow & Repetitive:The battles, the animations, everything is so slow. A fight could be over in 3 minutes, but thanks to the slow animations you need 15!!! Also you will want to strangle the voice who tells me the 50th time in a dungeon that my luck might be turning. Less frequent please or more tracks.3. Makes no sense:So much makes 0 sense in this game: You buy items to go into a dungeon but if you don't use them they are magically gone afterwards. And the money you paid for them with it. And because you have no idea what awaits you in a dungeon it's a pure lucky guess if you buy the right items or not. Your heroes feel more like civilians than warriors. 50% of the game consists of sending them into overpriced bars/hospitals/churches to tend to their breakdowns. And you should spend a ton of your time to look into which hero likes what best and remembering it.I'm sorry, but this game must be made by SEO, because it's formula is to frustrate and punish the player on every single corner. Not because it's hard, but because you can also let a monkey play it as there is so much luck and crap involved. Haven't played such a really really bad game in a long time. I've played it very early and did hope that after almost a year it got better, but if something it only got worse. "

												Good game, but it should have ended after 30 hours then its just boring grind and repeating same actions over and over again. High level dungeons require much more time to complete becouse enemies have higher hp, prot and dodge. Fights on lvl 0-3 or 3-4 lasts about 3 turns and when you get to high level dungeons it can be even 7 or more turns. Sometimes you start a fight and game randomly place against you 2 Pelagic Guardians and some random monsters, so you finish this two monsers and then waste time poisoning debuffing and bleeding two enemies that far too tanky. Also it's ridiculous that even huge enemies like Unclean Giant with a lot of hp or Ghoul with 40% prot got improved dodge on higher levels. Debuffing mechanics is just wrong - I'm fighting enemy with insane dodge like Shrieker or madman, who i cant even hit, so i'm casting dodge debuff on them, and they dodge it xD.Some fights are far too random. The best example is The Collector, during fight he summons healer and tank to support him. If those two decides to heal and protect him you are going to have bad time, but sometimes they just do random stuff - healer buffs dmg of tank that can't even attack and tank protects healer when Collector is about to die. This♥♥♥♥♥♥has nothing to do with difficulty.Critical hits are really powerfull, when enemy crits you he can deal even 40 dmg+stress, so basically all your character HP... so in my opinion there should be like 2%-6% chance to critical hit... but its about 20% so sometimes when your unlucky you can get 3 crits in a row and get destroyed.After all i can't truly reccomend this game, the first 30 hours was great experience, art is amazing, narrator is perfectly suited for this game, and mechanics is pretty good. But repetitive gameplay and too much of random stuff makes me bored and im struggling to finish this playthrough.			"

												Really fun at first, great atmosphere, great narrator and a fun art style.That said, the latter half of the game is awful, recycled enemies who use the exact same attacks except they have a ridiculous amount of dodge/resistances to everything so each battle is a tedious struggle while they endlessly crit your team, easily killing heroes who take forever to ♥♥♥♥ing recruit and train up (I've head eight weeks so far in my game without any lepers, arbalasts, men at arms or bounty hunters arriving in my 100% upgraded stage coach).

												The only real difference to a typical browser game is that it is single player. The game has about no content and expects you to do the same things over and over again to gain anything. The only thing it manages to do right is the atmosphere, but it vanishes too after you realise that the narrator has only about 20 lines he keeps repeating. Overall, I would recommend it if it were a smartphone game, maybe if it was a 3DS game, but for PC it offers too little.			"

												It's a nice looking game and it seems like it has some fun mechanics.  And I am really missing turn based RPGs. But after the first easy dungeon, I just was not having fun.   Bad things kept happening to my explorers in a completely random manner, and it's the randomness of it that that made it unbarable for me. It didn't just simulate the stress of being in a dungeon well, it made me feel actually stressed. It's not for me.  Obviously some people like it so it might be worth a try.  Just don't make the same mistake I did....keep an eye on your clock. "

Posted: April 22
												I had some fun playing this game. I love the narrator and the whole style, the intro video and the art style is plain awesome. The psychology aspect is very unique, and that feature is basically the only standout aspect that seperates this game from the endless quagmire of other dungeon fantasy games. Unfortunately, the psychology aspect was never anything more than a disguised handicap mechanic to bolster the AI monsters and weaken your own people. They imply that there is this dynamic psychological mechanic that affects your characters in game. It is truly just another health bar disguised as this intricate system. The only psychological effects I ever encountered with my pawns was negative impacts during combat. Basically the enemies attack you physically, or use some kind of mental technique to damage your will. So during battle certain enemies attack will only, and they will chip away at the will untill your pawns go through a mental break. As if the game isnt hard enough already. Youll be trying to survive battles health wise, and mental health wise. Basically over time as you do more and more battles, the whole gameplay system is designed to limit your ability to recover your pawns after each dungeon raid. So it will whittle you down more and more and youll be sending increasingly weak pawns into combat over and over until you eventually start to lose them all. And this all happens because the game REFUSES to let you have any kind of rest or day off. You HAVE to send in pawns to a dungeon. I thought Ha Ill just have one guy be the punching bag and send him in alone and retreat right after. But nope you HAVE to send in four pawns. It wouldnt be a big deal if they didnt tack on enormous debuffs and penalties from retreating. Also everything you do costs gold, and there are MANY things youll have to buy just to enable the possibility of clearing a dungeon. Food, torches, healing items etc. Everything is very expensive, and to make it even more difficult they decided to make it where your supplies you find after each raid, DISSAPEAR. So if you are unlucky during a run and the only treasure you get is a bunch of food, you cant save it to use it for the next raid, oh no that would be too easy. I ended a run with something like 20 food and thought oh great ill save money next time, sadly next time came and I had to buy the expensive food all over again. Same goes for all other basic resources like torches.There is very little in the way of RPG stuff. Items, upgrades, skills. Yeah they might be there but the whole system is so ridiculously simple that it barely resembles an RPG at all. Level cap is 6. Upgrading gear consists of pressing the + button and spending gold to and other rare resources to do so. Nothing changes, no visual difference or variation in weapons or armor, just the magical invisible numbers behind your pawns stats. I say magical and invisible because never does the game bother to explain any of the battle mechanics to you. In fact youll go through most of the game not understanding how most stuff works, you wont even have the slightest idea of the whys and hows of pretty much everything that goes on behind the scenes, meta game as some say. Pray to the RNG gods, because everything is random. You might not even make it out of the tutorial dungeon in the beginning, because you may get some unholy combination of crap luck and get crit hits repeatedly. Somehow thought that never seemed to work in my favor though. Very little did I ever score and lucky strings, I only ever had unlucky strings that eventually whittled away entire teams and hours of progress. That is the recurring theme with the game. It does not respect your time and it will demand hours of grinding and grinding just to stand half a chance, and even then youll get smashed and forced to start from scratch. No save system, basically permadeath, so save scumming is not possible. I love save scumming because I dont enjoy games where a simple mistake leads to hours of progress lost, or accidentally making decisions im not unhappy with and being stuck with it for remainder of the game. I like playing games the way I enjoy them most. And this is one of those games that not only demands but FORCES you to conform to their idea of how it should be played, and theres no room for compromise. ""easy"" mode is a joke and is still stupid difficult. No cheats or even mods for difficulty either so hope you enjoy soul crushingly difficult moments, prepare to replace you keyboard/mouse or other accessories within an arms reach!TLDR: All frustration aside I really did enjoy the morbid charm and art style of the game. Its simple combat system can be fun and addicting. Sadly it devolves into a convoluted resource management grind fest nightmare. The grinding wouldnt be so bad if you didnt lose your hard earned pawns so quickly and easily. In the end it does not respect your time and will eat it away and spit it out, and it is VERY infuriating and defeating to lose hours and hours of gameplay to a bad string of RNG luck. Yes thats right, prepare to bend to the will of the RNG gods as they will always remind you who is in charge. No not your strategic thinking or witty planning or fighting, but they, they alone are in charge of who wins and who loses and dies.			"

===========================Not an RPG, not a Roguelike===========================With Darkest Dungeon, during the 1st hours of play, you fight against the game, not within the game, in a degree I had never met with other games.The rules aren't well explained, are often counter-intuitive or just plain weird.For example, you can use your healing spells during the fight, but can't anymore outside of fight. Why that ? It's not a world logic, it's only a game balance logic.At 1st, you'll also need to get acquainted with DD world : you have a village with several buildings which are unlocked 1 by 1 after every quest you do. A quest is only crawling in an extremely basic dungeon with a team of 4 heroes. There's no real exploration as you only have something like 5, 10 or 15 rooms (depending of the quest length) connected by vertical or horizontal corridors on a 2D map. Once in a room, you select the next room you want to go, but it doesn't have any real consequence. You just want to select the rooms in the best order to avoid backtracking. The goal of the ""quests"" is usually to explore 90% or 100% of the rooms, or kill the Boss, or destroy a couple of altars.And for this crawling, you constantly need to light up torches, as fighting in the dark gives handicaps to your team. You'll also need a few items to maximize the looting of the different curios (eg: you need a key to open locked chest ; holy water to purify an altar, etc.), and food to eat at random intervals. At 1st, you don't know how much torches or food you'll need, and they are a bit expensive and you can't keep them from 1 quest to another. Why, oh why ? Oh, it's just to waste your money so you'll have trouble upgrading your heroes at 1st, as everything is money based.But after these few hours of adjustment, the game becomes actually quite simple. There's no gear for your heroes except 2 trinkets. There's no leveling choice either, nor anything that would look like a real RPG game. Your heroes starts at level 0 and their max level is 6. They get a random positive or negative perk at each level up. There you'll be able to upgrade their skills, weapon and armor in the Guild & Blacksmith buildings of the village. There's no choice in this. Your only choice is in a what order you'll unlock the additional upgrade level in each building. Spoiler alert : usually, you need Armor -> Skill -> Weapon.Although your heroes can permanently die, it's really easy to avoid this by playing conservatively and carefully. There are dungeons of Level 1, 3, 5 and the final one of level 6. So as long as your heroes aren't fully upgraded to Level 3 or 4 skills, armors & weapons, just stick to the Level 1 Dungeons. Simple. Also, don't go to fight the Level 1 Bosses before your heroes are entirely upgraded to Level 2 or 3. Your heroes also don't die when reaching 0 HP, they still need to be hit once more and there they still have a chance to survive. And you can run away from a fight and abandon a quest at any time.Moreover, there's no special event, no randomness that can lead to different outcome, so this game is not a Roguelike. There's nothing that looks more like your current dungeon run than the previous run and the next one.===========================Grindest Grindy Grind===========================So, it's not a Roguelike, it's not an RPG, and you keep on doing the same thing over and over again. Yup, it shouldn't have been called Darkest Dungeon but rather the Grindest Grindy Grind.Let me explain. So your heroes constantly get stressed by crawling in the dungeon and often they'll end the quest with high stress. So you have to put them to rest in the Tavern or the Church to lower their stress. Meanwhile, you are forced to send another team for the next quest.It doesn't stop there as your heroes can get very annoying negative perks that will also require 1-quest off to be removed. If unlucky, they can even get 1 negative perk from leveling and 1 from checking items in the dungeon, so you may need 2-quest off to remove both. And it doesn't stop there either because there's also diseases that you'll need 1-quest off to remove. So all in all, you need between 2 and 4 teams to roll.Another very annoying thing is that your inventory is very limited, with very small stacking ability, thus if you do a medium or long quest, you'll be constantly juggling about what to keep or not. Personally, I installed these 2 Mods that extend stacks

Marco's Inventroy Balance Mod 
A Workshop Item for Darkest Dungeon
By: Marcoevelle

			How often when going through a dungeon do you have issues with your inventory limit? For early levels the limit is fine, but it does not scale well does it if at all?		


 , but it's still very painful : you feel like you're totally wasting your time, as you can't even keep the little loot you're finding.And it takes many runs to get the necessary items to unlock the upgrades of your weapons, armors & skills and thus you're often stuck with leveled but not fully upgraded heroes. And it can get badder, as Level 5 Heroes refuse to go to Level 1 Dungeon, so if you didn't manage correctly your team roster, it can lead to additional headaches.I have been playing the game with latest Radiant mode, which halves the time needed to finish the game. I can't imagine the horrible grind & repetitive feeling it must have been to play with the normal mode. Or I can : only 1.4% of the players finished the game with it 14 months after release. On Radiant, we're at 0.6% 2 months after its release, not exactly great either.One note of the curios : to find the item to optimize their use and their result, you'll have to spend countless of time & tries to figure out everything, or you can head there : http://darkestdungeon.gamepedia.com/Curio .===========================Missing the Spot===========================So almost all the interest of the game relies on its combat system. It is in itself really not bad and quite interesting for 4 or 5 hours. But unfortunately, it's not deep nor varied enough to justify chaining the quests, as you're mostly walking straight in corridors, opening containers, and fighting, fighting & fighting.Most fights are only 2-3 rounds long, which doesn't allow any evolved tactic building, so you just repeat ad nauseam the same skills over and over again.Quickly, you'll figure out you need an healer in your team and a stress reliever ; as pointed above, you can't use these spells outside of combat, so you'll use & abuse of the stun to make the fights longer, to heal & lower the stress of your heroes ; after 4, 5 or 6 rounds your heroes will start to stress out, because the Devs limited that abuse.And unfortunately, the Boss fights don't bring much on the table. They are straightforward enough and won't require your brains : your team is ever strong enough to kill them or it's not.There are 16 classes, I tried 11 of them and didn't feel enough gameplay differences from one to another. Mastering a class requires not much more than the 2 minutes needed to read its different ability descriptions.===========================Conclusion===========================DD is a game that hides its relative simplicity by not clearly explaining its rules, and is based on way too much grinding and on its interesting but not deep enough combat system.=== Pros ===- Unique enticing visuals- Interesting combat system, although ultimately lacking of depth and surprises- Village with buildings to upgrade=== Cons ===- Way too grindy- No real challenge- After a few hours, gameplay gets ultra repetitive- No exploration- Enemy mechanisms strongly lack of variety- Bosses fight are a stats check and not tactically challenging- Most trinkets comes with strong handicaps, making them nearly useless- All the negative things in the game have actually very little influence on the gameplay ; ie: they don't lead to choices for the player- Dull quest system without accomplishment feeling			"

												This was a very promising game but the recent changes have pushed it from a challenge to a tedious grind fest. Even if you succeed in the grind, the RNG will kill you. For a game that was advertised by hyping the strategy required to beat it and the brutality that came with it, it worked in the beginning. The brutality is still there but now that skill requirement has been stripped in favor of the RNG kneecapping you at every opportunity. Can this game recover? Absolutely, if the devs take the game back to a skill focus rather than a randomization focus. For now, stay away, very far away.*edit-Well the game is here and while many things have change the RNG kneecapping is still in the mix. It is better but I still cannot reccomend this game. Maybe things will change with the continued support but it is highly doubtful.			"

								I bought this game yesterday, i think. Maybe the day before. My opinion is that this game is INCREDIBLY AWESOME!I don't understand, why the negative reviews.... yes, it is HARD, and i remember quitting and restarting a few times after losing my party. But it's addictive as hell! I have ALWAYS found myself coming back to the game after losing brutally!So far i have even managed to beat one boss. Boy, that was some hardcore chain of luck!!! I had one hero left, who was already at deaths door when the last few strikes came.... it was some crazy gamble!!! :)I think the entire point of the game is, to make you struggle. You simply cannot progress, unless you learn how to minimize losses. And somehow the game makes you want to come back for more.10/10			"

												Warning: spoilers ahead. This is a great game, it really is: I wish I could reccomend it. The reason I can't is because of the ending, which basically takes all your hard work as a player and spits on it. You get to the end, are forced to make great sacrafices after a long journey that has allowed you to shape your party and the nearby hamlet. But what happens when you finally defeat the great evil? *poof* You just get a ""rocks fall, everyone dies"" scenario where none of your actions really mean anything and some silly cycle is maintained, it's simply a lazy excuse to encourage a replay of the game. Sure, it has quite a bit of inspiration from Lovecraft, but that doesn't mean you have to make the evil unbeatable because of such inspiration. Is a happy ending after such a journey too much to ask?			"

												I really like the atmosphere, level, character and story design. The narrator is a nice touch too.But I can not enjoy the game I paid for because it is not an enjoyable game. After about 20 hours of gameplay I've come to a point where everything is really repetitive. That would still be fine since I enjoy the game, if only the game would let me enjoy it without punishing me every time I either go in blind or fully prepared.You do a perfect quest, clear the whole dungeon and on the end screen for your quest, you get a bunch of sicknesses and debuffs on characters that you kept stress and disease free. So you have to keep your heroes in town for one or two more quests. So you take other heroes and go on with them. The same thing happens. Rinse and repeat.I do not enjoy being punished for playing a game well and thoughtfully.You make some progress (level up their gear and skills and get some cool trinkets), but you get to feel that progress very little during the actual gameplay, since soon enough your buffed up heroes have leved up beyond the maximum level for the dungeons you played. Now you take on higher level dungeons thinking THIS IS WHERE THE FUN STARTS. Nope. You get the same enemies, the same tactics, the same level design, the same curios, but it's all leveled up too, so you're back to basically the same thing. Sure, you get more money and heirlooms, but that's because every next upgrade costs 2-3 times more than the previous one.So, after playing without having a single hero die on me, by having 3 teams of 4 ready to go on quests, I feel like I'm just grinding in place WHILE BEING STRESSED OUT ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT DICE ROLL WILL BRING.The story didn't advance much, nor did it show anything original, nothing changed about my heroes nor my town except for some stat modifications.The darkest grinder.

Early Access Review
								A very pretty game, however ultimately hostile towards fun.I love the fact the developers wrote their own engine since most general ones (Unity, Unreal) are not so great for 2D-only games. The 2D animations, instant load times and nice UI effects make for a pretty sight.However, as hard as I tried, I haven't really had any fun playing. The game is difficult, in a way where you don't really get to feel angry about your decisions and in the end learn from your mistakes. Rather, you end up feeling like you're constantly out of luck.There are 2 phases in the game : exploring dungeons, and managing your party back in the town between adventures.In the dungeon is where the luck element gets into play, and that could be fine. But unfortunately, the state of your party degrades exponentially rapidly. So you need to be in excellent shape for more than half of the dungeon in order to have a chance at finishing it. It rarely feels like you barely make it out alive; you either die far from the end, or you clearly had incredible luck / too powerful a party for that dungeon's level of difficuly.Also, there are so many events and animations that I felt I was watching the game play against itself in fights. When it's finally your turn to do something, out of the 4 abilities each of your character has, there was rarely the feeling that some tactical thinking was in order. I would more or less select the offensive ones one by one, then hover above a monster to get an idea of the hit probability, then cross my fingers. There is not really any worthwile build-up of buffs, as they are not that good, and losing a turn buffing yourself is dangerous. Fights were not very exciting to me.Finally, when your party is surprised by enemies, your order is basically shuffled, which means some characters won't be able to act at all. You then need to spend one or more turn rearranging your positions, which is madenning since you don't know in which order your characters will act, and since they cannot always move to any given position in one go. All the while getting attacked, and not retaliating. Not very fun all in all.Meanwhile, in town, some design decisions made me wonder about the developer's intentions. For example, if you need to send a couple party member to the church or tavern for stress relief, you basically have to go in each building, figure out first which slots will be available to each character, which is not really fun. But then once you commit to a slot and pay, you won't get your money back if you need change your assignments. Since stress relief can easily cost more than 50% of your income, this is kinda frustrating. Please, just let me select heroes that I want to have a relaxing time, and show me options, instead of the manual, error prone and unfun assignment.Also, when preparing to delve into a dungeon, you need to buy supplies, but anything you don't use is not refunded or kept for another go. I do not really see the point in this; there is enough reliance on the random number generator in this game without having us wild guessing how much money should be wasted on items. This just leads to grinding for more money.Pros:  Great engine, great UI, pretty as hell  Great writing supported by even greater voice actingCons:  Difficulty stems from luck rather than tactics; I'm not sure I could get much better at the game  Frustrating design choices in the Town phase  Fun is not something I would describe this game as being. Not really frustrating either, just kinda boring :( "

												I came extremely close to refunding this game, but I chose to write a review instead. Maybe I'll change my mind in the future, because I really did want to like the game. Art's nice. Atmosphere has a good dark gothic tone, and the gameplay tries to reflect that, but fails in my opinion.This game is a pseudo-Lovecraftian horror dungeon crawler where sanity/stress plays a part in your dungeon delving. My first experience with the game was relatively enjoyable, but game mechanics which at first seem interesting very quickly turn into obnoxiously tedious obstacles to actually enjoying the game. You gain a new affliction EVERY time you go into a dungeon because it's impossible to not get up to 100 stress for at least one party member and there's a good 90% chance you get an affliction from that. Only dodged it twice in three hours of play. And once that happens, your heroes start to think that skipping all their turns is a good idea and the entire game just becomes infuriating. Stress can only be removed by engaging in town activities, but OOPS, there's only one ♥♥♥♥ing slot per unless you spend 3 dungeons worth of heirlooms to upgrade it, and each activity costs 1000+ gold, so to de-stress all your heroes it takes all the gold you made on your last run as well. And you need to go on an expedition for those activities to take effect which means running with a second group, which is probably also already stressed, and collecting new afflictions for them as well. Gotta catch em all. Stress accrues at a rate far beyond the rate at which you can remove it, if you can at all. Most classes don't have an ability that removes stress, and the ones that do remove 6, and when you're already gaining stress every turn, and all your heroes are♥♥♥♥♥♥talking each other because that's a great mechanic, adding more stress, it's like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the ocean trying to abate the stress buildup, and all the while wasting turns on top of it. Saying that the stress system is more unbalanced than a one-legged elephant on stilts would be to put it lightly. You can't carry nearly enough torches to keep the light up for longer dungeons, and camping feels pitifully useless, especially when you've already gotten stressed AND YOUR CHARACTERS DENY HEALING ABILITIES. Stress is an interesting idea for a game mechanic. I like the idea, but not the implementation. Certainly not when it's completely unmanageable.This game does rogue-like wrong. There's no way to prepare for the things you'll face, or manage the problems your heroes rapidly accrue, and it all just snowballs downhill starting from the very first ♥♥♥♥ing mission. It's not challenging or complex, it's a slap in the ♥♥♥♥ing face for all your efforts, and then the game tries to tell you that you like it that way.♥♥♥♥ off. Don't buy this game. Especially not for the full price tag.			"

												Wanted a fun game, instead got a very difficult grinder. I looked online to find out if others were having difficulty and they were, the players that responded to them recommended doing ""suicide runs"" to gain money for your main team's stress healing and etc. So the point of the game is to grind out missions you're likely to lose but not care about to support the characters you do want to keep. That's a chore, not a game.Darkest Dungeon should have a difficulty that is more story-driven and the harder modes can be for players that want a grind. I'm going to give it a shot with some of the more egregious penalties removed, but I'm not really keen on doing missions that I spend a half hour on for characters I'm not supposed to care about.

												I was enjoying this game a lot when I first started.You can feel yourself getting the hang of the strategy and learning how to defeat the various enemies you face.However, the end game is horrendous and is simply not a fun experience.I don't know if one can say if it is truly difficult or if it simply is NOT FAIR.Am I mad? Yep. Honestly, I am so frusturated with this game to the point I don't want to play it anymore.Sure you get used to losing champions (I am not annoyed about this), but to lose half your party everytime you go out? REALLY?And I'm not talking about losing your party due to your own mistakes and not bringing enough supplies etc.The high level enemies WILL crit you every turn, and the high dodge level you built up using trinkets, buffs and spending your heirlooms on the armor is basically useless as the enemy's accuracy is too high.Oh yeah– if you are playing on the mac like me, it will probably crash randomly at times. Also, if you install any mods through steam workshop, expect the game to crash everytime you return to the hamlet after going to a dungeon.TLDR: The game is really enjoyable at the beginning but the end game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ On mac, the game crashes randomly.

												Due to the poor balancing and game mechanics I can unfortunately not recommend this game. The single mechanism that feels completely game breaking to me is the fact that level 3 heroes refuse to quest on lower level missions. That just feels like a massive non-sensical band-aid. It's a shame considering that the voice acting and the art is amazing.Imagine you play an RPG and you level up and now your party dies because the guy who level up goes like ""nahh I don't want to fight those mobs because they are too easy"". That's how broken the game is. The only explaination I can imagine for why the developers would design the game like this is because they realized the game would be too easy and simply couldn't be bothered to take the time and find a sensbible way, so instead they went with a quick and dirty option.I recognize though that I have higher standards for game mechanics than most people so feel free to ignore this review if you don't think game mechanics is that important.

												It's just another negative feedback game, most choices are wrong even if it is the best or only possible choice.the stress damage mechanic is rediculous enemies in the first dungeon dealing 20+ stress damage and damage to your entire party's HP at the same time.I've missed 12 times in a row while getting blanketed with AOE attacks dealing 8 or more damage.I think I've only found 2 chests that weren't stress/HP damage traps, hallways also have RNG traps that randomly give status ailments and damageHealing is vital but punished with crits on that character in most casesYes I did this review frustrated and angry but with only 1.8 hours into a video game and having less than 0 fun makes this not worth the 25$ price tag. I play games to have fun not to get frustrated and ticked off at mechanics totally out of the players control, these wern't my mistakes this was a dice roll and the game rolls everytime you hit a key in or out of battle. I love turn based RPGs but this is just a game, sorry job of attrition since I had no will to continue playing it makes it feel like work.			"

												I'm conflicted about the game. Everything screams for me to like it. The graphics look great, voice acting is incredible, the theme is foreboding and thick, animations crisp, and on and on and on. But really, this isn't a game. It's an RNG simulator. It's a horror story spectator mode. You don't git gud at the game and overcome (like in dark souls) but rather you exploit certain aspects of the game to progress. Ultimately I found no reward in this game, which is sad cuz I wanted to like it so damn much. Like I said, it feels like I'm just watching a story I have little control over in which you always die or go insane in the end.			"

												I very much wanted to love this game to bits, but the endless grind and unforgiving RNG just killed this game outright for me. Besides, no matter how buffed up your level 6 heroes are, they still won't stand a chance in the final Darkest Dungeon level because you'll be running in loops and your supplies will be very limited (besides, Stress will kill your characters faster than that you can say 'Huckleberry Fin' anyway). Played the game for a very long time, all the way from the beta, but they just screwed up the final release. And especially for the current price it's not worth all of your frustration. Unless your a masochist, of course. Then feel free to give it a try.			"

												This game is too grindy and very very very very RNG heavy. I do not understand why abandoning a fight requires RNG. This just makes the game EXTREMELY frustrating to play and if you lose a high level hero, you have to go back and grind another one. This game could have been really good if it wasn't for the amount of RNG in it and the amount of grind.			"

As far as early access games go though, this is a great 88 hours of gaming on darkest dungeon so far. Also one more thing, I have not had any crashes or big bugs so far, pretty stable for an early access game!The Full game is now out and I am in love with the game, have over 30 hours on it now since xmas and boy, what a joy! After about 20 hours I really started to get the mechanics down and have a huge, well done up party, but I know death could be right around the corner for any of them.Great art design, awesome atmosphere, gameplay is a blast, wonderful voice work and it is very addicting! I love the stress mechanic and all the quirks and diseases, just a wonderful game indie rpg that is a very nice challenge! I use to love a game caleld Vandal hearts years back, this reminds me of that in some ways but so much better, with alot more depth and much much more challenging.Go pick up this wonderful game, early contention for Game of the year. I have not been able to put this game down! Got it around Christmas and I have already put in 88 hours!			"

Early Access Review
								I was initially unsure of whether to get this game or not.  I was excited and nervous based on the reviews.  I'll summarize the important aspects of the reviews that I found positive or negative.Positive:1. The game is hard2. Your choices have permanent consequences (no redos)3. The game mechanics offer depth and a variety of play styles4. The atmosphere is awesome.Negatives:1. The game isn't so much hard as unfair (RNG) and tedious2. The changes that led to Corpses and Heart Attacks made it even more tedious without enhancing gameplay.Obviously, bought the game in spite of my fears.  I don't like tedium, so I figured I might turn off the most offending bits (corpses and heart attacks) but I'd try it with them first.Almost immediately, I lost a character to a Heart Attack and found the corpses annoying.  I recognized the heart attack was my fault and could be easily avoided, so I left it on, but turned off corpses.  Played for awhile, until I had level 3 heroes, went into a level 3 dungeon and got owned.  I realized at that point, however, that I had made a lot of mistakes, had learned a lot about the game, and generally (aside from that dungeon) had found combat kind of easy and tedious.  I was using the same skills over and over and didn't think I was playing the game very well (which was confirmed for me by that level 3 dungeon).I decided to start from scratch, w/ corpses on, and I like the game better as a result.  My heroes are happier and healthier, and I have more treasure.  A couple tips for enjoying the game:1. Corpses don't need to be destroyed.  If you have ranged weapons, sometimes you want to keep the enemy further away.  I would say it's about 50-50 on whether corpses make a battle easier or harder.  Sometimes they♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but sometimes I'm glad they're there.  They certain helped push me toward utilizing more skills, which honestly helps you be better prepared for when your characters are knocked out of order (btw, prepare for that!)2. You either need to do one of the following  a) Read some guides.  Read up on the things you can interact with, what items you can use with them, etc.  Your heroes will be far less stressed and you'll get more loot.  b) Figure it all out yourself.  You'll need to treat some excursions as scouting missions (which they are...), interact in all sorts of ways with different objects, record the results, and don't hesitate to dispense with the broken husks of heroes who return to you, rather than wasting money repairing them.  This way takes longer, but can be fun.  This is true really for any new situation in the game....boss fights, etc.  If you don't read the scouting reports (guides) of others, you'll need to do your own scouting,  Your scouts will pay for your ignorance.Is the game perfect?  Of course not.  Is the corpse mechanic kind of silly?  Sure.  With or without corpses, there are silly aspects to the combat.  The combat is stylized, so it's going to be weird at times, you just need to learn the rules.  My biggest complaint, actually, is that the system of skills and characters is actually too flexible.  It would be cool if there were missions that required certain characters (4 Crusaders, for instance).  Well, maybe there are or will be...I have a lot more game to play.  However, if you're like I was and sitting on the fence, worried about tedium, then I recommend buying the game and giving it a shot.			"

To keep the game going on you have to take a hero out of recreation, but you don't get the money back you invested. And since money is key in this game it crushes you again			"

												This game is very polarizing, some hate it, some (a lot more) love it.I count myself to the top of the pile, the people who have tried everything and seen everything this title has to offer. There is: A metric ton of atmosphere, 14 hero classes, 24024 possible party configurations, a truckload of trinkets, five regions, three difficulty levels, eight quest types, 11 bosses, some of which in multiple versions, enough stress for three generations of engineering students, heart attacks, bitter losses, sweet victories, bloodhungry dice, unspeakable abominations, the flame that lights your path, lessons of frustration tolerance and consequences of greed, unavoidable deaths, far more avoidable deaths, a psychologically challenging journey and, ultimately, ruin. If you are ready for all this, i dare you delve into this masterpiece of art, both dread- and beautiful. My final advice would be just to buy it. After two hours in the game you have essentially seen the vast majority of things that are in the game, literally. It will get much much harder later on, but it will stay the same gameplaywise. If you like what you saw so far  keep it. If not, refund.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has A LOT of potential, but falls very short of the mark. Let me give a quick synopsis of it. You are trying to reclaim your family's estate from dark forces. You recruit adventurers from the town to perform various quests, all involving adventuring in dungeons. You will have the ability to upgrade your party's skills and equipment, in addition to equip them with trinkets that can help or hinder them. There is a very diverse spectrum of character classes and builds that you can recruit, along with both positive and negative traits. Building a party of 4 adventurers whose skills benefit and support each other is key to adventuring successfully. While you adventure you will find treasure, trinkets, and ""heirlooms"". The latter of which you can use to upgrade the resources in the town to better support your adventurers. During your adventures your characters will not only take health damage, they will also gain STRESS. Varying factors can cause stress, everything from taking a lot of damage, enemy attacks, insufficient equipment, traps, other character's actions, your character's quirks, and even not enough lit torches. Having too much stress will cause your character to acquire quirks as they slip deeper into insanity, most of the ones you acquire will be detrimental, and hurt your character's performance, rarely will the quirk actually help them. In addition to quirks the characters can become diseased, further hurting (very very rarely helping) them. To remove the Stress, quirks, and diseases, you need to make use of the facilities in the town where the character will recover for 1 week in game (the time it takes to  perform 1 quest). Due to needing to recover from stress, diseases, or quirks you need to have multiple effective parties while the others recover. Where this game falls short:- In the dungeon there is no way to heal outside of combat other than a dubious ""Camping"" which is not always present and subject to the characters skill sets and quirks. You can eat food for 1 HP each, until the character gets full (3 or 4 HP total). This is next to useless as most enemies will eliminate that in one hit.- Negative Quirks and Diseases are acquired faster than they can be healed. Paying to reduce stress, and cure quirks and diseases can get VERY expensive, there is no way to keep up with it, you have to become resigned to having patchwork characters with annoying negatives.- Farming is disallowed. Finally have a party of decent heroes? Think you can run some low level dungeons to get some gold so that you can actually pay to cure and outfit them? No, too bad. There is a level cap, your heroes will utterly refuse to go on quests that are ""beneath them"". I can understand this, so that you don't farm until you are unbeatable. But one Levelled hero should be able to join a low level party.Basically if you don't mind completely random events trashing characters that you've put time into and become attached to, then this is the game for you!

												Darkest Dungeon is, at first glance, a great strategy game. You must assemble a party of four flawed (sometimes very flawed) heroes and descend into unforgiving dungeons full of traps, monsters and loot.Along the way, monsters will not only try to kill your heroes but will also spook and stress them out, pushing them over the edge. This could make your heroes ""afflicted"" (paranoid, masochistic, selfish...) and speed up your spiral of failure, or it might bring out the hero hidden in them and actually improve your chances. This mechanic in particular makes for some great moments: the slow, calculated combat builds up tension, which is then released all at once when a hero that you thought was a goner actually raises up to the challenge and turns legendary.This game has a great atmosphere. Everything from the art style, to the music, to the sound effects and the awesome, awesome narrator build a rich, scary and mysterious world. This isn't your standard fantasy fare - or rather, it is, but filtered through several layers of gothic horror and lovecraftian nightmares.The learning curve is great, at least in the beginning. Preparation is as important, if not more so, than combat tactics; the only way to know how to prepare, however, is to send heroes into dungeons ""like lambs to the slaughter"". This is fine at low levels, when you can easily get new recruits and toss them in. At higher levels, however, this builds into the game's fatal flaw.The highest level hero you can recruit is level 3, if you upgrade your hamlet properly. To have a chance at winning a Darkest Dungeon run, you need a party of four level 6 heroes. It takes about two quests for a hero to level up, and it takes about 30 minutes to complete a single quest. This means that, if your party of 4 level sixes gets wiped in the darkest dungeon, you must grind for THREE WHOLE HOURS in order to try again.This calculation does not consider weapon and skill upgrades, which you also need, and cost lots of money; this calculation does not consider recovery time, which your characters will probably need at least every two dungeons. So the three hours figure is a very conservative one.In addition to this, your party wipes can and will happen through no fault of your own. The very nature of the game, which makes it a great and unique experience at low levels, makes it so that the RNG will ♥♥♥♥ you up completely and relentlessly at the drop of a hat. All it takes is a small chain of bad luck and your three hours are gone.The developers have implemented a fix to this, in the form of 'Radiant mode', AKA easy mode. There's also plenty of mods that make the game less grindy. I still don't feel like I can recommend this game, because as it is, out of the box, 'Darkest mode' (which is the one most players will start with) is fundamentally broken and not fun in the long run, no matter how 'gud' you 'git'.

								The gamedesing and idea is gorgeous and very good.Nevertheless there are far too many random factors involved. The game works a lot with ""luck"". By this it is not creating a ""Dark Souls""-like fair challange but a repetative blockheadedness. It is ture that some strategies can be applied, however they can be overthrown by a single ""bad-luck-event."" One has to admit that this is something we face in reality, but in my opinion it is not working towards a gaming gratification.			"

In truth, this game is only really worth $7 tops.  Maybe I will try it some more later, but as far as initial impressions... not worth it.			"

								An excellent game designed for people who enjoy procedurally created content, turn-based combat, and interesting team management systems.  An absurd amount of replayability and fun is to be had here.  Don't listen to the WoW-kids and their complaints about the game being ""too random"", or ""too hard"", etc.  This game is not designed to spoon-feed you with easy and expected dangers.  Instead, the dungeons are realistic in that they are unforgiving and you never know what will happen.  This game is about managing risk, the health of your heroes, mission costs, and the all-too-real problems associated with things not always going as planned. Similar to other team-management, mission-centric games (i.e., like X-Com, Dungeon of the Endless, etc.), this game shines.			"

												A lot of reviewers have already said what needs to be said.The voice acting, the game's story, the game theme, all of it is very high quality. However, the game artificially lengthens its playtime by throwing too many punishing mechanics against you, with too many random elements.As one example of a problematic random element, nailing a critical hit is massively damaging, and while it can feel satisfying for your group to instant kill a target from a lucky dice roll (along with cool narrative from the narrator), the enemy can do the same to your characters (especially with chained criticals), which strips you of any tactical defensive options you'd want to employ. For this reason, it's not really a question of ""if"" a character will die, but ""when"" the character will die. You can't get too attached to your characters like you do in X-Com in Ironman mode, for example, thinking there's a chance they might survive. You actually have to grind parties to their death over and over and over and over again until you amass enough gold to upgrade your town to the point that you can then begin creating an endgame group (or try to) after another long grind of amassing wealth with suicide runs.

												For a while I enjoyed this game - the unique character archetypes, figuring out which party combinations would work best, the stress management aspect - but there are only so many times I can lose a high level character before all I can see is the grind it will take to train a new character all the way back up again.  The fact that the pinnacle of the game, the ""Darkest Dungeon"" requires this in order to retreat feels like being debilitatingly punished for playing the game.This game requires too much time for what it gives in return.  I don't want to spend any more time on the grind, and I can't help but feel cheated out of a satisfying conclusion to the story.			"

								Ugh... this game is just really bad. I have tried to like it but there isn't much to like in a game that gives you no fair chance and utter randomness. I like challenging games mind you, but this isn't challenging - it is just plain dumb bad luck all around, I guess they expect you to have ""fun"" dieing and being sorely outnumbered every quest, but I don't enjoy that... and I don't know who does. Then their is the fact that there is no option to save your game, first time I plaid for nearly two hours and by some luck had beaten a few quests and unlocked some stuff, and I figured ""Oh well I guess it must auto save"", so I excited the game but nope, it didn't auto save. That's pretty lame. The artwork is the only cool thing about this game in it's current state, but that's not enough to redeem it or make it worth playing. Until they add some balance to it so you actually have a chance, I would avoid this one altogether. Games are supposed to be fun... this is no fun. Its insanity.			"

												do i enjoy this game? yes. would i recommend this game? no and here is why. the game is very unforgiving which is either a  good thing or a bad thing depending on your own personal preference, the problem is this game doesnt really do the whole unforgiving gameplay very well compared to other games I've seen or played. lets take X-COM enemy unknown for example, in that game you almost always start out fairly on top of things but the game ups the difficulty faster than you can ever reduce it via equipment and researching, one of the reasons it works is because the game allowed to build at the very least some kind of foundation to work off of the rest of the game. in darkest dungeon the game is practically out of your league by the first actual mission and it takes quite a long time to get levels and upgrades, and your characters will begin to drop like flies which means you can never really build that foundation to build upon and most of the game just becomes a frustrating nightmare.

								Everyone seems to be complaining about this game being too hard as of around Dec 1st, 2015.  I got the game late December and have been having a great time.  RNG seems plenty fair to me.  Just when I think I'm doing well, the enemy crits me and I almost lose a character.Just when I think I'm gonna have to abandon a quest, a character goes virtuous and turns the mission around.I think the majority of these bad reviews came from players who got attached to characters that existed in a game that was easier than the developers wanted it to be.  The game got harder, some characters permadied, and everyone ran to the reviews to cry about it.Nothing in this game is permanent.  You're eventually going to have to pick who to heal knowing that the other is going to die.  A time will come when you'll need to sell a good trinket to have enough supplies for the next mission because you had to bail on your last mission and didn't recoup the losses.  Sometimes you don't bring enough shovels and have to tear down several stone walls with your hands so your favorite team spends a week or two on vacation and you're stuck leveling scrub recruits while passing on the higher level mission that had a sweet trinket reward.Preparedness goes a long way.

Darkest Dungeon SummaryDarkest Dungeon is at it’s heart more than just a rogue-like RPG. It’s a tale, a story, an epic if you will. Becoming attached to your characters cannot be helped and only makes those final blows much more painful to witness. You cannot go wrong with Darkest Dungeon, and here’s why!The GameplayDarkest Dungeon gameplay is slow and methodical, but that does not make it stale. Oh no, the gameplay is as staunch as the droves of monsters you’ll slay. To rush your decisions will lead your party to suffer both mentally and physically. It’s unforgiving, and you’ll probably throw a few cusses at the screen but it’s part of the experience. Gameplay Verdict: This is a turned-based strategy gem, and you’ll see that the moment you step into the abyss.Gameplay Score: 9/10The User Interface & MechanicsControls are simple, and actions are responsive. It’s a very well designed UI with enough depth to achieve what you want without feeling overwhelmed by navigation. You can literally play the entire game with just a mouse, unless you wish to name your characters after family members (not recommended). The mechanics are refined and definitely don’t lock you into one way of playing. There’s plenty to do and plenty to play around with. Who knows, you might find the next best party lineup!User Interface & Mechanics Verdict: When you remember that this is a Kickstarter game still in Early Access then you will realize why this score exists.User Interface & Mechanics Score: 9.5/10The Graphics Amazing enough to warrant the purchase of an art book. It’s orginal, somber, and macabre, but warm enough to set it apart from other dreary titles. It takes you back, draws you in, and provides more than enough character and emotion while remaining true to the art direction. Nothing seems out of place, and at the same time everything feels otherworldly.Graphics Verdict: Lovecraftian visuals like you’ve never seen them...but always wanted to.Graphics Score: 10/10The StoryA solid foundation for a rogue-like game, and more than enough narration and backstory to keep you invested. The story is not the focus, but will provide you with everything you need to understand the world and characters.The Story Verdict: Comparing the title to other games of similar genre(s), Darkest Dungeon actually stands out.The Story Score: 8.5/10Replayability Very high! There’s tons of upgrades (both town and character) and lots of trinkets to be found, if you stay alive long enough to make use of them. On top of that, there are currently (as of writing this) three distinct areas with different enemies and randomized dungeons. Add mods into that mix, like my three here, here, and here to multiply that replayability!Replayability Verdict: More than most games, honestly, especially with the wonderful modding community!Replayability Score: 8.5/10Overall VerdictLovecraftian art, a Serling-esque narrator, refined gameplay, and devoted devs; Darkest Dungeon is perhaps one of the most original titles ever made, and I have a passion for it. No area of the game is left unpolished, which says a lot for an Early Access title. I will continue to enjoy this game for an endless amount of time as it offers both an immense amount of replayability, depth, and challenge.Overall Score: 9/10 "

												TL;DR It's too frustrating to be fun. You're at the mercy of a dice roll regardless of good planning and decisionmaking.  Any progress you make is like driving a fuel inefficient car down a seemingly endless road with no gas stations. You know you're going to peter out eventually, it's just a matter of time. It makes you wonder why the hell you wasted your time with a doomed quest.The good: Interesting character classes and all of them are useful. Great art, great atmosphere with a heavy heaping of hopelessness. The narrator is great, adds a ton to the game.The Bad: The afflictions and the cures for them are exhausting in every sense of the word to try to keep up with. They're expensive, they keep that particular character out of the action so they cannot gain experience, and they can leave you without key party members. The combat is passable, but ultimately it's a roll of the dice whether or not you hit. With the game already having so much random crap it would really be nice if the core mechanic was not determined by luck. Player agency is a real problem. You commands to the characters become suggestions, especially when they become too stressed and fall into despair.     The stress is a separate affliction and everyone gets it over time. That can also force your characters to be held up in town so they can de-stress.      I've also had characters who have been in town for a week ( I didn’t select them for my party, but they had nothign wrong with them so there was no point sending them to do an activity) suffer penalties. That's right, by trying to save money, your character can get a debuff seemingly at random. You're punished for giving your characters a break.     Just about everything is determined by random chance.The caravan, the way you can hire new characters every week, is also random. So when you need a front line character, you could get 3 backline characters that came in on the caravan instead.      If all of that wasn't bad enough, you can't even take your higher level characters into lower dungeons to help out your low level characters. They will refuse to go. And you cannot use your characters abilities outside of combat. So you could be walking around with one of your party members an inch from death and your healer cannot help them until the next fight starts, unless you want to dump a bunch of your food into that character and potentially starve your party later and stress them all out, which is going to cost you a lot of money.There's more, but ultimately all of this makes it feel like you can never quite get a leg up and you're always sinking just a little deeper, all the while the challenges keep getting greater and your resources aren't keeping up. It’s not an enjoyable experience. I play games to unwind and have fun. I enjoy challenges, but this is like drilling into a steel vault with your d*ck.			"

												Darkest dungeon is simply one of (if not) the best games themed arround heroes and dungeon crawling.1 - ""heroes""unique characters and classes wich unique abilities as well, from your crusader to the ocultist, all have exclusive lines that definitively makes you know what kind of character he isthey are humans that try to prove their worth and do their best at work, when suffering humiliation and recieving massive damage, they will lose their minds slowly due to stress causing mental illness2 - stressusing the factor that can make any living being fall in despair and pain in a game makes you feel related to the hero, even feeling sad on seeing their mind going away slowly due to the eternal disgraçe he must endure to gain the decisive victoryand when you think all is lost...that's when a true hero may also find his resolution and stand up to it's fears, guiding your companions and boosting their morale3 - detailsthe graphics are definitively outstanding, the scenario and characters seem like comic book heroes as their drawing fits the style of modern dark and realistic comic drawings, the color scheme fits no matter where you are,the atmosphere hits you, each critical hit close-up makes you feel powerfull (or powerless if the enemy lands...) the expresson of characters when their resolves are tested makes a big impact on the player, worrying if bad and making you raise your fist in the air and say YES!' wen it's a good resultclosing statement - Darkest dungeon is like a novel, it will make you smile, it will make you cry, it will make you feel worthless, it will make you feel like nothing can stop you. i highly recommend this game if what you are searching for is a game that makes you his rug, but also a friend sometimes,and if you want thrill and excimentif you don't fall in love (and at somepoint, rage) with this game...no...this experience, once the ruins battle theme plays, you may need a doctor			"

												Having now surpassed over 150 hours on Darkest Dungeon (~40 in EA, ~110 since full release), it's long overdue for me to give this game the praise it deserves.  Simply stated, I would rank this in my top 10 games of all time - it's truly a phenomenal piece of work, and for anyone who's a fan of tough, turn-based RPG combat, you really need to buy this game. The good stuff:- The game's aesthetic; fantastic art, in a very gritty, dark style that sets the tone perfectly- Really cool music that uses some unusual sounding instruments; yes, I bought the OST DLC for this one- A turn-based combat, roster management style game that never lets you coast.  In fact, the difficulty ramps up pretty steadily, and on the top level missions one slight error in judgment could easily get that high-end hero you sank tons of gold into permanently killed- Nice variety of mission length, perfect if you sometimes only have a short while to play, but with longer missions that can last up to a couple hours- Cool variety of characters, all with unique skills, and all of whom can be used in many different ways depending on how you develop them- Some of the coolest bosses in any game, ever (Formless Flesh is truly the stuff of nightmares!)Guess I have to find something bad to say about it, too...?- Could definitely seem like a grind to some....and in a lot of ways it can be, but if you're (red) hooked on this game you won't care- The lack of anything to do with the currency you use to improve your town after you've puchased all the upgrades; maybe let us trade it for gold, or find something new to use it for once the town is maxed?Fans of dark, Lovecraftian fantasy or anyone who enjoys a challenging, turn-based RPG dungeon crawler, do yourself a favor and get this game.

												From every harsh review I've seen, I felt like I had to do a review on my own. So here it is.Darkest Dungeon. Bought it from♥♥♥♥♥for like 15$ a year ago. Definitely worth it. People are saying that the game's ruined because of the patch. I decided to play the game again after some break, 3 months maybe. It didn't impress me, I don't know what people are being so mad about, moreover, I'd even say the game is easier than it was. More classes = more choices in the dungeons, more compositions. It's not a surprise that you are losing in every dungeon if you don't upgrade your armor or abilities, God damn. Im still loving the game, it still annoys me when my enemy is dodging my attacks like crazy, but nothing has changed in that because of the patch. Im still rating the game 9/10. The perfect ten will happen if the final dungeon will give me a challenge. Peace.			"

												When a game opens up with a disclaimer saying ""This game is about making the most out of a bad situation. You will die, you will loose heroes, you will abandon expeditions, you know exactly what your getting into. This is by far, a very fun, challenging unique RPG. You know the developers did something right when you putting along in a dungeon and all is going well, too well. And then it happens. The train wreck, and all you can do is sit back horrified as the whole thing goes to pot within seconds as your party starts to tear itself apart from the inside out as they can't manage their stress, and the monsters keep on their relentless onslaught.It’s not just about managing HP (although, that’s a part of the equation). It’s managing the party. It’s managing their stress. It’s managing the torch. This is a really unique spin on a dungeon crawler. Two thumbs up. "

												Time i got around to posting a review of this game. In short its fantastic.It is hard, brutal and sometimes downright unfair but hey thats the nature of RNG.  You need to get used to idea that you are not meant to win every battle and loss is a part of the game. Every run is a knife edged gamble where you take risks you simply would not even consider in most games. It can be frustrating and i have rage quit several times, like running into a collector on a boss run where i dont have any characters suited to dealing with him. The class system again is unique and the way skills synergise between classes is very balanced, plus the occultist can rain down tentacles^^Wonderful tone and the story fits perfectly, if your a fan of lovecrafitan themes then this is for you.  If you want a game that will push and sometimes break you go for it.			"

												The atmosphereVery well done, the voice acting and the work given to the assets gives a serious lovecraftian feel. I love it hands down! However, given to the nature of the game, it does get a bet repetitive every now and again, which is a perfect time to take breaks.Difficulty It was difficult to learn this game without a few guides everynow and again. However, there seems to be a stacked randomizer that is some what set against you. I am new to a party wipe every so often but it seems that your walk a razor thin randomization line with both sides leading to failure.Possible conflict For some reason this game does not work well with any settings I have tried on OBS classic. Not the biggest deal in the world until I tried to use studio as well, with no luck. I just want to point this out, it was not a breaking thing.TLDR:Great game with a great atmosphere, but it seems to be seriously stacked against you, looks beautiful otherwise! "

												 Let me start off by saying that Darkest Dungeon scratches a certain itch.  The itch to grind to be specific.  That being said this game is not for the faint of heart.  Darkest Dungeon will reward you with one hand and slap you across the mouth with the other.  Early on it is evident that not everyone will be able to survive.  The ones that manage to make it to the higher levels seem to have earned some level of respect in the later game.  Which makes losing them all the more painful.  Losing a couple level ones is a sacrifice you are willing to make, but a max level character with about 150000 gold in training and rehabilitation, that really hurts.  My only advice is to use straight Darwinism, it sounds cruel, but in the end only the strong will survive.  Great game.			"

												well i have to say that this is a great game, but frustrating too.the whole concept of the game, i believe if you read any other review on steam, is awesome. it's a somewhat a Cthulhu based game with all those horrifying monsters you need to fight with. i do like the concept of you cant be a superhero once  you get on a certain level, in this game no matter how hard you tried, the heros can fall and all your hard work for that hero is gone. you can undo any moves you done and that's realistic. im not sure do people still feel so much entertaining afterall when you see all your hard work gone with a death blow, but im sure that if you are looking for some causal fun, this is not the right game you are looking for.I like this game anyway.10/10			"

												Ruin has come to our family.Once you hear those words, ruin will come to your life.Darkest Dungeon is a place where boys become men and men become dead.You start as a sane person and end as a madman.An unforgiving game where you have to pay for every mistake you make. Yes the RNG is relentless. Yes there is no hope in this place. Many heroes will end at the graveyard (but you can still visit them YAY).But you will get back for more.This fantastic 20$ journey to hell is wrapped in beautiful art style and best possible narration.So, steel yourself, and remember, there can be no bravery without madness.10/10 will be laughing still... at the end "

												When a game opens up with a disclaimer saying ""This game is about making the most out of a bad situation. You will die, you will loose heroes, you will abandon expeditions, you know exactly what your getting into. This is by far, a very fun, challenging unique RPG. You know the developers did something right when you putting along in a dungeon and all is going well, too well. And then it happens. The train wreck, and all you can do is sit back horrified as the whole thing goes to pot within seconds as your party starts to tear itself apart from the inside out as they can't manage their stress, and the monsters keep on their relentless onslaught.It’s not just about managing HP (although, that’s a part of the equation). It’s managing the party. It’s managing their stress. It’s managing the torch. This is a really unique spin on a dungeon crawler. Two thumbs up. "

												From every harsh review I've seen, I felt like I had to do a review on my own. So here it is.Darkest Dungeon. Bought it from♥♥♥♥♥for like 15$ a year ago. Definitely worth it. People are saying that the game's ruined because of the patch. I decided to play the game again after some break, 3 months maybe. It didn't impress me, I don't know what people are being so mad about, moreover, I'd even say the game is easier than it was. More classes = more choices in the dungeons, more compositions. It's not a surprise that you are losing in every dungeon if you don't upgrade your armor or abilities, God damn. Im still loving the game, it still annoys me when my enemy is dodging my attacks like crazy, but nothing has changed in that because of the patch. Im still rating the game 9/10. The perfect ten will happen if the final dungeon will give me a challenge. Peace.			"

												Unless you're a masochist, avoid this game. The first two hours were my party getting hopelessly slaughtered and stressed out resulting in me having to run away from every quest I tried. If I could pinpoint what I'm doing wrong, it would at least give me a direction to strive for, but there's not. Getting destroyed seems to be the way this game intentionally plays. The entire experience feels wholly unsatisfying. There was no point where I felt like I had achieved anything or real enjoyment. There is nothing pulling me to delve any deeper than the surface of this game. It's pretty clear there will be a ton of frustrating randomness destroying any sense of progress.			"

												Darkest dungeon is simply one of (if not) the best games themed arround heroes and dungeon crawling.1 - ""heroes""unique characters and classes wich unique abilities as well, from your crusader to the ocultist, all have exclusive lines that definitively makes you know what kind of character he isthey are humans that try to prove their worth and do their best at work, when suffering humiliation and recieving massive damage, they will lose their minds slowly due to stress causing mental illness2 - stressusing the factor that can make any living being fall in despair and pain in a game makes you feel related to the hero, even feeling sad on seeing their mind going away slowly due to the eternal disgraçe he must endure to gain the decisive victoryand when you think all is lost...that's when a true hero may also find his resolution and stand up to it's fears, guiding your companions and boosting their morale3 - detailsthe graphics are definitively outstanding, the scenario and characters seem like comic book heroes as their drawing fits the style of modern dark and realistic comic drawings, the color scheme fits no matter where you are,the atmosphere hits you, each critical hit close-up makes you feel powerfull (or powerless if the enemy lands...) the expresson of characters when their resolves are tested makes a big impact on the player, worrying if bad and making you raise your fist in the air and say YES!' wen it's a good resultclosing statement - Darkest dungeon is like a novel, it will make you smile, it will make you cry, it will make you feel worthless, it will make you feel like nothing can stop you. i highly recommend this game if what you are searching for is a game that makes you his rug, but also a friend sometimes,and if you want thrill and excimentif you don't fall in love (and at somepoint, rage) with this game...no...this experience, once the ruins battle theme plays, you may need a doctor			"

												I know people will just vote this down without reading it, but I really don't care.Darkest Dungeon is not a game I can bring myself to recommend, but I still find it to be an incredibly earnest videogame on the merit of how much effort went into making it -- at least as far as general production goes. The visual polish is incredible, even though it lacks variety. The core ideas are very interesting and some choices were good, such as the ability to leave a dungeon at any time to prevent loss of recruits, at a cost. The narrator is amazing and the addition of a section in the options menu which lets the player toggle certain systems such as corpses was a very good decision.That said, while this breaks my heart to say, this is easily one of the most disappointing games I've ever played.As it stands, progression-wise, Darkest Dungeon's design is very akin to your standard mobile game. Perform task, then perform task again, then perform same task again. As you do this, your funds may rise and you may inch yourself closer to... Whatever objectives the game throws at you. At its core, the game asks you to pick a party, throw the party into a dungeon where they'll hopefully succeed. After this, the player will receive funds in return for a good performance, promptly wasting said funds recovering party members from basically unavoidable mental injury and funding the next expedition's quasi-mandatory set of supplies. This will / may leave the player with a very, very small margin of profit. Since money is so important to progress, half of the game will feel like a constant grind to stay just above debt. Losing out will often imply a huge scuffle just to recover from debt. Running out of funds will almost always mean the player will be losing recruits or a great deal of time just to get back on the treadmill, let alone back to progressing.The core design doesn't help this. I love turn-based RPGs and I particularly love tough ones. My favourite RPG series ever is Shin Megami Tensei, for example. The difference is that, in those games, the player has more going on that they don't feel like all they're doing is fighting. That's more or less what I felt while playing this. I fight, then I fight some more, and then I fight a little bit more, and in the end I hope that I made slightly more money than I wasted. I'd also like to add that for a game whose narrative is based around eldritch horror, it certainly is pretty safe with its monster designs. Combat-wise, each and every enemy encounter feels designed specifically to kill or maim the player's progression as fast as possible. Some enemies are dedicated solely to inflicting large amounts of stress damage and they're often protected by beasts with over-inflated health bars and sometimes even spells to protect other members from direct harm. On paper this might sound alright, but in practice, since practically every move a player makes is subject to RNG, it's hard for the player to feel like they can control their fate.The game is too reliant on dice rolls and that's fine, in theory. However, the enemies are not under the same pressure that the player is, so they can easily form all-out attack parties and stack debuffs on your recruits because losing their ranks doesn't matter. They are more-or-less subject to the same kind of dice roll the player is, so to some players that might feel fair. But since the AI has no sense of self-preservation, they can easily throw themselves at your party until it breaks.This would also be okay, would it not be for the overwhelming odds. The developer has gone on record to state that they wish this game to feel like the player is constantly in a bad spot. I understand this mentality, but I think it didn't work out for them.The game becomes grueling to the point of frustration and tedium -- where things happen completely outside of your control and you're somehow being asked to feel responsible for something you couldn't possibly prevent. It's like saying you worked hard to win the lottery.This is one example of a new genre I call ""Badge of Honour"" games. Games which live and die through unfairly punishing design and are extremely contingent on clicking with the audience -- being able to say you've ""beaten"" Darkest Dungeon will become a badge of honour and very few people want to admit they won because they got lucky, so it creates this aura about it wherein the audience is divided by ""people who got good"", and ""people who don't get it"". Plainly, I disagree both of these are the case, so I don't feel the game should be recognized in this manner. There's nothing quite as infuriating as knowing a game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and yet being told it was intended. I'm sorry, but I can't possibly recommend Darkest Dungeon. There are those who say people like me ""didn't get it"", but I'm sorry. I systematically play bullethell games, I've done challenge runs in games like Contra and Megaman and I often engage in challenge runs in more modern games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne. I do get 'punishing but fair', and this is CERTAINLY not it.Seen as I'm told all of this was intended, I'll make sure to not recommend this. I can forgive awful balancing work and poor overall design due to inexperience, but if this was the vision the creator had, then they'll have to accept those consequences -- ironically.Did I enjoy my time with Darkest Dungeon so far? To some extent, sure. And I'll be playing more of it. That said, I am fully aware that this is a game a lot of people will not enjoy for this price.Once the price drops to 5€ or thereabouts, I'll edit my review. Until then, again, I'm sorry, but at this price, a glorified mobile turn-based badge of honour game isn't worth your time or investment. I've said this before and I'll say it again: Videogames are a past time. Designing a videogame explicitly to make the player feel like crap on a constant basis is counterproductive at best, and just plain stupid design at worst.If you're not convinced, then I would highly recommend downloading the Lighter Dungeon mod and then going into the game's files and adjusting the parameters to better fit your criteria. Bumping down the cost of supply items can go a long way toward making the experience bearable at best.""These terrible creatures can be killed; they can be beaten!""Sure thing, narrator. If I'm lucky enough.			"

												The good: It's challenging, if you're into that. Most of the classes seem well thought through (not sure I see enough benefit in the Antiquarian or the Abomination, but maybe that's just me.) It is very replayable, in that it is basically a RNG-fest with a lot of grinding at the core. If you enjoy it, the cost per hour will be really low. Has sort of a Lovecraftian vibe.The bad: Doesn't satisfy my explorer urge at all. The dungeons are basically RNG-generated graphs and have no interesting unique content. There is really no story here worth mentioning. I suspect how you feel about this could be predicted by how you feel about rogue-like games. I find them boring; if you are into them, you'll probably enjoy this more.Mechanically, It's an unforgiving game of tactics and LOTS of grinding to level up fighters. I thought maybe there were plateaus and the mechanics would open up in some interesting way at some point, but not so far. I think I'm done with this game. (I'm still a long way from the end.)It's ALMOST a game I could like, but at the end of the day, there is way too much tedium and way too little joy for me to want to play this game. It kind of rolls up some of the things I've liked least about D&D dungeon crawls (poor survivability of heros, no real sense of hero's journey, boring resource management) up into one package. If you like games like that -- and I know people who do -- this might be your game. If, like myself, you favor exploration, story, and unique content, well, this probably isn't going to do it for you.			"

												What a great game. When you go to dungeon, you have to know your limits. If you push harder with taking serious risks, you will lose your heroes. Sometimes it is worth it, but mostly you have to retreat. Do your risk assessment because it is all about control. However, often you will lose your control, and everting will go wrong.			"

												+ Lovecraft Themed game with concepts like sanity and various creatures from his novels.+ Cool classes to experiment with.- Overdose on RNG: sanity/virtue just becomes unmanagable screwing your party over.- You cannot heal between battles nor can you keep your unused supplies.Those two negetives alone will just have you going through an endless cycle of sending groups out just to get slaughtered and lose money. The only viable way to ""get good"" at this game is either to get lucky or send endless suicide squads just to earn a little bit, making the game about spending hours of grinding over rewarding diffculty though speaking of which.- Torches are your difficulty.This seems initally like a cool concept: more light = advantages, but less loot and vice versa. However, why could there not be any optimization at all for  the difficulty for this game? I'm not the only one whose played this game and realizes the curve for this game is as hard as eating a rock, yet theres nothing you can do about it but ""get good""? But in the end, unless you're a masochist who loves dealing with being at the whim of a sadistic RNG system I would avoid it.			"

												A dark, turn-based dungeon crawler that will test your ability to manage a group of adventurers in an attempt to purge the evil underneath your ancestor's manor.  The game pulls most of its inspiration from Lovecraft, so expect your characters to go insane in addition to dying horribly.  No, really, you probably do not want to name characters after people you like because either A) they will die or B) they will get so messed up that you kick them out.  Do note that there is a lot of RNG involved--if you cannot handle randomness, you might want to look elsewhere.Pros:Fantastic narratorGreat theme and implementationAnimations are quick but showInsanity mechanic is well fleshed outBosses are well-designed and horrifyingCons:Not all party member classes feel well balancedRNG can be a turnoff - sometimes feels like difficulty is artificial due to evasive enemiesWeapon and armor upgrades feel a little bit underwhelming "

												I have a feeling that people who complain about the game being ""unfair and random"" are just not very good at it, and can't accept that sometimes you WILL lose and people WILL die, because you can't savescum. The game is challenging and fun to play, moreover it has an amazing visual and audio design, it oozes atmosphere all the time, and the addition of the narrator (oh my god his voice is so good) was a great idea.I have never felt like I was presented with a challenge I couldn't overcome, even later in the game when the dunbgeons are supposed to be ""impossible"" and ""unfair"". They really aren't. you just can't go in blindly and expect to win with every team. Figure out what works and what doesn't in each dungeon, design your team accordingly. Sometimes you will get screwed by dice rolls, sure. But it's part of the course, just as it is part of the course in games like Xcom, it's all about minimizing the risks. If one bad dice roll puts you in the losing position, you are doing something wrong.The game is hard and mean, and is not going to cut you any slack. The last dungeon is a huge difficulty spike, but it's nowhere near impossible. It's (again) all about figuring out what works and what doesn't, if you keep bashing your head against the wall, maybe it's time to rethink your approach, instead of going to the internet to complain?The game is awesome, but not for people who want to succeed every time they play, that's not how it works. If you can't tolerate the fact that the game has some random elements that work for and against you, then this is not a game for you.			"

												Lots of people are leaving negative reviews because of the incredibly anti-player RNG they added a few patches ago. Recently, they added options so that the player can now choose their own difficulty regarding enemies critting or causing a certain amount of stress. I only got this game a few days ago and I am absolutely loving it thus far without tweaking any of these settings. I imagine the lategame is what people are complaining about mostly. From my perspective, 14 or so hours in, this game is fantastic. I love the random events that can happen and I like the high-risk high-reward system in the game. I love that in one moment my level 5 Occultist with 4 buffs on him at max HP will get one-shot by a tree branch in two enemy moves, but the next I make a really stupid risky move and get 3 incredibly rare and useful trinkets. The dumb things that happen in this game are hilarious, and losing is fun sometimes. Random town events are fantastic, too. Some people had a lot of complaints about grinding in this game (which I can understand is frustrating in a rogue-lite) but there are some events that will level up your idle characters no matter what level they are. Not having experienced the end-game RNG, I love this game to death, absolutely the most fun I've had with a turn based game for a long time. Hopefully the options they added last patch makes the game fun again for the experienced players.			"

Early Access Review
								EDIT 6/21/15Keep in mind this review is from Early Access.With 50+ hours into the game, I have experienced most of the content the game has had to offer. Personally, I had to restart a save file two seperate times to get the ball rolling right. If you like games that punish you when you take the easy way, but reward you if you can adapt to the curve and dwell in the darkness, then this is the game for you. Here are my thoughts, the good and the bad:Pros:- Harsh gameplay mechanics (for those who like a challenge)- The art style and gritty aspects of the dungeons- The classes and the strategic combos you can set up with the various skill sets- High risk, high reward (generally)Cons:- RNG can definitely kill a good run and be frustrating at times- End game content is non-existent (early access)- Repetitive grind to advance your characters (Randomly generated dungeons get to a point of just being giant checker boards of doom)X The inability to sell relic trinkets, the inability to sell base upgrade resources (They have added the ability to sell trinkets)Overall this is a great game with great potential, hoping to see more updates soon! Personally, I only recommend the game as I have enjoyed my time playing it, but if you are looking for a title with more content to dig into you may want to pass until a beta stage, or final release.

								This game is amazing. Tired of games that you can win with literally no effort? Then this is for you; because no matter what you do, you will lose characters, you will fail quest, you will have less than minimal resources, and you will get royally ♥♥♥♥ed. Just when you think you've outsmarted the dungeon, your entire party is starving,bleeding,or going insane. Every detail of this game, every mechanic, every bit of lore, every corner of every dungeon makes you feel like you've finally got the upper hand when in fact, it's the monsters that have it. You won't get rich and become the famed hero of tales for generations to come, you'll die in a worthless hole and your corpse will lay there forgotten until some brigand decides to loot your rusty worthless sword because it's better than a stick.

												A lot of people have given this game a bad rep, mostly about its difficulty and the grinding. Darkest Dungeon IS grueling, its a trying experience. You have to be careful with your adventurers, and you have to cut your losses when you can. Victory is achievable, but you have to work hard for it and grind for it. The game is about flawed characters, Human characters, who can faulter under stress or due to some character traits, so you have to take care of them. The game isn't for everyone, this is essentially the Dark Souls of Tactical RPGs; the bosses are not the only thing you have to worry about, normal enemies can also be deadly. It's about learning, and working hard for your victory, and I appreciate that about Darkest Dungeon. Also the unique artstyle, brilliant music, and everythng about the game is great to me.			"

								I think at some point people just forgot what fun was.This game is designed to be miserable. There's no payoff or any sort of interesting reward for thinking your way through missions. As you play through you'll gain more reward for finding exploits than thinking strategically. I'd say something about the atmosphere and narration, but any game where your characters WILL die from a lucky enemy crit is anti-narrative, no story can be based around a group that will reliably cycle out (without exploiting the game) every few hours. And no, it's not excused by being an early access.  It's literally a JRPG where your characters misery is a stat.  This could have been an interesting feature if stress was approached as a resource, used for spells, or used for the morally questionable goal of intentionally driving your characters insane. Here it's an in-game cash sink that tries to pointlessly humanize your boring dying meatsacks. This game may be popular, but it's got a long ways to go before it's good.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is one of the most atmospheric and engaging strategy games of this decade. I'm not telling you anything new if I repeat that its artstyle and the godly narration of Wayne June sets the mood perfectly to the point where even after over 150 hours the little ""OBLIBERATED!"" exclamation still makes me smile every time I bid my farewells to an enemy via critical strike. The voice over, the little barks of the heroes themselves and the brooding visuals make for a fantastic world to immerse oneself in. But the point I actually wanted to adress is that after the full release many reviews and players in the forums started complaining the game would be to hard now, and not just to hard, but to hard because of RNG - or bad luck. Players complain that the game wouldn't give them any chances for success and that's just wrong. There is more to the game then just the combat. You are the manager of this mess, you have to make sure your heroes are properly equipt for the job and you have to send the right heroes for the right job and only then will your commands in battle result in victories. The learning curve is laid out pretty well to do so. Sure, you WILL lose one or even a few heroes, but the game reminds you after every lost battle, fallen hero, or abandoned quest: You will learn from your mistakes. I played the game for about 100 hours right after the EA release, so when I started a new save I knew what I was doing. I managed to reach the final Darkest Dungeon without a single death and only retreating once because of a mistake I made, but which taught me a new boss mechanic I didn't knew about, so I won't be doing that♥♥♥♥♥♥again. Many people have managed this feat, which stands as a testemony to the fact that Darkest Dungeon is a beatable game, learnable and its chances are outplayable if you take your time to observe them. Then I started to go blindly against the Darkest Dungeon Quests. The first one went a little rough and I saw some questionable team choices at the end, but the second one destroyed me. I lost 3 out of the 4 Legends I sent. That's quite a bit of playtime down the drain and the game made me more than a little upset. I could feel the stress mechanic the heroes are going through in my own brain. I was mad, I was angry, but for the most part I way actually scared to go back in again. For the next three days I spent my time at work mentally preparing for the second assault on the second DD Quest. I pitted every possible team combination against each other in my head, weighted their pros and cons and when I went back in, I devastated the enemies. It was not even a contest. I stood no chance the first time, but after actually thinking about what I had to do and developing a strategy, I mopped the floor with eldritch blood. That's the point I want to get across. It's a strategy game. Use strategy. Use your brain. Don't just mindlessly grind. The game rarely gives hand outs and if you still want to take a calculated risk, think about all the times your risk-taking, your 90% chances, have worked out for you. It's a long game. It WILL bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥ given enough chances. Your job is to act like an adult and take responsibilites for those poor bits and bytes you just sent to your graveyard. If you really read up to this point: Get the game. You don't need a puzzle game to make use of your brain. Try yourself as the commander of misfits against the armies of madness.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a procedurally-generated, hardcore-difficulty dungeon crawler in which you lead teams of four heroes into the unknown dangers of ruins, forests and caves in a desperate attempt to get as much loot as possible without losing your sanity. And without having any of your party members killed, but that is somehow less likely to happen.In Darkest Dungeon, you are the heir of an ancestor particularly fond of playing around with demons, necromancy and other rather unholy things, whose last experiment basically screwed over the entire estate. It is now your job to explore the rotten lands, defeat unmentionable abominations and reclaim, piece by piece, what is rightfully yours. Exactly why are you doing that when you could just get the hell out of this nightmare-inducing land is beyond me, but hey, who am I to judge?To aid you in your quest you will have at your disposal heavy-quote-unquote ""heroes"", divided on 14 classes (15 with the last update), which you will send in teams of four into the depths in order to achieve randomly-generated objectives in randomly-generated dungeons, bringing back any shinies you find in the way to upgrade your little hamlet and supply your army of disposa- *cough cough!* ... rather brave henchmen and women.Some unique features while exploring the dungeons include a position-based combat system (in which the formation your party adquires is vital, since some attacks can only hit some positions, and some abilities require you to stand other ones for them to work), and the implementation of a second ""health bar"", which represents the hero's ""stress"". It always start at zero, and it slowly creeps up, skyrocketing when things are going bad for your party. Fill it completely once, and your hero will go nuts, giving him unpredictable behaviors for the rest of the mission. Fill it twice, and he/she will have a heart attack, intantly dropping their HP to zero and putting themselves ""At Death's Door"", a status effect for those without hit points left, in which any additional damage (including DoT) has a chance of putting you six feet under. By the way, permadeath wants to say hello.Despite the somewhat safety net the ""At Death's Door"" provides by not killing you instanly when your HP hits zero and some other shenanigans you can try to turn the tide in your favor, the game is heavily stacked against you. Many RNG-controlled events are ready to screw you over when you least expect it, and the game is unfair in general for the player, punishing the slightest mistake you make, and not giving you any get-out-of-jail cards at all. The freaking game tells you in the cover: this game is about being put in the absolute worst situation and trying to work your way out. Your favourite heroes will die while you hopelessly witness the result of your own recklessness. You will be slapped in the face, repeately, for no reason. Your hard work will be torn down before your very own eyes.The worst of all is that I absolutely love it. Perhaps I'm simply turning mad.+ The dark story, the gothic hand-drown graphics and the overall stress this game puts you under really all serve its purpose to ilustrate the hopeless situation the game is trying to illustrate.+ The unique battle system and some other features make dungeon exploration an absolute joy.+ Superb OST that will get you on edge.+ Despite your ancestor being, you know, dead, his spirit follows you around and acts as a narrator, of sorts, commenting on your actions. Let me tell you, this guy has some of the most badass lines of dialogue I've listened to, specially in battle. He definetely knows how to pump you up on a tight situation.- It is a very easy game to rage quit on. It's random and unfair nature can very well cause anger on both new and veteran players. Particularly infuriating are the enemy crit-rolling-sprees when your party doesn't seem able to land a ♥♥♥♥ing hit.- The game can get very grindy at times. If you lose your beefy lineup of mains due to stupid mistakes or too many bad rolls, you are pretty much left over with rookies that you have to level up again (with takes time AND precious gold) in order to take a shot again at late-game missions, or even the final boss.This game gets a well-deserved 8 out of 10. I feel like I'm still winning in the wall-head banging contest.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  I think the atmosphere is great, the narrator is a nice touch.  I like the different classes and most of the mechanics, but it's too frustrating for me.  I suppose I should retreat more often to save my characters, but it just feels like I should be able to finish the quest.  I just watched my entire group get killed in the last room of a quest with only one of my characters getting a turn.  If it's going to be a grind like that the entire time, I'll just skip the rest.  I enjoyed the set-up, though.I died alot in FTL, but for some reason getting killed in that game was a whole lot more fun.			"

												if i knew how this game would end up i would have never spend any money on it , back when it was originally released i had a really good time with it , but now its just horrible , so many features that you just cant use after you do a dungeon you barely(sometimes you don't ) have money to remove the stress from you heroes and yet removing a perk costs costs 2500-5000 (fully upgraded)locking in a perk costs    3750-7500 theres the nomad wagon that sells artifacts that you will never be able to buy the blacksmith upgrades get way to expensive at the later levels the guild upgrades start off good but get so expensive its just not worth upgrading 90% of the skillsand lets not even get into the other currencies...the game is so GRINDY when it doesn't need to be the only way to have any meaningful progress is to hire heroes do 1 dungeon with as little supplies as possible and dismiss them after ,its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

												the pros:- looks amazing- awesome theme- great production value- can be played in smal sessions- many different monstersthe cons:- all core mechanics revolve around rng! its all about rolling dice, the bad kind of dice..- its a grind fest! this game is a threadmill if i've ever seen one.- the mechanics are more what you would expect from a mobile game.My opinion: As i already said, this game would be a great mobile game.as it is, it's just a bad pc game.i wanted to like this game so bad, but the constant dice rolling leaves little to no strategic possibilities and it's all the same over and over and over again. What a pity!			"

												It's hard to recommend this game. A lot of the base game elements are pretty fun, but the Random Number Generator...something is seriously wrong with this. It's so easy to enter a dungeon and lose without feeling like you did anything wrong. That's part of the game's theming, but well...for me it's just not fun. It bugs me that I can half♥♥♥♥♥a dungeon and get everything I need one day, then struggle just to survive despite playing fantastically the next.It doesn't help that the game seems a lot more random now than it was in Beta. Now theres a chance of triggering mini-bosses when doing certain things, like inspecting certain items for instance. I found someone called the collector who was, quite frankly, impossible to beat. He healed for 10 damage a turn and the only person in my party that could reach him at the back dealt 9 at most. What's more the rest of the party had to contend with constantly repleshing monsters that he summoned. I think this encounter sums up how I feel about the game - it's not fair. A game doesn't have to be fair to be fun, but this isn't unfair in any way that feels fun to me.			"

												Since I am a massive XCOM fan I assumed I would absolutely love Darkest Dungeon and for the first few hours I did.The combat seemed deep and varied. There are so many character classes such that I have not used them all let alone try all possible permutations of a four adventurer party. Managing your hamlet is just as stressful as combat when deciding where to spend your hard earned resources. I opted to boost the strength of my party by focusing on the guild and blacksmith but every so often I had to throw some resources to help my adventures recover from all the horrors they had seen.It felt like I had a rich game that I was going to lose myself in for days.But after those first few hours I realized that I felt I wasn't making any real progress. Sure I had a few adventures at level two but I wasn't really making enough money to actually upgrade their skills and equipment. I also never seemed to be sending out the same party composition more than once. The stress would be too great or some malady was would afflict an adventure and they would have to miss a week of adventuring while I spent some gold healing them up. The caravan never really seemed to bring me much variety (could I please have more than one Arbalst?) so it forced me to put together so many patchwork party compositions because I just didn't have the ones I wanted to try. Also, every time I came back from a quest I didn't really have enough money to do any major upgrades to my characters such that I felt I was ready for the next challenge.It was at this time that I had realized I had already entered the grind of the game. I had only been doing lvl 1 short quests (either complete every room battle or explore 90% of rooms) and I was already at a point where I felt like I needed to grind for hours to make enough progress to even attempt the first boss of the game.But OK this is a hardcore game right? Maybe I'm just playing it wrong. I set myself a goal of attempting one of the first bosses, the Swine Prince, and I picked out a party that I thought would work well and aimed to get them to level two with level one skills and armor (since my guild or blacksmith was not upgraded enough to get everything to level two). I grinded for four more hours and got exactly what I wanted and equiped my party with the best trinkets I had, provisioned them to the gills and out I went. I explored the dungeon and didn't even need to camp before I scouted the boss's lair. It was at this point where things went completely sideways. I managed to kill the boss but I lost three of my four party members. All of that time and energy was gone without much to show for it. All the gold I got for beating the boss was essentially a moot point because I would need to spend it all again to upgrade new adventurers to have that same level of skill and equipment. With respect to the boss battle I felt like I could have retreated and gone back to the hamlet with my spoils. But I would have to spend a lot of gold to reduce the stress and afflictions they had acrued on the quest so it feels like it would have been a moot point.But again this is a hardcore game! I just gotta git gud! I mean I made progress right? Killing one of those first bosses means something does it not? Let's pick out a second boss and try again. So I picked out the Wizened Hag, put together a team, grinded for two hours to get them where they needed to be (some this time had level two armor because I finally got enough freakin' deeds) and set out into the dungeon. It went every much like the first where I got to the boss without needing to camp and I made my attempt. This time only two of my four adventurers died, although the other two came back with such high stress that they won't ever been quite the same.And so I am back again to where I was before I decided it was time to attempt my first boss. I have a stable of adventurers that are in no shape to make any attempt on the next boss let alone an attempt at a level three dungeon. None of my healers are above level zero since they've all died so I'll need to grind them up again. But I could do it. I could pick a boss, pick a party composition, grind 2-4 more hours doing the level one dungeons and make another attempt. Odds are I'll lose some adventurers again but thats a point of the game. How does a player deal with such great loss? To me though the grind is just far too obvious that it makes it much easier to just put down the mouse and keyboard and walk away. Its far too clear that I'll have to just grind the same dungeons over and over again, kill the same creatures and then go into another boss battle completely blind where I am likely to come away with some heavy losses. And after I kill all four of the starting bosses I'll be essentially in the same position as I was before with the exception of my hamlet being a little more upgraded. But at that point I'll have to do all of this over again for level three dungeons and I think that I need something else to pull me throught his grind.			"

Posted: June 27, 2016
												New Updated review:So after trying the veteran missions, I have found this game to be basically UNPLAYABLE!There is a major obvious flaw in a game when my heroes are causing 3-10 pts of damage after casting debuff spells on the enemy and buffed spells on themselves (using Man-at-arms and Occultist classes), while the enemy can causes critical damage or regular 10-21 pts of damage without using any of that on my heroes.This game is BROKEN at its current state of difficulty balance (if you want to play beyond the Apprentice level missions, but then again there is little reason to even try because Veteran and Champion level missions offer mostly the same enemies but just higher stats. The only reason to try is to see what the Darkest Dungeon levels are like). There are too many things stacked against the player, whether it is:1. Your player can get ♥♥♥♥ed up in so many different ways, whether it is a disease, affliction, or just being stupid enough to gamble away your trinkets during a visit to the tavern (yes happened to me)- There are two ""health-like"" stats for this game in my opinion. The regular health stat and then there is the stress level stat. You will be ♥♥♥♥ed if something happens to either one.2. You only have 16 slots in your inventory so you better be extra careful what to bring for medium to long missions. Don't waste space and money on a useless provision, which can cause you to not stock up on something useful like torches or food!- Also if you want to retreat from a mission, you don't get a full refund on your purchased provisions. So you end up losing the money spent on provisions.3. Everything is so expensive! Armor, skills, provisions, and healing and stress treatments all costs money.- Also some things cost more for higher tier heroes. For example, healing and stress treatments all goes up.So in order to prepare for the higher tier missions and progress the actual game, you must GRIND MORE LOWER TIER MISSIONS to collect enough money and upgrade your heroes.In my opinion:     DON'T BUY THIS GAME!       IT IS NOT FUN!!!      DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE NICE ARTWORK AND APPEAL OF ""A REAL CHALLENGE""!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Old review:I wanted to provide a fair and honest review of this game based on my overall positive experience. Even though, I am only at 40% completion, I feel that I have a pretty good grasp of the game mechanics and what else to expect before reaching the end.Pros:1. Great presentation, unique art/animation style, excellent soundtrack.2. Great use of hero character permanent death to build tension and suspense in combat.3. Unique and varied skill system that includes both offensive, defensive, and camping skills.4. Interesting upgrade system of characters and buildings based on looted gold and other resources. 5. Interesting collection of looted items/relics with both positive and negative perks which forces you to plan carefully and balance out the perks in tune your overall strategy. 6. Unique variety of enemies (based on 5 types of dungeons and 1 ""common"" type found everywhere) with different types of attacks, buffs and debuffs and requiring different strategies.7. Small inventory system (only 16 slots) which may seem like a terrible game flaw but actually poses another exciting challenge for the player in terms of forcing you to have careful resource management (ie. what items to bring into the dungeon and what loot to take with you).Cons:1. Limited variety of enemies/settings which makes combat feel repetitive. There are only 5 dungeons to explore. You will never leave the setting of this one particular manor and town. There are also 3-4 mission types per dungeon (ie. exploring 90% of the dungeon, killing all enemies, questing for 3 particular items, or killing the dungeon boss). However, again all dungeons have these 4 exact types of missions. In terms of enemies, there is one unique enemy group for each dungeon and a common enemy group that can be found throughout all dungeons. Overall, there is only around 30-40 total enemy types, including bosses (which feature about 5-6 types with 3 versions of difficulty). This may seem like alot, but gets boring when you run into the same enemies over and over and can use the same strategy everytime. 2. Annoying glitches where sometimes my screen froze but the music kept going. Luckily (or maybe not) the game uses a hidden, frequent autosave system so I never lost any progress when I was forced to exit the game. Other times, I noticed that the picture for interactive items or action animation would not appear properly and I would see a white box instead. This isn't too much of a problem because if I click on the white box, another pop-up screen will appear with the name of that particular item.3. No real character development or dialogue. I know this isn't a classic RPG game, but more of a dungeon crawler game.  However, you start to not care for your heroes when you don't know their story or thoughts outside of occasional comments in combat. This then negates the suspense and tension that you feel when a character is about to die.Overall:This is a great dungeon crawler-type game requiring a lot of strategy and planning before entering the dungeons. I felt that I was spending up to half the game time preparing for each mission (making sure I have selected the right set of skills, items, and tools for my squad of heroes) and it was worth it when I got my heroes out safe and sound. But after playing for 40+ hours, this game seemed to get repetitive because of limited character development, enemy types, and dungeon settings. A lot of other people have been commenting on the heavy grinding involved in this game and I have to agree. However, I am also the type of person to play very cautiously when there is alot of risk and random chance involved, so that aspect didn't bother me too much.This is a very impressive game from a small company and I would recommend purchasing it when on sale. I hope they make a sequel with more of everything!			"

												No matter how well set up you are, steps of risk management taken, and so on, this game will frustrate you. It is a grinding slog and masochistic climb to do anything with this game. At times, it feels like you're losing progress rather than making any. Coming from someone who loved a game like FTL (Faster Than Light), this is not worth it at all.			"

												A potentially great game stretched too thin for my tastes.I found that there are two challenges to this game; difficulty and the time it takes to get gold.  The former was enjoyably demanding, the latter was a chore.I enjoyed the first 30 hours but after accumulating 7 characters of final tier level I realised that in order for them to meet their full potential and have a good chance of beating the final dungeons they'd need to have afflictions removed, have good equipment and positive traits locked in.  Which takes money, LOTS of money.  Which means repeating dungeons, LOTS of dungeons, to the point of boredom.  I already felt slightly weary with the repetition when entering 30+ hour mark but carried on since I felt the end was in sight.  However, another 10 hours later, when I realised what would be required to complete the game, I felt like I was facing another 40+ hours - mainly grinding at lower level stuff.  It's a shame since there are so many cool things to do with the characters and so many classes to mess around with.   From experimenting with and increasing certain skill sets, to paying to permanently keep certain bonuses they have earned, it's an exciting prospect.  Doing this would really individualise them, add an extra layer of depth and greatly increase the RPG feel of it all but again, this costs money, TONS of money.  Cue even more grinding.Simply put, I feel this could have been a great 40-50 hour game but the constant halt in progress to get obscene amounts of gold to heal, cure and upgrade the roster is so time consuming the game ends up artificially increasing its playtime beyond my interest and desire.  I'm guessing they made this decision in order to 'double down' on the difficulty but I find testing people's patience through grinding isn't a fun form of challenge.Having said all that, if you pick it up cheap and get 30+ hours of enjoyment before repetition sets in then I guess that could be viewed as money well spent....just take into consideration that you won't finish the game in that time frame, beat the bosses nor see your characters and township reach their full potential.  Not even close. Whether that's a deal breaker is, of course, for you to decide.  If it isn't, then have fun :)			"

Early Access Review
								a group of warriors are walking in a Dungeon,the group consists of a Crusader,a Highwayman,a Vestal and a Bounty Hunter.their quest today is to clear out a dungeon in the Warrens,it's supposed to be a medium sized dungeon and it'll take no more than a day to clear it.everything seems to be going according to plan,stress level is low,our group is well equipped and *BAM*......a trap,the Healer is bleeding ""it's ok a bandage will stop the bleeding""they walk a little bit more and they find some books lying round,The Bounty Hunter decides to take a look at one of the books and after a few seconds his stress level goes up like crazy,apparently he's read the most terrifying verse on the planet....nothing serious,a few drinks will wash the stress away after the quest is completedafter walking around countless Hallways and small rooms fighting demonic creatures our group finds itself in front of a large door...someone slowly opens the door,this room is different,it's bigger,darker and colder.there is a large object in the middle of the room,it's really dark so no can see it clearly,The group lights up another torch and decides to walk slowly towards the mysterious object. Crusader was trained to fight in the vanguard so he has taken the lead and acts as the party's Tank,Bounty Hunter is Behind him,scouting the corners to make sure there are no enemies in the room, Highwayman is following the 2 warriors with his pistol and dagger and Vestal is slowly walking behind him,she acts as the healer of this party and  protecting her is one of the party's main priorities.""it's a chest"" says the Crusader.""no it's a trap"" says the Bounty Hunter as 4 unholy creatures appear in front of them,no one knows where they came from but there is no time to discuss that,...yep,that's pretty much how it feels playing Darkest Dungeon,most of the time you don't know what's gonna happen(almost everything is random) and during the fights even one single move can save or kill your entire party.i wanted to write a little bit more about the fights,the town,the stress system and how it can drive your characters crazy and so many other things but i'm really tired right now :| :D""this is more like a first impressions and a fan fiction and is not an actual review,this game has a lot more to offer and i will edit this review in the future""			"

												*some spoilers*I have to say......the negative reviews on this game kept me from buying it for a long time. Despite the fact that I think of myself as being quite good at turn-based strategy and RPGs, the long rants on RNGesus and about how people lost their entire party...that they sunk 20 hours into....from mechanics that they had no control over...in a few turns gave me pause. I first saw this game shortly after it entered 'early access,' but I didn't buy it until a few weeks after it was fully released.Well, now that I have beaten the game with the default settings, including all of the bosses, uninstalled it, and haven't looked at it for a bit, I want to return with, hopefully, a more impartial view. Unfortunately for those who are still complaining, about half of my impression of this game can be summed up with the question:Were those people playing the same game as me?*sigh*Before some enraged noobs start calling me a shill for the developers, let's be frank. This is supposed to be a hard game. It could even be argued that this is supposed to be ""unfair."" You are not supposed to be able to beat it without any characters dying on your first try. If you're going to rage every time a character dies, you better just uninstall right now. If I could really pinpoint what pisses people off here, it's that this game has a treasure trove of non-obvious game mechanics that it brutally punishes you for not fully grasping. Although...the ultimate irony could be that the combination of its difficulty with the asthetics makes me feel like the narrator is actually describing the gamers as much as the characters in some sort of snickering, 4th-wall-breaking trolling. To help explain the disconnect, let me summarize my own experience with the game a little. I didn't look up any tips on this game until about halfway through the campaign. I already had multiple characters at level 6, and I didn't have a single party wipe. Did some of my characters die? Yes, of course. Up to that point, I had about two characters die from the collector on separate occasions. I had about 2 random deaths, 1 character from the shambler, about 3 characters from the Hag, and maybe 2-3 characters from other bosses. I beat the level 2 Hag on my second try. I beat most other level 2 and level 4 bosses on my first try. After multiple failures on the level 4 Hag, I felt frustrated and finally looked up some tips. Basically, I read, ""Don't hit the pot. Just priotize high back rank damage and bleed."" After that, I beat the Hag on my next run with no losses. And, really, in my experience, that's what 95% of the complaints about this game amount to. Again, I'm not saying this game isn't difficult and/or isn't punishing, but people will continuously lament that RNG killed their party when, upon further inquiry, they killed their party. Sure, ""git gud"" has become a cliché, but seriously, some people just need to ""git gud."" People will rage that the collector is impossible when they didn't have any reliable DOT or stun. They'll say, ""Antiquarian sux. What is she even for?"" and ""I can never make enough money."" in the same post. Or, ""The swine king is stupid OP,"" when they killed Wilbur. Or, ""The houndmaster, arbalest, and occultist are all worthless. I typically run: vestal, highwayman, bounty hunter, and crusader in every region."" Or, ""Trinkets are barely even worth it. So, sometimes, I don't even use them."" Seriously, once I had a lot of trinkets, I NEVER went on a run without full trinkets. Even cheap common trinkets are extremely helpful. Is this person playing the same game as me? These aren't hypothetical posts; I've seen all of these at one point or another. You can read most of them right now in the negative reviews. And this is just the tip of the iceberg.To be fair, I do think it took too long to make money before; too much grinding was needed to make up for the loss of a high level character. However, I believe that has been resolved. I completed half of the game before they patched bonus rooms, and I was on the verge of assaulting the Darkest Dungeon before they added antiquarians. Grinding has become a lot more rewarding with the later patches. And additionally, I am indeed the type of person that beats Civilization on the hardest mode by micromanaging all of my workers and explorers. I am a very patient gamer, and I don't rush into things. I actually enjoy studying my party for extended periods of time, pondering whether one party synergy is better than another, checking whether I have reliable stun, guard, heal, DOT, etc. If you're the type of gamer that requires constant adrenaline and jumps into things without thinking, this game will grind you into dust.By the time I finished the game, I could beat any level 1 or lvl 3 dungeon while asleep. I focused on grinding lvl 5 dungeons for money because I could beat any normal lvl 5 dungeon without anyone even reaching 100 stress over 90% of the time. I had one party wipe my entire time playing this game, and it was intentional! I sent a party of noobs into the Darkest Dungeon just to check what it was like and to get the achievements. It doesn't matter if they die because they're free. My first time experiencing a heart attack was in the second Darkest Dungeon, when the game was almost over. You know what goes through my head when I run into the collector? Yay, more loot. I'm sorry. This will sound rude, but if you can't consistently beat any lvl 5 dungeon or the collector without someone dying, you're just bad. If you can't beat most bosses on the first try or at least second try, you need to learn what you did wrong and try again. If you repeatedly experience party wipes and heart attacks, you need to be more open-minded, be more flexible, be patient, and play smarter, because you're just bad. Now, you can make all kinds of excuses. You can say, ""not everyone is as OCD as you, butter,"" and that's true. You can say, ""the amount of effort that it takes to achieve those kinds of results makes the game not fun."" That is a subjective statement, and I don't care. I had fun. Furthermore, do I need to point out the irony of saying you don't enjoy putting in the effort to beat a game that is supposed to be hard?Whatever you think about the RNG and whatever your excuse is, if I replayed this game right now, it would be a piece of cake for me. If you don't share that opinion, you're not as good as I am.So, git gud, son.			"

												I just want to start this review by saying to give a little time dilation for those of you paying attention. I bought my copy of this game waaaaay back when, at the same time as I got Hand of Fate. Tried to play it a couple of times, had a really hard time getting into it. Big part of the reason was how early the game still was back then.Flash foreword to now. I couldn't sleep the night before last so I decided to start playing something on my laptop, thought of this awesome game that I never touch/could seem to get into. 24 hours later, I'm super into it, finally seem to have a good sense of how to play the damn thing. It's really simple once you get a hang on things and not nearly as painful as it used to be. If anything I think the game developers reduced the difficultly just slightly enough to make the game approachable. For those who don't know what the game actually is. You play the son of a man driven to insanity of Eldrich (read Love Craft/ Cuthulu) heights, as he plundered the deep dark arts and catacombs of his own estate. After which he eventually took his own life. Which he leaves as your duty to now finish what he started! Oh goody for you! So how does one go about doing this you ask? Well, he built this Manor on top of a hill behind a city named Hamlet. Here, over various levels, which are handled as hubs that increase in difficulty as the game progresses. You take four of your hired help to crawl through dungeons, fighting terrible beasts of the uncommon variety, pillaging artifacts that help you unlock more abilities for your heroes (and heels) and buildings in town use them as upgrade currency. It's a fun little game. I can see why some people think it's ""too much"" but really, take my word for it, be patient, do what the game tells you to do and you will get the hang of it and boy is it rewarding to get good at this one! Dark Souls still your beating heart, my dear fellow. Graphically I find the game to be gorgeous. It’s not like you need a powerful computer to run it but man it looks so stylish in action, sort of in a, how cool Sin City was the first time you ever saw that film’s style, sort of way.Also, totally worth the 20 dollars through and through, you will not be simply breezing through this one. You’ll get your money worth. I recommend this game to people who like Binding of Isaac, on a couple of levels… I see a lot of negative reviews at like 90 hours in and let me tell you something. In my book, a game that gets you to spend 89 + hours on it before calling it quits must have been doing something right. Right?    I have a copy of StarDew Valley that I put around 65 hours in easy. I randomly stopped playing it one night and haven't felt the need to go back since. Why, you ask? Because, I saw most of what there is to offer, but for a game that only cost me five less then this one, that's a lot of game time. And let me just say this again, part of what makes this game so tense is the fact that unlike Demon/Dark Souls where you might loose an hour here and there, in this game you might lose a character you love forever. I get it. I totally get it. Love hurts. But sometimes it's good to learn how to also let go and let live. I love this game and if you can get over loosing a few (more like a football team by the end, I'd imagine) you'll like it too!			"

												Genuinely surprised at how salty people are over RNG, and how negatively received many positive user reviews are. The only real flaw with the RNG is that you can go hungry several times in the span of minutes, which does not reflect any reason or logic conceivable. Missing several times in a row is possible, getting critical'd over and over is possible, starving after every other battle is not. Despite that, Darkest Dungeon is a better example of coping with stress, death and the inevitable randomness of despair life offers than most games in recent history. People say this game is more fun as an ""experience"" rather than a game with fair rules or challenges, and they're completely right. Darkest Dungeon is unfair in a way to remind you that life is unfair, a trait that most games lack for the sake of defining ""balanced combat engine"" as ""let me beat the game"". Darkest Dungeon is not about winning. Darkest Dungeon is openly and intentionally a stress simulator.The skills this game really tests you at aren't traditional video game skills like timed dodges and attacks, but psychological skills like patience, diligence and mental composure. It's not about a win-state as much as it is about learning how you react to struggle and adversity, and learning to make the best of it. It teaches you the difference between victory and diligence, each one its own virtue and reward. If you can't handle that, go play an easy game like Minecraft or Dark Souls.			"

												The atmosphere in this game is amazing. If you like Lovecraft you'll love this game. Friends I have who don't generally like turn based RPGs still like this game. Combat is fast and action packed. When you press attack you get immediate satisfaction. Skills and heroes are varied and so are bosses (8 bosses + 2 mini bosses + final mission mini bosses and bosses).RNG is utilized to its fullest to make every dungeon potentially dangerous and to keep tension up. You can never feel completely safe and the awesome narrator will remind you of this. A couple of crits in a row can totally tun the battle around, be it to your favour or detriment. In tense fights when your hero gets stresed out but become vigorous rather than afflicted (strong buff rather than severe nerf) you can feel the stress relief yourself.I see a lot of negative reviews focusing on the length of the game calling it a ""grind"". Let me compare it to a soccer game: In those games you can usually change the length of a match and usualy also the number of matches per season to fit different players. You can't do that in this game but you wouldn't call playing matches in a soccer game a ""grind"", after all that's what you bought the game to do.Beating a dungeon takes around 30 min. Beating the final boss (ie completing the game) takes around 60 dungeons. 100% completion (except the 104 weeks achievement) takes around 90 weeks and you have to beat the game once first (to unlock ""new game plus""). Is this too long? It is of course up to personal preference. I think there's plenty of content to justify 30 hours. Heck, I'm still playing it after 150 hours and that's excluding all the time I played during the alpha. Just like in many sports games the management aspect is not very big. It is all about dungeon runs. If you don't like doing dungeon runs you should not buy this game. Some peole continue to go into dungeons even after they have beaten and upgraded everything just for the fun of doing them. About 4% of players have made it to week 104 (104 dungeon runs in a single game).Some people list money management as a negative. I actually think it is a positive. Having a lack of resources adds to the tension and it forces you to take risks. Do you go for that last treasure chest? Do you dare bringing a high stress hero into the dungeon in hopes of removing it for free with hero skills? It of course punishes those who refuse to (or can't) learn money and risk management, but since there is only one difficulty setting you can't satisfy everyone. Some people will find this aspect too easy and some will find it too hard. There's no vac ban for cheating though and you can mod the game to be easier too if you want.			"

Early Access Review
								This 2D turn based RPG is one of the best surprises to come out of early access in a very long time. The fact that it came out already a good game is something of a godsend in the sea of unfinished products that we seem to be getting more and more off lately. Having your heroes and a town you slowly upgrade and bring into their own is a very good feeling, as you always feel like you are doing some amount of good at least.However a game is not without its flaws as the game doesn't really progress all that much, though it takes a heck of a long time to feel it since you need to constantly have the same heroes. Another problem I found is a slight lack of attachment to the heroes, as they may all have their own drives and wants, but... They hardly ever stick around long enough for you to attach to them and soon you become appthetic to their deaths ""Oh well another one for the corpse pile"" And that just shouldn't be in my opinionOverall a lovely game and well worth the money.

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon is a treat. The game itself is great, but the developers are rockstars. Frequent updates, problems quickly addressed, community input is considered but doesn't stop them realizing their vision. So what is that vision?Darkest Dungeon is a game about stress, glory, and adventure. Your goal is to reclaim this manor from the horrors discovered below it. And you will do so with pure management, dungeon diving, and perhaps a few trips to the brothel, pub, church, and asylum. You will care about your adventurers, because only so many will consistently gain good traits. You will care more becasue any worth keeping will need care to have bad traits removed and stress reduced. You will still care about losing bad adventurers because you need every one in a run to have a shot at getting the loot at the end.The game is RNG heavy, and it gets some bad press for it, but don't listen to the whiners, just do your research beforehand to see if it is for you. Any game with rogue-like or rogue-lite elements has RNG elements, and any game with RNG elements is about overcoming adversity. Just keep in mind this isn't a linear game with a carved out path and progression curve. This is a game that will try to kill you(r adventurers,) and you will try to conquer it. Sometimes this can result in a bit of tedium or grind, so don't be afraid to mix up your playstyle.The enemies are varied and fun to deal with. Some are very stressful as they are currently, but again, that's a PART of the fun of a game like this. You will still see the same mobs a lot, but it's like meeting an old friend, the fun sticks because of having to deal with them in different combinations and formations. Also, you can be surprised and have your party shuffled about, and they could be surprised and you get a free turn. So this game likes to encourage mixing things up, experimenting, and at its core, is very much a management game, but still seamlessly blends in dungeon crawling, and rather beautifully at that.The art style is refreshing and fun, for me. I love the aesthetic, and between it and the sounds, it sets the tone well. It's not lavish, it's not hyper-detailed, and it isn't supposed to be. It's supposed to be vague and dark. One thing I can say though, is if the screenshots don't impress you, there's a chance the art will still work its magic on you while playing. The little bit of motion, the way everything ties together, and the feelings associated with trudging through the dungeons personally can add a lot of impact.This game has depth, accessibility, polish, great devs, good art, and great sound. It's a wonderful offering, even with a few shortcomings or the stress of RNG, and I wouldn't be surprised if the devs address that, too.The best part is, while what's there is so well put together, there's still more to come!

												The constant RNG will test your patience, not your skills.The game's presentation is really good and charming in a macabre way. The stress system really keeps immersed in an hostile enviroment of people going mad and unholy monsters lurking in the dark. But when it comes to actually -play- the game a few glaring issues comes up.In order to make the game difficult and ""hardcore"" the developer have turned to cheap tricks which only function is to frustrate the player, not making it enjoyable or rewarding. Granted some of those -can- be turned off but nothing is beign done about the elephant in the room: The RNG system.You will often go in with a completely leveled and geared group, and lose them to weak monsters you shouldn't be losing to. Because all of sudden you are missing the shots and they are spamming critical hits. No warning, no chance to react and you will most likely fail to flee the battle and even if you do, your adventurers will need to recover stress and diseases for a long time. You lose your main characters and now you are stuck with ""the rest"" of your roster in a phase of the game where everything does triple the damage they did at the start. Leveling from scratch in there will be a pain because your adventurers get stressed and needs constant attention. You will eventually recover, sure, but you will not be progressing anytime soon and once you get a new team ready to go, they die again. And again. For reasons outside your control or skills. A dice rolls and you lose, start from scratch once more.Another game that is notoriously hard: Dark Souls. You die a lot but you don't seethe like you would in here, because every death in there is your fault. And you die over and over until you learn how to dodge and poke your way out of the place you're stuck into. That dosen't happen in Darkest Dungeon. There is no learning from your mistakes, no getting good other than in the estate management. You roll the dice until you and your characters are too rich and overpowered to have any challenge anymore. It's not fun.			"

												The cthulhu theming is very strong. It can get repetitive. Very difficult game; plan for an aggresive play style. An update killed my very defensive team building methodology. You must be okay with losing your team and starting over. Try to have enough spare gold when you start a mission so you can fund the next one in case the current mission goes bad and you  find yourself stuck.			"

												I've played alot of good and bad games and usualy never wrote any reviews cause I'm lazy.But, when I write a review it's because the game is awesome or totaly sucks.Never again. What a time waste.I finished the game using a save game backup background program. Cause otherwise it's just too reta.rded.Count 40 to 100 hour to finish the game. 10 hours of fun and the rest is a painfull chore. I've got so bored so i speedran the NG+ with some uber trinkets.I dont have any game presentation. Go read some positive reviews that somebody wrote while having less thant 10 hours of gameplay (sarcasm).So there is my review:Grinding grinding grinding gold and heirlooms ... boring boring boring.At the start you'll be amazed how this game is great but later you'll hate everything about it.Get 4 new chars, send them for quest without supplies (as long as at least one of them survives to bring back the GOLD GOLD GOLD ) then get rid of them. Repeat 100 times. or just hack the gold.If it's not grinding then RNG plus retar.ded logic of devs will get you:When you see the achievements you may already see that there is something wrong with the game. A lot of achievememts are based on you to misirably fail. ""Lose you heroes this way, lose your heroes that way"". Have you lost your mind! I've spend 10 hours grinding gold to build them...wtf.Some of these achievements require some RNG conditions that you may never meet even intentionaly. After restoring or healing, heroes may get a TOWN penalty that won't go away until you complete a run with them. And there is no other way to remove this debuff.Ohh...dungens are tough, here, get some -10 to accurancy,  be useless in battles.At levels 5+ enemies may kill one of yours chars without you been able to react. Enemies may land heavy crits and one shot any of your heroes then any additional hit or blight / bleed will terminate him.Shambles...shambles everywhere. There are some rare curios that may be used to summon these minibosses. BUT you won't need em cause every fuc.king second dungeon will spawn one as a random encounter and ruin your run.Criticals, these damn criticals. It's all good... your heroes will do some then they may take some in their faces. The problem is  a retar.ded additional stress that all yours heros will get. One hero takes some misirable (0-1) damage rolled as crit and becomes 2 (yes TWO) damage and every one gets 1 million of stress.Food consumption is totaly random and you never know when it will happen. When your team need to eat, you have only two choises: feed them or starve them (health and morality penalities). Another major problem is that they may never eat or eat 5 times in a row leaving you with no supplies and pushing your run to a fail.One dungeon run take supposedly several days. Therefore you need provisions, food and torches. Your team consumes torches while walking through a dungeon. Battles  takes no time comparing to the whole exploration because torches dont burnt out. During a battle you heroes may heal and buff themselfs but they can't dot it outside the battle. Moreover, in a battle the game forbids you from keeping stunning or ignoring an enemy while healing and stress releaving. The game will react by sending in reinformcements and blasting you heroes with stress damage.Game has no game over. So if you lose yours high level heroes all you need it's just 15 more hours to train new ones. Why not add a save game you dumb sh.it devs ? I have better things to do or games to play.Conclusion: The game suffers from some major grindfests witch are exponential and also of tons of BS RNG.Play it at your own risk of wasting your time for nothing. Or wait for some major balances or  MODS / hacks			"

												I LOVED this game initially. It was very challenging, but also very fair. Then, when my characters hit Level 5 and 6, I grew to DESPISE the unfairnes of this game.You start by building up some money running Level 3 dungeons with an Antiquarian. You spend that money to ugrade your level 5 and 6 characters. Then you equip them with trinkets, enter the Level 5 dungeon and it goes something like this:Cast a debuff --> Mob resistsAdd a dodge buff to your group --> Doesn't matter, the mobs hit you anywayHave your tank swing at the mob --> MissTreebranch smackdown --> Hit for 40+ right off the bat, first toon on deaths doorBefore you can heal it, it gets hit again with Deathblow by another mob.You try to continue on with just 3, but after the third fight you have to abandon the quest, return to town, and start running Level 3 dungeons again. After about four times of repeating this pattern, I erased the game because it's completely rigged against the player.			"

Imagine my shock to find out they've recently started censoring comments and utilizing review bots...This is an absolute disgrace.  Red Hook should be ashamed of employing these practices, especially given the fact that the game can stand on its own two legs.  It didn't need the ""new Ghostbusters"" treatment where anything dissenting gets immediately censored or discredited.Uninstalling, and with any luck, Red Hook's next endeavor is an absolute tank.

												What a game.After some time of playing this, you just get the feeling like you are being pulled in to a fantasy world, so dark it will haunt your dreams and make you think about it at night. Before we talk about the gameplay, I must add, the Soundtrack of the game is a must for every fantasy freak out there. Tense, well placed and executed perfectly, it is one of the staples of the game... not to mention the gameplay.Gameplay, simple, but yet so complex, it is a gem in the sea of lookalike games.Side scrolling, nothing new, but the amount of detail and calculation required for to go into a dungeon is huge.Also, this game has one little thing everyone thinks is neglectable, and that is perma death.You die, you stay dead, no going back, and that, alone, makes the game a tension bomb.You will die, and you will most likely cry afterwards, due to the fact that you invested time in the characters.All in all, Awesome game. A must have for Dark Fantasy freaks.			"

												After just five hours (the amount of time I put into a game before I decide if I want to continue playing), I can honestly say I'm hooked.I'd say this is the perfect game to binge for a few hours, set aside and revisit once in a while.  Since so much of it is based on luck, to play this like a traditional RPG would be self-defeating and frustrating.  The goal is not to achieve the perfect character build or the perfect team as it's impossible. The goal of the game is to progress as far as you can inspite of that. 40% skill and 60% random things hopefully going your way more than not. Some may say this is flawed design to make a game unnecessarily punishing.  I just choose to treat this like an elaborate game of roulette.  It's fun and addictive because there are no guarantees.  I just try to cover my bases and hope that I go on a good run.Bottomline, treat this for what it is.  It's a game of chance where you're able to control a few elements that may push the the odds slightly in your favour each round.  Treat this like linearly progressing RPG and you'll pull your hair out.			"

												This game would be great if not for the horrific RNG events. The heart attack system can completely ruin a dungeon run and is almost 100% random. I have had 3 runs in a row where all my characters get heart attacks and wipe out in one turn. This game is difficult and is ment to be but the random nature pushes it from being difficult and rewarding based off skill and planning to a constant struggle and hope that the RNG dosnt kick in and ruin your run. If this could be fixed this would be an amazing game.			"

												After just five hours (the amount of time I put into a game before I decide if I want to continue playing), I can honestly say I'm hooked.I'd say this is the perfect game to binge for a few hours, set aside and revisit once in a while.  Since so much of it is based on luck, to play this like a traditional RPG would be self-defeating and frustrating.  The goal is not to achieve the perfect character build or the perfect team as it's impossible. The goal of the game is to progress as far as you can inspite of that. 40% skill and 60% random things hopefully going your way more than not. Some may say this is flawed design to make a game unnecessarily punishing.  I just choose to treat this like an elaborate game of roulette.  It's fun and addictive because there are no guarantees.  I just try to cover my bases and hope that I go on a good run.Bottomline, treat this for what it is.  It's a game of chance where you're able to control a few elements that may push the the odds slightly in your favour each round.  Treat this like linearly progressing RPG and you'll pull your hair out.			"

												I really like the music, the aesthetics, and the world gives me a Diablo-esque grim kind of feel that when done well can be enjoyable. I'll try to keep this short but the stress mechanic needs reworked if I'm to ever enjoy the game. RNG dictates far too much the outcome rather than skill or strategy and it kills any enjoyment for me. I don't want victory handed to me or anything but at least make it feel like it was my fault instead of just bad luck. I understand this game isn't supposed to be played very casually and you're also expected to lose and that's fine. I'm okay with losing if it's my fault and I deserved it but everytime the game starts bending me over it just feels like all my efforts make no real difference.I think there is so much to this game to admire and I'm somewhat conflicted about giving it a thumbs down but if it was simply made to reward skill more than luck it'd be better. I'd suggest making a masochist mode for those who like the stress mechanic as it is whilst people like me can enjoy themselves. You can even call it casual mode or something if it makes the dedicated fans happy, I have nothing to prove to anyone and I feel like I'm missing out on a world and spent money on a game I can't even get through without crossing my fingers and wasting hours doing the same dungeons many times over.

								The game got pretty bad once they added corpses so I stopped playing for a while.As of December 26th I've started replaying and it's now well balanced and fun to play. If you complain about RNG you are just terrible at this game, they fixed every issues I've had such as the long grinding for low level characters and the corpses that took ages to clear. It is worth a buy in my opinion for anyone who likes good rpgs, it's ruthless, you will often lose 1-2 members during a boss fight but it is satisfaying. The only thing I don't like about the game is there should be more customization, for example it would be nice to pick up swords and armor parts to add more depth but I can understand this would then make the game a lot harder to balance properly.There is already a lot of content and with the full release coming up you are looking at around 100-120 hours of gameplay. Don't listen to the autistics cry babies reviews, the game is challenging but fair and a lot of fun.Note : I actually have a lot more gameplay time than it shows since I play it mostly on a computer with no internet connection.

												Darkest Dungeon was a game that came to my attention almost as soon as it came into steam. The concept seemed interesting to me and I indulged in watching a few streams and YouTube videos of the game. Turned off by the early access label I decided to withhold my purchase and buy it some other time. Recently it came to my attention that the game had been ""finished."" I had seen numinous glowing reviews from critics I trust and I was convinced to make the purchase. To me the game looked like Xcom: the RPG with a dark graphic novel H.P. Lovecraft aesthetic. I am a fan of HP's stories and the narrative to me is clearly inspired by 'The statement of Randolph Carter' and of course the classic 'The call of Cthulhu.' I even encountered a rather on the nose reference to HP's work as my rambling arbalest asked my crusader ""have you ever seen a colour out of space?"" Referencing the HP Lovercraft story of the same name. I didn't even have any truck with the controversial ending (that I spoiled for myself, more on that later) it's as hopeless and grim as many a Lovecaftian tale. The visual and sound design are excellent, The character sprites are very graphic novel-ly and well-drawn, the music is well composed and the disheartening ambiance that gets louder the darker the torch gets is a nice atmospheric touch. These well done aspects of the game added to the exclusively positive media i had heard up to that point convinced me to buy the game. While this did not cross my mind when i first made my purchase I now remember a certain youtuber saying something along the lines of 'those people who played for 300 hours and hate it.' This should have sent off warning signs in my head but sadly I did not research enough. I made my purchase and began playing. I did well (I think) initially and had a good time. I only lost 3 party members in 15 hours and I managed to beat 4 bosses and both the encounter bosses. I'm not exactly sure if I did anything wrong or if I was just unlucky but I started lousing, lots. Most of the time I would lose one or two level 3 party members and flee, But then I had my first party wipe, I lost one level 4, three level 5 heroes and some incredibly rare trinkets (including the drop I received of my hard won shambler fight). Up to this point I had played the game akin to the way I play Xcom. I had named each hero after someone I know in real life and had upgraded all my heroes as much as possible in an attempt for them to stop dying. This caused my string of losses to be quite costly both emotionally and financially, I understand that I may have been playing it wrong but the way the game punishes you for losing high level heroes breaks the fun of the game for me. Falling back on my Xcom instincts I started a new save file and started playing that. At this point my friend linked a video showing why he wouldn’t be purchasing the game after I had stated I had a good time with the first 10 to 15 hours and I realised why I would not be revisiting this game until it is significantly patched. The game is SUPER grind focused. Not only that but the core gameplay loop is repetitive. The same missions: scout(search almost all rooms), exterminate(finish all room battles), and an item mission where you must find 3 'curios' and interact with them with 3 provided items repeat over and over. For some reason Red Hook have padded out the game with completely unnecessary repetition and a slow progression system that will set you back HOURS of grinding a replacement hero if you are unlucky and lose even one or 2 party members. Boss fights are repeated 2 more times at harder difficulties for seemingly no reason and the final straw was seeing what was in store for me in the final missions of the game. One your party beats an incredibly hard level in the Darkest Dungeon they will all refuse to ever go there again forcing you to grind even more on easier levels to produce max level and well equipped heroes in order to stand a chance.This revelation I had has killed any desire for me to play the game. I am familiar with challenging games, even ones with RNG tied to them, I beat Xcom on ironman classic. But Darkest Dungeon is not 'challenging'. It's not really. You can’t even lose. It just takes up your time to make it feel like its challenging. If the game was shorter, had more variation in the core gameplay loop and removed unnecessary features like the 'Never Again' mechanic then I may of recommended this game. But in its current unfairly grindy state I do not recommend. Hopefully with the alleged addition of the steam workshop soon someone may just fix the game instead of the devs.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. I gave it a fair trial. The central problem lies with sheer randomness. You simply cannot know when an enemy attack will inflict a massive critical hit, taking one of your heroes from full health to ""death's door"" in a single blow. In my final attempt to send a fully-outfitted expedition to destroy the ""Formless Flesh,"" I encountered a troup of common rogues, the kind I'd fought many times before. This time, a couple of critical hits took my knight and my bounty hunter down to death's door, and a bullwhip multi-strike killed both of them before I could take meaningful action. Random chance of so wide a range is simply not fun in a game.Mind, I like difficult games! For example, I thoroughly enjoyed Alien: Isolation. But there, one dies because one fails to understand the antagonist and anticipate its next move. In Darkest Dungeon, no amount of preparation or strategy will save you from the true enemy -- sheer dumb luck.Additionally, while the bosses (the necromancer, the Formless Flesh, the Swine King, the Hag, and the Ghost Pirates) are all well-conceived and executed, the game demands you fight each no less than four times, making the game repetitive. The campaign long overstays its welcome.The creators have created an involving game, with many fun elements. If they made critical hits far less frequent and less devastating, and trimmed the tedious recycling, I would try this again. But I sadly cannot recommend it in its current state.Addendum: I have now tried many mods in an attempt to rebalance the game. Unfortunately, the latest patch appears to have rendered existing mods obsolete, as most of them now cause the game to crash or lock.			"

								Having played some hours, I cannot recommend this game.The general structure of the game is boring. You go through dungeons, fight very difficult enemies and try to survive. That's the good thing about the game. But in order to keep your strong party alive, you have to use countless cannon fodder gangs to do boring grinding for money and items.This is one of the most repetetive games I've ever played. Not in a good way.Additionally the difficulty is not entirely fair and some mechanics just suck like losing a character outside of a fight from toxic damage.Yes, it looks cool and dark. Yes, the first hours are fun. But this changes very fast...			"

												There's not that many negative reviews, so I'll give it go.  I'll sing some praise first, since the game is ok.  I won't list everything that's good about Darkest Dungeon (DD), but it does have a lot of goodness tucked away inside.  I really love the artistic style, and turn based combat for example.  These two things drew me to DD.  Stress is a gimicky mechanic, I could take or leave.  It works and adds something to the game play, even though there are times I wish it didn't.The real problems for me is game pacing, variety, and length.  I've found that pacing is one of those things that rpg's in general have a poor time getting just right.  DD over complicates it by using five different currencies, and then in a rather miserly fashion not giving them out in any quantity.  To add to the worries, bag space is extremely limited, so even if you find some great hoard you might not profit by it.  Oddly enough, the exp gains might be spot on, but without the other resources your party will quickly be outmatched so there's no way I can tell for sure.  Essentially, you'll be forced to start over at some point and rebuild a team with fewer flaws, and hopefully higher earning potential.The rebuilding of a team isn't bad in itself.  I think it fits the atmosphere the game is going for.  This does lead to problems though.  All of the heroes are rather cookie cutter.  That's not bad presuming that you'll be burning through a lot of expendable characters.  On the downside, there's no reason to be invested in any of them either.  Additionally, every dungeon run is more or less exactly the same.  There are, I don't know, three, four different quest objectives?  Each zone a handful of unique mobs, plus a handful that could appear in any zone.  It leads to dungeon runs where the only objective is to smash and grab while min/maxing the curios and bag space as best you can.  It's too expensive to take stress damage, or risk a negative quirk.  So you find your little strategy, and more or less do the same things in dungeons you could hardly tell apart.If this game clocked in at 20 hours from start to finish, I'd feel better about it.  It's not.  There are eight bosses, each of which requires some number of zone specific dungeon grinds to open, and has to be killed three times, at slightly more difficult levels.  Why?  just because. . . I'm almost through now, and I like the game enough to finish, and possibly restart it, but come on.  Have some respect for my time.  I've also read some spoilers about the ending.  All I can say is for real?DD is a good game mired in poor design.  Everything seems to work, which is a big plus.  Guess it's suppose to be hardcore?  There are times it just feels like a hardbore, or a hardchore.  It's not at all bad, it just isn't that great once you get your teeth into it.Overall, I'd recommend a pass on this one, unless you can get it on sale.  There are some neat things to see, but once you've seen them, you'll see them again and again, and again.			"

								RNG Review, for those that are curious about how heavily the RNG affects the game.You can die outright in the tutorial.You can die in the first two missions because your replacement party members are useless due to RNG selected skills.You could literally not buy this game and just roll dice on D&D tables and get the same experience of gameplay.  Just without the art.======TL;DR for people with reading comprehension problems:It is a nearly finished productIt is not necessarily ready for broad consumption as an early access pieceIt is worth your support if it is a game you would like see reach its full potential.If you are going to support it, be involved with the community and developers, don't just throw money at it.=======AMAZING aesthetic. In its current state, it is a fully finished art piece, which will be regarded as a gem...When the rest of it is finished.The mechanics of the game are fully realized, the systems and etc are fleshed out, functional, and understandable (if not a little obfuscated behind menus in some cases), so that's not necessarily the issue.The problems you will find will relate to the game design and the user experience.  Yes, the game is hard, in ways that you may even find unfair due to randomness, but that's kind of where the fun is, in this reenvisioning of the popular dungeoncrawler idea.  What you'll find is a game that, in many cases, doesn't care whether or not you're having fun, which is a real shame, because the developers clearly care about making it a good game, but in its current state you will be hit, full force, with the sense that they don't, amist an equal amount of force saying they want to make a great product.While I am giving this a negative recommendation, I say this:If you think you would enjoy this game, or this is a game that you would like to see succeed, do buy it.  However, don't just buy the game, but play it and provide good constructive and analytic feedback to the developers about the areas that need it.  This is an early access game, which means it is technically an unfinished product, but while early access is often a variant form of a kickstarter money grab kind of thing, this game is a near complete product, and if it's something you would like, the best thing you can do is support it not only with money, but with the intention to beta test it the way early access is somewhat meant to be for.Do not entertain ideas of fanboy hype and vapid support of various features of the game, because that is only appeal to enthusiasm and emotion.  If you feel something is wrong with the game, take some time to analyze it and understand how it affects the game, how it fails to benefit it, or, maybe, how it actually does its job well, and use these understandings to notice the cracks that need to be filled.  And then communicate them.			"

								PROS:Beautiful Mike Mignola-inspired artAmazing sound and narrationEngaging game designSatisfying gameplay, overallCONS:Random difficulty spikes - difficulty will increase with no warning. Probably to make the game more challenging but ends up just feeling cheap and unfair. Nearly impossible to complete a dungeon without a healer which are hard to come by. 7/10Recommended? Yes, but wait for a sale. When it is fun, its IS FUN but until they fix the random difficulty spikes and under powered healing this game is just an exercize in frustration (and not the good kind).  I understand the point is to drive home the unforgiving nature of this world, but it comes off almost vindictive sometimes.			"

												Not enough good ways to reduce stress in the field. sometimes when a character gets stressed it  makes them refuse healing, attack one of thier own party members or refuse to do an action which seems rather pointless to me in a game design sense. I dont know if this is just me but my characters seem to miss alot for having a 85% accuracy to there main attack skills.The game does have a nice feel and enviroment to it though "

												If you have taken any time to read the reviews on this game you have a pretty good understanding of what to expect. Great atmosphere, character design, story, voice acting, art work, class design, etc. all great ingredients for a fantistic dungeon crawler only to be completely ruined by the combat system. There is no rhyme or reason to the way combat plays out no matter how hard you prepare or grind your characters you end up losing a level 5 character to a level 1 boss because of bad luck. The grind it takes to get that level 5 character back is another issue. The game play is so repetitive that the extreme difficulty it takes to make an inch of progress is not worth repeating the process for hours just to be dissapointed time after time. Altogether a great start but the finished product is just not worth your time. If things could be patched or modded to make it more playable than it might be worth revisiting.			"

								This is violence porn for accountants.Sadly, with the recent patches this games was turned from a difficult game which made you take tough decisions based on a careful risk/return analysis into a masochistic grindfest based on luck. All too often you see your carefully groomed, max-equiped level 5/6 chars killed in a single round of combat. From full health a hit/crit combo takes the character to death's door, leaving a nasty ticking damage on the character killing the character off as soon as his/her turn is up.One has to understand that the death of such a character is an enormous setback because you have to grind a replacement through several lower level dungeon runs. The loss of gold and time is substantial. Basically, most of the time you grind through content you have already done ad nauseam in order to have another shot at a dungeon you actually want to play. And did I mention that the loss of a character early in a fight means that you have to quit the fight leaving all that hard-earned gear behind?This isn't a game anymore. It is an experiment on how much frustration, pain and tedious time sinks people can suffer through in order to MAYBE achieve a particular goal. If that is your jam then by all means come and join the club!			"

I've contacted them three times with no response, The first time a Friday, the second a Saturday and then today(Monday) as I assumed they may not work weekends.

												Asthesitics and tone of the game are well delivered. I tried very hard to like this game but way too much repetition and not enough reward for your efforts. The stress mechanic forces you into what feels like an unending grind fest by doing the same thing over and over again for no other reason then to stretch the game out in duration. It feels like a chore than a challenge.			"

								It would be a good idea BUT:The game wants to be very hard and does so by beeing unfair, some traps for exaple are not visable and will just hit you without any counter option (but luck as in doge)Since the Dungeons are randome (Even boss dungeons) you can either find the boss with all your members at full health or with a near death party.Boss encounters are just frustratingly hard and there is only one difficulty setting. For exapmle the swine prince just perfomres 1 attack which damages the whole party AND STUNNS. SO with a bit of bad luck you just watch him beat you into the dirt without having any option of fighting back.Leveling your group memeber isnt of much use since they can be too high and will then refuse to go on a mission (yes that also counts for bosses)The anouncer has about 4 lines for every event so that gets real dull real fast.There are monsters that can change possisions of your group mebers (pulling/pushing) this sounds nice int theory but just ends up in a frustrating atempt to get the lineup back into something usefull. Monsters themselfes are not bound by lineup so if their mage is pulled into the front row by you it does not matter, if you mage gets pulled into the front.....hes useless.I get that the game wants to be hard and i can respect that, hell i love the SOULS games, but there is a line between hard and unfair.

								This isn't like most dungeon crawlers you've played. Although it shares a lot in common with most ""rogue-like"" games (i.e. death in permanent, life is cheap, dungeons are randomized) it also has a number of unique features that add spice to the game play. There is no resurrect spell, dungeons aren't overflowing with loot, dungeon items can yield unpredictable results, and the character's stress levels are as important as their hit points. Also, it's not a game where you have the straightforward classification of ""tank,healer,thief,mage,"" there's a number of unique classes that combine different aspects of all three classes. For example, Amazonian ""Hellion"" can heal herself, and a properly equipped mage ""Occultist"" can hold his own in front-line combat. It's probably the only game where a lute playing Jester can die of a heart attack from burning books.All this makes for a refreshing twist on the typical dungeon crawler experience, but it takes some time to orient yourself to the game. What initially seems like a brutal game turns into a strategic challenge as you learn the classes, their tactics, and how they all work together. This is not a game that ceases to be a challenge at higher levels, unlike other games where a top-level tank can laugh off most opponents.So, for me, if you are done with the old, tired dungeon crawlers but like the ""rogue-likes,"" then this is this year's game for you. If you are looking for one of those games where your 53rd level Cleric can resurrect a person from a corpse to a fighting machine in the middle of combat without skipping a beat, this is probably not the game for you. It's different, it's challenging, it's fun, you shoudl try it.			"

												I do not recommend this game to others. Like many other games nowadays the games try to use 'difficulty' as an angle to entice players. This game as a result is more tempting because of the morbidity the game contains. Things like the narration and reactions from characters is neat too however that's basically where the enjoyment ends.Welcome to the land of RNJesus. Whether you are a good stratician or not makes little to no difference. The resources you need to upgrade your town and maintain it are dependant on the amount of risk you take in each dungeon visit. The game talks about sacrifice but if you send any of your parties to the dungeon and they are wiped out you get nothing. So it's not a sacrifice at all. For the first 3 visits to the game's dungeon you will find it difficult to barely hold on which at first seems like difficulty but it is actually a balance issue. There are torches and with them lit dungeons are easier however loot becomes scarce and you cannot sustain the cost of having parties go out for you. There is a system that allows you to gain new adventurers at a decent pace but they do not scale with the difficulty of dungeons you need to do without huge amounts of upgrade and even with that upgrade it is chance. It is also chance which new adventurer you get in the system I am talking about.If you are not begging and pleading mentally for an Antiquarian [A character whom's abilities aren't even shown in text anywhere that can allow for mass gains of cash] you will find yourself hitting a wall repeatedly. But that is just the first wall!Once your characters hit Resolve level 2 they will be able to fight 'area bosses' at the apprentice level. Which happens to be most of the starting ones. However if you have a favorite party and use them frequently they will outlevel the requirement and become moody and no longer want to fight the bosses of those areas making leveling up have less value. Then when you do level up areas so that you can do Veteran quests for them, they will be grossly outmatched by most mobs they fight even when they are fully upgraded and outfited. Basically the game is imbalanced and is using horrible statistic gaps to emulate difficulty.People have also said that once you get to late game [pfft] it becomes easy and boring, which only proves what I am saying ot be true. When getting used to how brokenly unbalanced it is the quirky narration loses value and the interaction between your party members becomes interchangeable as other characters will say the exact same thing, again taking the purpose of the dialogue away. So despite it being in beta... I just don't think this is worth. I was enticed by the earlier levels of the game but it takes being hardheaded, not skilled to get anywhere in this game. Which if balance were a thing they understood it would be fun, but since it isn't...			"

								When I fist got this game I found it amazingly fun. I would summerize the game as a rogue like party based dungeon crawl with some city building aspects. This game introduces a stress system that acts as a second bar of life. As the bar raises party memeber resolve is tested and can lead to some nasty effects. When the bar mexes out the character dies from a heart attack. Characters gain stress from going to dungeons and relieve stress through services in the city. Services take take time and force you to leave them behind to recover. I started enjoying this mechanic as it forced me to diversify my party, level up multiple people, and continually experience different class combinations. The dungeons are difficult and various mob and boss fights can easily get our of hand. A lot of the game turn into managment of city service slots, money for services, money for upgrades, money for dungeon supplies (these are important), and character stress.I did really enjoy all the management aspects of the game until I finally was able to start leveling my pary members to level 3. Once a character reaches level 3 they can no longer run level the starter dungeons to help raise other party memebers. This ruined the game for me. The game is difficult and stress can kill characters of any level fairly easily if things get our of hand in an ambush. I did not ming struggling to unlock new tiers of content in the game but being forced to struggle in the lower level dungeons to attempt to level a new party memener to replace a higher level party memeber that died in the higher tier dungeon ruined all the fun I had in the game. Gaining levels in this game did not make a large difference in survival and allowing higher levels characters to shepherd lower level party members through dungeons for no XP gain would not be game breaking. It would not have been much easier but it would at least make the catchup process muchless stressful. The highest unlocked content would have been no easier by allowing this. This restriction just turned the game into an annoyingly grindy and unfun game in what appears to have been an attempt to make the game continually difficult and stressful. I am ok with diffiuclty but I think that it is ok for lower tier content to become easier as you progess the game.			"

								There are plenty of good elements in this game so it is definitely not all bad. Things just turn from interesting into rather stupid quite fast. Your party will suffer from mass hysteria all the time and usually for no good reason. Healing spells only work during combat and not outside combat. Pretty much everything gives a huge dose of stress to your chars and pretty much nothing relieves it in the dungeon. Getting a scratch is an end of the world but getting it all healed up means nothing and so on.You also have to carry a ridiculous amount of torches even for a short trip and any gear that gets left over from your mission is apparently thrown away. Like keys, shovels, bandages and all that. Overall this game has a great concept but in the end the implementation makes no sense at all. Due to the unbelievably erratic nature of the game a manual save system would increase playability. With automatic save system this ridiculous amount of erratic behavior is just *boring*.			"

												I actually dont like the game.Stress damage is just much too dominant. I moved my team through the first dungeons. They where well equiped for the task, No one got low on healt - they just butchered everything.Well exept 1 of them went insane 1 maniac and one - well I forgot. At the end 3 had to take a forced ""vacation"" from wreckig havoc on a bunch of zombies. Maybe they took stress damage from beeingoverequiped?But let's just ignore this. Let's assume, you can live with that. How does the game work (at least to my experience...) What did I do?0. Starting Point1. I crawl dungeons2. Build Fortune, Level, Equipment3. Your heros get Bad Traits, Sicknesses, etc.Here one has 2 options:A.4 Pay the cure / whateverA.5 You are low on money=> Result: GOTO 2 (Money)B.4 Dismiss HeroB.5 You need more heros / higher levels==> Result: GOTO 2 (Heros / Levels)So it all amounts to a grind for either money, hero levels or a mix of both.So yes: The game is def. punishing. But what is the punishment? Well it is you having to grind back up to the point where you where. Cant recommend the game.  Sorry. I really liked the idea.			"

												I'm really torn on whether to recommend this game or not. But for the reasons very well articulated in the top negative reviews, I can't do so in good faith.Which is really too bad. This could be one of my favorite games. I'm not turned off by the difficulty, the RNG, or the  lack of gameplay variety (I'm a big fan of rogue-likes though). It's the grind that makes this game painful to play after the first (awesome) dozen hours. With just a handful of small changes, this could be a phenomenal 30-40 hour game. Instead, it's about an 80 hour game where the last 50 of those are grinding away to level up enough heroes to play the last level and collect enough money and relics to buy upgrades.I checked out some past and current discussions, and the developers do look like good guys that are trying to make the best game that they can. I just don't agree with some of the high level design decisions. That's okay. They've produced a beautiful, smart game that unfortunately overstays its welcome with mechanics that turn it into a grindfest.			"

Beat the tutorial... went onto the first dungeon and lost my entire party. WTF? I miss 2x more than I used to, 20% blight resistance apparently means 85% blight resistance because plague bomb never ♥♥♥♥ing worked, I got hit by crits nonstop leaving my entire party at around 150 stress before they were all killed. ""Screw it"", I thought, ""I'll just load up my original save with like 10 maxed out warriors"". I'm not even kidding right now, I ran into 4 walls in the first 6 halls and I only brought 2 shovels... so right off the bat my stress was high as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Long story about this plunge, short, I lost 3 of them. 3 maxed out legendary warriors that I spent forever with in that game. Why? Am I bad? Well being that when I first played the game, I NEVER lost a single warrior and completed the entire game fairly easily. I'd wager that I'm not bad. So why then?Crits, debuffs, RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, once-useful trinkets are now garbage trinkets. Oh, and I learned something! Apparently, if your party is injured and you try to heal them up so they don't die, the game punishes you!I'll let you guys figure out what it does for yourselves :) It's a hoot!This game is just stupid now. The devs suck. I wish I could just play the game as it was in the past. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is just garbage now. 4/10The 4 points come from art, music, design, etc.the -6 comes from the game being unbalanced and stupid now.Buy it?Nope. Don't reward devs like these with money. It just teaches them that being stupid is rewarding. Let them starve for cash so that they're forced to fix this game to get the income back. Supply and Demand. We demand good games. These guys can't supply one at the moment.			"

Early Access Review
								The art and tone for the game is very appealing, as is the Old School dungeon delving theme. Art direction and story for this game are top notch. What it all boils down to is cool edgy art, great tone, fair story and quality voice acting, on top of a 2d side scrolling dungeon crawl. Sort of like graphic rich side scrolling Rogue - no wait.... huh? Yeah if this was the 80's, this game would have blown my mind. Even as an app this game would be credible. No app yet.      The game is actually...predictable... Every time you enter combat you use your best skill - the first one - to out dmg the enemy (the game is simply about the combats, there is very little else to the game, a little bit of managing another HP counter for ""madness"" which essentially enables the monsters to take down your toons two ways instead of one). Yes its perma-death. But its not. You have a stable of toons to use so they are basicly just foder. At the end of the day gp/gippers/gold/money, is what's going to kill your game and make you restart. That's probably not going to happen if you play in beatstick mode.    On madness: its really just another resource. It acts like even worse hit points. You take madness from attacks and from being in the darkness and other spooky♥♥♥♥♥♥ Only not only do you gain madnes points and eventually die from a heart attack, you get hard to remove character traits along the way. Yes you can have a TPK from madness and heart attacks. so like I said two hit point tracks both of which can kill you.   There is little to no synergy between the character powers. The nuanced powers - bleed, blight, all the fun little tricks, are less effective, than simply using each character's first direct dmg skill. With the possible exception of stun. As a result the game is extremely... predictable..? Pretty but simplistic. Oh and random, its got a survival shtick going on, and the randomness is meant to be something you manage ... but the gameplay feels too random and chaotic. Player agency is apparently very low, UNLESS you just use your beatstick pwr ..in which case ... no actually player agency is very low. What could have been the interesting part of combat, the synergies and combos, are unfortunately lackluster, when compared to outright beatstick powers. Instead as it stands the game could nearly play on autopilot. Beatsticks + Heals wash, rinse, repeat. Go old school!!! Or not ....    The strategic resource management is ham fisted and basic - you have to provision your expedition, and any provisions mysteriously evaporate on successful mission completion, with no return or refund. Its not flavourful, it just looks like a programing error they turned into a ""feature'. There is little in the way of actual real, exploration, logistics or strategy over long term in the game. This would make a fun pen and papper rpg, or maybe a smart phone app. as a PC app its lackluster.			"

												This game gives the illusion of being hard through unforgiving RNGs.The game has a great atmosphere and feels special in that regard, but to enjoy it to its full extent you need to be...lucky.You can finish missions without a scratch with new characters with default equipment as easily as you can fail horribly the same missions with hard-boiled badasses armed to the teeth and trained with min-maxed abilities.Combats are just a series of hits traded between two teams. Most will seem even untill one side misses or the other crits, and just like that your fate is sealed.It's a shame really, there are tons of varied classes with dozens of different abilities but all of them seem so meaningless when each fight is played with the flip of a dice.

								I've played this game some time ago when it was just released. TONS OF FUN, my friends! Yeah, it was hard, frustrating, but undeniably fun. I remember I was sucessful in some quests, but eventually lost almost all members of my party because I was too bold in my ambitions. Still super fun. I felt I was about to play a masterpiece once the game is finished. Then, I stopped playing (no time to play games for a while). Now I came back and started a new campaign. I tried to finish the first mission 6 times. 6 times.SIX F*CKING TIMES. And everybody died (or I abandoned the quest, but your gold will vanish very quickly and you won't be able to embark without provisions).It's just unplayable. Now, I do realize that there are people who like to spend 600 hours losing in a super mothaf*cka hardcore game, study every aspect of the game, try 10000 different builds, record his own progress to analyze for mistakes and whatnot, but for me I just want to have fun. I like RPGs, I like the main idea of the game; it was ""frustrably"" fun in the beginning, but with the new patches it become impossible and boring. Let's see if it will get better in the future. Atm I can't recommend it.			"

												Madness takes digital form in your quest to grind your brains out in Darkest Dungeon. On the surface, you will find elements of city management, a complex party system that requires you to balance not only classes but their post-spelunking ailments and illnesses, multiple tilesets with a variety of bosses that require different strategies, and a bevy of trinkets and baubles with equally weighted good and bad stats. All these elements (despite the RNG) combine into an enjoyable experience for the first dozen or so hours.All this is fun and games until you clear the first boss for each dungeon and the problems with randomness and luck really show their ugly faces. RNG holds every gameplay aspect of DD in it's iron grip; from miserable combat accuracy (for both you and the enemy), interacting with curios, suffering from permanent debuffs, and even being able to run from battle are all randomized. I love board & card games so I'm used to rolling dice and suffering for it but when the entire game is determined by luck it gets infuriating. Imagine playing Monopoly: you land on an unowned property only to have to roll dice to determine if you can buy it, roll again to determine if you can put a house on it, and then your opponents get to roll when they land on it to determine if they have to pay you. Every step is a roll of the dice (not even counting traps) with your characters gaining stress randomly while walking and sometimes forcing you to interact with obviously bad curios because of a permanent trait they have. Of course, RNG can always be brute forced because this is a video game and anyone who has played an RPG before knows how to brute force any kind of difficulty: grinding. In order to beat anything above the first tier of bosses, you are expected to have the best gear possible on all your characters in order for them to survive. With a max roster size of 28, characters running away or suffering from multiple crippling ailments, and permadeath (because why not?), you're looking at spending several hours grinding ""easy"" dungeons in the hope of bringing back some cash without your party suffering from any more permanent debuffs or dying. Near the end of the game, losing a max level key party member can spell the end of your progression and send you back to the grind mines. Since launch, they added the ability to upgrade your recruiter to occasionally bring you higher level recruits, but this also requires grinding up multiple buildings just to have the chance at buying non-unleveled heroes.These are all complaints about how the game was ""meant"" to be playing though. Through the options menu you can choose to mitigate some of the RNG but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Most of the miserable elements above aren't covered in the menu and removing & replacing them would completely change the game. I don't hate the individual elements that bring this game down but when combined it just feels like Darkest Dungeon despises the player and is actively trying to stop you from playing it. I'm sure the devs thought this was some kind of clever meta-torture based on the Lovecraftian horrors you run into but I didn't find it amusing. There will be a small, masochistic audience that will sink their teeth into this and grind it for hundreds of hours (only 1.3% of the people who have bought it on Steam have beaten it, including SAM users) but for the average person I would not recommend it.

												TL;DR I imagine Darkest Dungeon is Dark Souls the RPG.Man, this game is not meant for me. I don't know how people like TotalBiscet or NorthernLion make it look so fun. Maybe it's because I'm not the one playing. Maybe it is because they make it look easy. I don't know.I just start a game and I'm already having a salty time. Getting constistently hit by crits and consistently missing attacks makes combat feel very unnatural, despite the fact you're combating supernatural beings but that is not the point. It doesn't feel like I'm being slowly whittled down bit by bit like a #2 pencil in a hand-cranked sharpener, but more like I'm a #2 pencil being snapped in half for funsies.I feel no sense of escalation. Like instead of throwing monster fodder at me at the beginning like most RPGs do, it's more like every fight is a mini-boss, which means that one team of skeletons at the beginning of a mission will end you if RNGesus doesn't particularly like you that day. I can't settle in on one save file because I can't trust the game on anything, like gambling since my luck is about as reliable as getting kicked in the groin. I know there are options in the setting menu that will decrease the risk, but I'm afraid that will decrease the authenticity of the experience of what the game is suppose to provide. Which is a delema to me. Do I want to enjoy PLAYING the game, or enjoy playing the GAME? I'll probably just leave it in my Steam library and leave it alone ad infinium.Darkest Dungeon is a game about making the best out of a bad situation. But if the best I can make out of a bad situation is effectively nothing (poor roster selection, essentially no gold, bad luck with RNG) or worse, what is the point in trying?			"

I am a huge fan of turn based combat and DD has brought something super unique. The main thing that brought me to the game was the art style.. ITS JUST AWESOME. The second I started playing I felt like I was on my way to kill andariel from D2, the gruesome and dark nature is just so cool. The game has some of the coolest mechanics too, its super fresh. The designers are VERY creative and VERY good at making it work. Nothing in the game feels reused, or 'taken from another game'. DD is truely one of a kind and if your a fan of the three things stated above, DD will not let you down. "

								I really, really wanted to like this game. Really. In theory it sounds great: a combination of Cthulhu with heroes/anti-heroes, a dungeon crawl and RPG elements. The problem is the game is SO weighted against you that it ceases being fun. If your party isn't wiped out first, chances are really good after a couple of missions your ""primary"" characters will be useless due to their stress and negative quirks and you constantly have to start missions with Level 0 characters. There are mechanics for you to reduce stress and remove quirks but it is so expensive to do so it renders the option useless.I understand this used to be a fun game to play before a recent patch that tilted the odds to ""unfair"" against the players. I did not get a chance to experience this ""fun"" version. I can only hope the devs recognize they are frustrating their player base that they will clean this up. There's a good game lurking beneath the surface. In the meantime, Fallout 4 awaits and is much more worthy of my time than this game in its present state.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a dungeon crawler in which you must grind to survive. The game sells itself on the fact that heroes will die and that you won't always finish quests. Fine.However, what you notice is that this makes the game into a grind fest. Expeditions cost quite a bit of money, especially due to the harshness of some of the combat and any attempt you can make to make up for that. This means that, without the quest reward, you're going to be looking at a net loss if you decide to retreat, even if you grab a fair amount of loot. It also means your heroes will gain no XP from the expedition, which is the means for upgrading them to complete more difficult missions. The difficulty to obtain money and heirlooms required for upgrades, coupled with the lack of rewards (even most items have fairly harsh negatives) and potential loss of a high leveled character (which is more common in higher dungeon levels), makes for a game that can easily stall and leave you grinding in lower level dungeons. This makes for a rather dull, gameplay wise, and repetitive experience.The upsides are that the combat is fairly interesting when attempting to make synergies between characters, the world seems to have depth in terms of character development, and the game mechanics are fairly unique. However, the synergies between the characters don't seem to be particularly interesting or impactful, character development quickly washes away when you have 16+ different expendable heroes/weirdos, and any trait can be quickly swapped out for another, since characters get a trait on almost every adventure (the swapping mechanic is new, though, at the time of this review). I would maintain that the game mechanics remain unique with little qualifications in these regards.The gameplay isn't the worst part, though, and it would probably be tolerable if the aesthetic and world weren't so atrocious. If I were to describe the feeling the game was trying to impart upon the player, it would be ""hysterical panic."" I don't know about anyone else, but that is probably the single worst attitude to attempt to get a person playing a video game to feel. Panic is bad in and of itself, but the hysterics the game attempts to impart upon you make it intolerable. I had to mute the music because it was mind-numbingly obnoxious. All so the creators can impart some cheap, shallow interpretation of H.P. Lovecraft (the mentally-deranged racist that so many gamers have taken a strange liking to). I would say that the visual art design is well done. The characters look interesting and the world looks unique and well crafted. It really gives you a sense that you're living in a world, and I would say the game's attempt to give you that sense of living in a world is well done. However, a game is much more than that and my interest in the world quickly faded once I actually engaged the game mechanics and started hearing the horrible music.Darkest Dungeons is a game that had some promise, but the grinding required to play it and lack of reward coupled with the sense of hysterical panic it attempts to impart, and does a good job imparting, make it not worth playing.

												This will probably be the best game you don't want to play. Honestly, I love the game, I love the atmosphere, the artwork.. but, the game yearns to be difficult. The difficulty of this game isn't based on skill or knowledge or preparedness. It wants to be difficult and brutal so bad that it cheats. The stress system makes what normally would be minor enemies potentially the most devastating in the game. Enemies will crit you and you will miss and there's nothing you could have done differently. Your healers might kill you and all you did was try to heal yourself. Long story short: Good game, marred by developers who wanted to make a ""hard"" game a little too badly.			"

												Rushed the game a bit to get a feel.  I enjoy hard games, but ones that are difficult for the right reasons.  This is not one of them.  The game is a great concept that falls flat in my opinion.  Getting to the point where you can attempt the darkest dungeon, you will probably have 2 or 3 leveled teams.  Finish the darkest dungeon level with them? guess what... you're starting over from scratch because you can't go back there with the same characters!  The game creates a progression wall where you have to spend days leveling up a new team each time you want to attempt this dungeon.  That's artificial difficulty by adding time.  That's wrong, and the publisher should feel bad about it.  Art is great, story is a bit all over the place, combat is interesting.  I like the pieces of the game, but when it boils down to it, the fake artificial difficulty added into the already difficult game just turns it into an annoyance instead of fun.  Can't recommend that.			"

Thanks to a savage RNG system, permadeath and no effective way to strategically ""level up"" your new heroes, level 0 and 1 dungeons feel next to impossible to complete.  Going broke in week 5 while littering a graveyard with heroes as you ""learn"" the game through the extremely vague tutorial system is not the way to endear new gamers to the title.  Beginning the game in this way doesn't immerse me into the story or make me want to get better at the game (as there seems to be no real, strategic way to do this) it just makes me want to punch the monitor.Very disappointing.

												This game is infuriating.  In other games with similar management you get a bit of leway and aren't riding by the seat of your pants 24/7.  The odds are always stacked against you and if there's even a small chance something bad will happen,  it will.  What will usually followi s that one event will probaly kill your entire party.   You can spend hours playing this game, and wih one toss of the dice  your entire party wipes and you have to start from scratch, since there's no way to recover reasonably anywhere other than early game. This is because it autosaves your pogress,  so it's possible to completely fail the game and have to start from the begining.  It's not a difficulty setting,  it's how the game is supposed to be played.   For example,  my veteran team managed to kill a fairly hard boss,  while on the trek to a neighboring room  my party chain died of heart attafcks.  My first attempt at a boss in my first save game ended with a party wipe too in which i had to start the game from scratch,  an ""easy boss"" did enough damage to kill my entire party in one hit despite the boss being marked for my level,  although I was NOT ALLOWED to take my strongest party memeber along because he was somehow not challenged. There's a lot wrong with this game, another BIG problem with it being the RNG. The rng is absolutely batshit insane and not worth your time to fight against.  Buying trinkets and upgrading your party would help things along, but ultimately isn't worth your time,  nor is it viable. The reason being, it takes an obscene amount of items to lupgrade your crafters. Any trinkets that  might've helped you eek out some progress will run you your entire stockpile of money.  About the only manageable thing is , ironically,  stress relief......when that jackass caretaker isn't taking up the only spot you need. You're in a constant state of being stuck because you can't upgrade your team because you lack materials,  but you can't get the materials because they're locked in a dungeon that you can't beat because you're weak.  The rng also contributes to ANOTHER unfair and blatantly stupid mechanic,  party hunger.  You can be treking througha  dungeon,  and have fed all your team mates, but you'll get a prompt that'll tell you your team is hungry.   But since you've just fed them,  you sometimes won't be able to feed them all again,  which will result in your ENTIRE PARTY taking 20% damage from hunger despite having eaten just moments before.  Taking this much health and stress damage  usually leads to one or more of your party having  a heart attack.  Aside from all those issues,  the narrator  and music is repetitive.  While the music and dialogue is great,  there's barely more than one track you ever hear,  and after killing a few hoardes of enemies you've heaard nearly every line the voice actor has to say aside from story realted stuff.   It's as grating as the game itself.If you're looking for a decent turn based look elsewhere.  This game needed some more polish,  and a lot more testing befoer it got released.  As is it's just an aggravating mess of a game that could've been a winner.   Maybe they'll fix it with the second game, but this one'll make you wanna taear your hair out.			"

												I can not recommend buying this game. I really want to love this game, but I can't suggest to anyone to buy it with a clear heart. First lets give points where it's due, then I will talk about the shortcomings. Positive points : -very atmospheric (great narrating voice and music)-the art style is fantastic-the story is interesting-town events really add to the game-real sense of loss and/or accomplishment after missions Negative points : -horribly unbalanced gameplaySeemingly the positives are overwhelming the negatives, but anyone who ever played a dungeon crawler or rogue-like knows how important balance is. Here I am not talking as someone who dislikes hardcore games, it is not simple whining about the game difficulty. My concern is the lack of options the player is given to combat the challenges the game sets for us. The character skills and identities are just lacking. An example : : you have a single character (the jester) who can manadge stress level of the party, making them camp and preparing a feast using all your time on stress relief is far from enough, even with the torch lit bright you have no real way of combating the problem. Even striking 3 critical strikes will only give the benefit of a single one, so you can not even depend on luck)Stress level is just one, the party lockout (a leper refusing to serve with a moster, because reasons) and level capping are ridiculous concepts, not to mention you MUST bring 4 people at any time, forcing you to keep at least 4 people of every level in your roster, and if you overlevel 2 of them your party just broke up and you can not use half of it until you somehow level the remainng guys up with a makeshift party.Forcing players to lose with setting impossible goals and forcing them to try and complete them is not a hardcore game, it is just lazy design. Real challenges can be solved, even if you ahve to spend a lot of time on them. If no sollution os presented it is not a challenge, it is a timewaster.Until the horrondous balance gets fixed in a way, turning the game into a real hardcore game from the current state, I can not wholeheartedly suggest this game to anyone. That is why it gets a downvote from me.			"

												Had fun at first, the combat, animation and the narration is very cool. However after 13-14 hours you start seeing how unfair this game is against the player. Sometimes there is nothing you can do to escape death. Sometimes you can't heal the character who is at Death's Door because all your party is mixed up randomly or a character which has 110% Trap Disarm chance can't disarm it and gets a disease. If you enjoy despair, buy it; if not, don't.			"

												I know the game is supposed to be brutal but you are at the complete mercy of the RNG.  Once you get to the harder parts of the game there is very little fun.  I felt where I did win through it was usually more luck than judgment and other times when I thought I had set up perfectly I was completely smashed with multiple crits and characters constantly failing their resists.  Also it is no fun watching the bosses get three gos in a row smashing your party to pieces.  It's a shame really as the game started so well with the odd death here and there.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a dungeon crawler in which you must grind to survive. The game sells itself on the fact that heroes will die and that you won't always finish quests. Fine.However, what you notice is that this makes the game into a grind fest. Expeditions cost quite a bit of money, especially due to the harshness of some of the combat and any attempt you can make to make up for that. This means that, without the quest reward, you're going to be looking at a net loss if you decide to retreat, even if you grab a fair amount of loot. It also means your heroes will gain no XP from the expedition, which is the means for upgrading them to complete more difficult missions. The difficulty to obtain money and heirlooms required for upgrades, coupled with the lack of rewards (even most items have fairly harsh negatives) and potential loss of a high leveled character (which is more common in higher dungeon levels), makes for a game that can easily stall and leave you grinding in lower level dungeons. This makes for a rather dull, gameplay wise, and repetitive experience.The upsides are that the combat is fairly interesting when attempting to make synergies between characters, the world seems to have depth in terms of character development, and the game mechanics are fairly unique. However, the synergies between the characters don't seem to be particularly interesting or impactful, character development quickly washes away when you have 16+ different expendable heroes/weirdos, and any trait can be quickly swapped out for another, since characters get a trait on almost every adventure (the swapping mechanic is new, though, at the time of this review). I would maintain that the game mechanics remain unique with little qualifications in these regards.The gameplay isn't the worst part, though, and it would probably be tolerable if the aesthetic and world weren't so atrocious. If I were to describe the feeling the game was trying to impart upon the player, it would be ""hysterical panic."" I don't know about anyone else, but that is probably the single worst attitude to attempt to get a person playing a video game to feel. Panic is bad in and of itself, but the hysterics the game attempts to impart upon you make it intolerable. I had to mute the music because it was mind-numbingly obnoxious. All so the creators can impart some cheap, shallow interpretation of H.P. Lovecraft (the mentally-deranged racist that so many gamers have taken a strange liking to). I would say that the visual art design is well done. The characters look interesting and the world looks unique and well crafted. It really gives you a sense that you're living in a world, and I would say the game's attempt to give you that sense of living in a world is well done. However, a game is much more than that and my interest in the world quickly faded once I actually engaged the game mechanics and started hearing the horrible music.Darkest Dungeons is a game that had some promise, but the grinding required to play it and lack of reward coupled with the sense of hysterical panic it attempts to impart, and does a good job imparting, make it not worth playing.

												::tldr:: (Full Review below)IMO, great idea that wasn't quite executed correctly. With great challenge should come great reward. This quickly becomes not fun because there is tons of challenge but no reward. 6/10. If they could find a way to keep it challenging but tweak it some this game would easily be a 10/10 in this price category.::tldr::First of all, let me say, I couldn't wait to buy this game. It's one of the reasons I decided to get back into PC world and build this computer. I'm no stranger to long, tough games. I love a challenge! I was hoping to add this to my list of favorites along with the Civ series, the Dark Souls series, Evil Within (Nightmare difficulty), Everquest (back in the day), and a few others. I also enjoy rogue like games such as the Binding of Isaac and Hand of Fate.Overall I love the whole concept and gameplay of DD. I'm okay it's grindy, rogue like/luck based, and just downright mean at times. What I have come to find is it just doesn't feel rewarding. I'm okay getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me, like in Dark Souls, but if you improve your game play in DD you are actually punished. If you do too well with your heroes you will end up fighting tough enemies with weak weapons/armor. So you'll end up just tossing your mentally damaged hardwork on the next wagon out of town and starting over. Theres no way around it. I get the feeling you're suppose to play the game in a specific way (ie Spending resources on specific buildings in a specific order) or you will hit huge roadblocks. I guess you could consider what to upgrade a mini game in it's self with a winning way and a losing way. There's no play your own style.Ends up just not being fun. I'm a person that HATES to not finish a game. I've finished plenty of games that I didn't like, but unfortunately DD is going to be on a very short list of games I just cant muster the will power to finish... maybe. I'm going to revisit it later on. Again this is all my opinion, 17 hours worth.			"

												Its disappointing that after re-visiting this game after so long it has only been patched and updated with more non-sensical and RNG based punishments for players. The classes are still largely unbalanced, even more time and money is now required to purge the endless stream of new diseases and debuffs, and trinkets are either net positive or net negative making only a select few worth anything. Near constant attacks to your moral and severe and often permanent punishments for looting anything in the level put me off experimenting in the game extremely quickely, including trying the new classes. The investment of time to train new units up from 0-2 is boring and unrewarding, and it's often easier to simply dismiss new units and recruit fresh untainted ones. To succeed I had to run the same team, use the same ability combinations and ignore as many RNG based elements as possible to avoid a majority of the games 'difficulty'. Even for a roguelike Darket Dungeon likes taking control away from the player way too often.I'd hoped more skill and squad composition mechanics would be explored as the game progressed, maybe even some relief from the frustrating requirment of destressing and purging abilities after almost every single run. While I understand this title is invested in being as crushingly hard as possible, many of the mechanics come across as merely stalling for time and forcing players to repeat low level areas. "

I've tried at least 3 differnet methods of fixing this, such as verifying game files, reinstalling it, going into the files of the game and configuring them, but none of these methods work.I was really thrilled to finally play this game as it was on sale, but was sadly let down by a huge bug in the game that totally ruins a potentially great game. A lot of other people have also had this issue from what I can see on forums and they have said many different things on how to fix the bug.Would recommend if you can be lucky enough to be able to start it up.

												Game starts out like a difficult RPG but quickly devolves into a resource management sim similar to a Facebook game like Farmville or Vampire Town. The reason for this is the much-too-punishing RNG over which the player has little control and there is simply no strategy to overcome. Because a single surprise attack can instantly destroy any character in your party, the only sensible way to proceed is to avoid taking any extra risks whatsoever. In the language of this game, this means sending out parties of throwaway characters and deleting them.The game advertises itself as ""difficult"" but a better explanation is that it is ""grindy,"" and the player forced into the role of an HR manager of a fast food restaurant where employees quit at random. Doubling down on the resource Facebook-game aspect of DD, the game forces the player to ""gamble"" prior to each mission and expend money on tools. This aspect of the game feels like a money trough. Overall, game has some nice graphics and some promising features, but feels more like managing a Wendy's restaurant than a horror RPG.			"

								Pretty standard, generic RPG.  The stress system doesn't add enough to the game to make it worthwhile.  Battles are bland and uninteresting.  The only part I liked about this game was the variety of recruitable characters, and managing said characters' equipment and skills.  That only gets you so far, though, when every fight feels the same.  The game's still in early access as of this post, but the problems here are conceptual; no amount of tweaking and adding will save this game from mediocrity.			"

Would be nice if there was a difficulty setting.  Beside the difficutly there is very limited choices to make with your party. You can only have two items equiped, skills are linear and most class have very similar abilities.

												I really wanted to like this game. The graphics are amazing, the idea behind it is fresh and interesting, but sadly I cannot reccomend it. o) It becomes repetative fast, mostly because it is very punishing. You have no time to get attached to any of the characters because they'll die anyway, and every character is simply their class. Meaning if your one healer dies you probably have 2 others, that look the same except for maybe a different colour scheme and you might have to unlock one of the skills you prefer using. o)The AI is too smart. While I appreciate enemies that actually fight smart, it's a bit frustrating when they constantly and effectively kill your characters. When your characters all have about the same health they will spread outt heir attacks but as soon as one of your characters health gets too low they will usually gang up on this character and attack them until they're dead.o) Because it's so punishing you almost never get to finish a quest. I still only went to the apprentice levels, I had leveld up party members, and still I had to retreat a lot because either half of them died, were so stressed out that they were about to have a heart attack, or it was clear I wasn't going to finish it. And to make it clear, I'm not complaining about the fact that this game is difficult, what I dislike is that I feel it is difficult just for the sake of being difficult. Bloodborn is also difficult, but there are no random elements to it. You have to figure out how to get past certain enemies, how to kill them etc. Dark Dungeons has too many randomized events which makes it impossible to truly learn what to do. Especially when half of the party that you needed for that strategy just died. I would consider changing this review and recommending that if the AI was a bit more balanced.			"

Posted: November 12, 2016
												Darkest Dungeon is not an experience I would ever think of myself describing it as being as therapeutic as it is enjoyable and demoralizing. This is said from someone who gets too paranoid when playing horror games and deals with anxiety issues, and I have come away feeling more at ease when playing than I ever thought I would.For the longest time, a lot of the things I had heard kept me from DD. The ""grind"", the artificial difficulty spikes (""Never Again""), and various aspects of it being a rouge-like experience kept me unconvinced until I saw a steep enough sale. Now that I've put 23 hours into my first 52 weeks, I think if you know a few things about DD you will find a game that doesn't suffer from its repetition and that justifies its infamous difficulty.In many ways, if I were to recommend this game to a specific audience I would suggest it to people who want to understand/get-into difficult games (like XCOM) but who also don't like the idea of failure-states after 15+ hours into a game. You cannot fail DD at any point in the normal mode—NG+ adds a time-limit of 90 weeks and a character death quota of 13. Games like these understand its shortcomings from RNG, so to alleviate the pressure the developers provide you with many ways to live with your mistakes. The only way you will lose to this game—excluding NG+ modifiers—is if you give up or constantly make bad judgment calls. No other game that uses RNG has ever made me feel as responsible for my errors. The inevitability of screwing up will happen, but you'll learn to deal with it to finish the game. In many ways, DD teaches you how to deal with issues one catastrophe at a time.Not Your Common Rogue-LikeOf all the rouge-likes/lites out there, this one is my favorite design. In most cases, the presence of RNG ruins these games into being more reliant on luck than actual skill/knowledge, and the repetition of doing all the previous content over-and-over will tire you out from ever succeeding. DD, however, mitigates these problems in various ways. For one, the RNG here is tastefully applied to heighten the tension in and out of combat. Unlike the 99% of other rogue-likes, you do not fail the whole game from one encounter; your progression is kept at the Hamlet. Human lives are a free, expendable commodity never in short-supply—something you can exploit for min-maxing. You may dismiss party members because they're too expensive to ""repair"" or you can deal with their quirks, which are never game-breaking or are impossible to remove. (The exception being ""Never Again."")Another difference is how the gameplay prevents you from screwing up from one turn. One example is the ""At Death's Door"" (0 HP)  mechanic where you can take an additional hit(s) before your character dies. The percentage chance to resist death is given to you, and you can avoid this mistake by either moving him/her out of harm's way or use skills that protect, heal (for 1 HP minimum) or other tactics to draw attention away from the character. You can always flee-battles (which counts as exploring a room) and abandon quests to save your party and return with the loot you have. Stress-management, a vital thing to master, can easily be handled with a ""stress-healer"" when in dungeons or by careful management of your whole party roster at the Hamlet. And because death is permanent, you should never have one A-Team, B-Team, etc. but a selection of skilled adventurers with various synergies available to you. The infamous  ""Never Again"" quirk shouldn't ruin the game because the whole experience is about making the best with what you are given, so you have to learn to be flexible.In many ways, the tactics DD teaches you is similar to card games where you have to know when to bluff to risk the odds and when to fold and take your winnings. Even if you abandon a quest, you will most likely earn enough gold to be a net-gain. The difference between both games is that winning at DD is inevitable, only that the time required to finish it is based on how eager you are to challenge the odds.The Developers' Divine ComedyDifficulty is something of a double-edge sword. If the game is too demanding of the player, the player becomes apathetic of success though s/he may find the success more rewarding; if the game is too easy, it becomes a slog to replay tedious content but beatable. I want to say that DD finds the happy medium in its ""safety-net"" grind, but I don't think every player would agree that it's flawless.As previously mentioned, the game lacks a final fail-state outcome where you have to start over until you beat the game once. The fail-state, at this point, is tolerable because you will have to understand the mechanics and how the game wants you to play it in order to win. The only way that the game keeps you engaged from this system is if the game keeps its punishments as an ever-looming threat from the tediousness of doing the same five mission types (Clear X rooms, Find 3 X, Restore 3 X, Slay X Boss and Darkest Dungeons.)The difficulty reinforces the developers' intentions for you to play the game as they wanted you to play it, which hasn't always agreed with its Early Access community.Based off my experiences, I see nothing wrong with all the changes. Corpses add a risk/reward to using skills that may destroy the body (and loot); heart-attacks emphasize the penalty of not managing stress or taking too long in battle; the reinforcement addition discourages stun-locking enemies to heal the party entirely in battle (you can't use skills outside of combat)—this last mechanic I've never seen happen to me, so it's not too demanding.  All of these changes were made to cut out the cheap tactics and make the experience more risk/rewarding, which I am personally fine with as the game feels designed for these changes. However, I still wonder why they took away the option to add/remove these additions.All of these elements contribute to the game staying interesting from a 35 - 40 hour playtime (average for a 90 week playthrough for NG+) in spite of its limited content variety. The three-tiered layout of the entire game (Lv 1, Lv 3, and Lv 5) areas help foster a sense of scaling difficulty for the Lv 6 Darkest Dungeons (4 of them). Lastly, the other updated changes like transferring heirlooms for one-another helps cut down on the grindier aspects of the game.The problem, however, is if you are a completionist or too conservative of a player, which may make the game take 70+ hours. In that regard, there is not enough variety to keep the game compelling for that length, even if you're a die-hard for turn-based squad-strategy games. You don't have to complete the Caretaker's Tasks to beat the game as the bosses only give you a different mission type and Trinkets as rewards. The process of rebuilding a lost-squad member is somewhat randomized by both the class and level assigned to them from the caravan. (The highest you can unlock is a chance to get Lv 3 heroes, out of 6). But the process of rebuilding the team isn't that long as missions give you a substantial amount of XP to rebuild a Lv 6 team in 2/3 hours. Ultimately, what separates a grind from progression is what is the end goal. If you set mile-stones to slay one boss to get that one trinket, if you vary up your party-arrangement to level them all up, and if you focus on building certain structures in the Hamlet to improve your whole roster, etc. then you should never feel as though you are slogging through the game.""Math, I'm Not Your Psychologist; Solve Your Own Problems""	As someone who is a fan of reviewers like Joseph Anderson—and he has done a good critique of DD with a lot of complaints I agree —I want to reiterate that this game is not going to be for everyone. But I think a lot of people who would be interested are dissuaded by EA adopters and people who take as few risks as possible.			"

												I keep coming back to this game over and over, and as much as I love roguelikes I just can't love this game. Nothing I do in it seems to matter. I like the theme, but they take it to an extent where even the gameplay becomes meaningless. The chest is trapped so you don't get to open it? What a ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time. ""Oh but it's the theme dusty, despair."" Purposefully making me feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥doesn't make it fun. I've played tons of balls-to-the-wall hard roguelikes and at least a sense of ADVANCEMENT after all the grinding is satisfying. Nothing about this game satisfies me. Characters will randomly go down the toilet, the artifacts you throw on your characters are a roll of the dice, the stress system is dumped all over your characters, and all the resources you recieve are drained by the ridiculous prices to the point where this game is a giant ♥♥♥♥ing windmill of a grinder. It's literally Roll the Dice to Grind: The Game. You will spend 2 hours preparing for a mission only for it to fail miserably, and the slog is only exemplified by the insanely slow crawl through Random Number Generator-ville. If I wanted to pop back in Dragon Warrior, or Final Fantasy 1, and fight♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over running around, I would, but at least I'd have an overmap. These are just very pretty hallways that don't interest me with anything other than lots of GOTCHA moments. GOTCHA DUSTY....OH WAIT 5 SECONDS LATER GOTCHA AGAIN! Repetitive and entirely too frequent, too ♥♥♥♥ing soon.I also couldn't give two-flippin-♥♥♥♥s about the ""upgrade your base"" system. This is a dungeoncrawl. I'm not here for sim city.My point is, they didn't try anything new with the genre, and instead made it HALF of the genre game, and then filled it with doodads and other systems (stress), and then the UNECESSARY EVIL OF ALL: stretched the levels and combat so much so that instead of taking 2 hours to get through several dungeons, you're taking 2 hours to get through 1. And don't give me that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about ""careful planning,"" there's a point where it gets way too ♥♥♥♥ing autistic. Go play Stone Soup, NetHack or Dwarf Fortress if you want something with a little more substance and just about as much rng. I was just playing and I'm like ""man I would rather be spending my time playing Dungeons of Dredmor, or FTL, or Rogue Legacy, or Risk of Rain or ANYTHING other than this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; because the change of scenery and the character ascension factor (despite whether you screw up or not) is at least satisfying to me. It gives me pleasure. Like videogames should. Unlike this game, and Super Meat Boy. No thankarino, Arino.~There's a point where ""challenge"" just becomes a buzzword for people's taste in fun. Let's be honest guys, it's pretty colors, themes, a guy who does really good voice acting, but at it's core it's a game with a lot of elements, potential, but they executed it poorly in order to make the Kickstarter fans feel like they bought something with a lot of content by stretching it out. That's what most developers do when they make an ""Insane"" difficulty in their games. They stretch it out. I WANT to love this game. Everything I want is in it. The only problem is the guy behind the wheel won't get the ♥♥♥♥ out of the car and let me drive the damn thing.			"

												A moderately fun and interesting game until you reach the final dungeon, which is ridiculously unbalanced and wipes out your elite party with ease, causing you to lose whatever irreplacable items you equipped.

												As many others have stated, the game is garbage. The RNG determines the outcome of a dungeon raid and nothing else. The problem with the RNG is that the only effects are negative. Progression is soooo slow with this crap. So if you are a masochist, buy this game. You'll have loads of self punishment with it. Many people; including myself, enjoy building and keeping characters and using just those. This game however, uses characters as disposable tools that you just throw away every few dungeons. I'm not a fan of that mechanic. The game lacks any useful options to tailor the game towards your desired game-play as well. No difficulty or ""please remove X from the RNG list"" options. Another major problem is the UI doesn't give the user everything that they need to know. Even people on the forums will give you the wrong information because they don't even know. Example: have a skill that works on religious characters? Great! Which ones are religious? Game wont tell you. People on the forums will tell you that ""God fearing"" quirk will make them religious because that makes sense... NOPE! Not at all true. The Devs have all but abandoned adding or changing the content of the game and are only releasing patches to fix basic bugs.  "

Early Access Review
								I could think of a million good things to say about this game. Everything from the visuals to the sound design to the gameplay is stunningly wonderful, and accomplishes its goals with ease. This is certainly one of the few early access games that more than earns its somewhat inflated price, and which you should play if you enjoy hard core RPGs.I see a lot of people posting negative reviews for this game who have less than 10 hours on record, complaining that they've just lost their best heroes or that a boss totally destroyed them, and so the game isn't recommended. I find it bemusingly appropriate that the game, which sets out to create an oppressive and worrisome atmosphere even for the player themself, appears to be doing its job well; the Dungeon is defeating many with its steep difficulty curve. The game warns you up front that heroes will die, and that bad things will happen no matter what. If you play this game, indeed prepare for the worst, but don't throw in the towel the first time it happens!Don't listen to them, and become Hopeless! Instead become Stalwart, roll up your sleeves, mourn your dead, and push harder through the Darkest Dungeon!			"

								Was really fun in the beginning. Now; not so much. Depressingly unforgiving and purely based on luck and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly evil mechanics. You're constantly working uphill and losses are inevitable.I keep losing all my guys on the first missions. Trinkets are not worth using anymore, the corpses and heart attack -mechanics are too sadistic, I don't know how many times I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game and then patching with the Lighter Dungeon mod, but it's always too unforgiving nonetheless. This is the last time I'm trying to enjoy this game; as well as playing it. We had a good run in the early months. Never again; Red Hook. This game is just too sadistic and unrewarding. As for many others. Not recommended at all.			"

												I had great expectations for the game. I was disappointed. The game tries to create an experience of managing your own hero-based dungeon-assaulting company in a gothic setting, but ultimately fails to deliver. I just did not feel it. Some reasons:- Cheap cartoonish graphics and animations- Overly ambititious design- Mediocre dungeon gameplay- Serious design flawsI feel I would have enjoyed the game much more if the dungeon gameplay would be more automated, although I feel the game would need much more tweaking to be really as enjoyable as the fanboys make it out to be. Can't recommend for the default price. "

												I am very sad about this game. I had such high hopes for it. It is a great concept, it has great art, it has a great vibe, the voice acting is terrific so what could have gone so wrong?The gameplay.It all boils down to one problem. If you want to have a game about psychological damage the most important thing is that the player should care about the characters, a lot. You have to set it up to say ""you are stuck with this guy however insane it gets"". You have to feel like you are on a minecart ride to hell where then only way out is to go all the way down.Instead what this game does is throw hundreds of characters at you. You need 4 per week to make an adventuring squad but you can get up to 8 replacements! So yeah you end up with a massive squad of 16 adventurers whose names you don't even know. Has one of them gone insane? Chuck them out and get another to fill their place. Everyone is disposable.Drowning in characters means it's impossible to care about any of them. It's such a shame because this game could have been a true great, instead it's a complete fail.If they just made it so that you had a small squad which you needed to cherish, with maybe a replacement every once in a while. If only you had to sit in the town thinking ""I really want to stay here for another week to rest but I need to keep pressing on deeper into the dungeon because I have to beat the timer"" this really could have been a huge win.Instead they bungled it.

												I've been meaning to write a review for some time now.I understand why people like this game and I think it's well made, but it really isn't for me. It is not the elements of extreme difficulty and surprise mixed in with the factor that the game is incredibly unforgiving if you make a mistake. I actually love that concept. This game has so much depth and so much to discover that not even 100 hours of gameplay should be considered enough to actually feel like you know the game. Every time you feel like you're starting to learn a pattern and you're managing to breeze past dungeons, that pattern changes and you feel like you're back at square one again. You feel like you've only just scratched the surface and only played a small amount of what the game has to offer.My criticisms are that the game just feels repetitive and it's not engaging. The gameplay quickly becomes stale and it doesn't have any exciting factor that wants me to keep playng. I suppose the critical strike factor is nice and all in addition to being able to draft your dream teams and test builds which are more optimal than others so you can succeed, but there is nothing there that encourages me to play more. Everything just feels... wrong? I don't know how to describe it but I just honestly did not enjoy the game. I think if you're a fan of games like this then go ahead and buy it, but it caters to a very niche audience so be sure to watch a bit of developed gameplay or a play through of it (don't start watching it from the beginning, that would be boring). Then you should make your decision. "

Everything from your character access to whether or not your skills work is random. Its very much like watching someone get struck by lightning 30 times in a row, or hit the lottery everytime they play only to always get hit by a meteor when they pick up their ticket. Lots of potential here, but doesn't quite make it to being playable...unless masochism is what the devs were going for. In which case they hit the bullseye.			"

								I don't review many games, but I came here after a fit of almost punching my computer screen.  This game has so much potential.  Stunning mood, artwork, and gameplay concepts.  But it is HARD.  I don't mind difficulty, I think only difficulty can bring a truly rewarding play experience.  But this is randomly unfair, keyboard-throwingly hard.  You can work for hours to build up a killer party grinding easy missions and buying tons of gear, only to get to a very small, easy fight where one mob crits your whole party and they all go insane and die.  You lose everything you worked for in an instant because of a fluke of bad luck.  You can put a hero out of comission for a week to cure one mental illness, only to pick up 5 more illnesses every single week on every character that participates.  You upgrade your town to make it better, but what's the point?  Nothing seems to make it any easier or less grindy.Or, there are a couple interface hiccups, like what just happened to me: Find an object which you can use a shovel on, and the interface LOOKS like you're going to use the shovel, but no, it's slightly greyed out and you messed up.  Your party digs through the thing barehanded, and (yes) goes insane and dies.I want to like this game, I kickstarted it many months ago and I've really been looking forward to it.  But the sheer sense of constantly losing an impossible battle is really too much for me.  I want to have at least some kind of fun playing videogames.  This is just this overwhelming downhill slide of frustration and failure.  I feel like I'm one of the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s inside the game, trapped and doomed.  I'm really sad that I'm not enjoying it at all.			"

												There really needs to be a neutral option as I don't fully want to not recommend the game.There is a lot of good here, great atmosphere and music. Great use of conveying impact with very minimal animation. Along with pleasing game mechanics.The problem is of writing this in May 2016 is that the end game, (level 5 dungeons) content spikes in difficulty and pure unfairness in a spectacular way.To be able to finish the game you will have to put in 10's of hours grinding out money and resources from low level dungeons that you will have already played to death.The game by it's nature is very repetitive it's a testament to good mechanic design that it dose not feel as repetitive as in reality it is.Yet it is repetitive. When being faced with having to just farm for 10's of hours old content you will also most likely want to put the game down as well.			"

Early Access Review
A few fortnights back, in the darkest annals of the internet, I came across a singularly striking dungeon crawler by the name of Darkest Dungeon. It had not yet been released but I was wooed by it's beautifully sinister graphics and sanity mechanics.The day the game was released on Steam for Early Access I immediately purchased it and never looked back. This game is incredible even in its unfinished state. The art, music and narration combine so effectively to create an eery, oppressive atmosphere. This is best experienced in my favourite of the current dungeons, The Warrens. You are beset by disgusting, malformed pig creatures that vomit on your adventurers to break their morale. When your torch dies out you can hear a constant chorus of squeeling in the background. If you make it through alive you really feel like you survived a traumatic experience, and your adventurers will be similarly scarred.There are a few minor design squabbles I have: one of them being the way hunger works (or doesn't work) and another being that some of the classes are quite underpowered. But for the most part the RPG mechanics are very well thought out and implemented.Overall I would r8 this gr8. 8/8			"

												""At last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed that damnable portal of antediluvian evil.""  That's from the (frankly brilliant) introductory cut-scene of this game, and it just gets doomier and darker from there.    Tired of the ""lighter"" fantasy elements in RPGs?  Hate hobbits, for example?!  Here, have a claustrophobic crusader (who's also a kleptomaniac) instead.  Weary of kindly old pointy-hatted wizards?  Here's a plague doctor for your grenade-lobbing, disease-spreading pleasure.  How's about a bounty hunter with bulimia, to fill the party out a bit more?  Oh, and I hear that your vestal (cleric) is suffering from stress?  Perhaps I can suggest she spend the rest of the week flagellating herself in the abbey for her sins?    This game by and largely takes a Call of Cthulhu (the tabletop RPG) approach to dungeon-hacking...which is to say, don't get too attached to your characters, as they're gonna die pretty regularly!  It also has a wickedly black sense of humour, wonderfully charming graphics, more-than-serviceable sound, a genuinely interesting ""skill""-based approach to combat, and is one of the few games I can think of where permadeath and irreversible auto-saves are actually JUSTIFIED.  In a genre of video gaming all but literally done to death, it's quite amazing how many (relatively) fresh tricks this one has up its sleeves.       I gave in to buying and playing this prematurely due to the amazingly positive reviews and ridiculous amount of playing hours wracked up by some players for such an Early Access game - if that doesn't speak of its quality, I'm not sure what does - but another look at the Store page tells me the game doesn't yet have a proper ending, so I might wait 'til it's officially finished before playing any further.  But MAN, am I impressed thus far.  Definitely shaping up to be one of the all-time best games of its type, especially for those of us with a heavy bias towards the gothic and horrible.  Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

Early Access Review
								This as yet unreleased game received some of the most glowing reviews from the gaming press that I have seen in quite some time.  I have to disagree.The game has a great atmosphere and wonderful graphics and sounds that perfectly fit the mood, however, the core elements of class skills, combat, and leveling are lacking.Class skills are simple and generic leading to few relatively simple strategies for each class, which makes combat mostly about RNG, not player choices.  Since skills are cast from certain positions and hit pre-determined enemy positions, another element of player control is lost.  Accordingly, you could probably write a fairly simplistic algorithm to replace the decision making involved in fighting and not lose anything in the process.  Considering that you have do a very considerable amount of grinding to create a party capable of higher level zones, and considering that those higher level party members can no longer help in lower level zones, what you end up with is excessive repetition of tedious content where success is mostly up to the RNG gods.No amount of chanting 'hardcore' or 'permadeath' or 'roguelike' will do anything to help with flaws like this.  To me, a good rpg requires that in game challenges be responsive to player decisions more than they are to random rolls.  In old 'roguelike' games such as Nethack, player knowledge contributed to victory at least as much as RNG factors.  A good player was one who knew the options and the capabilities of the creatures they encountered.  They were not simply lucky. RNG was a factor to overcome by foresight, preparation, and knowledge.I hope that as the game develops, this issue can be addressed.  I would happily grind away if I felt like my choices in battle made much of a difference, but, as it stands, I'd be better off placing bets with myself and rolling a d20.			"

								Do you like having yourself dodged every attack but not be given the same priviledge? Do you want to be doing decent, and then, have events well beyond your control and not even playable around destroy what would be a 'mediocre' run and turn it into one where you delete your save and just start over? This game is so poorly tuned right now it's not even funny. The damage difference is enormous between you and mobs, there are no tools in place to even 'allow' the idea of a group not comprised of most of your frontliners. If they have to be benched, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Plain and simple. Why might they be benched? Whatever rng gods have in store. Things you can't play around. You just accept. I've deleted my starting game after artbirary dogshit that is impossible to prevent more times than I can count at this point. Oh, you can't also spend precious time using abilities that buff yourself. That is precious, precious time that the enemy gets to attack you through so if you pause and miss MAYBE eliminating one of them for some +15 accuracy (that still doesn't negate dodge) buff then odds are you take damage that makes completing the mission impossible. And that can happen in the first step of the dungeon.What a poorly designed♥♥♥♥♥♥hole of a system.When damage, when skills, when stress is balanced maybe you can get this game. Right now? No. Don't give a dime. I like rogue-likes, this is just like a Cthulu run through DnD basically forcing you to die for no one's amusement but the AI with literally no hope of preventing it.			"

			Darkest Dungeon: First Look / Let's play Darkest Dungeon is the latest in rogue like/lite RPG. It's still in early access but we're going to dive into the darkness and dangers of so we can hunt for...		

Darkest Dungeon is a tough as nails turn based RPG with  procedurally generated scenarios and dungeons. The game has tons of replay, deep RPG mechanics, a great gothic comic art style, and rip your hair out difficulty. The game will screw you when ever it can, it's like role playing murphy's law.It's in early access, but to me it already feels very polished and full. The game feels quite complete even in it's current state and I simply can't wait to see future updates.It's hard for me to find any flaws as I've thoroughly enjoyed what the game has to offer. It's take on the genre is some thing very enjoyable. I can not recommend Darkest Dungeon enough.Pros:- Great aesthetics - Enjoyable take on turn based RPG- Deep with a high skill ceiling- Very polished and playable as an early accessCons:- Can be frustrating to some- Don't expect a fleshed out narrative like other RPGs			"

Early Access Review
								Do I go on whith a few torches left and hope for the possibility of loot in the next room? Or do I take what I have so far and return to town to mend my party? The risc reward factor is what makes this game so addicting and fun. Even though the game is stated to be in early acces, everything plays and feels like a full game so I can't wait to see what the Dev's will come up with next. Definitly worth checking out			"

Early Access Review
								I very rarely play rougelike games. Or at least I didn't start playing them until recently since they weren't my cup of tea. I've heard of Darkest Dungeon from game reviewers and it grabbed my attention. Even though its an early access game I have to say that this is by far a worthwhile purchase.The game offers quite a lot to do and it doesn't hold your hands. If you can die in the so called ""tutorial"" (which happened to me once) it just goes to show that it has great potential. The dungeons can be long or short, the quests vary and your party is ""paper"". You have to be careful with them, you have to pay attention and think on how to proceed. In this game, you or your party aren't immortal or godlike heroes. Its best to say that you should not get attached to any party member as they will eventually die. But this makes the game much more interesting. I definately recommend it even at this stage in development.			"

												One day since I bought it, I played it more than 8 hours. Now it's about 22...If you'll decide to buy it too, I remind you: THAT GAME IS HARD. Your heroes will die, your missions won't be completed, you'll starve, fall into diseases and become insane...But it's worth it.10/10I got addicted. :D			"

												To put it simply, I'm still in love in love with this game.The art style is akin to a Mike Mignola comic, right down to the usage of shadows and the color palette. The music is eerie and foreboding. The voice acting--the narrator--draws me in. I find myself walking around the house saying all these big words in a deep voice to annoy my wife now.For an early access game, it plays like a complete game. The character classes available are well polished, the creatures and encounters unique and moderately challenging (I’ll get to that), and the interface bug free.The game itself can be unforgiving. I find myself cheering when I land a much-needed crit, or yelling WTF when I find myself missing over and over. I've had my share of deaths, but as I reach the higher levels, unless I really go against the grain with roster selections for encounters, I have no trouble. After reaching Level 2, I've had minimal deaths since I'm playing a low risk, low reward style of play as I learn the ropes. I can imagine that if you brought little in the way of torches, food and bandages to a dungeon, the difficulty and loot would scale upwards (and you could carry more home..)I can't wait to try and new classes and start playing around with more rewarding party combos.If you are looking for a different, immersive, dark RPG style game, pick this up. Don't blame me if you utter ""Cruel machinations!"" in a radio voice as you step on a Lego in the dark in your kid's room.			"

												Whats the most important criteria to decide wether or not to buy this game?Its the thrill of challenge. This of all things is what DarkestDungeon provides imo the most. I am not going into the gameplay too deep, but it mostly evolves around a continuos onslaught on your physical and mental health during dungeoncrawling (go watch some gameplay-videos on youtube or so). And let me tell you, the word ""fair"" is lacking in the dictionary of the DarkestDungeon (which is on the other hand extensive beyond the measures of everyday communication - Wayne Junes voiceacting is just on point in this game). There is no such thing as an ""irrelevant miss"" from your frontlines, or a ""harmless Crit"" from the enemy, and most of all, not even the slightest mistake is forgiven. Sometimes, your biggest enemy is chance.But exactly this aspect is what makes this game so exciting - to win against the odds, to make the best out of a bad situation, as the game tells you in the very beginning. Many People complain that the difficulty takes away the fun, that they feel restricted by it, but its a key element to the game (otherwise it wouldnt be called the ""darkest"" dungeon, duh). And by that I knowingly include all the ridiculous RNG. Because thats when true heroes emerge. Getting that one critical hit that turns the tides of battle, that one positive resolve-check when you almost felt all hope was lost, is just glorious.Also, as you start to learn the combat system, expeditions will become more consistent, and team-compositions adjusted for specific quests are able to overcome most of whats thrown at them. Yet the game keeps challenging you. Bosses requiring a planned takedown. The final DarkestDungeon-quests (especially looking at you, second one) with insane difficulty level. And once you are even proficient enough to master those and win the game, beware the horror that is NG+And that concludes my (subjective) analysis of the joy this game provides. If you are willing to accept the challenge, answer the letter, brace yourself, and venture into the shadow of the DarkestDungeon. Because...RUIN HAS COME TO OUR FAMILY			"

												Love the visuals, love the narration, the audio adds to the atmosphere, and the gameplay is solid. If you don't like RNG in your games, this might not be for you though. Also, I wish that there was a little more customization in terms of the gear for your characters. That progression feels very linear.			"

												One of the best games I played, some of the complaints are unfair imo it depends on how you view the game are you playing for fun or just to win? Saying that, there is very little RNG in this game, the fight is won before it begins, it's all about picking the right team comp and skills and knowing what to do in a fight:Some spoilers below:I'll give you one example: I was going through a lvl 6 dungeon ( the infamous event ) and all was going well until the final fight, to cut things short I lost the first fight, looking back it wasn't because of RNG, my first few turns I decided to focus the wrong target, by the End of the fight the Boss barely needed one hit but because of the mistakes I did at first my team died before I could finish him off if I hadn't done those mistakes my entire team would have survived, and I would have walked out with insane loot.What i'm saying here sometimes you might get screwed over but a good 95% of the times if you look back, you will see that you did some things wrong ( I should have stunned that, I should have went for a heal etc.)Before lvl 5 and 6 dungeon you can go with whatever and make it work, afterwards you can still do it but it will require a bit of planning and a bit more investment in your characters if you want to pick randomly, and the more you play you'll see that there is barely any RNG in this game and that it's only their to keep you on your toes every once in a while.Different fights can be done in may different ways, you can go out all dmg, or have a traditional comp of ""healer+tank"", you can go all out debuff + guard, you can make anything work if you want, that's the fun of this game trying out different compositions, hell if you get mad you can cheese some fights for the hell of it.My advice is don't be alarmed and don't listen when someone says you MUST use a certain hero, it might make your life easier it might not it all depends on your playstyle and which heroes YOU prefer using.I recommend this game if you enjoy dungeon crawlers and you enjoy playing games for fun + challenge, because if you're only playing it just to ""beat it"" you might rage more if you get a severe loss in game, but everyone's got their own reasons.I honestly can't wait to see what these devs will do next.

												Darkest Dungeon is a 2-D roguelike dungeon crawler that tasks you to put together a rag-tag group of misfits, crusaders and bandits to raid neighboring areas in preparation for the largest raid into the Darkest Dungeon, which is narratively built to be a festering, climatic and brutal playground of destructive beasts and traps. The title's core gameplay involves 3 pillars at various stages of your raiding excursions: preparation, exploration and combat, supplanting these core aspects with a variety of nuanced systems that enhance its difficulty, strategic necessity and more. You prepare for your dungeon raids in Hamlet, a small, decrepit town of hollowed out buildings and decaying structures. These buildings serve various roles to your team, from recruiting new team members, buying new equipment, visiting saloons and cathedrals for stress relief and blacksmith and guild workshops to upgrade their talents. You pay gold to obtain their services and utilize other collectable trinkets to permanently upgrade their efficiency, cost and number of teammates that can be serviced at once. It’s also in Hamlet where you do pre-mission preparation and provisioning for items you’ll need for the upcoming mission. Party order and composition are extremely important here, since particular characters are skilled at building basecamps, healing and even scouting rooms at random to give you a better sense of the challenges headed your way. Since there is no chest system for storing items you don’t use on missions either, you can quickly spend yourself dry on key items if you don’t carefully micromanage your gold.Once you embark on a mission, you’ll begin in a random room in the chosen dungeon. It’s at this point you’ll walk right on a 2-D plane and explore, coming across different optional items, obstacles as well as traps and enemy encounters. These items range from chests, corpses, old books, torches and many more, and each occasion you can choose whether to interact with them or not, and each object could hurt or hinder your team, from a sudden bleeding or poison effect or even a new permanent characteristic or loot/gold. Barricade obstacles are unpassable and must either be removed with a shovel or with your team’s bare hands (taking some health away as well). Traps can often be spotted on the ground, but are invisible depending on your constantly draining torch meter at the top of the screen, which dictates your visibility and can confer advantages or disadvantages depending on its level (ranging from pitch black to radiant brightness). Opposing teams can even get the jump on you and attack first if they attack with no torch equipped. It also affects how much stress your team will accumulate, which is an actual statistic the game keeps track of for each party member and will often affect their combat abilities, their quotes and even their performance off the battlefield. If left unchecked, a character with a tremendous stress level may begin to disobey your orders, loot a booby trap without you clicking and several other unintended negative effects. You must complete the objective in order to leave the dungeon, with the goal often being exploring the majority of the dungeon, clearing every room or even defeating a particularly strong adversary.Finally, once you run into a combat scenario, the game’s varied and cinematic combat begins. Your team stands in a row, with the one farthest to the right typically your melee fighters to stay up close, and the one on the far left your ranged fighters who prefer to keep their distance, although you can choose and party members placement to your hearts content. However, their placement affects what abilities can and cannot be used. There is a speed stat in the game but often times it is random who will strike first¬¬¬. Enemies often have additional attributes to their attacks, like poison damage, stun and knockback/shuffle, which forcefully displaces the party member’s original position to a different spot, often putting melee fighters far away and so on. Other moves can heal, buff or de-buff characters on screen and even do a much stronger attack in exchange for detrimental effects in upcoming turns.  Once an enemy is defeated, corpses are left on the battlefield that can either be destroyed for easier access to the remaining foes or left to loot later for additional rewards. Taking a major hit, being cursed by certain incantations or certain party members being near a particular type of foe will stack stress on your character. Stress affects combat in a number of ways, but the most nefarious ones are characters at high stress levels receiving afflictions, which instill random negative effects like auto-attacking a random target, passing or even shouting to stress out neighboring party members. At its worse, stress can even result in a character permanently dying from a heart attack mid-battle, removing them entirely from your game.Darkest Dungeon offers a grim but striking and appealing Gothic art style, with every corner of its game world dripping with disgusting monster effects and sounds, occasionally disturbing character dialogue and an atmosphere of brutality. The art style perfectly captures this feeling, with even the character designs feeling worn down and battle-torn, from the healing cleric’s tattered robe to the abominations vulgar appearance. Everything feels well placed and methodically tuned to deliver a mood of foreboding. The dungeons as well feel aged and mysterious, although repetitious at times with their similar setups of traps and set hallway lengths. This tone is complimented further by a bombastic and epic narrator who voices many of the proceedings, whether it be the end of a battle or key event, a particularly gruesome kill or just a well written quip of battlefield dialogue to enhance the mood. The narrator greatly accented my enjoyment with the game because he always made the events transpiring more interesting and eventful. There are tons of other smaller touches you may use to personalize your quest as well, not least of which being able to name each member of your party. While a small touch, I ended up naming the best of my squad the names of some of my closest family and friends, which in some ways was quite a mistake as I approached higher difficulty areas. My most palpable moment of dread and overwhelming exertion with Darkest Dungeon came with my encounter with that first boss, who due to my drastic underestimation of his abilities was able to decimate my entire team, with the 4 members lost consisting of the real life names of my sister, cousin and 2 best friends, all while my self-named character was resting comfortably back in Hamlet. It’s a shocking effectively blow to my morale, self-perceived skill level and pride, never feeling so defeated when I returned to Hamlet knowing that I had gotten several of my “family and friends” killed. I even started building my own stories on how my remaining party members would be reacting knowing the losses we had incurred. While not everyone may end up having that experience, it was one of the most sincere moments of shock I felt while playing.Darkest Dungeon hits all the rights notes with its methodical combat, Victorian gothic visual style and its sense of mystery in exploration. Preparing for missions felt worthwhile and necessary, with optimum planning essential to keeping party members alive and as unstressed as possible. The story was a bit disappointing but creating my own narrative and character personalities by naming my characters gave the fledgling tale much more weight and personal depth. The number of options and factors at play in any given gameplay scenario is often breathtaking and overwhelming, but remains fun and challenging in all the right ways. Darkest Dungeon is a superb title and a truly fantastic start to 2016 for me. I highly recommend it. "

												Highly Recommended. As a general statement, if you enjoy tactical games that force you to think, stay engaged, reward planning, are challenging, allow significant experimentation and variability and give a strong sense of accomplishment, this is the game for you. I have played a lot of tactical games over the years, such as both XCOM's, Fire Emblems, Dungeon of the Endless, many playstation era tactics and RPG's, and this game is argueably one of the better ones. While each is different, the aspect I enjoy probably most about Darkest Dungeon is that even when you get later into the game, it will never allow you to go on auto-pilot. By that I mean that I find with many tactic games, once you get a party to a certain point, enemies start to die much quicker and the challenge is gone; it makes you think back to when you first started the game and it was better. Darkest Dungeon captures that enjoyment as each run through a dungeon feels like its own game. Losing champions is definitely frustrating and sometimes it feels like the game is against you, but once you get a feel for it you will be suprised how quickly you can recuit and train up new heroes.  Some context to the above:- The planning and attacking phases are very well laid out. By this I mean before you enter a dugeon you have a significant control over: Who your party will be, what items they will take, what map size you want, what consumable items you will buy and what skills you will use. Have a short amount of time to play? Play a smaller map. - The heroes and dungeons are created in such a way that they give you a lot to think about and experiment with. Even 50 hours or so into the game I was still experimenting with party and skill combinations. This helps keep the game fresh as you will likely always have a favorite party, but the mechanics will force you to play will different groups.			"

												Darkest Dungeon.""My obsession caused this great foulness, and it is shameful that I must rely upon you to set it right.""Set within an victoria-fantasy setting, this gothic infused rogue-like dungeon crawler will without a doubt have you on the edge of your seat. A game, not only about expending resources to benefit the greater good of YOUR party, but the newcomers that arrive washed up from days of trecking.Horrors beyond your wildest imagination will strike you at every corner and crevess, leaving you scampering on the tip of toes as you search room to room for gold and prized possessions. Not only do you have to manage the stress your heroes will overcome, but the vitality of the town you so predominantly dwell in. Will you scarper and abandon all hope? Or persevere and fight the monsters that seek to destroy you, head on? This is no place for the weak for only the strong will survive -- The Darkest Dungeon.			"

												I love this game. I don't play early access games, since I'm more interested in the finished product; I made an exception for Darkest Dungeon prior to its release. It's atmospheric eye-candy that captures an oppressive tone and mood I could only replicate in my dreams. The sound and art design are to die for, honestly. The Narrator sends chills down my spine.It's hard. You have to sow time and energy into learning the mechanics of the game-- but I think that's fun. I like trial and error learning; I feel accomplished when I assemble a team that works well in a dungeon where I'm not entirely sure what to expect. If you enjoy, say, Nuzlocke runs of Pokemon, I feel like the two are similar when it comes to developing strategies. (And when it comes to accepting that RNG does play a role in your success and failure.)Darkest Dungeon is really one of my favorites. You will have runs that go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but that's the exception, not the rule. It's a matter of taking things slow and just playing the game for what it is, I think. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you are intrigued by what the game offers, I strongly recommend it.			"

												Really fun game, hard, my kinda game. but it does feel like the stress can get out of control way too fast. I get into the medium level and high level dungeons and have either 2 or 3 party members afflicted in the first few battles. ghouls skull toss is ridiculous haha, and all the mobs that use stress wave, and enemy crits. afflictions are so crippling and make camping useless I just end up leaving the dungeon and spending a fortune trying to destress, nothing pisses you off in the game more than watching one of your favorite dudes die because of a string of nonsense. other than that im a huge fan and will continue to put hours into this thing.

												This game is very well crafted, and they've made great additions to the content since Early Access. As a roguelike, it has a lot of random elements, and the difficulty is harsh, but it's a game about the stress of fighting eldrich horrors, so that's to be expected.			"

												So far, I think this is an awesome game. Great atmosphere and fun mechanics. I am especially enjoying the narration. My one criticism is that the game is a bit of a grind. I am around six hours in and the end is nowhere in sight. Normally this would not be a problem, but every mission is essentially the same. You enter a dungeon with four characters, walk around, get in turn-based battles, and then return to your hamlet.			"

												Facts: turn based dungeon crawler, great art style, monsters design, clever mechanics (for example stress, quirks, roster shuffling), synergies, a metric crapton of strategies to succeed. So for mechanics, presentation and overall quality of the game 9/10Now I want to adress some issues that majority of people seem to have with this game:1) difficulty spike in champion (and further) dungeons - what people seem to not understand or rather refuse to adapt to is this subtle change of balance in the later game. At the beginning you're good to go with 4 pure damage units, just bashing everything into oblivion. But the further you go, the more it changes to strategy focused game. The battles get longer, enemies get tougher and all you have in your disposal is your creativity and 'on the fly' way of solving these combat puzzles. People seem to think that you just need a crusader or hellion who will crack skulls with sword or axe. That's not the case brother. Think and solve the puzzle or die. That's the name of the game.2) grind - there are essentially 2 currencies - one for town activities (gold) and others (deeds, crests, etc) for upgrading your town. Again, at first, you need both. But after upgrading the city to the max, you can just abandon the second currency completely. There's no lose state in this game as far as I know, so the only matter here (as I understand) is that you have to go through lower levels dungeons to level up new rosters. Well, isn't it what you like? Playing the game? If not, what the hell are you doing with your life? It's like I would say - 'well, I don't like Disneyland, so let's go to Disneyland and whine about it later'. You don't like to be punished for stupid mistakes that you made? Well, why in the love of ♥♥♥♥ do you play difficult games then...(not to mention - developers are going to make it easier for people like you and update the game today (08.03.2016) with 'more gold from quests class' and couple of town tweaks to make it less 'tedious' to level up heroes)Maybe the problem is not in the game, but in the public. People don't like challenge these days, they want to have everything served on a silver platter. This game doesn't do that. It rewards careful planning, thinking and shifting your focus from certain strategies the further in you are. People don't like to think, people don't like to learn on their mistakes. That's why they can't handle the game. Or is it unfair RNG's fault? I'll tell you this - I lost ONE character in about 70 hours of gameplay because I couldn't do anything about it. And it took really unfortunate string of enemy crits and bleed/blight damage combo to make it happen. But it's life man, stuff happens, deal with it :P Or maybe that's because I'm 80's guy. I was raised on difficult videogames that didn't give a crap about my feelings. They made me tough player that can appreciate cool, merciless gameplay :P And Darkest Dungeon delivers!Darkest Dungeon ladies and gentlemen - 9/10!			"

												Do you like smashing your head against brick walls? This is the game for you. It's just as punishing as Dark Souls, but is a sidescrolling dungeon meatgrinder. Your heroes will die. They will become diseased. They will go mad.And the narrator will point out all of this in a darkly bitter lovecraftian manner. The narrator, in fact, is what earns this game it's spot as 'atmospheric' as his brutal critique of what occurs will at times demoralize you.That said, this game is a definite buy if you don't mind your self-esteem being eroded.

												What can I say other than: THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC!.To be fair you have to really like turn based combat. But if you have ever played a tabletop RPG, almost everytime you venture out will have that thrill of having to pray for a good dice roll. That thrill of not knowing whether your characters are about to rise to the challenge or things are about to be FUBAR really gets the heart pumping. Numerous times, you will either exclaim with excitement over that perfect crit at the perfect moment or lament as that heal you really need hit for 0.You will soon have to get over any attachement to any single character. This is like Game of Thrones of RPG's. They will die. You will be upset.The art is beautiful. The animation style is amazing in its simplicity and ability to create excitment.			"

												Solid, innovative party-based dungeon crawler.The difficulty and learning curve is a bit steep but that's the main point of this game. Foreboding atmosphere, good character design, thoughtful visual style and nice graphics.But what stands out is the sound of this game. The narrator did a top notch job on the voice over. Other effects are great sounding too. And that soundtrack, suits the game!Innovation like stress impact on your heroes force you to manage your party instead of just throwing in a team and embarking on a quest, the difficulty could have been a bit less but still this game is fun.And all the above mentioned aspects will combine together .. to own you.EDIT:Okay, this game is quite .. unfair. Its heavy reliance on RNG renders this game unbalanced. Losing a party that you've invested a lot of hours in is too frustrating, which ultimately pushes you to grind more to bring another party to the required level. I'm not going to change the recommendation, i think this game still needs to be played to appreciate the fantastic gameplay, artwork and voice work / sound effects. I just hope this game is properly balanced in the future.Looks like updates have made the game much more accessible.			"

												I really dont understand the negative reviews of this game and all the folks that say the RNG is terrible and the game is all luck.  My experience was exactly the opposite.  I lost, in grand total, 2 characters across my playthrough.  One was because I deliberately sent 4 level 0's on a 0 light run.  Basically it was a suicide run and still only 1 died.  The second I sent a very ill equipped party against a tier 2 shambler.  The shambler is no joke and you really, REALLY shouldn't fight it without a porperly prepared party.  I didn't lose a single other character and beat the game in under 99 weeks (an acheivement).I keep reading these reviews and I see people saying the antiquarian is terrible...just wow.  She is the single most useful character as she completely solves the money grind.  I started playing before her patch and that was the biggest gripe I had but she completely solved it.  A few antiquarian runs leave you in piles of gold and you can afford to kit out your squads without issue.I keep reading and I see a bunch of folks complain about stress.  I feel like they have completely failed to understand the tools that have been given to them.  There are three classes that can remove stress and camping skills to help as well.  Between those factors I virtually -never- used stress heal buildings and I only had trouble with people reaching 100 stress on late tier boss battles where you cant afford to stall at all.Also yes, I played with all default settings.  I did not turn any of the cheats on.Honestly...if you are terrible at tactics and strategy games sure then this game is unfair.  If you actually think about how to form good parties and make good decisions this game is wonderfully rewarding.			"

												If you want a challenge, this game is for you. If you want a game that doesn't hold your hand, Darkest Dungeon is for you. If you love playing Bastion, this game is NOT for you. Darkest Dungeon is a semi-rogue dungeon crawler that asks what it would really be like to be a hero in a story, movie, or game. Form a roster of heroes, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and take four of them each week to fight the horrors of the abyss. Your heroes will get hurt, they'll get stressed, they'll learn to fear the terrors they fight. Maybe your favorite hero comes back with the Black Plague, maybe he becomes Paranoid while fighting. And your heroes will die. But in death you will learn to pick up the pieces and try again. Darkest Dungeon kicks you when you're down, laughs at you and calls your mom fat. No hero is safe, and no dungeon is ""easy"". The bigger the beast, the greater the glory, however; if you persevere you may just find yourself at the end of the Darkest Dungeon. You will be laughing still... and the end.			"

Gameplay Amazing!Many people have the ♥♥♥♥♥ for the simple fact that it is to hard for them, or they are angry that it is taking them to long to complete, if you do not want a game that punishes you for ♥♥♥♥ing up, there are plenty of easier games, you don't leave a bad review, just based on that fact.This game is right on the money, it makes you think, plan, and take chances, if you try to do something without having the proper tools, you will suffer for it, if you think you can not complete a map without one of your toons dieing, Don't!If one of your toon dies, it will not come back, you will have to start fresh on a new one.There are plenty of upgrades, weapons, amour, skill unlocks, skill upgrades, and it also has items to equip on toons, with these items you can completely change a toons stats, there are also plenty of perks that your toons will pick up along the way, a few are 10% HP boost, 15% ATK boost, etc.Now for what everyone is loosing there♥♥♥♥♥♥about, there are alot of things that can go wrong, your toons become stressed throughout the dungeons and monsters they face, as this builds your toons will start to loose it, one example is Anxiety, each time this happens the toon will start to act in there own unique way, they might hurt them selves, make decisions for you by attacking at will, stopping you from being able to retreat, abusing other toons, if this stress becomes to much, the toon will most likely have a heart attack, and die.Toons don't always loose it when they become stressed, some become heroic, these toons receive buffs, relieve stress from other toons, trust me, when this happens you will be so ♥♥♥♥ing happy, you will♥♥♥♥♥♥all threw your pants, at the end of each map/level your toons will receive bad/good effects, these are permanent, don't stress about the bad one's, you can remove them, but it will cost you!Wrap up is, think, plan, don't take to many risks, and above all don't ♥♥♥♥ up, in saying this there will be times where no matter what you do, someone will die.

												An absolute triumph of indie gaming and, by far, my favorite Early Access title (or so it was when I bought it). The simple, yet aesthetic gothic-style graphics work well as a visage over brilliant mechanics and complex characters. The animations, while subtle, contribute greatly to the overall flow of the game, as do the comic book-esque attacks and movements.The characters' individual lines were clearly written by someone with great experience in the English language, and the narrator's voice exemplifies the feel of the game while playing. There clearly was a lot of thought put into character lore, from their backgrounds to their outlooks on the situation from room to room.Rougelikes are inherently difficult, and the addition of rising stress paralleled with falling health makes Darkest Dungeon's gameplay a serious challenge. And while there is certainly a degree of luck prevalent throughout, there are thousands of ways to conquer each region through the tweaking of characters and their skills. This point is particularly potent through relics (especially those that are class-restricted), camping, and even wise disease use. Want a powerful Rank 1 hitter? Let him get rabies, and then stand the hell back.This game demands a tactician. Those who can't succeed in this title just... well, aren't tacticians. Without proper party assembly and skill synergy, this already-daunting title because almost insurmountable. There is a steep learning curve, but it's the most delight I've had in dying repeatedly since Dark Souls. Truly a masterpiece of its kind. I can't recommend Darkest Dungeon enough.			"

Early Access Review
								Great game !  Lots of fun with a unique art style.   Game balance is much improved over the earlier builds.  It's challenging but without the frustrating party wipes due to bad luck and poor design.   While you can start multiple campaigns, each campaign has only one save that the game auto-updates.  Characters can and will die and there's no bringing them back.  With that said, once you know the game mechanics, you have to be overconfident or unlucky to get a character killed.   What's more likely is that they will become so riddled with afflictions and phobias that you start wondering if it's worth the time and money to cure them. ""Alas, poor Dismas.  He grew un-well.""The game mechanics appear simple at first, but the more you play, the deeper you realize the strategy elements go.With multiple classes, quirks, afflictions, equipment levels, learned skills, trinkets, and character position, there are a lot of things to consider when putting together a party.  There's also a limited amount of supplies you can carry, so you have to consider carefully what to bring. Supplies and loot occupy the same space. Bring too many supplies, and there's no room for loot.  Bring too few supplies, and you starve in the dark.Visually, characters of the same class look the same.  Crusader Bill looks just like crusader Bob. You can change their name and choose an overall color scheme, but they look the same.  You'd think this would make the characters feel generic, but it doesn't.   Over the course of a campaign - for however long they survive - each character will develop differently.  Bill is smitten by a worker in the brothel and that is the only place he will go to de-stress.  Bob finds religion and will only de-stress in the abbey.  Bill becomes paranoid and mutters constantly when in a party. Bob becomes vigorous and regenerates a bit of health.  Visually the same, but in character totally different.Is Darkest Dungeon a perfect game? Hard to answer. I think it is a game that is perfectly itself - and that self is very engaging.If you're looking for a turn-based, dungeon experience with a unique art style, challenging game play, and a lengthy campaign ( broken into manageable bites ),  give Darkest Dungeon a try .

								What an absolutely delicious game.  A whole-hearted old-school affair.  If you enjoy stats, dice rolls, RNG, gear, tons of classes, exploring dungeons, turn-based action, and beautiful artwork than this game is for you. Even though it's in early access, it already has tons of content with tons more on the way.			"

												I LOVE this game. I can't understand how people with 80+ hours in the game can not recommend it. If you were enganged for that long, how is it not worth it?This game has alot of great stuff- Amazing artstyle. It is so awesome and unique- Great rhythm: The combat has highs and lows. Alot of epic, dynamic moments contrasted by grim and grueling dungeon crawling- Top notch lore and writing, with spectacular narration by Wayne June. This game would not be the same without him- More stuff i cant quantify into wordsThis is the most stressful game I've ever played, but whenever I quit I want to play again.All that said, its not a game for everyone. Games are hit and miss. this is not the sort of game I usually play but it's now one of my all time favorites. If you watch the trailer, see some gameplay and think it looks fun, BUY IT! I cant recommend this game enough.			"

								This game is frirst very interesting but as you play later on the intensity of the game increase without much pleasure. Seriously, all your belove heroes will die one way or another, eventhough you go to the region without blight. Some how the boss will have blight and invunarable to bleeding. The boss will hit 5 times in a row when your heroes are lvl 1-3 max. The factor of light, food, antidoes, bandage, will make you suffer from one stage to another. I feel like the more you play this game the more stress you will get same as those character in games. The vanguard will scare the sht out of the spider and let your healer stay in front. That is just freak awsome that game can make you♥♥♥♥♥♥in your pant when you think you most ready. Enjoy the game when you want to killsomething. I do not recommend to play alot. Just play so you can appreciate the easiness of other games lol.			"

								this game is very hard! its a lot of fun, but don't get discouraged to quickly, as you easily can.  Take breaks often and play something else when its starts to get overwhelming. I think there are a few things that should be fixed, that are just a little broken.  You gather stress too quickly, and its very hard to manage.  I also think that its almsost impossible with a VESTILE (Healer, with both skills) on your teams.  TIPS:Don't get attached to your people until lvl 3+.  DON'T pay to destress anyne except the Healer/fav character untill lvl 2+  (dismiss them)Upgrade the Stage coach, guild, blackmith, church. Its hard, but fun, and oddly rewarding.  I love it in small doses! give it a try! "

								Great game !  Lots of fun with a unique art style.   Game balance is much improved over the earlier builds.  It's challenging but without the frustrating party wipes due to bad luck and poor design.   While you can start multiple campaigns, each campaign has only one save that the game auto-updates.  Characters can and will die and there's no bringing them back.  With that said, once you know the game mechanics, you have to be overconfident or unlucky to get a character killed.   What's more likely is that they will become so riddled with afflictions and phobias that you start wondering if it's worth the time and money to cure them. ""Alas, poor Dismas.  He grew un-well.""The game mechanics appear simple at first, but the more you play, the deeper you realize the strategy elements go.With multiple classes, quirks, afflictions, equipment levels, learned skills, trinkets, and character position, there are a lot of things to consider when putting together a party.  There's also a limited amount of supplies you can carry, so you have to consider carefully what to bring. Supplies and loot occupy the same space. Bring too many supplies, and there's no room for loot.  Bring too few supplies, and you starve in the dark.Visually, characters of the same class look the same.  Crusader Bill looks just like crusader Bob. You can change their name and choose an overall color scheme, but they look the same.  You'd think this would make the characters feel generic, but it doesn't.   Over the course of a campaign - for however long they survive - each character will develop differently.  Bill is smitten by a worker in the brothel and that is the only place he will go to de-stress.  Bob finds religion and will only de-stress in the abbey.  Bill becomes paranoid and mutters constantly when in a party. Bob becomes vigorous and regenerates a bit of health.  Visually the same, but in character totally different.Is Darkest Dungeon a perfect game? Hard to answer. I think it is a game that is perfectly itself - and that self is very engaging.If you're looking for a turn-based, dungeon experience with a unique art style, challenging game play, and a lengthy campaign ( broken into manageable bites ),  give Darkest Dungeon a try .

Early Access Review
								It started out well BUT shrtly after getting into the game I found some serious problems. The game doesn't seem to allow for mission selection (meaning you have no control over where you go or the difficulty of the missions being undertaken). This wouldn't be a problem if you could aviod more senior members of the team dying but you can't, leaving you with rookies getting smashed on missions far to hard for them and your coffers quickly empty. Once this happens you cant get back into the game and the repetition of start well, get smashed, everyone dies, fail dungeon, return to town, rinse, repeat... it just gets old quickly.I like the game, I like the design, I like the ideas and the spooky voice over, the commentary and the captions from characters, the psychological and medical quirks, ALL GREAT... but the difficulty curve and the risk reward are totally out of whack diminishing the playability and amping up the frustration way beyond fun into simply annoying.This could be a really good game, but alas it falls short on playability, where it excels is in the exceptional design, sound, visuals (all top notch)... if you don't mind the overwhelming urge to smash your machine, this may be a good game for you. I was left feeling hollow and teary... I want to love this, I really do... it's SO COOL, but I just can't... perhaps I'm playing wrong... but I dont know if I'll come back			"

Early Access Review
								When I first hired Reynauld, a wet behind the ears crusader, and his highwayman Dismas, I had my doubts if we would even make it to The Estate.  On the road, though, they quickly proved capable - dispatching a small company of bandits who camped on the only road to my isolated inheritance.  Our arrival was met with little fanfare - I heard the tavern keeper remind Dismas that he was not allowed at the gambling tables.  Reynauld refused to leave the transept of the church while in town.  While drinking at the tavern Dismas made friends with an old man at arms named Machel, a man who spends as much time in the brothels as Reynauld does in the transept.  I asked Reynauld if he and his misfortunate band of three might be ready to start excavating and clearing out some of the old ruins beneath the manor, to which he responded that they would if they had a fourth, someone to help keep them in good health.  I told him I knew of just the soul and sent for my old wrestling partner Bretel the vestal.  An old injury that had ended her career in the ring had left her with a weak grip and a torn rotator cuff, but she could still raise the spirits of any soul, bless her heart.With a full company, the small band set out to explore a small section of the ruin.  To this day Reynauld and Dismas refuse to give account of how their first encounter with the occult and undead went.  All three of them had to spend weeks in isolation, drink, and prayer before they would speak.  Bretel will not be in the same room as either of them, calling them selfish and masochists.  None of them will tell me what happened to Machel.(x . x)This is a great game, especially for being in Alpha.  It might be a little on the expensive side, but it's a very well balanced and playable game at this point.  It's challenging, especially at the very beginning or when starting with fresh characters.  As they level up and you unlock higher levels for your characters abilities and gear, and as you get a better sense of what classes go well together, the difficulty eases off a bit.  A lot of the mechanics which seem to be unfair and do nothing but punish you in the beginning do so much less as you learn how to mitigate them (basically, stick in there if you're having trouble, it gets better!).I'd recommend this to anyone who likes dungeon crawls, rogue-like games, and/or D&D players.

								Okay, so this game is only about 25-50% complete, and there is a lot of missing content (early access OFC), but it still packs a good 40+ hours of questing, looting and burying fallen comrades. This game is INTENSE, and it will make you feel things. Some of those things are frustration and anguish. -- a lot of those things are, but you feel them in a good way. Just when you think you have this game figured out, and you have a clear path to victory, it rolls back the curtain and shows you how utterly doomed your characters are.			"

								Darkest Dungeon is a lot like Rogue Legacy where you have a constant influx of adventurers and a randomized dungeon ahead of you. If you're lucky, your runs will yield a tonne of gold, but if you are not then you'll drive your party insane or dead.The game is about pushing your luck, and managing wear on your party members. There is fun in building a very competent team and taking longer embarkations as you build up. Buy this game if you enjoy:1) turn based combat2) character progression and customization3) pushing your luck4) discovering new combinations and interactions (try not to read too many in-depth guides)			"

When the warriors started to get hurt, the doctor started to find out he was not cut out for the job of saving lives, started losing it and killed himself mid battle. The archer saw all of this and got so stressed out he got an heart attack and collapsed.The other 2 warriors stood their ground and won the battle. After the battle they died 4 meters away from the battle scene because of hunger.Best game ever.  0/4 survived..10/10 entertainment.			"

								An excellent game that's well on its way to a successful release after early access.  Its roster and party based gameplay, with the macro game of upgrading the town to improve your squads, is akin to XCOM, and you may find yourself getting attached to specific characters!  Its turn-based combat is deep, with many customization choices of skills and character positioning.  The game's difficulty level can be intimidating at first, but the fact that it's easy to continue with new party members means you will learn for your mistakes and your hard-fought victories will be all the sweeter.  Overall, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a strategic turn-based game, especially at its current 14.99 sale price.			"

												Great, inspired game that falls short due to too much unexplained randomness.Edit: I gave this game another shot and am having much more luck and fun, but problems still exist. Currently at week 30-40. I will say the randomness is not as much an issue as much as a lack of agency and the fact that the game does not give the player enough info to learn how to get better. In addition many of the challenges are simply asanine. Playing with higher level characters becomes unmangeable because it costs more to do even essential things such as treating for stress. Most of the time I see challenges being shoe-horned in just to be challenging rather than being clever, thematically relevant, logical, fun, etc....Other examples:-How is hunger processed? I had to eat twice on one run in the first 5 rooms, while in other runs with same team I ate once after many more rooms. If I spend 8 food in camp and then 1-2 rooms later have to eat again, this seems very illogical. It just doesn't make sense at all.-Why does my character with 50+ dodge get hit several times in a row when my character with 5 dodge succeed 3/4 times?You can get many hours of fun from this, but be warned that at a certain point it starts to feel like a time waster rather than a engaging challenge.

 ""Great is the weapon that cuts on its own.""This game is a masterpeice. With six hours played I only nearly scratched the surface.This game is about if heroes in RPG games were more human. Characters get stressed out if attacked or if its dark. There is a bar that is called the stress bar. If this fills up you can become afflicted (most likely) or virtuous (rare). This is one of the main draws.Another main draw is permadeath. Like real life, if you die, there is no respawning. If a character dies they are DEAD.Also there is the torch. This mechanic is my favorite draw. If the torch is darker that means you get more stressed out, get surprised, and even get crits if the torch is low enough.The combat system is siple yet complex. You pick an abilty and it has a certain amout of damage, targets, and special feature. Like the Vestal's judgement: it heals her after hitting an enemy.There is just so much charm to this game and more things i can't write down.So far this is my GOTY. 10/10			"

If you want an unforgiving environment with level caps and a large portion of RNG, this is also up your alley. If you're a fan of good gore, and music, and a dark flair to the genre, akin to Dark Souls (except less life ending) this is up your alley.I would also add that you'd be wise to invest in the current mods that assist with just general UI overhauls, and town buffs. They're nice, and don't intrude too much into the ambience of the game.  "

								The game is fun at times, but really needs some work still (I know it is early access).For example, my party is fighting the Swine Lord. I kill the little swine and the Swine Lord goes berserk. He attacks my party again and again, chain stunning the entire party, and eventually wiping my entire party. Was there any indication I wasn't supposed to kill the little swine first? No! It was just a random event that happened which led to an entire party wipe. You spend hours building up a party, so losing an entire party is painful. What a waste of time and not fun at all.Until they figure it out I wouldn't suggest this game...			"

												As a bored college student, I have two very limited factors in my life: time and money. As such, I try to find games that are cheap, have plenty of content, and can be picked up and put down in a small amount of time. Darkest Dungeon delivers all of these aspects as well as a great setting that is only bolstered by the art, music, and narration.Gameplay:Darkest Dungeon is a Rouge-lite 3rd person horror rpg that puts an emphasis on struggling for resources and the mortality of your party members. Combat is turn based, and offers a ton of challenge due to the game's stress feature which can cause your party members to gain quirks, or have heart attacks and die.Art and Music:Darkest Dungeon's art fits the name quite well: gritty and dark motif that takes ideas and concepts from the likes of H.P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker. Not a moment is spent without a sort of grotesque abomination, or some sort of foreboding scene. The music is hard to describe, but it does its job perfectly. In your town, the music gives a desolate feeling, while in one of the dungeons the music is non existant until a fight happens at which point the music is grating and fast paced, giving a sense of urgency.Narration:All of the games story is done through narration in the style of Bastion. The narrator's voice is beyond a perfect fit for the setting, and there is no shortage of lines he says to either make you feel empowered, or hopeless in the middle of a battle.Length of Play:Each dungeon takes about 10-20 minutes to complete depending on what level of dungeon it is and what the objective is. This is perfect as it allows for breaks to be taken and ample opportunities to quit without losing any progess.Price:The game is $20, which I think is a good price for this game as it holds many hours of quality content. If it's on sale, then it's just even more value right there.			"

												Wow. There are many negative reviews, and i understand it, but i fell in love after five minutes. But the storytelling, the varietiy of hero combos, and the fact that i could be interested even when every map is, more or less, the same (each hall is 4 squares, each with a possibility of battle, item, etc. and then a room). If you like XCOM, this is a game you will love. there are a lot of classes, and certain teams have fun names. You have to level huge numbers of people before you get anything serious done, but the layout of the game offers so many opportunities to change your style. There is so much to explore, and you can risk it all or risk very little. Sometimes it does seem ridiculous that there are so many crits, or so many dodges, but you will get just as many, if not more. Items are sparse and you will lose or anbandon a few quests, but there is always a chance to come back. Anecdote (don't read this if you've decided against this game or don't care): I had an entire team going into a battle against the Swine Prince. Healers, big damage, damage over time. Everything. The battle started with the Swine Prince and a little pig next to him. During the first turn he marked several people, who subsequently lost about half their health. So I killed the little pig, which afterward turned out to be a horrible idea. Every turn my heroes reminded me not to hurt the little pig while the Swine Prince was landing whole team attacks with big damage and stun. Looking back, the little pig murder was a bad idea, but i managed to win with a Leper at Death's Door. Thsi game is exhilirating and unique. The art is incredible and the story draws you in like few other games i have experienced.			"

												Saying this game is like a side-scrolling Dark Souls is inaccurate, because this game is much harder. Darkest Dungeon is an old school turn based, party combat strategy RPG. The plot isn't too deep, but is enough to keep it going. A search for mystical power underneath your family's house opened a portal that unleashed monsters upon the surrounding areas, so now it's your job to recruit heroes and send them out to complete various missions throughout the area. Now, make no mistake, your heroes will die. A lot. So really, don't get too attached to any of them. Now, this game is a dark, gory, brutal, and balls-grindingly hard journey and is not for the faint of heart. Examples of this are illustrated in the stress mechanic and the art style. The art style is a beautiful hand-drawn style, highlighting the shadows, scars, blood, and insanity on people's faces to give off a very grim, dark, and sinister look to represent the game's themes. The other highlight is the stress factor. This game's big selling point is realisitcally showing off how fantasy heroes are regular people too, and they have their quirks and flaws, as well as how dungeon crawling and fighting skeletons, demons, and other unspeakable horrors would affect a person's sanity. As characters are injured and exposed to certain events, their stress bar fills, resulting in either an ""affliction"", causing them to gain personality traits that will hinder your party's effectiveness, or even raise the stress of other characters, or a ""virtue"", a buff that allows the hero to lower their stress and the stress of other party members, or even randomly heal themselves. The heroes themselves consist of a vareity of classes. They include but aren't limited to: The Vestral, which acts as the healer, the Plauge Doctor, a DOT/Debuff character, the Leper, the game's tank, and the rouge-esque highwayman. Every character also comes with their own ""quirks"", traits that can alter combat stats, damage resistances, susceptibility to stress, and even restrictions on how to relieve the character's stress. The combat is turn based, with party positioning a strategic choice, as characters must stand in certain positions to be fully effective, causing you to sometimes sacrifice certain character's ablilties because they can't stand in the right slot, as you need that slot for another character to be effective. Some enemies will throw this positioning off, forcing you to spend turns righting the order instead of attacking. The only two cons I can think of consist of an audio problem and an annoyance in gameplay. In cutscenes, the audio will cut in and out at random, causing me to skip most of them altogether. The other is the ease in which you can land in a ""mosquito bite"" spiral. You'll lose gold for failing an expedition, which means you won't have enough to outfit another expedition, whch means you'll fail, causing you to lose more gold, leading to a game-wrecking and vicious downward spiral that renders the game almost unplayable.An overall expertly crafted RPG with unique mechanics, great atmosphere and a new twist on dungeon crawling.9/10			"

												Hello everybody,I like the game very much and am ""diggin in"" in this dark hopeless amtosphere! The combinations of different heros with different skills provides a high variety of play fun. The challenging difficulty forces the player to think carefully in each dungeon wether it is short or long.

												Hello everybody,I like the game very much and am ""diggin in"" in this dark hopeless amtosphere! The combinations of different heros with different skills provides a high variety of play fun. The challenging difficulty forces the player to think carefully in each dungeon wether it is short or long.

												I would highly recommend this game to any fan of roguelikes or RPGs alike. I find myself playing this almost daily and getting my butt kicked about 50% of the time. But you keep coming back, ""Should I do one more dungeon?"" The answer is usually yes. It is very punishing difficulty-wise, I recommend maxing out the companion wagon as soon as possible, if you have 1 or 2 bad runs in a row, you might find yourself basically starting from scratch. At least if you can rehire 4-6 people each time you can ammend that problem.The game is with a few cons, I find the graphics very flash-like, I still really like them, but that may turn some off. I also found the early game pretty grueling. Took me at least 10 weeks in-game to really get the ball rolling.Other than that, great game. The difficulty is more rewarding late game. I found mid-game a breeze, so once I got to the hard bosses, I appreciated the butt whoopings again. 8/10, love it. Unique, addicting Fantasy RPG. I would give it a 9 or 10, but it gets a little too hard once you reach the later dungeons, its not fun to have to grind an entirely new party back after losing them all due to a spike in difficulty.Edit: I should mention if Status effects got on your nerves in RPGS...this game is totally going to get on your nerves.

												This game is a blast. And, as it tells you, is about making the most out of a bad situation. As with every chance based games, you have to ""game the RNG"" by consistently making the right choice at the right time. Stun or damage? Heal or Attack? A single bad choice can cause a massive chain reaction. But when you get how to play the game (ie: always account for a neutral or bad scenario; interact with the environement only when you have the % on your side; and so on) everything starts clicking in place. And you learn it quite quickly too, the hard way :)			"

Early Access Review
								A good old dungeon-crawling romp through 'Ye Olde Eldritch Nightmareland'. Purge the realm of undead, tentacle monsters, spiders, bloodthirsty brigands, and cultists, or just go insane.Can be more unforgiving than Hand of Fate. Where that was a game about building up your singular hero in a relaxing, tavern-esque adventuring tale, Darkest Dungeons is more about resisting entropy--knowing to recognize when your group is headed the way of a complete nervous breakdown, while facing a dungeon's monstrosities.The combat is Turn-based, but with a unique system of class and position management, and a stress system that will utterly destroy the cohesion of your group if you're not wary. This would almost make for a horror game, if it weren't mildly humorous, and tactically-minded. Each of the different class characters will eventually go paranoid, steal from the party, become masochistic pain-freaks (the plague doctors in particular remind me of the TF2 medic, if they take enough physical abuse), or start hallucinating calls to action from their God, that make your entire party come alive in a random, somewhat prefab, but nonetheless characteristic way.Of particular note, I enjoyed the resting mechanic, which basically lets you pick a good time to rally the party with food and firelight, and offers a number of abilities each class can use to maintain the party's cohesion. For instance, if you're carrying a leper, you can have him considerately confine himself from the rest of the group, at his own expense, to help reduce the team's stress. Or, you could just have him lift his mask and get some physical relief, putting everyone off. The crusader gives pious rants, the barbarian can curse and swear for personal relief at other's expense, the rogue can scout for monsters, the priest can say a prayer for everyone or put up a protective ward around the camp.Resting almost becomes like its own recovery-based combat round, and the varied options for each class felt fresh and neat. It puts cRPGs to absolute shame, with their rest-spamming cutscene to forget all the party's wear and tear in one instance. (Obsidian and Bioware could take a page from these devs.)The soundtrack isn't anything unforgettable, but like Monaco, the music conjures elements of tension, fitting your gamestate. Unlike that game's ragtime jingles though, in Darkest Dungeon, when you're on a mission, you get tense metal, percussion, and ambient noise that intensifies the closer your torch comes to sputtering into total darkness. Of especially horrific note, is a sewer/catacombs themed level, filled with emaciated pigmen to put Amnesia to shame. When things go pitch black, the soundtrack fills with the echo of their distant squeals. It's a fantastically chilling touch. Meanwhile, your narrator, in the spirit of Cthuulhu callback games like Eternal Darkness--is a dead ancestor with an ominous voice like an evil Don LaFontaine, egging you on with encouragements, and grimly announcing your stumbles into starvation or  mortal injury.The game has a nagging issue with difficulty, in a similar sense to X-Com: Enemy Unknown, in that you'll be dealt a starting tutorial prefab that gets you utterly ♥♥♥♥ed the first few times you play. In particular, your starting crusader always has Kleptomania, and will often deprive you of loot you try to scavenge, until you take him to the Sanitarium--a facility that doesn't unlock for you for a few adventures.Additionally, you do not gain access to a balanced assortment of classes all the time, and there's definitely an ongoing resource-climb that you can fail, if you spend too much on the wrong things. I would compare it to luck rolling underground steam vents and UFOs in the resource-management portion of Enemy Unknown--a bit of a merciless crapshoot that might demand you scum the whole game.All in all, Darkest Dungeons captures the bleakness of Lovecraftian horror in a fun little procedurally generated, resource-gathering dungeon crawl. The kind that takes breaks in the style of X-Com or Patapon, but reminds you that starvation or defeat is only a few bad moves away, nonetheless. Enjoy it if you like that kind of thing. I did.			"

												Only after many crippling losses, frustrating encounters, unfortunate outcomes, and landing myself in a situation where even the most mundane quests seemed impossible to complete did I truly fall in love with this game. To say that Darkest Dungeon is a hard game would be an understatement, as disaster is always a possibility and dare I say inevitable. What makes this game different from other RPGs is that luck is more involved than any objective mechanic, as anyone who has played more than ten minutes would be able to tell. With this in mind, anything is possible at any point, whether it be searching through an inconspicuous bookshelf or in a chance-encounter with a boss. In a way, you the player are in the same position as your heroes fighting for your estate, but whether you prevail against adversity or crack under pressure and end up leaving a bad review is not up to RNG. Ultimately, Darkest Dungeon is a game that demands a lot from the player mentally, and it is understandable to feel hopeless, fearful, or abusive as that is all a part of the game, but unfortunately this frustration can lead people to hate the game for being what it is; an unforgiving and unrelenting RPG that will refuse to allow everything to go in the player's favor but instead require the player to react to a poor situation.Before buying, it is vitally important to understand what it is you're getting, and that is true with anything and is no different with this particular game. Aside from outlining the gameplay, the artstyle is incredible and I would be remiss to not mention it. The art alone was enough to entice me into buying, and I was not disappointed by that aspect of the game. All in all, everything is subject to opinion so I can only hope more people get to enjoy this game where others would not.			"

It gets repetative with the same predictable boss battles.2. At higher levels, the enemy models are just reskins with different tinted colors.3. I played at least 10 hours before noticing that I'm doing the same grindy missions over and over again. 4. Only 3 levels to go to.Hopefully they'll have more content when this gets fully released.

												The apparent commercial success of this title is the best example of style over substance I have ever seen in the context of PC gaming. There's a lot of style in this game and it is compellingly presented. However, the game that lies beneath the presentation layer is tedious and grindy. It's not a difficult game; it doesn't particularly challenge your intelligence, or memory, or reflexes or anything like that. What it is is a tedious and frustrating game. There is a difference.If you are easily amused and like shiny things you may like this game. If you are easily bowled over by a slick presentation, and don't notice or care that you've been doing the same thing again and again and again - for hours - then you may like this game. A lot of people seem to. But if you are a more discerning person, well... I'll say no more. I just wish I had gotten a poster for my 20 dollars instead of what is essentially a gothic-reskinned version of Cookie Clicker.BTW check out this critical review (it's not me, however I absolutely agree with what this person says):

Early Access Review
								This game is not about playing to win, or even developing characters. It is about setting you up for a frustrating exercise in futility and leaving you with absolutely no hope. The items that bestow stat boosts also carry penalties. The money and resources spent developing your hamlet will leave you without resources to purchase items for quests. You will experience random deaths and afflictions of characters, which you will be unable to cure because you lack money needed from finishing dungeons. In other words, this game has been overweighted to such an extent that it is designed to cause you to fail at every turn. And not matter how careful you are, you will lose. The worst part is that you will be unable to level any characters up high enough to advance in the game, because they will likely gain so much stress and affliction they will die of a heart attack before reaching level 2. I appreciate the lovecraftian elements of this game. However, the developers have weighted the game to such an extent against the player, that it isn't even enjoyable to play. That said, if you simply want to play to see how long you can go before all your characters die, then this game will provide at the least a lot of entertainment value because of the narrator commentary and creepy graphics. To be fair, I think the developers have a decent basis for what could be a very versatile game to the broader gaming community. But at this point, it is purely designed for graphic visual value, because it isn't even challenging - it's hopeless. If anyone in the company or development actually reads this review, I would urge you to consider programming some variability into the in terms of challenge levels. It would probably have a broader appeal to the larger gaming community. As it stands now, I think it is likely a very small niche group of folks that would actually enjoy the gameplay. Examples of in-game issues: Want to heal outside of combat? Nope. Healer skils are only available during combat. And food only heals one lifepoint at a time outside of combat - while penalties like bleeding and plague continue to linger outside of combat. You can cure them with items, but if you don't have the money, you don't have the items. You can only camp to restore life in certain dungeons, so if it's a single-shot playthrough dungeon with no camping option, you have no heal ability outside of combat. Treasure drops in the dungeons are so random and rare as to be not worth it. And healing abilities in combat are somewhat random in the amount they restore. The game is designed to kill your heroes. Period.  You can leave a dungeon at any time. But if you do, it may disappear, which means you lose out on the item rewards for completion. Further, you don't get to keep provisions purchased but not used for the next dungeon. And the costs to remove and heal heros who are likely crapping themselves when they return to the hamlet means you have little resources for provisions in the next dungeon. I like the concepts in the game. And I appreciate the developers really aren't going for a game that's playable to win - it's more about sacrifice and how far you will push to complete. The problem is, if you do push then your heroes will likely die and you won't finish the dungeon anyway - and you can't advance in the game if your characters don't have higher levels, which require money and resources gained from dungeons, which cycles back to the basic problem. Psychologically, there's very little positive reinforcement in this game, and a whole lot of discouragement and negative reinforcement such that if you are attached to your characters or advancing in the game, you are in for an excercise in frustration. This type of psychological situation doesn't affect everyone negatively, so if that isn't a consideration for you, you may very well enjoy this game. I don't recommend this game to the broader gaming community. However, if you are the kind of gamer that appreciates the dark, twisted, and impossible to win kind of game that leaves you breathless and frustrated (and I know there are gamers out there like this), then you are in for a treat. This game won't disappoint. Improvements that could help this game are healing abilities being active outside of combat, or having food restore far more health. But then, I suppose that would mean your heroes might not die as quickly, which would defeat the whole purpose of the game probably. At the least, it would be good to have variable levels of challenge settings in the game in order to help players at all levels truly enjoy and appreciate the dark storyline and potentially awesome gameplay. Right now, however, it just isn't there outside of a niche group.On another note - I spent hours investing time carefully cultivating characters to be able to take on the first boss (the hag). The turn system in this game is so random, that the hag ended up having multiple turns before I even got a shot off, and she wiped out my whole party with her pot (which she puts your heros into to cook them). The whole battle was a joke. To say that I think the game developers have a tremendous amount of work to do on this game is an understatement. The part that upsets me the most is that I cannot get my money back. But certainly, it is the last time I will ever buy a game from this company.			"

Early Access Review
								A unique dungeon crawl experience with exceptional atmosphere and brutal, roguelike mechanics to ensure that every encounter is dangerous and meaningful.  The stress mechanics alone are enough to make the game stand out from its predecessors, but the game goes a step further with interesting line combat mechanics and customization options which serve to distinguish the game from any others like it.  The game drips with atmosphere from the outstanding artwork to the enriching, if at times sesquipedalian, narration.I feel the game stands out for its emphasis on resourcefulness.  Due to the randomness of recruitment, character trait assignment and dungeon generation, it's extraordinarily rare to put together an optimal party for all situations.  There are times where your primary healer will be nursing her paranoia in a tavern, or you'll design a team to defeat a boss only to have it ripped apart by an unfortunate monster spawn.  Each class has 8 active abilities and 6 camping abilities, of which you can only take 4 and 3 with you respectively.  As a result, you often find yourself assembling teams and kits which aren't great for any situation, but are good enough for every situation, and therein lies the beauty as you tend to scrape by tough encounters more often than dominate them, making those encounters memorable and engaging.My critique in its current form are tied with the volume of information you must keep track of.  Each character in your group may possess as many as 10 traits, both positive and negative (and might have some diseases on top of that) which can have various impacts on their abilities.  These traits will also change over time after each successful dungeon run.  Add onto that having to manage equipment, skill and camping skill layouts for numerous party members and it can be a bit daunting to remember what role each character plays in your group and which dungeons they would best serve in.  Consequently, at least for me, most of this information ends up being ignored.There is some commotion over the new mechanics introduced by Red Hook, but I personally feel the game has continuously improved over the course of its time since its beta release.  To cover some of the more recent changes, corpses present another opportunity cost question to your party (should I scrap a more general purpose ability for one that's not as useful, but clears corpses) while heart attacks further test your risk/reward assessment abilities.  Increased PROT for monsters adds value to blight/bleed effects, which themselves require planning around as enemies might be more resistant to one or the other.  I do not endorse early access games by in large, but I will endorse this game.  If you are looking for a dark, unforgiving game that tests your resourcefulness and willingness to take dangerous risks for the promise of substancial rewards, purchase this game immediately.  For $19.99, you are getting an exceptional bargain for the entertainment you'll get with this title.As a bonus, the game's narrator will also likely improve your vocabulary.			"

												The problems with the Darkest Dungeon since it got its full release is not that it's harder. Or that the RNG is against you. For me, the problem is if you don't look up youtube videos and read the wiki cover to cover, the gameplay sucks. There's no trial and error, because your party will be wiped out, your gold reserves emptied and you'll have to start again and go through the painfully long tutorial. There are so many times where I've found a boss, tried to fight them only to realise that they endlessly summon. By the time you've worked out that this is indeed a bossfight, you've lost. I'm all for no hand holding, but DD seems to delibrately deny you any clues on what the hell is going on until it's too late.EDIT: I wrote this review quite late and upon looking at it again, see I've left off the end. There IS a good game, once you get past the ridiculous learning wall. The aesthetic is brilliant, the difficulty, once you've thoroughly read the wiki, is just right to be always challenging. The gear upgrade is a bit pointless, as are the skill levels. However, it's rather made up for by the plethora of trinkets you can equip to tweak your characters' stats.Overall, this is a good game if you have the patience to persevere, but I couldn't recommend it as it is with so much vital information witheld from the player.

								I am very excited to see where this game is going.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic tabletop, dark themes, and testing their luck against difficult odds.Atmopshere / Theme / Art:I love the non-traditional art style of the game - the character and background art is cartoonish but it manages somehow to add to the charm of the game, not take away from it.  The narration is spot-on and well-done and I found it to be an enhancement to the game.  The atmosphere is consistent and nicely executed.Gameplay:I found gameplay to be enjoyable, personally.  I love the simple but effective UI - it plays like a casual game but there's much more to it under the surface and you can really feel that.  It has all the pros of a point-and-click and none of the cons.  There's no twitch, which I like, and I absolutely love that your decisions are well and truly final.  There's no save-game trickery, no way to go back on a bad choice.  You live with what you do no matter what.I find the game to be a great diversion and will be playing the heck out of it :)			"

								 Alrighty, adding my opinion to the many already here! DD does a great job of taking a classic set-up and giving it a good spin! You and your characters travel through an atmospheric world that perfectly captures the feeling of despondence felt by the towns folk and your long suffering party members. The upgrade system in the game is scaled very well and the enemies are also well suited to keep you and your characters in check as you go up in level. Balancing stress and health, especially when camping, is an important part of the game and really gets you invested as some enemies attack physically and others make your characters really feel the psychological strain of the quest. The enemy types are also quite varied so each new attack feels interesting as you plunge through the depressing landscapes. On the other end of the spectrum it is sometimes hard to keep track of your characters. There were several times in the game where I tossed high stress individuals into my party because I didn't notice they were already at 100 but I do blame that more on my own inattention than the game itself. I also find myself getting angry at the characters when they fail a saving throw, again, it's an important part of the game and it does really well in making you think about human nature and all but the 3rd time your Hound Master becomes Selfish and steals 2500 worth of loot you're going to wish you could order your highwayman to shoot him. There are also a few bugs for me but it is in early access so I'm not worried, they go away when I restart the game(which takes about 1.5 minutes).All in all I thought it was a great game! Sorry for my disjointed ramble, hope it helps you decide if you want to buy the game! "

								This game is not for everyone, or really most people. You'll like this game if:1) You like having to replace party members due to death or them not being able to function2) You like misleading probabilities; 70% misses much more than you would think3) You like having to contstantly manage your group's inability to function after a few encounters4) You prefer debuffs to buffs. Every enemy gives you a debuff with almost every attack.5) You like failing missions or having a high chance to fail every mission6) You like very slow progress which can even--and does--go backwards7) You like being punished investigating your environment8) You like having to frequently and involuntarily rearrange your group order; group order determines what skills you can use9) You don't like using high level characters on all content. Level 3's can not do level 1 and 2 areas. Level cap is 6.10) You like playing games that feel stacked against you in every part of the game11) You like every item to have a negative stat to balance the positive stat it grantsBasically, play this game if you don't care if you succeed and want a hard game that is hard because it is unfair. You will be frequently punished, and it will be completely unavoidable and random. The game mechanics are interesting, but they beat you down so much that it makes it really hard to stay motivated to play.			"

								With the recent changes to make the game a bit easier on the new commers (taking out battlefield corpses and heart attacks), I really like where this game is going. I love the art style and gameplay mechanics meshed with the micromanaged city building and upgrading. With that said, this is easily one of the hardest games I've played, but the sense of accomplishment you get after surviving those dungeons really keeps me coming back. I'll keep playing this for a long time :)			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a rougelike tactics game where all of your adventurers are expendable and playing long enough will allow you to win, however how glorious your victory is largely depends on how you manage risks and rewards.  For example having to think about how much food to bring while exploring a dungeon or if you should throw out anti-toxin in favor of gold is a fascinating mechanic.  Considering whether you should just dismiss a hardened adventurer instead of spending weeks and thousands of gold restoring their sanity.  It's a fun time if you don't mind having expendable characters die for you.			"

								Listen, this game is hard, it is unforgiving, but it is fair.  Darkest Dungeon may screw you with RNG every once in a while but for the most part it is a tactics game of planning and skill.  It is easy to play, easy to understand, but difficult to master. Redhook studios has done such a good job sticking to thier vision of a dark and difficult game that is taxing, you will feel excitement, you will feel your heart pound out from your chest as your team stands at death's door and one hit could end it all. You will scream in anguish win they die, you will  shout in victory when they win.This game does everything right, and the sound design is on point as is the art. I warn you this is not for the faint of heart, but if you take the time to learn it, you will have a great time.			"

												Best thing in this game is that you can really relate to charaters.When they are stressed, you are stressed, when they die, you die inside.In the very beginning of playind DD, after losing a character you may feel like: ""Oh no! I liked this character! What a crappy game!""And then after playing about 30 hours you'll be like "" Aw yass I've only lost like... two characters thats greaat!""Sometimes when your occultist heals your dying character for 0 and gives him bleeding you may want to quit the game, uninstall the game, uninstall steam and your OS and then throw your computer out the window just for sure...So difficulty level isn't that high...   And for pussie... I mean players who dislike difficult games, you can find lots of mods that make this game easier, on nexus.I'd give this game 10/10 but this game has some Lovecraft-Style lore so I give it 11/10.

Early Access Review
								So Darkest Dungeon....So far I have truly enjoyed this game. It is difficult and unique enough to want to continue. It feels very close to the difficulty of 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. However, there are a few key aspects that make this game actually impossible.1) Most enemies have attacks that target the entire party. No one in your party has any attack that can hit more than two people except the highwayman. He can hit three. Also, some of the party wipers that are multi unit hits have afflictions (I.E. Blight, and bleeding.) The highwayman hits people, that is all. You have single unit to two unit afflictions at best.2) The Bosses are unreasonably difficult. The level one boss in the ruins, against the Mad Priest hiding behind pews is too difficult for a party that was level 4, with level 2 equiptment and rank 2 abilities. He is a level one rated boss.3) The loss of sanity is like taking a bottle of water, taking off the cap, and draining the bottle to 7/8 emptiness and then complaining that you're thirsty and it isnt enough. If anyone in your party is sane after a dungeon, you should probably go to a casino immediately to capitalize on the new found super luck you have acquired.Aside from horrible balance issues, literally impossible boss fights, and god awful suicidal standards of heroes...It isn't a bad game. It is in early access, and there is room for improvement. That does not mean i do not love this game. Totally worth it if you hate yourself or enjoy watching guinea pigs (cough, i mean adventurers) wander aimlessly into suicide and failure, or want to have PTSD like flashbacks of Dark Souls moments.8/10 so far.

												Very compelling game - at first. You can (just) live through and rebuild, expecting to lose heroes fairly often. At first you can buy or find junk items. But after a while, it starts to dawn on you. EVERY item you find is basically junk - you can power up but only by making yourself too weak to live in another way and the negatives on the items are much more than the positives most of the time. I've had dungeon runs where I begin and before I have a turn half the party is diseased with crippling afflictions, yes before I've clicked a single option. Well, that is the RNG I suppose - but you can also have 100% light, have camped to obtain maximum chance to surprise monsters and scout ahead. So by being tricky and careful, you've got MAXIMUM odds and walk into a known encounter - yet right at the next-to-last encounter, your whole group is surprised and decimated before your turn begins. That's undoing everything you've achieved and it feels extremely cheap.And it doesn't get better, it gets (much) more futile. I've faced off against a boss (recommend level 5) - not the max one - with a full maxxed out level 6 group, with zero negative attributes (which is EXTREMELY expensive to do), maximum positives after 20-30 hours of building them and with max power items. Used luck and strategy to enter the final battle in PERFECT shape with maximum power from the camp right before and hey, I'm surprised. Again. So all my heroes are diseased, bleeding, afflicted and stressed. One is at ""Death's Door"". Before I get to do anything.Gee, fun. Your actions matter zero. Your preparation matters zero. Your time mattered zero.Now that is fine if you're party is weak, or if you didn't enter with EVERY. SINGLE. THING. PERFECT.But come on...So, gee what a surprise your perfect conditions matter zip. Within 3 turns had 4 deathblows occur because ALL your attacks are ""Dodged"". And your mage healer does ""0"" but makes you bleed. Twice. Really?Yeah...Right.But hey, it's only another 20 hours to try again to smash your head against the same boring wall. Again. And Again. And Again.256 hours of play, lost against the SAME boss more than 20 times, telling myself it's just horrifically bad luck. And that somewhere I will unlock the fun part, because there's hints that this could be a GREAT game.But it doesn't change. It's every goddmaned time. So this monotonous march to machocism is fun?!?Nope.It's not from poor strategy - the group has half debuff powers to reduce the big boss damage and maximum chances to occur against an enemy where mathematically you have 70%+ chance to succeed. But every, Single. Attempt. Fails. And the enemy criticals you. Every. Single. Time.At that point I uninstalled because that's bull. It's not a question of ""keep trying"" or ""bad luck"" but of ""stupid, rigged game"". Instead of adding more content, they jimmy the supposedly ""random"" odds just to make it impossible, I guess from a sense that you'd use up the (very) limited content if not.Your strategy - even if you somehow pull it off - matters ZERO.So then why bother? That's a failure of a game. A beautiful failure with amazing sound. But that's even more a reason not to bother.There's difficult challenges and then there's a game where you look in disbelief and say ""give me a !@#$$% break"". I played for more than 200 hours so it's definitely fun - at first - but after a while you simply will be frustrated by ""random"" (really?) events that undo every bit of strategy and make the entire experience a frustrating farce where nothing you attempt matters anyway.But hey, they did update something - added an encounter you HAVE to do which kills off ALL your best guys. Oh and if you retreat, you lose 2 of them. You can beat that enemy if you can debuff him. But he dodges or it fails 90% of the time.But you don't HAVE to do the encounter. It just ruins the town you've (had to) pour all your cash into. As in - ruins it.And it reappears 5 turns later. So if you want to have anything built AT ALL you HAVE to do this fight and win it. If you somehow survive it, you MIGHT have one character left who is crippled and has 3 diseases.Good luck doing it 4 turns later.The realtiy is - you can't. And you won't. And you can't stop the same stupid encounter appearing over and over and over.So the town you build up gets destroyed. Over and over. And you can do NOTHING about it. Except waste your time watching your heroes die before you can click anything.And if you do somehow totally luck out, you get to ""win"" an item that basically screws over anyone who uses it. Funnily, the game says ""are you SURE you want to enter the dungeon? You have no trinkets equipped?"" Well, yeah I'm sure because they all suck so bad you're better off without the supposed ""treasures"".I've tried both - and you do better without their crap.And that's basically this game to a T. You're better off without this supposed ""treasure"".Don't waste your time on this f---- pile of absolute futility.Two thumbs down.			"

												Three major problems exist in this game that are highly frustrating and ruin what is otherwise an enjoyable and interesting game.1) The costs for removing afflictions and reducing stress are FAR too high. No one enjoys throwing 50-75% of their earnings into a gold-sink mechanic after every dungeon.2) Battles and game mechanics in general are too reliant on RNG. No matter how well made your decisions are in battle, you are regularly put to your knees by crits/dodges/resists and other such nonsense. RNG is fine, but it needs to be used in moderation if the player wishes to maintain some sense of control.3) If you level a character quicker than  you complete dungeons, he becomes useless as he refuses to enter a dungeon that is a level below him. There are several mechanics that the devs could have implemented to stop high level characters farming dungeons. Simply making a character unusable and forcing you to draft a newbie is frustrating as hell.Good things to be found here, but not enough. Bought it on sale, still regret it.			"

I'm glad I decided to buy it anyway, because not only the game is amazing, but the most controversial features that enraged many players can now be toggled off.The gameplay is smooth, the Lovecraftian art style is fascinating and the challenge keeps you engaged and anxious.There are no save points, but a constant autosaving, therefore any choice, any event and especially any death (including your favorite party's or character's) is permanent!In the end, this is a fantastic and unforgiving game at the same time, with a dark, thrilling and captivating atmosphere.

												Darkest Dungeon is a great game, but not for everyone. If you enjoy a game that forces you to figure out mechanics or fail spectacularly this is the game for you. Alternatively you can watch videos / read wikis / whatever, but the fun in it, for me at least, was the game + needing to figure out the ins and outs of all the different skill and battle mechanics to succeed. The only issue I have with this is that it is just sort of dropped on you at the end. It essentialy goes:Easy dungeons: You can get through with almost any party comp given you aren't particularly unluckyMedium dungeons: You generally need to understand what team comps work and play the classes to their advantages OR have weapons / armor / skills fully upgraded.Hard dungeons: Bad luck can ruin a run the first or second battle, but the key is to always retreat when this is the case. Other than that you have to be a lot smarter about how you maintain your heroes health and sanity by using down turns to keep everyone healthy and to strategically use camping and items. The Darkest Dungeon: Pending you don't read a tutorial before hand you will almost inevitably fail your first few attempts at each of the four levels simply because you really do need to understand all your heroes, the enemies, and the bosses to do well. One thing you'll notice about the hardest and end game dungeon is that it sounds like you will likely lose heroes. You probably will. If you get really into the games you play and attached the characters you build up or realy just want to use specific heroes and play only one particular way, you will get angry at the game and you probably won't enjoy it. If you are also prone to rage quitting the game probably isn't for you. Bad things will happen and half the game is figuring out how to salvage the situation or in the worst cases how to build back up to where you were in the most efficient way possible.All that said, I love Darkest Dungeon. It was everything I hoped it would be when I first saw the original trailer.			"

												I want to get this out of the way right now. If you dislike RNG heavy games then this might not be for you as pretty much everything is RNG. You can tip the scales in your favor but everything is all about the roll of the dice.With that out of the way, Darkest Dungeon is one of my favorite games. The presentation as a whole is so wonderful. The gloomy atmosphere, the dark artstyle, and the music all come together to bring a masterfully made world.The gameplay is hard to compare to anything else. The closest I can think is like, (classic) Final Fantasty mixed with X-Com. Turned based battles where the position of your characters matter greatly. This game makes you think about every move you make before you make it. Even healing because you have to think. ""Is it worth healing my characters over killing this monster that could make my heroes stressed?"" Speaking of that, the stress system is what drew me into this game in the first place. An RPG where it explores the themes of the stress a ""Hero"" would go through when exploring these dungeons filled with horrors and fiends. It had me hooked as soon as I first heard about it.As it says when you start it up. ""Darkest Dunegon is about making the most out of a bad situation."" This game takes time to learn and even when you do learn it there will be stuff out of your control. Much like life there will be things you can not predict. Even when your whole team dies, you must stay strong and continue your quest to drive the evil back.... or give up and become one with the Darkest Dungeon.			"

												I bought it as kind of an experiment, because I've seen a friend of mine playing it a lot and I was somewhat interested how can it be that my friendlist constantly shows Darkest Dungeon under his name - I did't see a screenshot of the game before buying it.Glad to report, I regret nothing. Darkest Dungeon is a point and click dungoneer rougelike, where you are controlling a wide variety of heroes (4 at a time) with the rest of them living in the ruined town above the dungeons. Each exploration attempt in the 4 differently themed dungeon (seamonster caves, bandit road leading to town, ruins, and the darkest dungeon) you'll recieve loot that you can use to rebuild the town, restore it's buildings that provide your heroes equipment, relaxation, new heroes, cure and training, with each upgrade opening up a better option or making them cheaper. The combat and exploration is turn based with the latter being ""real time"", and the distance you make equals to turns per specific sections.The cartoony looks is really working, the audio effects are nothing special but do their job well calling the deathly atmosphere to life. The strongest and most essential part here is the Narrator, the only human voice you'll hear in the game aside from the accusations of that damn depressing risen who hides his mouth. The Narrator has an interesting speach pattern, not shakespeare english but similarly ""higher"" poetic, really being the icing on the gothic cake. So the atmosphere is a perfect hit, but how's the gameplay?At first, you are going down to all the various exploration trips out of curiosity and wanting to see everything, but once the 4 (really 3, because the darkest dungeon is far, far endgame content) different enviroments become familiar and you spent all the at first seemingly plenty resources, sooner than later you'll face that for your next desired upgrade you have to clear 3-4 dungeon runs. I understand that some kind of scaling is necessary to keep the game the longtime fun it is intended to be, but the scaling is way too harsh. I consider myself lucky I upgraded my town in a way I did because after a point the dungeons won't offer low level exploration trips anymore, and make no mistake, you WILL die in this game, you WILL see your favourite heroes die a horrible death in combat, fall to madness, have a heart attack, and the endless resupply of newcoming adventurers to the town can leave you with amateurs who have to face that they don't have low level challange to beat anymore, happy that did not happen to me... yet. Also the game works towards almost entirely unavoidable failure of your heroes though the stress mechanics that cause a wide variety of mental illness / personal flaws such as addictions, selfishness, mazohism and these lead to uncontrollable actions that futher stress the entire party, so you have to put away your ""sick"" hero and throw in a lot money on his/her cure, which means somebody has to take the place in the meantime, so you'll have 2-3 full set of heroes varied all the time. More countermechanisms to pressure would have been nice, and could have been done without making it ""comfortable"" for the user, but having 17-25 stress points added to all 4 heroes per turn vs some enemies when you can ""heal"" those in the dungeon IF you are lucky on top of IF you are landing a critical hit / multikill with one move to heal 3-7 points on one or two heroes is ridicolously unfair.One thing that I think is just a minor thing on the end user side but a major flaw from the development side, is having so little visual custimization options for your heroes. You can choose from 4 premade color patterns and rename them, but that's all. Having the option to choose from 3-4 different armors, maybe hairstyles, or just the actually visible clothes / armor upgrades at the blacksmith change the looks on the hero too not only on the armor in the inventory, would have a HUGE boost on being connected to your favourite heroes and caring for them, making their fall all the more painful (which the game intends to do so, just could do better. After a point I see them as easily replacable throwaway tools, a bunch of statistics that help me along, that's it).I really focused on the negatives here, but that is only because the game otherwise is so good, I love it so much that I cannot help but want to make it even better. Among all my recent purchases this year, this was definitly the most worth it.			"

												Dazed, reeling... about to break.The game is tough, but it has a reliable set of rules you can work with. Like any game with ""rogue-like features"", failure is desired, nearly guaranteed and eventually predictable with experience. Combining with a campaign you basically cannot lose, Darkest Dungeon lets you come back into the game and learn to adapt. It's a shame it does indeed get a little tedious and repetitive at some point, especially when some sort of major setback hits you and your roster of heroes. Apart from that, especially due to flavor, developer effort, unspeakably awesome art and sound direction and the strategic playstyle paired with some hardcore elements to punish mistakes very harshly, I personally deem this game to be one of the best indie titles of the century.

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!At one time I heard that this was a fun game .... BUT not ANYMORE!At this time I can’t recommend this game, the developers have totally screwed it up to a point where it is no longer a challenging rpg game. Instead it is now a time sink and grind fest game.Game mechanics are...Level up heroes to farm gear and what little gold you can.Then delete them when upkeep gets too expensive or before they hit the next difficulty level.Hire new heroes and equip them with your better gear to farm just that much better at low levels.Rinse and repeat until you can get best gear and money. Ending up with a conga line of characters entering and leaving your roster.GG enjoy playing Darkest Dungeon (football team roster simulator) "

												Not a bad game but the main opponent is the RNG.  There is a warning screen which tells you that your party will die throughout the game.  The problem is that most of it is out of your control.  In combat there is no active role, you pick what your people do and they do it, which means any damage you take and whether or not you hit is completely up to the computer. Taking too much stress damage? Your character isn't high enough level.  Not dealing enough damage?  Your weapons aren't upgraded enough.  Trying to do some easy missions for money to upgrade your characters?  Too bad.  They leveled and will only do harder missions.  All in all it's not a BAD game but there is too little control over the mechanics to make it feel worthwhile.  Go play Paper Mario or Fire Emblem.  Maybe buy this on sale.			"

												I'm going to start of by saying, this is not a ""rouge-like"". It may have perma death, but this is more of a gambling RPG game, everything you do is a gamble. Some people may find this fun, but most people that like a challange will hate this game because unless you want to challange your ability to get RNGesus on your side, the level of skill vs the level of randomness makes this game feel like punishment. It may be fun because of its ""hardness"" but that's only if you enjoy getting hours in, only to have to make a new game because its been a up-hill battle from the begining, and your luck will never change.

												Darkest Dungeon is not easy at all. Do not come in expecting to frolic and play in the Brightest Fungeon all day. This game is a dark, painful endless run. It will make you have fear. It will punish the smallest of any and all mistakes. You will have to be a true master to succeed. But when you do, it's all the better.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a 4-slot position-based RPG wherein you are tasked to continuously send frightened explorers and warriors into nightmarish wealds and slovenly brackens, with the sole purpose of rebuilding your ancestral home back up, brick by bloodsoaked brick. Your chosen party members and reserves are not hired and outfitted with the expectancy that they will live for the 90 or more times you dive into another excursion--this RPG is roguelike in nature, meaning death is not only expected, but it it imminent if you wish to fight through most of the tougher bosses. In sacrifice, there is radiance--your stressed-out heroes have equal chance to find  either middling madness or courageous zeal. As a bitesize roguelike, Darkest Dungeon will have you sending 4-person parties consisting of a handful of diverse classes and skills into horrid ruins, with the aim usually to do something like exploring 90% of an area, fulfilling all room battles, or slaying a boss enemy. In battle, there's a quaint selection of status ailments, movement shuffles, debuffs, and heals to be slung about, varying depending on your characters. But, there's also the element of Stress--a value that increases or decreases depending on how dim you keep the torch you bear, how many sickening critical hits you take, or what ailments and entrapments envelop each characters. At the edge of Stress lies the maw of madness; a Fearful hero may skip turns, while an Abusive one may hurt itself or berate others with increasing Stress. On the flip side, some characters will have the chance to rise up, becoming stronger and wiser as the tide of the fight turns. This singular feature alone is a wonderful addition to the RPG formula, and adds a lot of strategy to the scope ahead, as well. It serves not just as a thematic difficulty weight, but to also insure you consistently play with and utilize a variety of different teams and playstyles. it's quite a brilliant way to put forth the idea that each encounter with the unknown and the eldritch has a palpable effect on your poor adventurers, thus necessitating a visit to the bar or an internment at the medical asylums between missions. When you aren't imploring your mercenaries out to the evil realms, you're constantly upgrading your haven. Early on in Darkest Dungeon, the focus is less about your adventuring roster and more about preparing your former hovel to a battle-ready home. Eventually, you'll be able to not only pay less for cures and heal more people effectively, but outfit leveled characters with better armor, weaponry, and buffed skills. As upgrades grow and characters get stronger/better, so too does the knowledge of how to better tackle traps, examine weakness of each enemy type, and formulate teams with synergy. It's an expertise that comes with both time and effort, since your stronger teams will not likely emerge until a few areas in your town are updated permanently. In this way, I've found this game much more accessible than other roguelikes like FTL or even Binding of Isaac, which gave you more options on each playthrough but did not guarantee what you could carry on. In Darkest Dungeon, even if you manage to wipe out your entire roster, the progress made in your village will ensure that the following adventures you have go by smoother due to the capability to actually upgrade stats cheaper and faster. Thematically, Darkest Dungeon is beyond excellent; from the initial mood that narrator Wayne June dregs up like a thick fog of horror, the grim resolve permeates everything that is said and done throughout your journey. The notes and quotes of your ancestor litter each major boss fight's foreword, and with every strike and discovery there's a notation of victory--or defeat. Rarely is there something so notably incomprable when it comes to presentation, but the narration here is so enjoyable. Equally enjoyable is the fantastic art style, a kind of Gory/Mignola mashup that isn't quite hyper-real but still manages to be unsettling and shadowed with something sinister. A great many monsters are legit gross and abhorrent, which goes a long way at encountering some of the more disgusting bosses and knowing you're in for quite a match. I'm not a roguelike guy at all--I've never even come close to beating stuff like Isaac or FTL or even Invisible Inc, much as I love those games and enjoy their mechanics. However, I've clicked with DD mainly because the ""failure"" of losing characters, even after a great many victories to build them up, doesn't cause me pangs of extreme grief. I am not the character--I am the descendant, and the township is my legacy, not the life of the mercs. This format allowed me to accept that the future excursions would become less fraught with peril, although the threats and stress therein will always consistently provide some sort of challenge. It's that roguelike everyone has where you can put 100 or so hours in, doing convenieently menial or repetitive tasks yet always curious what's next. What team composition can I try next? What lurks beyond that threatening curio on the map? Which quirks and diseases should I heal--or spend a fortune to lock? When it comes to ""that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rng"" claims--I have to laugh, as this is no different from any rogue/rpg/etc. The real elements of distress and fear of death are what seperate this from most smaller roguelikes, though this game's really no different in handling RNG-based tragedy than Fire Emblem or XCOM--both games that I love. Sure, there was rarely a boss that I beat without a significant death from my team, but again--this is a slow march towards getting better and building smarter. As far as options go, for those who are not a fan of systems like enemy corpses affecting slots or heart attacks making stress potentilaly more taxing, the devs have chosen to give normal runs the ability to switch those features on or off. I admit, at first I found those features a bit overwhelming--before I began paying attention to the upgrades that would even the odds. I've played with all the normal features turned on since and never felt like they hindered me immensely. Darkest Dungeon has been a pleasure to play, from its early access inception to its ultimate released form. There have been stumbles along the way, particularly nerfs or buffs that made me initially think that the game was on very thin ice. However, Red Hook's willingness to be flexible with toggled options and updates have won my trust, and I've found that there was more advantage given to the player over time when it came to things like debuffs and movement options. That I've played almost nothing else the past few weeks since their latest flurry of updates and upgrades says a lot about how fantastic I think this stress-inducing, mind-melting jewel is. What I love most is that even at the lowest point, I've been able to start again and stronger than before--not just due to the progress of the town, but based on what I learned from each triumph and failure before. That, I believe, is the mark of an outstanding roguelike. I've stood gallant and fearless as my Vestal withered into madness, depending on the Leper messiah to slay the Formless Flesh--and cheering silently as he proceeded to hew through the horrid menace with a much-needed hit. I've seen my entire force slaughtered and boiled to bits my the malignant Hag, cursing my fortune and vowing to return in due time to turn the tables on the morrow. I've watched entire parties crumble, only to rally around one lone Crusader who decides to get Focused at the peak of his stress. And I've accepted defeat at the maw of the malicious Shambler, foolish in my confidence that my rank 1 group could possibly outwit the Lovecraftian beast. DD is as much about the stories and failures gifted as it is about slowly accepting your knocks and eventually besting the opposition. The match is struck; A blazing star is born.			"

								After all this time, this game still amazes me. Developers really put their heart and soul into it and the last Radiant Update polished everything to the last bit.Yes, it's difficult, it's reckless, it punish you for small mistakes, but it's like it should be. There's RNG but if you plan carefully, if you pay attention and take your time, you will succeed. DD is not like any other games I ever played. You always want to enter that extra dungeon, check that additional room, kill that last boss, even if you did that hundreds of times, and sometimes you pay an horrible price for it.I recommend this to anybody that wants a slow paced game in which you need to calculate every move, every party combination and every skill. Can't wait for the Crimson Court.			"

								Some rougelikes are fun, challenging, games with a interesting stories that reward long-term planning and lateral thinking. This is not one of those games.Darkest Dungeon is pointless and arbitary. If the it seeks to invoke an atmosphere of hopeless depression, it succeeds, but not by any merit of gameplay or writing. It is existentially boring. The forced-horror of immediate and irrevocable character death forces an attitude of detached nihilism that creeps into deep ennui after twenty minutes. Quests amount to ""Fight the Palatte Swapped Sprite of Lazy Game Design"" and no real motivation or incentive is provided for finishing, or even playing the game.			"

								I read the earlier reviews, and I like a challenge, so I thought, ""what the hell? I'll give it a go.""No, do not. It is brutual, right out of the gates. Fatal actually - you have ZERO chance of surviving. You will not finish this game, you won't even finish a chapter. Not for lack of skill or planning however. Read on.I'm hoping perhaps a patch in the future will resolve this - but as it currently stands, the game is impossible.PLAYABLITY ISSUES: There is no ""recovery"" once in the dungeon - where you could fight to a certain spot, then return to town and resupply or recuperate. A rational person would say, ""we can't go on, we must retreat."" Retreat means failure and penalty. And the mission cannot be reattempted. It's first try, or fail.It's a death match to the end of every mission - and because so much of the game mechanic  depends on random chance and blind luck, even a well prepared party can have one bad battle, and  literally be doomed.INTERACTIVE ITEMS: Don't bother, my experience was 99% were traps, diseases, or stress inducing maladies inflicted upon my party. that these typically occur right before a battle was no accident either. I was badly injured, defeated before the fight even began. Did I mention there is no retreat to recuperate?Want to start a fight poisoned, blighted, or bleeding to death? Go ahead and open that book, crate, or sarcoghagus.RANDOM LUCK, NO SKILL INVOLVED: As others have stated here earlier, you can go through a fight with out a scratch against a superior opponent, only to be taken apart by a pack of maggots that all score critical hits the next fight. It's maddening.There is no healing AFTER battle, (And your healers forgo offense to heal during) heavy wounds give a variety of diseases and stress-related offenses, and of course nothing tops the battle where a necromancer hit my entire party with a massive stress-inducing spell (""6 feet under"") and they ALL died due to heart attack. In the same round...simultaneously. Wheee....On many missions you can camp - ONCE - and recover a slight amount - but you'll never return to proper fighting form. If I was lucky, I might get back to about 50% of my original strength. And this was typically after 2-3 fights!VERDICT: This game shows a lot of promise, but currently the game mechanic renders it  unplayable. I'll leave it in my library for a bit and see if there's a patch in the near future. Otherwise, it's done.			"

 I'm sorry, guys. I need to gush. Look, I'm not a big fan of RPGs. I have no patience to play through a Final Fantasy nor a Mass Effect game.And yet this has easily landed in my top 3 favorite games I've ever played.Let's start with my pet peeve in RPGs (or any game for that matter): lengthy story. This factor is non-existent in Darkest Dungeon. The intro to the game and opening to a new playthrough both have cutscenes that last roughly 4 minutes altogether. I can easily live with that. From here, a lore is sprinkled throughout the game by a wonderfully gritty narrator that speaks during gameplay. That being said, more is revealed about the enviroment just by the interaction in the game. Interacting with objects and seeing enemies allows the player to imagine what happened (or is happening) to the dungeons they're fighting in. I adore this. There's no lengthy dialogues or other cutscenes to keep you from playing the game, let alone have a story. Granted, it's not a masterpiece novel; however, with all due respect, I gladly take this over an Assassin's Creed game where there's almost as much cutscene as gameplay (yes, I have played Assassin's Creed II, and this is merely an opinion).Let's get to another great factor of this game: it's sure challenging. Overall, it's a challenge. It's not I Wanna Be the Boshy difficult, but it's harder than your average game. I say ""Overall,"" because the difficulty changes throughout your playthrough. First-time players to this game will find it BRUTAL (I did). Enemies could do as much damage as you (if not more), dungeons are filled with events and hazards that greatly influence for units for that current dungeon and possibly even for the rest of their lives. What do I mean by ""rest of their lives?"" Well, your units will die, and death is permanent in this game. Your level 3 Highwayman is gone; go pick up a level 0 at the stagecoach. Throw in some financial issues, and you got yourself into quite a pickle buying this game.And yet you will learn.You will learn what the best combination of units are. You will learn what hazards are in each dungeon and how to resist them. You will learn that not all the equipment in the game is bad and ultimately use it. You will learn how to manage your units' stress (I'll explain later) inside and outside of battle. Eventually, you will find yourself with a roster of decently-leveled units and some gold to spare on some supplies and neat-o upgrades. And yet you will learn (about bosses).Regardless of your units' levels and skills, all the bosses in this game will leave you either dead or scrambling. No, it's not just a big enemy with 100,000 health that deals 100,000 damage. Every boss has a unique mechanic, and you will need to learn them quickly if you want to survive your first attempt. For example:  At the beginning of every round, the Prophet will predict that a ""catasptrophe"" will happen in certain spots in your party. What this means is by the end of the round, units in those spots will take massive damage. This makes the player make a decision: who to put in these spots and take the hit? This is a problem, because moved units cannot attack the Prophet. It's a matter of survival or desperate attacking. Let's go on to one of the more prominent factors of the game: stress. Dark enviroments, recieved critical hits, and stress-inducing attacks all give your units a certain number of stress. When a unit's stress reaches 100, they will gain an absolutely awful trait. These range from paranoia to selfishness to plain insanity. Each of these traits does something different. Fear causes a unit to either move back or refuse to fight. Abusive units will constantly insult their comrades. Irrational units...are irrational. In a new update, if a unit recieves 200 stress, they will die.Not all hope is lost! Despite all this,  there is still a small chance a unit will gain ""virtue"" when his/her stress hits 100. This means they will gain a GOOD trait, and stress is greatly reduced. I could go on about all the interesting mechanics this game has to offer, but then this review would rival the length of War and Peace. I am leaving a lot out to say.Now, if I could take a more personal turn, this game has genuinely changed my way of thinking. This game is all about making the best of a bad situation (they even tell you that), and the odds will almost always make you cautious or even be flat-out against you. Every little thing that happens could add up and ultimately destroy you. Or do they?When I first played this game, I felt very pressured every time a trap was triggered, a unit was blighted, etc. However, I learned these are things inevitably will happen as I play, and I will have to deal with them and/or get rid of them if I wanted to succeed playing this game. Heck, many things in this game could be easily solved with clever thinking or even a single item.(This is where it gets a bit sappy, folks) In my personal life, all the littlest things would stack up every day and often drain me, but playing this game made me realize that these things just happen, and I should accept them and figure out how to surpress them or remove them from my everyday life altogether. It's rather easy now that I actually try instead of take the hits from the minor drek.And for now, I am out of things to say. All I can say now is I love this game. I am more than happy for paying the whole $20 for this (it's apparently $25 now, but I would happily pay that price as well).By the way, everything in this game looks hand-drawn, and that is g-e-u-d goooooooooooooooood.

												Great concept with a few serious short comings. The initial apprentice dungeons and intermediate veteran dungeons are difficult, yet well balanced and rewarding. This isn't the case for the champion dungeons. I understand the game is based on the concept of ""making the best out of a bad situation"", but the late game difficulty spike is ridiculous. Basic enemies encountered in champion dungeons are seemingly on par with previous boss fights. My best heroes (max level, equipment, and skills) we're more often than not getting hopelessly roflstomped 2-3 battles in...even on short scouting quests. To make matters worse, management mechanics become increasingly skewed. For example, the weird level cap system prevents heroes from partaking in quests below their corresponding level, making it unnecessarily difficult to train badly-needed replacements and raise funds. Overall, late game play feels less about exploring dungeons/smighting evil  and more about bolstering lost gold and manpower (tedious/unrewarding grinding). After a couple hours of frustration, I threw in the towel. I doubt I have the motivation to finish it in its current state. Total shame, I really enjoyed it up to this point. I realize Red Hook has plans to implement a short mode. Hopefully they address some of these issues/give the game more mass-appeal. Until then, I can't recommend this to anyone but hardcore RPG fans.....casual gamers stay away!			"

												Darkest Dungeon is an outstanding game.  The Lovecraftian and other influences from weird tale authors make for an extremely enjoyable story, and the aesthetics are equally appealing. The gameplay itself is easy enough to pick up, and once you do you'll find that there is quite a bit of leeway allowing for a variety of game styles and strategies.  The expeditions you take with your parties can be fantastically cruel sometimes, and people WILL die, but I've never ragequit so far, which is a testament to how addicting the game can be once you get into it.  If you like anything similar in this genre, I definitely recommend getting Darkest Dungeon as well.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a grindfest, but addictive as hell! It's simular to Rogue Legacy in the sense of repeatedly playing the same dungeons over and over again, slowly gaining the resources and upgrades to proceed further the next time around. There's actually quite some roll playing going on. Although sometimes assigned too random, the positive and negative traits of your heroes, as well as the many distinctive classes, makes the characters come alive. They'll slowly gain experience and improve, and you care for them because once dead they're permanently gone and all progress is lost. The game isn't too hard though, although some bosses can be ruthless at first try because you didn't prepare the right squad to tackle it. The combat might appears generic turn-based, but there are enough subtle mechanics to keep it interesting.The art is like a dark fantasy comic book and the briljant voice over is the finishing touch.

Early Access Review
								I was significantly impressed to say the least!  It feels unique and is a great spin on a turn based tactical combat RPG.  I think the thing that makes this game have an entirely different feel from most turn based tactical combat RPG is the fact that it is not that inexorable leveling of your fixed party and continous progress.  This game is tough and is about making the best of a bad situation.  There is a bit of a 2 steps forward and 1 step back feel as heroes you grow attached to die or the RNG gods do you a bad turn.  Incredible value for $15.00 IMO.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is the best real life simulation I've seen in gaming!Everything constantly goes not as planned, the odds are oftimes against you, your team often has to run without completing the quest, even when the goal is nearly reached; game punishes you for being rash and greedy... I understand that the devs' goal was to deconstruct dungeon crawling RPGs with unbreakable fearless heroes who constantly walking from one hell to another without even breaking a sweat. Well done on that! Game absolutely destroys many a videogame cliche.It's one of the most depressing games I've played, in a good sense! I feel very very bad for my heroes and their constant sad talk is not making things any easier.And I get infinetely butthurt by the whining of some players 'meehh, my heroes are always stressed', 'meeh, game is too RNG'. Son, your life is RNG as hell. And trying to accomplish something is stressful. Especially in the ♥♥♥♥ing Lovecraftian hell with living skeleton jelly and human-pig hybrids. Deal with it. Or go back to your games about mighty heroes who kill armies singlehandedly. This is not a game for you. This is not 'Press X to win' title.This is more than a game. This is a whole new look at dungeon crawling genre. Definetely recommend, even Early Access. The game has some flaws, but overall awesomeness negates that.10/10			"

												If you can't stand turn based combat similar to the old Final Fantasy games, then you won't like this game.  If you enjoy that turn based strategy style of combat I believe you will LOVE this game.  You basically assemble a party of four heroes and go exploring in the dungeons of the game including ""The Darkest"" of the dungeons.  There are traps and enemy battles along the way.  The various character types have different abilities and you have to think about your choices.  Each charater has permadeath so when they're gone, they're gone.  The game has persistent saves so there's no going back and loading an earlier save state.  The art and style of the game is unique and beautiful.  I am writing this review with 11 hours into the game and I can see many more hours being poured into this title.  Don't let the price tag scare you away.  $19.99 is a good price point for a game like this.  The game is quite challenging by the way.  I got frustrated early on until I figured out some of the finer strategic points.  Easy to grasp, hard to master.  The enemies are interesting, the mood is dark, the game is fun.  I suggest it.			"

												I am here to make an edit on my review. I made a review about how the game can be too unforgiving, making it feel the game wasn't giving you a chance. Now that the game is fully out, I'd like to say the game is 10x better. They made the game more playable. That's not to say it wasn't before, but now the game has times where you feel really good. The difficulty is still somewhat the same, but enemies are toned down, drops are much better, and there were a few other mechanic changes/tweeks. Before I would have given the game a solid 7/10, but now with all the changes that have been made, it is an easy 9/10. Pick this game up. If Bloodborne's world took the design of Dark Souls characters, and put it in a JRPG style: it'd be this.			"

												This is a tentative recommendation. I've logged many hours myself, but I still find the game tricky to recommend. It's a really a ""you'll like it if..."" kind of game.What draws me to the game is its artwork and atmosphere, as well as the strategy and tactics of managing a team of characters. The aesthetics in particular are fantastic! Very inventive and compelling dark fantasy stuff. And there isn't exactly an abundance of turn-based team management games, either. Both strong factors for the game.However, Darkest Dungeon has abundant frustration, and not just the challenge-based or stress-based frustration you would expect, but sheer irritation due to the way many of the otherwise clever game mechanics have been executed in practice.The root cause of that frustration seems to be that the game's designers are incredibly paranoid that the player won't play the game 'correctly'. It really can give you the feeling of a judgmental game designer hovering over your shoulder, telling you that you're doing it wrong.-You shouldn't extend a fight against a weak enemy in order to have extra turns to heal your weakened heroes. Doing so will cause your team to become arbitrarily stressed out.-You shouldn't set up a control-heavy team where you try to keep dangerous enemies stunned. Many of the more dangerous enemies are very stun-resistant, and even if you do land a stun move, that enemy will gain extra resistence to the next one. Meanwhile, using stun moves instead of dealing damage means your fights will take longer, leading to the same issue as above.-You can't grind out easier levels with your best heroes in an effort to afford upgrades or further level them up. Heroes of a high enough level will flatly refuse to go on easier missions. Once a team crosses this threshold, the game difficulty suddenly ratchets way up because they will actually be underleveled for the new bracket they're restricted to.-You shouldn't put together a team that focuses solely on killing the front two enemies quickly, because there are corpses that block your way. Attacking the corpses to clear them out of the way doesn't count as proactive behavior anymore either, so your heroes will again get stressed out as if you were intentionally trying to delay the fight.Frustratingly, none of that makes any sense in practical or thematic terms for the game's dark fantasy world. It also limits the variety of options available to the player, instead shunting you towards more ""developer approved"" playstyles.So, the game has the awesome and rare core design of being a dark fantasy team management game, but seems to be designed by someone who's absolutely paranoid that you will Play It The Wrong Way. If you can get over that it's pretty great!			"

												When your heroes become too strong for the early quests, they refuse to go on any more of them. So you're forced to jump up two difficulty levels—I think that's a very artificial way of forcing difficulty, but fine. So I'm a couple fights into one of the harder dungeons, and I come across some standard-looking mobs. In the first turn one of them crits my healer for all of her health—ALL of it. She's the only one who could have healed herself back to life, so I'm ♥♥♥♥ed. I try to flee—failed. The bigger mob does an AoE that crits my ranged dps for all HIS health—now he's ""on death's door"" too—and finishes off the healer. Fail to flee again. They kill the dps. I don't know what would have happened after that because I closed the game, and I'm not going to be opening it again. Permanent deaths and one-shot critical hits should not exist in the same game. If you're stoical enough to bear massive losses from a string of unlucky dice rolls with equanimity, then you are a bad enough dude to enjoy this game. I'm not.			"

Early Access Review
								When I saw Darkest Dungeon I felt in love !And I rarely buy a game at first sight...But let me explain what is Darkest Dungeon. [Long Review]Plot:After his suicide, an old relative in his last will reveals that you will inherit of an estate cursed by an old evil dungeon.You decided to claim your property and bring back order to this land.But on the way your coach is attacked. Leaving you and your body guards surrounded by cutthroats and bandits. After having dealt with them, you arrive at the miserable and gloomy village that belongs to you.Now starts your adventure, you will bring back the old stability of the village and purify the land and, maybe, put an end to the terror lying in the nearby ...  Darkest Dungeon.Layout:Darkest Dungeon is a dark and mature rpg. You mission is clear, get rid of monsters that threaten your estate with the help of warriors and the village that belongs to you. The ultimate goal is to reach the guardian of the Darkest Dungeon to put to an end the madness that curses the land.The main aspect of the game is psychology. Indeed, every character is affected by its environment, especially in the dungeons. The light in corridors, actions like opening a chest or triggering a trap, resting and even fighting can stress your warriors and make them weaker with debuffs called: Quirks.Of course you have many ways to reduce it, the most important is the village where you can unlock and upgrade buildings dedicated to relax your characters.But beware, death is inevitable and permanent. And it's a part of the game to create teams of 4 characters with different   set of skills/ classes and be able to cycle between them to explore and accomplish quests effectivelyVenturing into dungeons needs planning, you can select characters, their skills (4 max per warrior), equipment and supplies because into dungeon they need to eat, to light their way and use items to counters bad events such as debuffs after fights or random encounters like when you are stuck in front of rubbles and you need a shovel to go through with ease... but the shovel is expensive and takes place in your inventory like loot.Even loot is a problem because money takes precious slots in your inventory!To move in the dungeon you can use a little map to choose your direction or even see what you may encounter if you had the chance to scout the sector (random event), and after to progress in corridors using movement keys or mouse. Your group  walk in order until they find something and you will need to select one of them to activate an item that in general trigger a dice roll influenced by the skill of the character, the item you used with it or maybe the both.The game is set around few phases: Recruiting and management of your characters, Management of the village, Planning quests where you have to buy supplies/gear for your team, Exploring Dungeons and be back alive to take another team while the last one needs to go to the bar, brothel, abbey, sanitarium... to recover from the horrors they lived.Gameplay:Darkest Dungeon works around a good fighting system. Each party has 4 characters, they are ordered in a straight line where placement is important. Even skills depend of this placement. In general close combat fighters are in front line, slots 1 and 2. And healers and range units are in slots 3 and 4. This system is great especially in front of stress which is one of the most dangerous attacks your warriors will receive. Indeed some enemy units stay behind their buddies and send attacks that fill stress quickly. So even if you have a nice combat team with good damages and restorative effects, you will need someone capable to manage the placement of the enemy. By talking of the enemy, this is a real devil capable to focus on the weak ones, ambush you or even flush your team composition, leaving you in chaos and hurry to find the best formation to endure the fight.The feeling during fights is extraordinary. At the beginning you will have problems to grasp the subtleties, like for the plague Doctor who is a marvelous crowd control that will save you if you use him correctly.But when you get the overall idea, you will enjoy counter attacks or even some fights where the enemy is just unable to reach you. By the way it's a part of the game to stun enemy and use this moment to heal your team and go further.Even light is important. It's a bar that shows the light you produce. The fact is, the more light you have, the better you heroes will be (less stress, less enemies). The funny thing is some items are related to this ""light meter"" and even spawn rate of monsters. You want more challenge and money ? Try your luck into the darkness!It's one of the many funny events this game has, like when you can camp in average and long dungeons to recover some health and reduce your stress and debuffs. During camping you use a completely different set of skills for each character that you can modify and upgrade like regular combat skills. The moral feature of the game is really funny especially when your team is totally exhausted and one of you characters (it depends of the class, Hellion is my favorite for that!) is inspired and during battle brings back his comrades moral and give them strength to win.And when your team is mad it can be the contrary, like when one of your guys does little damages or misses and one of his buddies humiliates him. Even passing the turn of a character makes him angry and increase his stress ! Consider that everything I said can be applied when things are right but in a weaker mesure, like when a monster die, good events/discoveries, criticals and you have a good idea of this system.Graphics:Darkest Dungeon is a gem. Art work is amazing: you play in a comic. The game is in a beautiful 2D and sprites are very cool. Only the Dark design might disturb some but the game stays correct all the time. Not too gore or vulgar. I hope more developers will follow this way and give nice atmosphere and design for unrivaled gameplay.Music:Nice and greatly participate in the gloomy atmosphere of the game. I love the intro video where the narrator is excellent. But more voices would be great.To conclude:Darkest Dungeon is already a gem, even if the game needs some balancing in combat, for an early access it's amazing.Everything is cool  and original, even the difficulty is correct if you consider that the enemy uses the same strategies, like in Dark Souls. The only aspect in don't like are the speech bubbles of characters that appears too often and when your team is mad it can be really annoying to wait each time they finish to talk to be able to act.By the way I would like to see more interactions between characters, like friendship or the contrary. To make things more realistic and reward you when you succeed in keeping your teams alive and your characters in good shape.You can notice few bugs in the game but the autosave is enough present to keep your progress saved.Okay, so if you read my review, go up , search the green button, press purchase and enjoy.N.B: If you think the game is in general based on luck (don't believe players reviews) it is not.In fact if you take some time you will understand that taking risks or being too greedy brings bad luck.Few exemples: Maintain your light meter around 75% before entering a room. A team of monsters may ambush you.  Openning everything you find on your way, without knowing the appropriates items, characters will receive quirks and  stress at a higher rate.  Ambushed, retreat from the fight and come back to have a regular start, don't forget to rearange your team. Be ware or food and torches. 10 of each will save you, especially considering that meals are random event that can trigger even after a previous one... And torches reduces stress rate. So spare your money on blight and bleed items.			"

Early Access Review
								The immersion of this game is friggin' fantastic. Everything in this game fits together so well: the music, the atmosphere, the action... It all works together. That cinematic trailer for Darkest Dungeon? It really captures exactly how the game feels.In combat, the music is tense, and the camera zooms into attacks for effect. It's very quick, so no time is wasted, but it makes every attack feel exciting and apprehensive. There is a narrator that really pumps up the excitement as well, commending a crit or a kill... or a loss. When your stress limit hits 100%, the hero's resolve is tested... and there's a brief pause... will he become Courageous and rally his comrades? Or will he become Hopeless and become the doom of everyone? Town mechanics are pretty neat too. You upgrade the town facilities using these items you collect from your adventures, but you upgrade/fix your heroes using the gold you have accrued. This separation of resources is nice, because it lets you focus your gold on party management. Party management is pretty nifty but simple. Between adventures in dungeons, you can put various party members in the tavern or abbey to relieve the stress they have added up through adventuring. You can also slowly eliminate negative afflictions that your heroes have.The game's main gimmick is ""Stress"". As your heroes fight in the dungeons, they will become stressed after witnessing unsettling things or taking critical hits or being debuffed by the enemy. The higher one hero's stress is, the more susceptible he/she is to the enemy's attacks. This can also trigger the hero's quirks (ex. Stress > 50: -2 Speed). At 100% stress, ""The Hero's Resolve Will Be Tested"". When this happens, RNG will happen to see if your hero can overcome this or not. It's quite epic to see your hero get a perk out of it and display his/her heroism. It also feels incredibly hope-shattering to see them become 'Hopeless' or 'Abusive'.In addition to ""Stress"", there are also ""Quirks"". Each hero can have good quirks (perks) and bad quirks (afflictions). These are permanent attributes to a hero, and there are ALOT! There are several ways that a hero can earn a quirk. At the end of a dungeon, there is a chance for a hero to earn one. During a dungeon the hero may learn something from a book or an altar. Quirks include things like ""Slugger"", ""Evasive"", ""Slayer of Eldritch"" or ""Syphilis"", ""Creeping Cough"", ""Deviant Tastes"". You can even get quirks in town!. For example, your hero enjoyed meditation so much that they gain the ""Meditator"" perk which makes meditating more effective. Or perhaps they went to the bar to relieve stress but earned the affliction of ""Tippler"", making alcohol their only method of stress relief. There is a building in town that lets the player pay gold to rid afflictions one at a time, but it will cost gold and put the hero out of commission for one adventure.The last gimmick of the game is the in the Dungeons. There is a light meter that continually drains as you make progress in the dungeon. The darker the dungeon is, the more dangerous and stressful it becomes (but more rewarding as well!). Before you enter the dungeon, you will buy and bring provisions with you such as food (to heal or feed your party when they get hungry) or torches (to increase the light meter as you consume them) or other misc items like shovels and bandages. As of this review, the game has a few bugs, some more noticable than others. Notably there are bugs regarding gold and text. It's relatively stable in my experience. I had two crashes on Day One but have not had one since. There are a few questionable balance decisions that are being pointed out in the forums, and hopefully they will be weighed and addressed. Definitely feels like it's in beta, but it's very playable in it's current state and it's lots of fun. I can only imagine how this game will look once it leaves Early Access. I have high hopes here!There's also this thing that people are butthurt about, and it's a kickstarter exclusive class. Though I am a kickstarter, I was not in the donation level to get it. I have no idea what it is and I totally forgot there was one. The game as-is is awesome, and the lack of one class was not detrimental to my experience. Might be the principle of the matter I guess, but I can say at least that this game is not broken without it.			"

												I decided to give another rogue-lite a try, see if I could get past the old issues I had with them and I have not. So I can't in good heart recommend this title. It is one of those kind of games where everything is based on luck. RNG all over the place. Quite frankly I don't find that to be ""difficult"" at all, just unfairly unforgiving. Difficulty is giving the player a goal, the means of completing the goal and then allowing the player to show their skill and accomplish what is set in front of them. If the player has to rely completely on RNG to favour them then it is not difficulty. And there are far more RNG's that favour punishing the player than there are RNG's that favour giving the player a helping hand. The scales are tipped too heavily on one side and I just found it frustrating. The art design is great, I didn't pay much attention to the story as it felt too background'ish to care about, the combat is interesting and has potential, the setting is drearily neat, the sound design is ok I suppose. What I'm getting at is that the rest of the game is pretty much fine. It is really good in some ways. But the RNG mechanics of the game just kills any enjoyment I could squeeze out of it.			"

												Decent game at first, then it just gets to the point where it's not fun any longer.  The RNG doesn't seem so random, and you really get the short end of the stick a vast majority of the time. Whether you are getting critted constantly, getting a lopsided amount of negatives added to your character at the end of each run, or encountering an enemy that can just blow themselves up (and placing your entire team on death's door), the game is just too frustrating to enjoy for me personally.  I don't mind when games are difficult, but when the difficulty is increased exponentially by the computer getting ""lucky"" way too often on what is supposed to be ""random"" rolls, it's takes the joy out of the game.If you play games to have fun and not to get more stressed out than you already are from work/school, then I would recommend stearing clear of this game.

								Step 1. Hire level 0 adventurers and give them no items.Step 2. go as far into a dungeon as you can collecting loot.Step 3. Fire all of them and hire new level 0 heros.Repeat forever.Darkest dungeon has no way to lose the game and most upgrades just reduce prices by a negible amount. And everything costs large amounts of money. I'd swear this was suppose to be a buy cash mobile game with how much everything costs, how grindy it is, and that is just impossible to lose.The first thing you will want to do after your first day of playing is turn the narrator volume off. He repeats himself CONSTANTLY and just plain ticks you off stealing slots at the tavern or church. He doesn't act insane or woe is me at all, and neither would I spending all my time gambling, drinking, and sleeping with a brothel. I'm not sure what is more annoying. The fact that after each dungeon run up to all 4 adventurers might gain a negative trait or how often enemies can dodge, especially enemies in the back that like to use sanity lowering moves.The game does have items called trinkets, but most have negatives that rarely seem to make them worth using. You can't even sell them, yet the game will offer to sell them to you for high amounts.Theres camping that can heal or boost your heros, but your likely to get attacked after in the dark. So the advantage camping gave might go right out the window and end your run right then and there.The fact that heros gain zero exp from battles and only from completing a dungeon. Makes battles just feel pointless. Completely 100% pointless and worthless. The time I spent in that battle I could have found and open 4 treasures or more.Its not a hard game, its not a fair game, its not much fun. I'm always loading it forgetting its not fun and then one dungeon later I remember and turn it off. Lots of rougelikes/lites have unfair enemies or traps, but they are usually consistant. Not miss every attack and every enemy gets a critical vs the same groups you always stomped before. Going from 22,000 to nothing because I upgraded 4 of my heros is not fun. This is the only game I can remember where after an entire day of grind my characters are level two. Making it possibly the most grindy game I've ever played, worse than silk road.The money grind just ruins it for me. If I wanted this much money grind I'd play a ftp mmo. The money isn't even spent on fun things, its fixing negative traits that my heros will just pick right up again.			"

								The aesthetic is fantastic and the narration is top notch. Unfortunately the random number generator in the game is simply not working correctly and resources are given out too miserly. This results in a frustrating grind through the same scenarios over and over again.			"

												It was enjoyable in the beginning but the game has become too difficult to enjoy. With some games, the added difficulty makes the overall experience more enjoyable and makes victory feel rewarding. This game however, is difficult just to be difficult. It doesn't matter how well you prepare, your team could get wiped out in battles you should have won handidly because the enemy managed to crit your healer three times in a row. Speaking of RNG, the RNG in this game is bull****. Attacks that have a 100% accuracy rating miss fairly frequently, it's like the actual accuracy rating is 30% less than what they tell you it is. I know this happens a lot with other games that have RNG (Hello X-COM) but no other game has infuriated me quite like Darkest Dungeon has. The purpose of video games is to bring enjoyment or satisfaction to the player, not bring up repressed anger management issues.			"

												Dankest Dungeons, is basically a dark-fantasy themed JRPG, with great art style, awesome unique mechanics, simple  combat but has room for lots of strategy at the same time, awesome unique mechanics, very polished and intuitive aesthetically, and AWESOME unique mechanics.So, if you enjoy the thought of a horror/terror (don't really know the difference, don't even care) JRPG and if you were not hating this review already because ""that one"" disgustingly underground game that nobody knows had similar mechanics, then you are very likely to like this game.I love when people say that the game isn't hard, and they played a couple HUNDRED hours of it, it IS hard, compared to most popular games out there, so just don't listen to these people.I really wasn't expecting this game to be this great when I picked it up on early access, and it just improved ever since, I rate thee 9/10, would dank again.

								Obviously this game has some flaws. And it's nowhere near done yet.That being said, what is out so far is amazing and unique. It's remniscent of old fashioned D&D, with a ton of horror thrown into the mix. This is my go to game whenever my net is down. I've actually got closer to 100 hours on this baby. Granted, I still suck at it. But the most fun I have is getting attatched to my characters, naming them, and then focusing my entire experience around keeping them alive. Believe me, it's a thrilling experience. The difficulty of this game is way up there with Dark Souls, but it's rougelike and if your people die they die for good, so in my opinion it's even harder. I doubt many people who weren't at one time old school gamers like me will be able to get far in this game. It requires tons of strategy, tactics, gambling on outcomes, and judgement calls.Truly a unique experience and I can't wait for more content to be added!			"

												Addendum: So now the game is released and many changes were made since this first hit Early Access. I am glad to say the game is still awesome. Very well polished, though some of the classes could use some balancing. The mechanics are solid and the gameplay is as addictive as ever. Corpses really make no difference to me. I find them to be pretty easy to deal with to the point that, IMO, they are inconsequential. So my recommendation remains the same. By it, especially if you like games with brutal difficulty. It is rewarding to play and satisfying to overcome the odds.  One of the most polished Early Access games I have ever played, Darkest Dungeon is a gem that deserves your time. A wonderful mish-mash of genres with the addition of the excellent Stress mechanics make this one of the most brutal RPG/Strategy/Rouge-Lite games in recent memory as well. The art style is beautiful as well, conveying the gothic atmosphere well. In fact, I can't find to much bad to say about this game. If you are interested in a challenging game that is only going to get better as it gets closer to its projected summer release day, you now have your game.. The addicting gameplay will bring you back for more, More of your adventurers suffering brutal deaths and mind-crushing insanities. Managing the stress that leads to insanity is one of the more gripping and complex of the mechanics in the game. In my opinion, it is one of the defining traits of this game.Even if these types of games don't exactly appeal to you, I still recommend it. The addicting gameplay will bring you in and the amount of polish will impress. Go buy this game, it will be some of the best 20 bucks you spent on video games.			"

								Man, since the latest update, it seems like every single review is ""whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it's too hard now that I have to actually master mechanics!""  The game is still great, you just have to make more use of ranged characters and shuffle attacks to maneuver around the corpse mechanic and the damage-over-time effects bleed and blight, which ignore monster protection.  Before the updates you could smash virtually every single jungle with two melee solid bruisers, a healer, and whatever else you wanted because who cares; now you have to pay attention to the zone you're questing in and pick a well-designed and appropriate party, as well as placing more thought into hero selection.  I mean seriously, people are complaining because the classes like the leper, simultaneously in contention for the title of toughest tank and highest melee dps, doesn't also have a way to hit enemies in the back row.  He has a freaking ability that clears all corpses so that, with the exception of a few boss fights, you sometimes have to waste a single turn!  That's so unfair!!  The next update better give him a rocket punch and the batmobile or else I can't recommend this game as I am unfamiliar with the concept of party balance.I really hate to say it, but perhaps people who did not like the recent update should considering making an effort to get good.

I'm not one to pay full price for games, and tend to shy away from early access games, but after seeing the ""terror and madness"" trailer I was instantly sold, and purchased the game at full price, in early access, and very quickly became one of my all time favorite games. I laughed, I cried, I lost 15lbs! The game's very addictive, and challanging, and will keep you coming back for more, regardless of how much it aggrivates you. It gets very intense when the lives of your heros are at stake. Well worth the money, and I highly recommend it.			"

								Darkest dungeon is basically Persona x crusader kings and it will become a good purchase for it's money if the additional content can turn this sidescroll dungeon explorer into something with a lot of replayability, which is kinda lacking atm becuase there is no real reason to grind most things and getting one person up to lvl 5 with less optimal parties can be really tedious, a lot of the concepts in game work until you reach lvl 5, then the game kinda fades out in challenge and fun. but i easily spend 20 hours into this game having a blast exploring the dungeons, enjoying the ambient sounds and music as it turns dark.  som classes are kinda lacking in gameplay compared to just having grave robber+highwayman+crusader+hellion/vestal/another grave robber. For example, Plague doctor has a good dot, but the unforgiving gameplay and rng makes the player want to end every battle ASAP, so a lot of classes that need turns to set things up are wasting time and taking risks.

												inherently unfair, illogical and cheating you for minimal fun calling it ""rogue like"" or ""hardcore"" or whatever rubbish. Early Access version was fun, released version is utter rubbish.It's okay for a healer to heal as much as they want during battle, but can't heal once out of it.Same applies for any other capability of your heroes.Even with maximum pampering, you just manage from breakdown to breakdown.And it's not that your heroes or your home offers something to lighten the mood.Mob attacks seem to connect way more easily than yours, no matter the lighting.Your heroes are in horror. Mobs never have something like this. Increasing resistances to hero capabilities while enemies successfully land their skills time after time.If your local dungeon master was this rubbishly cheating, you'd change your RPG round. In case of this game, don't buy it except you like bland grinding against the odds. For what though?Note: I have enjoyed earlier early access revisions of the game. But it seems the curse of the game creator who felt cheated that people actually were enjoying themselves and successfully managing the challenge bit. So the game creator resorted to taking as much joy out of it as possible.Finally uninstalled and remembered to write this review.			"

								The biggest affliction in the game is when the player gets frustration after all the RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happens early game, and you realize you've played slightly over 2 hours so you can't refund it anymore. There are difficult games, and then there's Darkest Dungeons which just makes you bleed gold and leveled characters until you have to wipe your game and start over because you no longer have any viable options. Level 0 characters will become triggered merely from the gentle caress of a lowly trash mob that decided today would be the day it became a kung fu master and dodged every one of your attacks. Trying to treat their mental state will make you and your coin purse painfully aware of the lack of public health care available to your characters.			"

												The Winning Move is Not to Play.Summary:  The experience is similar to playing Dungeons & Dragons with a somewhat goth and very depressed version of Debbie Downer.The main problem is *not* the difficulty, it's being around depressed characters.  When you go into a dungeon your characters  go from ""Let's do this!"" to ""Why the crap am I here?"" to ""Life sucks and is utterly pointless, and I might as well kill myself now.""  Further, when you do conquer a dungeon, the game is very lame about it (""Well, i guess you didn't die *this* time..."") and your characters are so PTSD'ed out with neuroses (becoming suicidal, stealing treasure, etc.) that they need to de-stress.  So how do they do this, you might ask?  Gardening?  Hunting?  Playing frisbee?  Nope.  You have to send them to go drinking, gambling, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or to flog themselves, etc. which is actually not nearly as fun as you might think since you just move the character icon to another slot and have to pay $$$ to try to bring them back.  (More on economics below)I am used to old-school games that are hard, where you die a lot, and I wanted to like this one based on the art style and old-school interface.  On the difficult/balance: if you have a few missions go sideways (which is extremely easy, since your characters can randomly die of heart attacks during battle), then you find that the $$$ situation has gone so wrong that you are actually *worse* off than you were when you first started the game, and you are better off just deleting your save file (game auto-saves) and starting all over again.  Conclusion:  *IF* you like wearing black berets and saying things like ""Life sucks and then you die"" in a French accent (even though you are not actually French) while chainsmoking for no apparent reason, then you might enjoy this game.  Otherwise,  save your $$ and go do something fun with your friends. "

Early Access Review
IntroductionDarkest dungeon, is shortly saying a game that is played against you. The game itself is a rpg- turned base stressfull game. Its at this point it's in early acces. Section Title*the story : The story itself is quite witty, wich makes it fun if you appriciate that kind of humor. Your hero's mention some witty comments about themself or how they go insane. *The graphics : A diffirent style then what you would see in most RPG games, It is quite darkbut then again the game didn't steal it's name.*Gameplay : well... What can I honestly say? The game is made to make you go insane with frustration and anger,It is build to go against you, Wich makes it really addicting because you really want to beat the game. Somehow one of your hero's gets rabbies, or gets scared and therefor moves to the last position. You just start cursing on how they react and wish you where in the game yourself. But the more frustrating the more you get into the game. The longer you play the more you realise how hard it is, how hard it is to collect gold, to delete the negative effects from your hero's. give it positive effects,and so on.In the end you can let your hero's gamble- drink-rest. everything to make them happy right? They can sing to eachother peacefully next to a campfire, or be selfish and take all the food for themself. You will need some strategy tho, see what fits together. So theorycrafting is also fun in this game  with strategy I mean more : with what hero will you pick up the bookcase, Will you leave it? or will you take the risk? It is something you will need to think about. *Soundtrack : Just like the graphics, it isn't something you find generally in an RPGIt is quite stressfull music when everything goes dark, a little bit halloween style. *Money-wise : Do I think the game is worth so much? Yes I do, the game is something you can play for hours non stop. You can start over or you can continue. so the time you would put into this is for me worth the money. Overall VerdictIf you are willing to have patience, anger, frustration, sadness (because oh no all your effort) then this is tottaly worth it. Do not forget this is an early acces game, things can still change. There will still be some bugs, and changing incomming. Overall Score: 9/10 "

												After updatePros: Less gold grinding.Cons: This game still relies on defeating you with crits from enemies (RNG). If the enemy rolls the dice good and you don't, there is nothing you can do to prevent defeat or a loss of member. Like as if lvl 5 dungeons weren't hard enough they added mini-bosses, if you don't take em out quickly, at least one of your crew mates will die.With all respect I still love Darkest Dungeon, but not the same as when I first played it. This game lost all the good dungeon atmosphere of horror and exploration. Essentially, the constant grinding of heroes didn't change. Now instead of the exploration mentality it is,""I need to level up heroes, oh I don't have enough gold need to farm some more, I can't go to lvl 5 dungeon with fully armored crew need more gold...

								As usual, bought a half-random game when it was on sale. This time it surprised me very positively!I've only spent 3,7hrs in-game as I write this. Those hours have been very rewarding! Atmosphere, game mechanics, visual style, everything just hits me like a ten ton hammer. And I think I've just sratched the surface..Like game says before you start, you will try to save your favourite heroes. I got myself a stab in the back once my favourite hero got ""mad"". Well, not mad, angry. Trying to save her in my group while she curses all other party members giving them penalty. It was a long dungeon and all my party members were close at collapsing mentally, still, I fought my way to complete that dungeon. What a rewarding moment. Then I put my favourite character to looneybin, maybe I'll get her back on my team soon..Game is truly hard and punishing already. I can only imagine how it will be later.Perhaps it will drive me to looney bin? :D 9/10 by first touchTruly recommend it, money well spent!			"

												You will cringe when your character misses and slump your shoulders when you get crited two or more times in a row.  You can't kill the enemies fast enough to avoid getting your stress stacked up.  They have some options to toggle certain aspects of the game off or tone them down ever so slightly.  The stress element at the end of the day is just annoying as hell to me, wish they had an option to 1/4 or 1/2 the accumulation.  Would be nice if you could turn the autosave off as well.  I just don't have the time or patience to burn on this level of ""difficulty/RNG.""I regret buying this game.  Plenty of reviews telling me this was exactly the case. I can't believe this game has the ratings it does, read the reviews they have legitimate praises and grievances.			"

Early Access Review
								I started playing Darkest Dungeon about a month ago, soon after the Houndmaster update.  The gameplay and narration are excellent and I think the graphics/battle animations are superb, as well.  The storyline reminds me of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Rats In The Walls"" and that's a great thing!  Kudos to Red Hook on capturing the same dark, dreary feel. I found the game to be very difficult early on because I was trying to save all of the party members after each mission and didn't have enough gold to fix all of their problems.  Once I accepted that the level 0-1 characters were simply cannon fodder to use for the greater good of the Hamlet (sending out on no provision runs to gather gold/resources and then dismissing the entire party afterwards), the game became easier.  Using the gold to fund real mission and item/ability upgrades for my main characters, I slowly built up my roster and continued doing no provision runs when my core teams required rest.       Now, I have a full roster of upgraded (though not max level) characters.  The days of no provision runs with new recruits is over but they served their purpose.  My ""A-Team"" (Grave Robber/Vestal/Crusader/Man-at-Arms) is level 5 and has completed several Champion runs; the remaining heroes are level 3-4 and are capable of completing the Veteran runs in various party combinations.  In my opinion, the best classes are the Man-at-Arms and the Vestal; I haven't had any success with the Occultist or the Plague Doctor.  It seems like the Occultist's heal fails at a critical time and isn't worth the risk, the Vestal has proven to be a more reliable healer.  The Plague Doctor hasn't been a strong enough healer or damage dealer in my expeience; I'd take the Vestal/Crusader for healing or just about anything else (Arbalest/Bountry Hunter/Grave Robber/Highway Man) for damage dealing, over the Plague Doctor.  Would I recommend this game to others?  Absolutely!  For only $20 (about the same price as a movie or two at the theater), I've had over 70 hours of enjoyment and I am looking forward to the next 70+ hours of gameplay.			"

												It had potential early on, but it's turned into a huge grind where way too much is left up to rng. So much of the game becomes recruiting fodder to send into the dungeons with no supplies so you can grind gold and other currency to heal your main group. Once the main group is healed you send them in to go for a boss, hoping that RNG doesn't bend you over and ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥ forcing you to retreat and start the whole grind process all over again. It's fun at first, but the game becomes really tedious once you realize you're basically throwing expendable resources into a rng machine and hoping that something good comes out of it.It's not all bad though, since I honestly love the art style and the narration is some of the best I've heard in any game. It's just an overall disappointing feeling because I'll see a snapshot of it on the store page or scroll by it in my library and say to myself  ""God dammit, I really wish I liked that game more than I do"".

												To open up: If you hate those times where RNG absolutely screws you over despite your best efforts and you are shrieking with rage because of it... this game is not for you.New players beware: The games difficulty in the beginning is deceptive. Early on you may not notice it as much but the game quickly creeps up with the difficutly spike if your not careful. Maybe its just me but the difficulty progression feels ""off"".Don't get me wrong. The premise, the atomsphere, the narrator and the artsyle are all very nice. However the gameplay elements turn the game into more of a grindfest which is a shame as this game from what I remember in Early Access wasn't actually like that.A good tip I would recommend to newplayers is once you are in the Hamlet, go to your gameplay options, click Darkest  Dungeon Configuration and turn off Corpses. It will save you a few headaches. Another tip is if one of your party members is getting close 100/200 stress, leave the dungeon. As unless you have the proper quirks and trinkets, your character is usually going to be hit with an affliction and these afflictions stress out the rest of your party and cause them to get afflictions or worse... heart attacks which can kill your party member.I honestly cannot recommend this game unless your honesltly looking for a real challenge.

												An okay game I can't really understand why people like. I like RPGs and I like exploration, but this game tries it's hardest to make the game not fun. I'm not a big fan of games where your characters die all the time (as to me story is interaction between characters and if they die before they are developed what's the point).This game is really a Dungeons and Dragons luck-of-the-die-roll type of game with a very low budget. It's also set in a very drab and macabre in the visuals department, with bare minimum level design and animations. If that's your thing, maybe you'll like this, for other's I'm sure you might have more fun with other D&D style games. I mean do you want to play a game where the narrator is constantly talking about how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and deadly everything is, to the point you wonder why you would bother coming to this place at all to explore? This game did not appeal to me at all, but try it on sale if you're curious, you may like it.			"

												First thing's first.  Don't buy the game if you don't want a challenge.  Don't buy the game if you hate a little bit of grinding.  Don't buy the game if you hate turn based strategy games (they really should include strategy as a tag).  Don't buy the game if you want an immersive storyline.  Don't buy this game if you're not willing to invest a little time failing in order to learn.  RPG's are my genre.  I don't think I would call this an RPG.  It's something else.  Difficult is obviously a very subjective word.  If you plan to buy this, assume that it will be very hard.  If it fails to live up to your difficulty expectation, then you're in a very small minority I think.There's been a lot of bad reviews gaining traction for this game since the full release.  I never played it in EA, but I've enjoyed the game thoroughly since I've had it.  I can't say whether or not the quality of the game was affected since EA ended, but I've definately got my money's worth out of the final release, and enjoyed every moment of it.The only reason I'm wrting this review is because I agree with what everyone has to say about the game's positive attributes.  Most of the the negative reviews bring up luck, RNG, grinding, and ""unfair"".  I don't know what to say to that.  I've never once thought the RNG was out of balance or that the game was unfair.  However, the game is pretty tough.  There's a decent learning curve as well.  Once you know which party compositions fit your playstyle, who to bring where, how to interact with dungeon objects, when to kick a hero to the curb, which trinkets are worth finding and using, and how to manage the different enemies in the game..... There's no more problem.  The game remains a challenge, especially the final end game push, but once you're familiar with the game, the farming that is necessary is almost risk proof.  The game did ruin my night once, but it was my fault.  I chose to engage a champion level mini-boss.  It didn't go well.  It didn't go great on Veteran the first time I fought him either.  He wiped my party in the Champion level dungeon.  I lost 8 ancestral trinkets.  All gone.  4 resolve level 6 heros.  Gone.  However, it was my fault, and I learned from it.  It was not ""unfair"".  Also, crits happen.  I'm not sure why people complain about a string of crits against their party that snowballs into disaster.  I mean, think of all the monsters that constantly get wrecked by your heros.  Over and over and over again.  Surely they should be able to ruin your day every once in a while.  That's what I think.Yes, farming is necessary.  Yes, there is grinding.  I've enjoyed every minute of it.  I enjoy the dungeon crawls.  I think if one were to approach this game as a turn based strategy game, there would be less hate.  Also, the game isn't as random as people have stated.  You can mitigate the chance of just about anything happening as long as you use the right trinkets and skills.  Mitigate, not prevent.  But you can't mitigate everything at once.  As the player, you need to decide what would be best to prepare for depending on your group composition and dungeon.Full disclosure:  I haven't finished the game, but I'm close enough to have a full oppinion of the game.  I will finish this first run with strict (default) settings, with all caretaker goals completed.  I have two final pushes on the Darkest Dungeon itself left, and one boss left in the Cove.  Final note:  If you find yourself truly finding this game ""unfair"", try running vestal, plague doctor, hound master/ crusader/man at arms.  Now you've become the one who is playing unfair.  Very final note:  You don't have to play the game the way the dev's intended.  Most things can be toggled on or off in the menu.  I urge you to try to play with strict rules, but If you truly dislike them, then by all means turn some of that stuff off.			"

												With the upgrade paths in the different buildings being so linear, I feel like there's actually very little variance in this game and it's purely a matter of endurance instead of randomness: max everything out and go for the final dungeon. The problem is that this form of progression just isn't masked well enough to make the game endearing to play until the end, and being able to see what skills you'll get for each character makes it more of a chore and less of a reward.The narration is interesting, but gets old fairly quickly. No way to turn it off either, just mute the narrator itself. The game's art style, easily being the highlight of this game, is striking and conveys a sense of dread and despair, but there's not much else propping it up in my opinion.			"

												Main complaint is you can't send higher level characters into lower difficulty dungeons. So, for instance, if you have level 4 characters, they can't play through a level 1 dungeon. Instead you have to send them to a level 3 dungeon, which will likely result in a total party kill. If this gets fixed I have no problems with the difficulty or even the game's stinginess with gold.*Edit*I sunk another 30 hours or so into this game, thinking I'd been unfair the first time. Nope. The game is the only thing that's unfair. The level capping ultimately prevents this game from being worthwhile. In addition to the complaint above, you can't level up past level 6, so sending high level teams out to level 5 or (God forbid) level 6 dungeons will just get them party wiped. Really wish they'd allow higher levels to grind through lower level dungeons. Until then, the game remains a waste of time.			"

Early Access Review
								Background: I supported this game on Kickstarter (liked the basic idea and the graphics) and  as I am not really interested in playing games that aren't mostly finished, I didn't bother with early access until a few weeks ago.There really is a good game here, but it just tries too hard to be the hardest game around and the whole thing seems to be geared towards masochists. The problem is, that this game is not just hard, but that you must LOVE to lose to enjoy it. To make matters worse, you have keep a myriad little things under control to just keep going and lots of thing frustrating your efforts.To be clear, I only lost two or three characters during my plays and didn't do too bad - so I am not rage rating. But I just realised, that I didn't have much fun. It's just not my cup of tea.			"

								Beautiful art reminiscent of Mike Mignola, excellent sound design, and the appeals of a very articulate narrator who has completely lost his damn mind accompany this trip into the dark beneath the world where horrible things dwell. This game is a very satisfying strategic experience with a reasonable amount of depth to recommend it, and it has enough variance to keep you on your toes but not so much that you find yourself frequently losing encounters despite playing well. It's exciting, difficult enough to be interesting, and very polished. This would rank high on my list of the best things I've played in 2015.			"

												While gameplay seems to be appealing from the beginning, the scaling to the later stages of the game is poorly designed. I'd even say it is simply abysmal: every lvl5+ battle turns into RNG fiesta with little to no ability to mitigate or prevent randomness on a side of the player. For example, a group of ~6 SPD monsters all went before any of my 7+ SPD party and killed my lvl6 position 3 hero. Just like that. I was unlucky. But the main problem is that the every high level ""unfortunate event"" of that type has the only consequence - more boring repetitive grind in leveling up another hero from 1 to 6. This game in its core is just the same old poorly designed RPG with the only way to victory - through tedious, boring, and repetitive grinding of the same content. The only difference is that the old games forced you to grind until your characters are OP enough to beat the game, and here you grind until you happen to be lucky enough to beat the game.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I even poured hours into it. I now regret them. 1) Random crashes are infuriating. How hard is it to build a stable game? 2) The random number generating. It's as bad as playing Risk. Far too many battles turn around because of a single ""Crit"" from the enemy. The Crit puts someone at Death's Door, then makes them afflicted, etc. all in one go. I can't count how many boss attempts ended the square before the boss because the dungeon decided to throw a Collector at me. Seriously? Additionally, too many of the mechanics are poorly explained. Scouting is obviously the most important mechanic in the game yet nothing ♥♥♥♥ing talks about it. And it can be absurdly unreliable. 3) I believe *this* game is more about gameplay than story, that being said I find the story just not worth it. Initially I cared but the story pieces before each boss dungeon just don't hook me. Also, for the emphasis placed on the gameplay it all so poorly explained and the learning curve is steep.			"

												Game is neat but kind of boring, the rogue-like element is not needed and kind of boring.  Just feels like it adds more grind.  You get a mercenary roster where you pick 4 and send them into dungeons which have varying difficulties and objectives.  Once complete you pretty much toss them out and recruit new ones, it's free.  Later you will build up dream teams and steam roll everything.Neat concept but the hype kept me playing longer than the games ability to be fun or challenging did.			"

												The concept seems interesting and thoughtful, but it's not. The Cthulhu-based story drew me in. The terrible design drove me away. Challenge comes only through non-sensical design choices and the intense over-use of RNG.Want to do something? RNG will stop you. Want to heal out of combat? You can't, even though you are a healer. Want to kill monsters? Well, you may get an occasional kill, but bodies just pile up, even though you are killing less than 3 at a time. Said bodies will block you from attacking. Everything is range based, and the game keeps finding ways to randomly change your positioning. The monsters can get though the piled up bodies just fine though, for some reason. If this were an action game, zombies and skeletons would be more nimble than humans. All of this doesn't entirely matter though, because your party usually dies from massive amounts of stress damage, which can't be mitigated much, in a handful of fights. It can be mitigated, sure, but you take about 500 damage in a dungeon, and you can mitigate about 20.Party members are essentially canon fodder, and your goal is to build up your estate as they all die from horrible deaths. Yet, you will not be interested in doing so, because it's an excessive RNG-based grind fest where you see the same tiles and the same monsters over and over and over again....I tried to return the game, but they won't let me. Maybe there's $2 worth of original ideas in this game, not $10 or $20+, not nearly so.			"

								Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Rogue-like dungeon crawler game.Interface/Menu/SettingsYou can play with a xbox controller.Has vibration. :DYou are able to toggle between Fullscreen and windowed mode.You can toggle the Subtitles.There is a master Volume changer availalbe. 0-100.There is a sound Volume changer available. 0-100.There is a Music Volume changer available. 0-100.There is a narration Volume changer available. 0-100There is a cinematic Volume changer available. 0-100.There are some different Languages available.About the game.But the game is not really that fun if i have to be honest, Yes i know it is called ""darkest dungeon"" But its like Faster of light,  YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY LUCKY to have a succeed. Stress meter will decide the stats, The higher your Stress, the more negative bonuses and bad stats you will receive. So it is easy to go downhill from that point.it's incredible difficult to lower the stress beside going to a town.Losing characters, getting bad threatments, and everything else that is negative. The game is more unfair then fair, and once in a bad state. You will never get out of this anymore.The game doesn't really feel unbalanced on the same time aswell due too much negative events. (impossible to win). If you decide to leave the dungeon and go back to the town, You will receive a huge ""Stress"" penalty. Traps are the most lamest things in the game, you can't even see this coming and damages a random party member, which will increases stress. (unless skilled enough). Before you enter a dungeon, you can buy items, like healing potions, bandages torches and so go on. If you complete a dungeon or retreat. All of those items will be lost. Which is a shameFeels extremely unfair towards Players.Has Video Scene.There is a map available.Has a tutorial.Getting stress is way too easy and too much.You can equip characters, upgrade their skills or upgrade equipment.Graphics is sort of cartoonish, which is very well done.Other things.To be honest, if this happends to me in real life. That i am inside of a dungeon and then later i decide to leave. How can that give me stress? It should be a relief! Like ""Aaah Finally!"" But these weirdo's are getting more stressed for leaving! Do they really want to leave? Fights are turn based and dependant on luck. (like throwing a dice)-------------------I Give this game a 4/10			"

												*DISCLAIMER* I'll admit that I haven't exactly spent too much time with Darkest Dungeon, so I've read up on some other user experiences while also presenting my own. I plan, at some point or another, to go back and give the game another try and see if I just dismissed it too quickly.While my time with this game isn't much, I do believe that I've seen and heard enough of it to give a solid opinion. Darkest Dungeon stresses realism at its finest and at its absolute worst, bringing a mariad of interesting mechanics and solid designs, but overall presenting us with a very, very frustrating experience. I had been looking for a dungeon crawler-esque game for a while now that could satiate my thirst to test my greed whilst diving for treasures and loot, and Darkest Dungeon seemed like a nice fit at the time. Unfortunately, only four hours later, I felt completely defeated and a tad bored of what this game wanted me to accomplish. The developers want you to go into various locations that seem to be procedurally generated and complete whatever mission you choose. Most of the time it was a ""Complete 100% of the battle rooms"" or ""Explore 90% of the rooms"" or something of that nature. There's the occasional random battles or what have you along the way, and I enjoyed that part.Initially, I enjoyed every second of combat. It was diverse and very strategic, keeping you on your toes and thinking steps upon steps ahead. Every battle was a fight not to just keep your team healthy enough to venture on, but to survive. It was thrilling and it was made even harder through the stress mechanic (which I will get to later). After a while of going head-to-head with hordes of bandits, undead, and demons, I started to realize something very grave about Darkest Dungeon in that, for a game that stresses realism, RNG has some very heavy influences. Random crits made your life either a lofty cloud to rest upon or a hellish nightmare to barge through. Every crit landed against you felt like being pushed even further down a hill of an uphill battle. Then, to continue with this discussion of RNG, there's the largest offender: the stress mechanic. Stress in this game is manageable through various skills of different classes and two locations in the base town. The concept in itself is interesting, but already too overbearing as there's already so much you have to worry about. Every hero or whatever you would like to call your characters has a stress bar that reaches to two-hundred points. In just one mission your heroes, if you don't play your cards right, could very well easily get over one-hundred points of stress. Stress isn't just triggered through combat either; there are a lot of tiny other things that will add up over that period of time that you spend in the area. Once a hero reaches one-hundred points of a stress, a very heavy fifty-fifty will take place that could possibly make or break a character, deciding if they get some virtuous perk that reinforces heroism or some negative effect that just hinders the rest of your group entirely. The stress system is just a dice roll that I dread every single time I'm notified of it.The game of chance that you play whenever you find a new treasure (called ""Curio"" in Darkest Dungeon) kind of adds just an unnecessary step of risk and reward. Not to mention running away from a fight is also determined by RNG...but I think that my point has been made clear enough. Ultimately, this is one of those decisions on whether you're willing to put forth the time and effort that this game requires of you to press on. And you have to be accepting of the fact that your best team could very well be wiped out in a single mission if you're not very careful. I enjoy that cautious and looming feeling that you really should have whenever playing a game like Darkest Dungeon, but with its heavy reliance on RNG when it really matters, it takes away from that experience and oppresses the realism that Red Hook Studious is trying to convey. I give Darkest Dungeon a solid 4/10 so far. I plan to play the game further and it might give me a better viewpoint if I just give myself more time to bask in the dark fantasy world that the developers have conjured, but I'll always have a sinking feeling that knows that there's always a very large chance of my characters being lost to random crits or afflictions. And unless there's some type of fix in the future, I don't see my opinion chaning all that much.			"

Early Access Review
								This game was great at first, in terms of early access when I bought it 7 months ago. I decided to wait after a bit to get the full experience, but it seems that's never going to happen. 7 months + of early access is a joke to the video game industry, and it appears this game will be in early access long after people have forgotten about it. Leonardo Di Vinci said ""Art is never finished, only abandoned."" The developers need to get over the fact that this game will never be perfect and accept when a game is good enough to say it's finished. They can patch the game, add expansions, or release a HD hyper delux directors cut version with everything they want included in the game later down the road, all while making money off it.  Early Access is just Beta Testing but you pay to test the game.  This Early Access business model only serves greed, and gives a reward to people that didn't fully earn it yet. Stop supporting Early Access.			"

The art and gameplay are awesome. The music also creates some horrific ambience, although it gets repetitive. The leap in difficulty in the later dungeons is just stupid; for example, I walk my group (ready for a fight, healthy, upgraded, and eqquipped) into an encounter and watch my entire group get wiped without even having a chance to respond. The game makes all of your previous efforts a giant, demoralizing, punch line. THE GAME IS FUN, BUT it just gets ridiculously difficult and not in a way that feels challenging, it is completely unfair and I stopped playing.			"

								At first this game seems great, it is difficult but managable. However, after the first two hours it starts showing all of the things I hate about games made artificially difficult. You can have best team ever with combos and skills all mastered and some random dungeon encounter with a skeleton will kill half of them with cheap tricks like constant crits and dodges of the enemy. I guess when I got the game I was hoping that it would be difficult but in a way that is ment to motivate the player to get better, not as one of those meat boy style games where the game is frustrating just because it can. My biggest regret is that I actually spent over two hours in game so I cant get my money back, definitelly dont recommend if you dont like getting frustrated over cheap tricks the developers used to make the game harder than it really is. Lastly it becomes a grindfeast pretty quick as you need higher level heroes for later quests but those heroes tend to die at random, so now you have to get new ones and grind lower quests over and over again...

												Six small reasons I can't recommend this game until they are fixed or adjusted:1. You can't use abilities out of combat. The developers want to be realistically harsh, but not realistic. Pick one. It's easy to implement a system where you can use abilities out of combat. Just like bleeds still do damage per movement after combat, so should abilities. And we all know that movement increases stress. Done. I just fixed the game. No charge guys. I'm nice that way.2. Some town events do not work like the autoleveling of idle classes. Doesn't do anything. I'll fix this bug free of charge too if needed. Call me.3. If you overshoot the door at the end of a passage by 1 cm, you have to backtrack to click on the door. WTF? All you should need to do is walk to the edge of the screen and it should automatically load the next room.4. The enemy shuffles your party order when you are surprised, but the enemy party is never shuffled for any reason.5. Using an item (like a shovel) on a curio that doesn't accept the item (like a stack of books) the game will consume the item and do nothing but tell you it had no effect. You don't get your item back as if the stack of books swallowed the shovel. WTF?6. Some curio events have extreme penalties that pretty much force good players to not be curious. Myself and other youtubers don't even touch most curios anymore unless we know 100% that we can force a positive outcome. Even using the wrong item on a curio will waste that item. RIP sense of adventure.			"

												Brutally difficult.  For every positive random result, it is replaced with 3 absolutely crushing negative ones.  The impending sense of hopelesslness and dread are compounded to the point the game is simply frustrating beyond the point of being even remotely fun.The mechanics are interesting, the character abilities can work well together, but the negative traits and rediculously overpowered mob abilities  will make you SCREAM.Get it if you enjoy having your nuts repeatedly smashed in a car door.

								At first this game seems great, it is difficult but managable. However, after the first two hours it starts showing all of the things I hate about games made artificially difficult. You can have best team ever with combos and skills all mastered and some random dungeon encounter with a skeleton will kill half of them with cheap tricks like constant crits and dodges of the enemy. I guess when I got the game I was hoping that it would be difficult but in a way that is ment to motivate the player to get better, not as one of those meat boy style games where the game is frustrating just because it can. My biggest regret is that I actually spent over two hours in game so I cant get my money back, definitelly dont recommend if you dont like getting frustrated over cheap tricks the developers used to make the game harder than it really is. Lastly it becomes a grindfeast pretty quick as you need higher level heroes for later quests but those heroes tend to die at random, so now you have to get new ones and grind lower quests over and over again...

												This game has amazing potential, but it is incredibly buggy.I lost 4 campaigns in a row due to fatal crashes.  Despite going through tech support with the developer, I could not get the game to run without crashes and loss of data.With the latest update, I cannot even start a campaign without the game crashing immediately.  Because I exceeded the 2h of play time (the crashes only happened after about 6-8h in to the campaign), Steam refuses to refund this game.If you are one of those who this game works for, great - it's a fun, engaging game.  But if you are like me, and lose hours of playtime, and then end up with a non-functioning product, it's worth exactly nothing.  Be prepared if you buy this game - your save files can become corrupted, especially if the game unexpectedly shuts down, and you have no way to continue your progress, and no recourse for a refund if you are one of the people affected.EDIT:  After additional contact with the developer, I was able to get the game to start a new campaign.  If I can get this to run without crashes and loss of data, I will revise my review to reccommend this game - it IS a fun, engaging game.			"

The most Lovecraftian game I've ever played (even the developer studio name is a reference). Stunning visuals accompanied by gloomy OST and grim Narrator commentating your actions further submerging you into the blindingly dark unsettling atmosphere of sheer horror and desperation.At the moment the game seems to have balance issues here and there, although it is expected to be unforgiving and brutal. As a result there is a few exploits available to mitigate the punishing nature of some gameplay mechanics (the dev has already addressed the problems and is working on them).I will keep updating the review later			"

												I dont really like it. Loads of RNG brutally destroying your party in a dungeon, but very little in the way of character customisation, no rare weapon drops or anything like that, nothing like the inventory systems of traditional crawlers. I quite like the combat, the character order, I find torches a pain which should be automated. Town building upgrade system is pretty uninspiring too, nothing to make you feel as if these are your characters. I'm into hard games, but they have to be fun and this one is missing the fun for me.			"

Posted: December 27, 2016
												I always thought about getting this game but didn't want to spend 20€ on it, so I grabbed it on sale.I saw some gameplay on streams already but most of the game I figured out on my own. Difficulty:The difficulty varies from extremly easy to slightly challenging. I am only in week 30+ however. Some people say the the game's RNG is making it impossible to play, but I can't agree to that at all. I have never had a fight that felt impossible to win. I haven't lost a single character yet and beat about 5 bosses. Most of the fights is just you gathering all the information about the enemy, doing some simple math and then make your move. If you don't do that and use your abilities willy-nilly then the game is probably a bit harder for you.Atmosphere & Game Mechanics:The atmosphere is great, the game mechanics are new and refreshing. The addition of stress on top of your standart HP-Bar is nicely done and it manages to capture the horrifying experience that is dungeon-crawling. The art-style is very fitting and combined with the differen't light effects the dungeons feel completely different depending on your light-level. Not only does the light level determine the scariness of the dungeon by looks aswell as sounds (which are awesome) but it is also a shift in playstyle. Running around in the dark is high-risk and high reward, while running around with the torch lit can make your dungeon safer but you get less treasure. Characters:There are 15 different characters to choose from, each filling different roles and some being very unique. So far I have used 14 of them, but I would say more than half of these characters are great and about equally strong, depending on your team and the dungeon you're exploring. Once again, if you choose your characters without paying much attention, the game gets a lot harder. But with a little bit of observing I was able to find out quite quickly which parties make which dungeon very easy and what combinations work well together. Town Management:There are 2 major currencies in the game: gold and heirlooms. Heirlooms are needed to improve your town while gold is used to buy provisions for your dungeon parties aswell as upgrading and maintaining your adventures. This is actually a quite challenging task, since the higher level your adventurers get, the more gold you will have to spend.For now, I have been able to win, or at least be on par in the arms-race with the dungeon enemies, but as a result I am almost always low on gold. Final Conclusion:One thing that had me worried about this game was that it might be too repetitive for me. After playing for a good bit, I can say that with many different characters to choose from and 4 unique dungeon locations (Darkest Dungeon still locked) I am still not bored of the gameplay. I feel like even though I have a pretty good grasp on the game, there is still much to discover, be it in creating the best possible party for each dungeon, defeating all the bosses or optimizing each characters quirks and trinkets. I am sure that this game still has many secrets to be uncovered and I can already say that the purchase, especially since it was a sale, was well worth it! If you liked my review, I would appreciate a thumbs up so others may enjoy it aswell!    "

								There's a few things you don't do in game design. A pretty important one is that you shouldn't take the players' hours of work and investment and then roll the dice to see if he or she keeps it.In this game I designed a fun, powerful composition and was having a lot of success with it. It took me somewhere around 10 hours to feel confident and prepared, and the team was blazing through dungeons. Seeing my team was now far over-levelled and overgeared I decided it was time to take on the second boss. I entered, went through the dungeon unscathed and finally reached the boss. Then he immediately hit my entire team with a massive critical hit, permanently killing two of them and essentially erasing hours of work with no warning or counterplay.The best example I can think of the compare how that feels is to suggest how one would feel after 10 hours of adventuring on skyrim, only to have the game say ""Woops! We decided to delete your save file to keep you on your toes!""Artificial difficulty is thrown around a lot these days, but this is a perfect example. It's poor game design that punishes the player for doing everything right. In what way does this kind of thing inscentivize the player to continiue playing? One could argue that events like this add to the overall horrific feel of the game, to which I respond that events like that add to the overall feel of me wishing I had spent my money on something that didn't make me feel like I wasted the last 10 hours of my life. The game has a lot of possitive qualities, but I can't recommend it currently.			"

												God, I love so much about this game. Really, I love it. But it's soooo hard to recommend this game because I would like to keep my friends.WOW, is it stressful. And that is the point, I get it...most things are challenging but a few things in the game are incredibly unfair (don't confuse the two). On the one hand, I love that the game designers made a real challenge, but on the other hand they take full control way from the player. The actual gameplay is great! It's challenging, dark, has a lot of strategy, and it is a lot of fun 90% of the time. I loved the setting, the stories, the difficulty of the actual fights, and the upgrading system.BUT there are THREE things in this game that make is just plain unfair. Pull-your-hair-out unfair. Like, “what were they thinking?!” unfair. 1. You can’t use your skills outside of combat. So no healing unless you’re being attacked. No mana bar, no healing potions either. This doesn’t make sense from a role-playing perspective. I get why it’s there, but it’s…frustrating. It's managable, but it takes control away from the player and breaks the fantasy immersion.2. You don’t keep the items you buy! This drives me insane! You spend so much money on provisions every time you go on a quest and any left-overs just…vanish. It doesn’t make any sense! It's stupid. It’s just stupid. It’s here for the sake of being hard. No other RPG has this, and real life doesn't have it! Game designers: if you can see this, screw you for this one.3. You have to bring food with you and that heals you a teeny bit when you eat..okay, fair right? But if you don’t eat it when the game tells you to...you lose HP. So you can’t eat early or you risk getting hungry…which again makes no sense! Everyone gets hungry at the same time even if they have eaten so you might as well never heal with food. And when you eat you gain 1-3 hp but lose 6-8 hp when you don’t!!! This is so stupid!People who like this game…I like it to, I really do. I love Lovecraft, I want to keep playing, I want to enjoy it more, but every time I play it I get really stressed out and I need to de-stress like my characters. Games sholdn't feel like second jobs that are harder than your actual job.			"

The game is so buggy. On my pc, it only works if you set it to windows 95 in compatability mode, the opening cutscene is skipped if you change the volume when it's playing, it just refuses to load my save file or just straight up crashes when I click on the save. In fact, it just crashed when I was writing this review. I don't know how many more bugs I'll encounter when I actually get to play it, but it certainly didn't get my hopes up after this.			"

								Ignore everything you hear about this game being difficult... because to say this game is ""difficult"" would suggest that this game is also fair. There are plenty of games out there that challenge reflexes, or strategic aptitude, or even sheer amount of patience... unfortunately, this game doesn't demand any of those. Instead, it demands tolerance for randomness. The only thing worse than having to say ""wow, there was no real way I could have survived that"" is having to say ""wow, there was no real reason why I should have won that"". It takes away any real sense of agency, which is one key feature I look for in a game.The game is gorgeous, sound/voice-acting is moving. At this time, however, the game is NOT worth anything beyond a Steam sale.			"

												It's a bit fun at first, but it gets old very quickly.If you wanna try playing something almost identical to it, there's a way to do it for only one cent. Simply flip the coin; if it's heads, you win and everybody is happy. Tails, you lose and you can try again.Seriously, though, 90% of the game is dictated by dice rolls. There are certainly some levels of strategy, team building, and upgrades, but overall it's just dice rolls. Unlike good RPG's, you can't do much of anything to affect those dice rolls. It's quite possible that it becomes more affected by choice later on, but certainly in the beginning, choices don't matter at all. Why play a game where your choices make no difference? You get just as much enjoyment out of watching someone else play, because choice genuinely doesn't matter.I had really high hopes for this game, and it looks so great - both the art style, and the gameplay in general. But in practice, the game completely fails to deliver. I wish I had a game that was exactly like Darkest Dungeon in every way, just it punished you for having poor tactics instead of punishing you for simply playing the game. Every time I play, I hope I can find what others apparently see in the game, that same ideal that I had hoped for when I first bought it. Instead, I can't help but feel that the developers are laughing at me for buying their game.			"

												As much as I enjoy challenging games where failure is another lesson learned, Darkest Dungeon is pure rewardless masochism. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. There are no great rewards for heroism. You will not ""learn"" the game like Dark Souls or Dwarf Fortress, because everything only gets constantly more unforgiving if you make any progress. There is no way to improve your gameplay, no way to learn from your mistakes, and no real reason to keep playing as time goes on when every new enemy feels like more of the same or an even more unfair concept.Darkest Dungeon is very well made, spectacularly designed, and should be a glowing recommendation... but I can't bring myself to recommend a game that flawlessly executes being utterly unenjoyable.

												If you like games that will make you miserable.....I have to strongly warn any and all interested that it will produce in the player massive levels of anger, frustration, and salt the likes of which you would not even find playing the likes of Dark Souls on a bad day. At least in a game like Dark Souls skill takes precedence and makes the game gradually more enjoyable. In this game, you are never not a victim to the RNG. When things go well, they go very well. But when things go bad, it honestly feels like the developers are giving you the finger and kicking you in the balls with a smug smirk for good measure.I've pushed on through this game and managed to defeat every beginner and veteran boss with two of the intermediate bosses (the dreaded Swine God and the Hag Witch) under my belt. But I've recently thrown in the towel and decided I can't push myself any further. It isn't simply a matter of the RNG either; the intermediate dungeons are too difficult with enemies that will frequently have both high dodging AND protection stats making each battle a slow grind and a fight for your life. That there are ways to mitigate the enemies ability to survive your attacks with debuffs barely helps when the debuffs tragically miss, making that character's turn wasted, or when you simply don't have anyone on your team available to do such a thing. It doesn't help that you can't ever go anywhere without a healer, whose healing skills are so hit and miss you're constantly on the edge of your seat whenever they attempt to patch your crumbling team together.Where the difficulty goes overboard is with an enemy called The Collector that you are guaranteed to fight at least once randomly in EVERY intermediate level dungeon. These enemies are the biggest asshats due to their ability to continually respawn allies which can either heal or protect it while it too heals itself by draining life from your team to refresh its already huge pool of helth. The reward for defeating this enemy, an item worth a lot of gold, won't even cover your losses at the end of the quest when you have to send your team to the tavern or the abbey to undo their accumulated stress (assuming you can even survive).Where I quit was in a dungeon where I had just barely survived an encounter with this most dreaded of foes only for TWO of my high level heroes whom I had already invested much money into upgrading, BOTH died, in a game with perma death no less. That brought the toll of dead heroes to ten and caused me to delete my save file in frustration. I don't mind (too much) if a hero dies valiantly while fighting a boss which I then proceed to defeat, but when it happens randomly due to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG it brings my blood to a boil and I have to fight not to hurl my laptop across the room.It's sad, because I like this game. I really, truly do. But it is TOO F&%#ing hard!!! Would it honestly kill them to dial down the difficulty just a bit? Even to allow you to purchase disposable healing items so you're not constantly relying on healers who can only heal during battle? When every quest becomes a desperate roll of the dice not just to progress the game but to just get yourself out of the black so you can invest in hero upgrades then it becomes more of a painful chore than a thrill. Especially when you see all that hard work go down the drain due to some random trick of the RNG. (Like missing four times in a row when trying to kill even a single enemy!)I like hard games but I'm getting sick and tired of this meat-head ""git gud"" mentality which is plaguing games lately and making people feel ashamed for just wanting to have fun.This game is too hard. Not hard but rewarding kind of hard, but hard and painful, like the worst day of your life at the worst job you've ever had and when deep in debt to boot. Would it be such a bad thing if they just make it a little more forgiving?????			"

												The level of art is very high and graphical design of the user interface is as intuitive as it is appealing. The narration and sound effects are simply awesome, and the narrator encourages you with quotes of wisdom with his deep resonating and enchanting voice as you go along. This is one of the most enjoyable and best aspect of the game, which really distinguishes it and compensates for the negative aspects. If the negative aspects are sorted, the devs are looking at a block buster.What I didn't like is there is no difficulty setting, just an radio button option to switch corpses and heart attacks off. This makes the game a lot easier and you don't seem to be penalised for switching these off, nor is there a reward for enabling them, so there is no incentive to switch em back on.Combat is one of the main aspects of the game but a lot of luck is involved, and this will get you cursing and shouting at times. A lot of people have already reviewed this aspect so, briefly, the computer has been made to cheat to increase difficulty. But I would rather fight a tougher enemy i.e with more HP, rather than a weaker enemy who cheats. So enough from me on luck. But the silliest aspect of the game IMHO is time wasted during combat. In between in each character turn there is upto a 10 second of animations starting with a loud drum beat, then the character gets blessed, stressed, buffed or debuffed, bleeds, blighted or resists and then he/she says something which you expect given the stress/quirk e.g. ""I... this...can't"". Given 8 characters must play each round that is 80 seconds per round, then 70 sec, then 60 sec as you kill the enemy etc. Given you could play 20-30 rounds per combat (especially if you take your time to kill the last rogue to heal your characters) that's typically 15 - 20 minutes of time wasted per battle. Given you play a battle almost every other room you are looking at typically an hour upto 2-3 hours of pure-time-waste per mission, just to watch some animations. I haven't even counted the time while the characters are actually attacking/defending let alone the time travelling in between rooms. There is no option to speed up combat and cut the faff. Playing one mission enables you to heal your resting heroes, and to collect about 10-15k gold, 20-40 heirlooms. Hence, it is a sad time waster. I think twice before launching the game because I know I will be immersed for the best of 3-4 hours just to complete 2-3 repetitive missions, of which half the time I'm just watching animations. Do I really want to spend a few hours just watching my computer play out a battle while I interact a little? I recommend you to wait till this is fixed, because waiting for a better build could save you many many pointless hours.EDIT Jan 2017: After uninstalling and hiding the game for over a year, I decided to give it another try and re-install with all updates . Turns out they have improved speed a little. But one of my best level 6 man-at-arms was first to die against a random undead party, despite having a hard-earned UNYIELDING quirk with 2 rare deathblow-resist trinkets, full armour, dodge etc!!!! he died even before any other heroes with lower DB resist who reached Death's door!!!!! Turns out Death Blow Resist is NOW CAPPED AT 87% meaning even if you have UNYIELDING quirk plus have 2 non-identical trinkets each with 12.5% deathblow resist you max at 87% instead of 97%!!!! So first they disallow combining 2 identical trinkets, THEN even if you worked hard get positive quirk and to find 2 non-identical trinkets to add more resistance, they spoil your fun by CAPPING the resistance value. No other towns to play in except Hamlet. No MP. No difficulty levels. ABSOLUTELY FED UP. CHEAP. TIMEWASTER. UNINSTALLING THIS STUPID GAME AGAIN.			"

												after spending the last 3 days playing this game until the early hours of the morning, I unfortunately have found myself in the ""waste of time"" camp in my opinion of this game. It's infuriating because as many others have pointed out the game absolutely nails the dark desperate tone. But unfortunately the RNG gods are just TOO cruel. There's no respite. and when you level up your favourite character he can't undertake low level adventures.... low level adventures which you have to partake in to level up weaker characters. The most frustrating thing is all the developers would have to do to make this game feel more fair is introduce a difficulty level. Put a few of the enemy creatures at a lower base HP and lower attack damage, maybe ensure the player has more critical hits etc. That way I could at least choose if I want to continously go up against enemies and get slaughtered at every turn. I'm currently stuck on the swine prince, who has an attack that hurts every party memeber about 8-12 damage, and stuns them. whilst the most potent healer can heal up to 12 damage, rng could also mean he heals absolutely nothing. It's just unfair when a boss can take half ot the health of your whole party with one attack, stun them so they can't retaliate, and you can only do pot shots of like 9 damage whilst he has a health bar of over 140+I finally caved in and changed the default options of how the game is played (you have the option to remove enemy corpses which block your positioning for fighting other monsters) I unchecked an option which meant sometimes if I fled from a fight my attempt would be unsuccessful, so of course when a fight was going awry I chose to flee.... only to be told my fleeing attempt was unsuccessful. Why did they give me the option to disable that game mechanic if the game just ignored it anyway?If the game ever gets a few edits to allow some kind of difficulty option, or they give you more customisation in general IE allowing the player to choose if they want to bring higher level characters onto quests, then this would be an immediate buy from me. As it stands however, I don't think I will be able to ever see the any more content in this game which is a shame because it is so well crafted.			"

												I read alot of reviews before I bought this game, and mostly heard things about how it was unnecessarily unfair. These reviews turned me off to the game (which I'd been interested in for awhile). I finally picked it up, and I wish I'd never listened to a bulk of those reviews. Most reviews went on about how the game was brutally relentless, hating the player at every turn and ALWAYS stacking the odds against you. However, upon having played the game myself, I say this is a pro rather than a con. The thing about Darkest Dungeon is that the game wants you to loose (there is even a warning message every time you start the game). And not just in the aspect of RNG. Of course, everything in actual combat is stacked against you. Powerful enemies with powerful moves call for planning at every encounter, and even then, RNG will still bite you. But beyond this, the game is designed to hurt you in the long run. From negative quirks and diseases your heroes pick up, to over stressed heroes, to a lack of funds, to a lack of valid heroes, etc. This sorts of things are meant to build up over time and will lead you to lose unless legitamte effort is put into compensating for the things you will run into. But that's not the whole of Darkest Dungeon. The challenge Darkest Dungeon presents is that no matter how well you play this game, the previously stated difficulties WILL catch up to you. They will hurt you, kill you heroes, and possibly make you lose your playthrough. I think this is why Darkest Dungeon recieves the criticism it recieves. Most gamers nowadays expect a ""right way"" to play their games, to maximize the good and minimize the bad. Darkest Dungeon firmly throws that idea into the pits, and says, ""You are going to suffer, then lose. You will continue to do so, until you win at immeasurable cost."" If this is something you can accept, and are willing to take on, then you should give Darkest Dungeon a shot. Gameplay's fun too. Good ole' turn based action			"

												First up, the presentation is top notch. I love the writing, I love the narrator, the graphics are suitably grisly and good looking. The atmosphere really draws me in and feels perfectly oppressive.The game is very fun at first, and figuring out how everything works is a blast, picking up the new characters and working out their playstyles and strengths and weaknesses. Some of the mechanics are interesting, and it is genuinely unique in how it brings character weakness and trauma to the fore, I found that very interesting, and it made me think.HOWEVER, as much as I really like Darkest Dungeon, I'm not playing it, because it's such a time sink. Progression is very slow and often frustrating, and I feel like I've seen most of what the game has to offer. I don't feel like the game is rewarding at a decent enough rate to respect my time. Your patience may stretch further than mine.I'm looking forward to seeing what the DLC offers, and maybe what the short mode does to improve progression. I may well pick it up again.It's games like this that I feel like I need more than a thumbs up or a thumbs down. I have mixed feelings about it. I say, yes it's a wonderful game to start and explore, and drink in the fantastic writing and presentation. No, it's a bad game to play long term, and get your bang for buck.I feel that it's expensive at full price, for what you really get.			"

								I bought this game a few weeks ago and have been having a blast playing it, at least up until the Inhuman Bondage update. Playing after that update it has turned into nothing by a pointless meatgrinder that spams you with stress and doesn't seem like you are doing anything other than playing a slot machine. The Devs have been very clear that they only want you to play the game the way that they want and have spammed the game with ridiculous mechanics changes in order to punish players; the most prominent is the 'Stall' mechanic that punishes you for trying to heal your party in combat, the only time that you can heal them. Setting aside that they are giving the finger to people that prefer a slower, more cautious playstyle, the mechanic itself is broken it will hit you if you don't manage to kill a single remaining opponent before the round ends and you can completely sidestep it by leaving 2 weak monsters alive instead of one. TL;DRThe Devs seem to be hellbent on taking a great game and ruining it as thoroughly as they possibly can. Don't buy unless they release the final version with all of their bad decisions undone.

												The game was very fun pre-release during early access when the developers weren't trying to screw the player at every turn adding things like corpses and heart attacks... Now the game is an exercise in frustration with the enemies having high dodge, protection, and what seems the roll of the dice on their side.   Enemies focus down your heroes who are low, or have high stress, they will always seem to go first each round, unless you stack speed trinkets which do not appear that often.  Your healer classes will never be able to keep up with the damage of the enemies, no matter how many rounds you sacrafice to healing unless you get lucky with the RNG and get crits.  You get stress on every character when an enemy scores a crit on your heroes, but when the reverse happens and your hero crits an enemy you lucky to recieve any stress relief on the hero who crits, much less every hero.All in all if you like being ♥♥♥♥ed by an RNG then get this game.  If you like strategy dungeon crawling do not get this game.  Oh yeah the art and sound is great too, probably it's only redeeming quality.			"

It's a visually stunning game. And while the premise of the game is good, the actual gameplay is just not fun. The Grind: As others have said, the grind is real. There are too many types of resources to gather and you never have enough money.Terrible loot: Trinkets are not supposed to be all positive, I get it. Still the loot sucks. It's just not funThe crushing defeats: I get it. It's supposed to be hard, but there are just too many crushing defeats to endure. The game should be more fun than frustrating and this is not the case here.			"

												It looks pretty and has an appropriate atmosphere, but if you're the type of gamer who revels in the feeling of meticulous calculations leading to triumphant victory, take a pass on this one.  This just isn't a game for some people, because the RNG is omnipresent and one unlucky dice roll often has catastrophic consequences.  To give you an example, in every single game I've attempted so far, I've lost one of the starting characters due to sequences that would go like this:-Enemy makes their 10% stun save-Enemy makes their 5% chance crit on party member, dealing over half his health in damage and sending him to death phase-Party member takes damage from another source and fails his death save (2/3 chance of success) on their first try.And of course, death is permanent.  So any of your treasured all-stars are subject to this system.  There is no save-scumming because the game continuously autosaves any time anything happens.  I can appreciate that for a game like this, but it does mean that your party is always at risk of being shattered in an instant because an enemy rolled a 20 on a 20 sided die.This has happened 4 playthroughs in a row now, and I'm sick of it.  This game does reward thought, sure, but other times it just kicks you in the ♥♥♥♥ing balls regardless of every little preparation you make.  If you can deal with that, have at it, but me, I can't stand to play a game where regardless of what I do, the fate of my party fundamentally comes down to a series of coin flips, one of which eventually will go wrong.

												If you are the type of gamer that is okay with leaving a game unfinished then there is 10-20 hours of great turn based dungeon crawling to be had. I had a lot of fun with this game getting my characters up through the initial stages and into medium and hard dungeons. Unfortunatly the game becomes a huge grind at this point.  Because death is permament and sudden a few bad encounters or even a couple of bad rolls within an encounter can kill a character that can take upwards of 3 hours to replace, and that is just the for the xp. Currently the best stratagy for seeing end game content in a reasonable period of time is to take a set of 4 newbies from the stagecoach (they are free and how you replenish lost heros) and tossing them into a dungeon with no supplies and getting rid of the survivors.The RNG in this game is really heavy, and don't let people explain it away as skill. Every attack in the game can miss, can be dodged, can hit, or can crit. Dodges and Misses do no dammage while normal attacks have fairly large ranges, a level 4 hellion hit for between 9-19 dammage on normal mobs who had health in the 20-30 range. So you could concievably crit and 1 shot a guy or miss twice and have 2 low dammage rolls and have him still alive on turn 5. Even outside of combat the RNG is pretty random. The one that gets me the most is the hunger checks, before you enter a dungeon you must supply your group with food, torches, and utility items like keys and shovels.  You eat food while crawling to replenish small amouts of HP and when camping in medium and long dungeons.  You also need food randomly when moving between rooms, doesn't matter when your previously ate, or if your party was full (you get full by eating 2-3 food). I have gotten 3 hunger checks before i cleared 5 rooms and have never had one in long dungeons.  Makes everything you provision for exept torches a gamble.But all that RNG is in the spirit of a dungeon crawler like this.  My real issue with the game is the late game grind.  In my experiance it takes 11 sucessful runs to get a hero to level 6, on top of that you will likely need to rest a hero at least once between runs to reduce stress, cure diseases, and purge negitive perks, you can only do 1 of these at a time and they all cost increasing ammonts of gold as you level up.  You also need to upgrade, linearly, a heros skills, armor, and weapons. I would love to see what ammount of money i put into my A-team members, a wild guess would put the number in the neighborhood of around 70,000 each.  And considering the most money i have ever pulled from a dungeon was around 25k means losing 1 or 2 of them like I did on a hard boss makes me quit the game because i am unwilling to grind out the multiple hours of repeditive gampleay needed to replace them.I still play the game in short sessions now but i seriously doubt i will ever have enough time or energy to finish it.  There is a core of a good game here that is padded out unnessaraly to the point that (as of now) only 0.4% of people have finished it (according to achievments) and only 0.2% of people have completed without changing any of the settings to make the game easier.

								The game schematic is nice but badly developed. It requires a lot of thinking for preparing a mission, but then random generation throws in completely inadequate items that make your preparation useless (like needing 3 shovels for a short mission, if I have to buy 3 every time I can never save money).There is a too large gap between missions at lv1 and lv3 (there is lv2). At lv1 you easily win, at lv3 you loose too much even with well equipped lv3 characters.The worst thing of all is the navigation through the menus. Although the game requires you to read every detail of the charactersm, you have to click hundreds of times and opens tens of different windows just to get an idea of simple things. They should put more information available in every window. The player ability should not be the patience to open 15 different windows in order to understand how to develop a character.			"

Game delivers great experience while still being challenging.3: Let it go to your head. Start adding artificial difficulty because a small minority of players decided the game wasn't hard enough.4: Nerf the drop rates for essential items. RNG spawn rediculously difficult enemies on low level dungeons. Make the game even more grindy in order to artificially extend the game.5: Make any party that undertakes a mission in the final dungeon unable to enter the dungeon again, essentially rendering that party, and all the time and energy put into them, completely useless, extending the grind even further.3/10 Grind simulator 2015			"

								Stress management 101Do you like to micro manage?  Then this is the game for you.  I can't even focus on enjoying the game because I'm constantly having to manage all the stress, diseases, and negative quarks the game throws at you.  95% of the books and chests result in negative stats.  The attacks miss a lot even though they should be hitting 80% of the time.  After every venture down into the depths, you have to send your warriors out for stress relief or you risk losing them to a heart attack.  Does this sound like fun?  Well it wouldn't be so bad if the damn stress meter didn't fill up like Bill Gates bank account.  I had a warrior gain 100+ stress in one random battle and die of a heart attack 5 minutes into a level.  If you manage to make it out alive, you have to send all of your warriors with high stress (so basically all of them) on to stress relief hubs, where you have to pay extremely hefty fees and lose them for the next round.  Then you run out of money and cannot buy food and torchs, so you're forced to go into the level with base stat recruits with no money, food, or torches.  Sould like fun yet?  And that is with the level being fully lit up.  Did I mention the torch mechanic?You have to constantly use torches to light up the room or you risk packing on the stress.  How long does a torch last?  ooooh about 3 seconds.  A torch costs 75 gold too and drains your bank account.  This stress mechanic is not innovative, fun, or interesting.  I want to play a rogue-like gothic RPG, not a %%%%ing stress management simulator.			"

Characters' ""quips"" and unnerved rants quickly shift from fun to being a pure annoyance - the single good change the devs made to the game since it was first shown was to allow one to turn them off. You will like this game if you're fond of X-COM style RNG ♥♥♥♥ing you over and over again, sometimes making all and any attempts at strategy that you try pointless. That of course is a selling point of this game and generally would not have discouraged me from continuing to play it.

								Please dont take to heart a lot of the negative reviews, a lot of them are pre-update on what they are writing about. The corpse update has been fixed with an option to turn them off, Damage and stress has been worked on. The game is in early access right now, the developers have even said, ""We are just trying new things to see what works and what sticks"" (I am paraphrasing, but you can find the actual quote). Its a real fun solid game. As of now worth its price. A lot of people also say the game sucks because they are bad at the game. It is hard as hell yes, but not impossible, thats part of the fun.     In this game (As of my reviews update Holiday Cheer Update - Build #12331 (PC and Mac) ),  You start with a tutorial on how fighting works, how the town works, then you are free to pick where you want to battle to find resources. With them you level up ""shops"" so they have better equipment, are cheaper, reduce more stress, level skills etc.      As you go on, you fight harder enemies and bosses, oh and people will die. If you are good, you can save a lot of people from death (I'm talking party members) But it will happen, I'm sorry in advance. Dungeons are generated at random as are what is in them, loot, enemies, traps. You have the option to ditch out at any time at a stress loss, but that sweet loot..... maybe one more room...... F*** a trap.... no we are ok, just one last room. No why the bandits with the whip, you fat- NO NOT THE HEALER! OH GOD WHY, maybe we can win still..... focus on the archer in the back hes the biggest prob- OH GOD THERE ALL DEAD! NOT MY TEAM! WHYYYY!     Greed is the biggest killer, or perhaps instigator fits better. Still, you need to do some serious, risk vs reward assessments. The game is fun as hell, in early access so it will only get better, and the Devs do listen, thats why when corpses came out and everyone was like ""how about no"", they put in an option to turn them off. Give it a chance, worse comes to worse, wait for a sale. But only if you like a challenge.			"

												How to completely ruin a perfectly good game in 5 easy steps:1: Start a Kickstarter, gain a significant following for a unique game with all sorts of lofty promises.2: Get your game into Early Access, Steams Sales for everyone and whatnot. Game delivers great experience while still being challenging.3: Let it go to your head. Start adding artificial difficulty because a small minority of players decided the game wasn't hard enough.4: Nerf the drop rates for essential items. RNG spawn rediculously difficult enemies on low level dungeons. Make the game even more grindy in order to artificially extend the game.5: Make any party that undertakes a mission in the final dungeon unable to enter the dungeon again, essentially rendering that party, and all the time and energy put into them, completely useless, extending the grind even further.3/10 Grind simulator 2015			"

												TLDR: Darkest Dungeon is an extremely shallow, bloated and repetitive grinding simulator. I bought this game because I enjoy (classic) CRPGs and dungeon crawlers as well as tactical combat and strategical gameplay. Suffice to say I am pretty disappointed with what the developers offered me with this game. The little existing content is extremely bloated to give the illusion that the game has more content than it actually does and this in turn makes it very repetitive.Once you figure out which classes are good (most are completely useless and exist simply for cosmetic reasons) then the game is essentially over, because you will do nothing else but grind in a repetitive fashion with the exact same party compositions until you reach the end game. There are also only very few really useful skills and they are good for practically every enemy, which makes the game very shallow.			"

								So, in short.Pros:+ Great viusals.+ Challenging start.+ Good ""dealing withs stress"" mechanics.+ Lots of classes with unique abilities.+ Tight and simple combat.+ Adventure mechanics are good.Cons:- Early access. It always is. End game not ready.- Stale progression system. Basically, raw stats grow, without new mechanics.- Game is easy once you nail it.- Item customisation system is, again, stale.Overall a good RPG/manager game and obviously one to look forward to. Combat is simple, but satisfying. Manager aspect is good, but not great, because customisation options are very limited. I hope dev will revamp item system entirely.			"

												Despite being well made with a fantastic artstyle and interesting core concepts, this game is plagued with no concept of fair challenge or supporting skill over luck, the game is blatantly unfair and punishing, you will rely purely on RNG and very good luck to succeed, nothing to do with player skill, but it's still in open beta so maybe the devs will balance the game later			"

December edit: Look at all the whiners! Oh my, the game is too hard for them now. Cry me a river. It's gotten even better, and I sure hope developers aren't going to listen to all the crybabies.I've gotten this game and played it for five hours straight, which simply doesn't happen to me all that often. It's great.Good:— A true and rare sense of overcoming the odds. When and if you manage to win, it feels good.— Great art direction, great characters and monsters, amazing tongue-in-cheek grimdark aesthetics.— Actually has a surprisingly well balanced learning curve.Bad:— A somewhat clunky interface.— Might get repetitive after a bit. Possibly. Although, after 5 hours of this (and my average in an indie game is, like, 15 minutes) I a have not been bored for even a second.			"

Early Access Review
								For a game in Early Access, there's a lot here that you can sink your teeth into. It makes you wonder why fully priced AAA titles can't be as polished as this game is right now, but I digress.This is a game as much about party management as it is exploring dungeons. The more you use each member of your pary, the more stress they gain, gain enough and they're unusable until you remove it. This forces you to use a wide varity or party members, running the same random generated dungeon doing different quests to get rewards.This is not a game for those who want something light and fun. You'll lose party members (permadeath), you constantly have to balance each members positive ance negative attributes, watch their stress and weigh weather continuing with almost no health and dying is better than escaping early and putting one or more of your party into a fully stressed state, not to mention watching your supplies.This is not an easy game, but it is damn fun and well worth the investment if you're up to the challenge.  Seriously, even if you're against buying games in Early Access, this is one of those rare exceptions where what you're getting is already getting enough content to call this a complete game by many peoples standards.EDIT; In the interest of fairness, there is one aspect of the game pertaining to combat that I dislike greatly. That is how your party will get rearranged if suprised. It's an annoyance since you need to spend turns getting people back into position where they're most effective.			"

Early Access Review
								It was a stormy night that I and Dismas came to this camp; a blood streaked letter clamped in my hand told me my dead uncle had left his estate to me. I remember it from my childhood; a beautiful land full of colour, surrounded by warm fields and swaying trees...Now I stood, letter in one hand and gore soaked sword in the other as I looked upon what had happened to this land. I found the caretaker buttoning up his trousers as he left a ♥♥♥♥♥ to greet me in the centre of village. Welcome, he rasped, to the Darkest Estate. With that greeting, he began to fill me in on my new duties as Lord of the Estate. I suppose that made me Lord Darkest. This grim sense of humour would become commonplace in my world soon enough.The forest had become a land of bandits and mutant swine, their Prince and King strutting and rutting and ruining the land, poisoning all they touched. What had once been a place of beautiful harvest had become nothing more than a land of danger; food supplies could no longer get through and what few rangers he had sent to scout didn't return.He discussed the old estate, filled with monstrous creatures and the undead, led by a Necromancer and his kin. The caretaker dared to imply a connection between these and my late Uncle, but a quick look put that line of reasoning to its end. These would have to be taken care of, as well.And to the ruins in the south, a coven of witches (hags, he muttered between swigs of whisky) had taken over and what few survivors returned spoke of great, sweaty and cackling loonies who ate those who dared to confront them. Their cannibalism had long since driven them insane. He began muttering about how they had come to my Uncle in a guise of beauty, but soon began to splutter and rant without reason or even words. I left him to his ramblings, and his mind.When the latest camp arrived, three nervous individuals had come. One, a woman with a similar faith to myself, a large mace, and a dour grimace. Another women, wrapped mostly in bandages and utterly unrecognisable without her phlaegm coated voice laughing at some joke no one told, echoing inside the bird mask of a Plague Doctor. Lastly, a Bounty Hunter, who simply handed me a picture of a large man in red. When I inquired further, he said he'd help me take his head with the non-expression of a sociopath. I stopped inquiring.We began on this estate, exploring the ruins. We packed food and torches, but little else. Our goal was revenge, although the bounty hunter said it left our pockets empty for recovering assets. The Sister frowned at him, and said donations to the church. The Plague Doctor kept laughing to herself, but I noticed she would pick up whatever diamonds we found.The torch began sputtering immediately, as it fought to hold back the darkness. I held it ahead of me, as much as weapon as the sword I held in my hand. I tried to sheave it, but the idea of not having it ready terrifed me more. The flickering firelight gave movement to every shadow, and every shadow an evil eye glaring at me. It was with a shove that the Bounty Hunter pushed me aside, an arrow flying past me and burying itself in the meat of the Sister's thigh. As we looked ahead, I saw skeletons charged at us down the corridor.No, this is true. Actual skeletons, like inside of you or I, but these moved with a foul purpose, carrying swords, armour and even one in robes with a staff. As he raised it, a dark light surrounded our Plague Doctor, and she began to laugh a little more maniacally. Stuffing her hand in her pocket and shouting about traps, she threw a glittering powder over the the skeletons, which exploded in pops of light. The Bounty Hunter charged ahead, using the dazedness of the skeletons to take the head of the first. Feeling heartened, I picked up my sword and purpose and smashed the largest one in the face with my hilt. It seemed they still felt pain. As he reeled, I pulled a scroll from my belt and banished whatever foul magicks animated him back to hell.The Sister prayed to her god, and a green grow began to close our wounds. However, the damage to our minds remained fresh, and for the Plague Doctor, lethal. We just didn't know it yet.At least, after a night in this place, we found the Necromancer. Foul smelling thing, with a rusty red robe and its face hidden in shadow except for a malign glint, he brought up the bodies of fellow fighters to face us. The Bounty Hunter shouted that the Necromancer was his; poor fool. As I and the Sister contended with the skeletons, the Necromancer surrounded the Bounty Hunter with darkness. As his mind broke, the Necromancer then began to break his body.The Plague Doctor used this time to surround the Necromancer with a special poison gas, and the Sister tried to heal the rest of us, as we watched the Bounty Hunter die. It took an agonisingly long time, and when he was done, all that was left of him that I could recognise was his dying screams in my ears. The Plague Doctor continued laughing. The Sister started praying. All I remember is screaming. Mine or someone else, I don't know.The torch went out. We fought in the dark.A few days, we three came out. The caretaker threw me into the temple, a run down thing, to begin prayer. The Plague Doctor apparently shut herself up in the brothel for days at a time, only leaving for more beer or meat. The Sister whipped herself bloody; I could hear her moans of pleasure echoing through the walls.After several days, they let me out to greet the new arrivals. More had come, apparently word has spread of adventure. I smiled. Welcome to the Darkest Estate. I promise you, there is gold enough for everyone who is brave enough to fight.			"

Early Access Review
								New review:I am addicted to this game. Buy immediately.Old review:Wanted this game for a long time and couldn't bring myself to pay the $20 for it due to it's reviews as ""Dark Souls""-esque in its difficulty.  I hate the Souls series of games, ever since Demon's Souls back in the day.  They started as a bad 3d action game with horrible controls and terrible balance, and then grew into a bad 3d action game with horrible controls and terrible balance _""on purpose""_ because ""anyone who doesn't enjoy dying 1000 times to complete the first level is a casual and blah blah blah.""I want to like this game, and probably would if it were made more clear what the order of operations is of a typical round from start to finish. As it is, you get a loose tutorial that gives you the gist of a few aspects of the screen as they come up.  In a world where we have stupid tutorial screens for simple things, and then this type of instruction on what seems to be a pretty complex game, it would be nice to strike a balance between hand-holding and whatever you would call this.  The best way I can describe this game is that it is a low-class citizen simulator.  You send your characters off dungeoneering, and the system is stacked against you.  Sometimes because many disparate interacting systems will cause inherent imbalances, and other times because the people in charge of those systems hate you and want you to die.  Every day you have to get up and go to work, but this work you have to pay for.  And if you don't work then you'll lose the job, visitation rights to your kids, and the box you live in. You make $5 a day, but the cost of living is $3.50. Every time an enemy hits you he does $2 in damage, and your job is ""guy who stands in front of enemies."" Try not to go into debt with that formula.The interface could use some polish. Why do I have to click and drag heroes all the time? And even still, why do I have to drag them EXACTLY to the box, and not just the region that I'm very clearly working with? This is like having to click on the checkbox instead of the long♥♥♥♥♥sentence attached to the checkbox. Sort that out.The game idea is cool, but it needs some balance tuning at lower levels so you're not piling corpses against a wall because somebody forgot to install a gate.FTL is not fair, and can be daunting to new players, but that is lauded as a classic game. Darkest Dungeon is talked about mostly for its art style.If this game didn't look like Mike Mignola came on the computer screen far less people would give it a shot.			"

								A wonderful game with a beautiful art style.  Darkest Dungeon is one of those games that's simple to grasp the basics of but difficult to master - add in the randomly generated dungeons and you have a recipe for instant chaos for the unwary.  I hesitated when buying it at full price, but for a pre-released game it is suprisingly slick with very few bugs - running better than some fully released games!The dark, lovecraftian story breeds an atmosphere that will get your own heart pounding as your heroes adventure deep into the dungeon.  My advice?  Read everything, upgrade as much as you can and don't forget your torches.			"

								This is a really good game!I was actually very surprised. I really like what the developers have done here and where the game has the potential to go with regards to its continued development, expansions and sequels. It's a hard dungeon-crawler, but it is not impossible to complete once you have an understanding of all the mechanics. I like the looting system. I like the tension the game builds as you become more and more attached to your characters. I like how your characters have distinct personality traits that actually impact gameplay. Basically, this game goes places that are beyond the limited brains of most committee-run, AAA game development companies.    So, Darkest Dungeon is a rogue-like (not rouge-like) dungeon crawler with great art design and excellent immersion. It is definitely worth the money. In actual fact, it is the best purchase I have made in a while. Bravo! Seriously, this game is worth it for $20! It would be worth it for $40!			"

								The game starts out incredibly difficult. Your heroes die in droves. Then from the ruined mounds of failed heroes true champions arise. Suddenly they're cleaving through enemies like chainsaws through hippies. Enemies fall, bosses die, you're steamrolling. The loot is piling up, you suddenly have nice items to equip to your awesome champions. Then suddenly you get into the veteran modes. You go in the dark. You fight guys with giant trees. They crit. Your champion goes down. You barely eke out a win in that fight. Then suddenly it's alright again. You miss that champion but he is soon replaced. Except this time your new champion somehow gets syphilus from a dead body.That's why this game is amazing.			"

Early Access Review
								On my first play through of this game, I thought it was brilliant. I got to week 19 before I ran out of cash after a couple of bad runs. I thoroughly enjoyed the games setting, mood, and mechanics. I eagerly started a 2nd run, and that's where things just went bad. I found myself failing on the first quest I set out on, before I had to restart a new game, and this happened at least 8 times before I packed it in. The game is HUGELY unbalanced at the moment, and is very reliant on luck. The first quest you go on should ease you into the game. Now, while I understand this is an unforgiving roguelike, you need to at least be able to get your foot in the door before your good or bad decisions in the hamlet start affecting your survivability. On the first quest, you have no options, no chance to improve your party, you just get 4 guys and off you go. Literally every first quest I've restarted since my first playthrough has been littered with misses, enemies dodging, whilst they constantly crit crit crit. At the end of the first quest, if I even made it that far, they were all maxed on stress and bleeding out. Back at the hamlet, you spend all your gold treating them, only able to take 2/3 people with you next run due to stress, and then die. Also, why would it recommend on the provisions screen to take just food and torches, when on the first screen...the FIRST screen, I'm faced with 2 piles of rubble. No shovels! Great! That's 50% stress on all characters just after getting in to the dungeon!Eventually I gave up. Today I tried another 2 playthroughs, but each time on the first mission, as badly as it went, I now started getting a crash error when walking near a lootable object which prevented me from proceeding. So never mind the RNG royally screwing you over constantly, now there's game ending bugs in it. The game needs rebalancing hugely. I must have been very lucky my first playthrough, but since then, just extremely unlucky. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. When these game breaking bugs are fixed and the game actually gets balanced, it would be a very very enjoyable game indeed, but until then, based on how random the game is, it doesn't even allow you to play it, and cannot be recommended.Immensely disappointed.

Early Access Review
								 WHY THIS GAME IS UNIQUE:I recently picked up Darkest Dungeon because it appealed to my inner masochist and fascination with the whole medieval/gothic atmosphere thing. As an avid veteran of Demon's Souls/Dark Souls series, I came into this game literally prepared to die, but mostly aware of the challenges I would probably face. I also knew that being in early access development, some mechanics may be a little off or missing altogether. That is why I was so surprised only a couple hours in by how engrossing and complete this dark world felt. Immediately, the narrator steals the scene, reminding me of something akin to running commentary in Bastion. This constant audio companion (voiced by Wayne June) comments on your adventure at nearly every turn, whether in town to tell you a random tidbit of lore, or in battle to convey the sense of the turning of the tide. It is exciting and easily the most unique aspect of this game. Honestly, this man was nearly enough to keep the whole game going on his own.Eventually, though, the glaring problems arise, and they had me scratching my head as to why. The biggest enemy in Darkest Dungeon is not the end boss, the unpredictable fights and traps along the way, or the growing list of mental problems besieging your heroes. The biggest issue is gameplay balance during what you do most - fights. It is curious because these mathematical equations that they have in place are possibly the easiest thing about the game to fix because they are not design hurdles, but rather poor ratios and percentages that might be fixed in a patch. As a veteran of XCOM, I was prepared for the occasional ""how is it possible to miss a shot at 97% three times in row?"" However, Darkest Dungeon punishes the player, so much so that it actively forced me out of my initial fascination and into realizing that this is poor design by choice. You stop believing or even caring about this difficult world to live in because it turns into a Game of Thrones on steroids - a punishment just for punishment sake. You may realize this when you are fully prepared for an ""easy"" dungeon, just to see your crew ambushed and critical hit 3-4 times before you can do anything about it. Before you can even make a choice, half of your party is dead. That 2-3 hours you put into keeping those characters prepared and well-equipped destroyed by some meager random encounter.

Early Access Review
								 WHY THIS GAME IS UNIQUE:I recently picked up Darkest Dungeon because it appealed to my inner masochist and fascination with the whole medieval/gothic atmosphere thing. As an avid veteran of Demon's Souls/Dark Souls series, I came into this game literally prepared to die, but mostly aware of the challenges I would probably face. I also knew that being in early access development, some mechanics may be a little off or missing altogether. That is why I was so surprised only a couple hours in by how engrossing and complete this dark world felt. Immediately, the narrator steals the scene, reminding me of something akin to running commentary in Bastion. This constant audio companion (voiced by Wayne June) comments on your adventure at nearly every turn, whether in town to tell you a random tidbit of lore, or in battle to convey the sense of the turning of the tide. It is exciting and easily the most unique aspect of this game. Honestly, this man was nearly enough to keep the whole game going on his own.Eventually, though, the glaring problems arise, and they had me scratching my head as to why. The biggest enemy in Darkest Dungeon is not the end boss, the unpredictable fights and traps along the way, or the growing list of mental problems besieging your heroes. The biggest issue is gameplay balance during what you do most - fights. It is curious because these mathematical equations that they have in place are possibly the easiest thing about the game to fix because they are not design hurdles, but rather poor ratios and percentages that might be fixed in a patch. As a veteran of XCOM, I was prepared for the occasional ""how is it possible to miss a shot at 97% three times in row?"" However, Darkest Dungeon punishes the player, so much so that it actively forced me out of my initial fascination and into realizing that this is poor design by choice. You stop believing or even caring about this difficult world to live in because it turns into a Game of Thrones on steroids - a punishment just for punishment sake. You may realize this when you are fully prepared for an ""easy"" dungeon, just to see your crew ambushed and critical hit 3-4 times before you can do anything about it. Before you can even make a choice, half of your party is dead. That 2-3 hours you put into keeping those characters prepared and well-equipped destroyed by some meager random encounter. This is what you must be willing to face in Darkest Dungeon. No measure of preparation can save you, no measure of finesse. The sad state of balancing extends to the characters, whose abilities range from average to completely useless. Upgrading, leveling or any sense of progression here doesn't do much other than raise your chance to hit, something that the monsters in these ""dark"" dungeons have no problem doing.To further exemplify my point that this is not just a small balance tweak, but a poor design choice, is the game's forcible handicap system.

												Review Nov 2016:Fantastic game with critical design flaw that ruins it. When it was in early access I tried to warn everyone about this flaw, and it wasn't addressed, and now, well read many of the reviews, its the flaw that kills the game: it doesn't respect your time. I'm the biggest fan of roguelikes. But roguelikes do not work for very long (100+ hours) games, like this. THe forumla does not work. Roguelike gaming sessions should go from 30 minutes to 4 hours -- a roguelike where you can be 100 hours in and ruin your game is bad design. Amazing game but I'd only recommend playing it if you have 120 hours to spare of your life. I have never played a single player game with as much grinding as this one. In this game, you could seriousely put in 60. 70.80 hours into it, and than have two or three unlucky quests and be hooped -- you are set back real life time of 30 hours to regain your position. It is just unacceptable to me.This is the best game that I ever have NOT recommended. Honestly, would only get into this game if you don't work or go to school, like if you are a retiree or unemployed or something, and don't feel guilty grinding for 50 hours. More stuff.WHERE IT WENT WRONG: I'm 100% sure this is the flaw with the game design process. The flaw is that the designers never had to play their game as players do. It would be impossible to play test of course, without giving themselves unlimited gold. But in doing so, the designers completely lack the concept of how much time it would take to play this game. Progression is glacier slow. And if you are cheating in testing, then you don't feel the frusturation of sinking 50 hours into a bunch of characters and then have them killed (and unrecoverable). If you can just respawn from saves than you lose that sense of annoyance that the actual players have playing the actual game. Earlier review from June 2013: Really divided on this game. I'm anxiously waiting for the final release. As the game is now, I just can't recommend it, I think more than half the people playing the game will find it more frusturating than fun. The game is potentially fantastic, but as it is now, it is just too punishing. I love hard games but this is punishing in the sense that you may spend 10 or 15 hours of IRL time developing a character, and then you may lose him permantly if you get two bad dice rolls in a row or through no fault of your own. I just don't have 200 hours to put into this game, its becomes more of a grind than it is fun.			"

												The Darkest Dungeon is a classic dungeon crawler, with brutal difficulty, yet very carefully balanced mechanics. It is extraordinarily hard but never to a point of being unfair. However, you will have to go through a certain amount of grind in order to reach the endgame dungeons. Despite being slightly repetitive, I enjoy this kind of gameplay which reminds me of the days when games were not a widely spread form of entertainment such as it is today. The Darkest Dungeon gives a tribute to this bygone era, and on top of that provides fresh and crisp visuals that stand out in comparison with other roguelike indie games which prefer the ""x""bit visual styles. The audio is superb quality, with an atmospheric soundtrack and a punctual narration. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, challenging games and gothic horror atmosphere. This is not for the faint of heart, or for people with no patience.			"

												Darkest Dungeons is a unique game, it's so unlike anything I've ever played before that I'm not sure that there is one genre I could describe it as.  As I'm lacking a genre, I'm going to make one up.  Darkest Dungeon is a strategic Lovecraftian themed resource management game with elements of dungeon crawling.  It's quite a mouthful, I know, but it's the most accurate title I can create.  Popularly this game is referred to as a roguelike dungeoncrawler,  but I've played many roguelike dungeoncrawlers and would not describe Darkest Dungeon like that at all.You play as a relative of the now deceased owner of an estate.  It is your mission to cleanse the estate of the many horrors that lurk there and in the surrounding countryside.  This is accomplished through expeditions that reward you with resources that can be used to restore the hamlet to its former glory.  As you upgrade the hamlet and defeat bosses further details of the game's story slowly unravel.For each mission you choose a team of four heroes to send off.  Which heroes you choose, which skills they have, and what position you place them in are all important for combat.  In addition to the heroes you take, you must also decide what supplies you want to bring.  It reminds me of Oregon trail in way, except it's far more terrifying.  What's really interesting about Darkest Dungeon is the stress mechanic.  As you traverse through dungeons the stress level of a hero will slowly increase.  There are also enemy attacks that inflict stress.  Once stress reaches 100/200 a hero will either gain an affliction or become virtuous.  A hero that becomes afflicted has effectively lost their mind and will be a detriment to the party and a virtuous hero overcomes their stress and becomes a positive actor.  At 200 points of stress a hero will have a heart attack.  Stress can be reduced by camping, from certain skills, and through activities in the hamlet.Stress is something that I don't recall ever seeing addressed in a videogame before.  It makes a lot of sense really.  You frequently see games starring a hero that spends their days slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of people/monsters/robots/whatever.  At the end of the day it seems likely that they'd have quite the case of PTSD.  The stress mechanic also factors into the resource management aspect of the game.  Heroes in Darkest Dungeon are somewhat disposable, but it is still in your best interest to keep them alive.  This means that at any given time it is likely you will have a number of your characters assigned to a stress recovery activity and locked out use for expeditions.  The end result is that you will want a roster filled with possible teams rather than one dedicated group.Maintaining a roster with multiple teams is more involved than one might expect.  Dungeons have max level restrictions, and you can only enter a dungeon with a full party of four.  If you don't have enough characters within the level range for a mission you will not be able to attempt it at all.  In an effort to make sure everyone is at the right level at the right time, I found myself doing hundreds of expeditions.  The real issue here and main flaw with Darkest Dungeon is that once you've done two or three missions in each area, you've seen almost everything the game has to offer.  I found it to be extremely repetitive.  The tedium of doing the same missions over and over is compounded by some late game events (nothing specific to avoid spoilers) that ultimately increase the amount of repetition.Darkest Dungeon looks and sounds excellent.  The characters, enemies, and town all look very impressive.  I don't know what the name of the art style is but it  reminds me of a pop-up books.  I'm not sure where they found the announcer, but he really makes the game.  His booming disembodied voice shouts memorable quotes as you battle your way through dungeons.  I had some of his phrases stuck in my head weeks after I finished playing the game.Darkest Dungeon was difficult for me to review on Steam.  The restriction of recommend “yes/no” is too simplistic.  If there were a “maybe” option, it's what I would choose to give this game. In my mind the graphical style and sound are so strong and so memorable that the game gains major points in these categories.  The idea of stress affecting adventurers in a game is creative and something I haven't seen elsewhere.  It's implemented in a very clever way that is very logical if you've had any real life experience with stress.  I loved how heroes resort to vices in an attempt to relieve stress.  Unfortunately the gameplay falls a little flat.  I found it to be somewhat easy, simplistic, and tedious.  This is a game that I would cautiously recommend, and only if it is on sale.  For those looking for a dungeon crawler, be aware that this is more of a resource management type of game.Click here to see my other reviews. "

Early Access Review
								An excellent, unforgiving, and frustratingly luck-reliant game that still manages to be absolutely worth playing, even though it's still in early access.  Just plain fantastic art design and aesthetics along with some really interesting gameplay concepts (the Stress system as a companion to the standard Hit Points really makes combat interesting and nuanced) make this a game at least worth watching, though it's also quite fun to play.It's best to go into DD with an XCOM mindset - low level characters are completely expendable and should be viewed as just another resource like your gold and your heirlooms, used and then discarded once they've served their purpose.There's still one more basic area to be unveiled - the Cove - and then the final area of the game, the Darkest Dungeon, so any existing balance issues (and there are plenty) will likely be solved by then.  There's also an enterprising person working on a ""Deepest Dark"" mod for the game that in many ways echoes some elements of the XCOM Enemy Within mod, Long War, by making the game more complex and much more difficult while also making it less reliant on luck and more reliant on good tactical decision-making, something the vanilla game is a bit light on.Even without Deepest Dark, I got almost 20 hours out of the game before it started to get a little old, and that's pretty damned good considering it's only about 2/3 complete and it's only $20.  If you like XCOM or Roguelikes, Darkest Dungeon is worth your time.			"

Early Access Review
								     After years of playing online RPG’s, this game has done something none of the other games possible could do….gave me insight into the selfish mindset of the NPC quest giver.      At first, I sent my adventurers into each quest well provisioned and quick to send them to the inn or brothel to refresh after each return. I emotionally waivered over fixing a quirk that my impulsive clicking gave to a beloved character or splurging on a larger brothel.      Then after failure, and failure, and failure…. That empathic worry calcified into scorn over an individual’s weakness to succumb to stress. I stopped worrying about paranoia or massive outbreaks of syphilis as I unremorsefully sent adventurers to their deaths. Again and again. Even if the chances were remote, if  they succeeded, my town (and brothel) grew. If they failed, their names were etched with the others in the graveyard that was more populated than some small countries. But hey -- there was always another wagon of fresh volunteers.       No matter what villain lies at the end of this game, I relish in the fact that it is unlikely to have a higher bodycount than mine.  Oh yah – great game 10/10 "

Early Access Review
tl:dr - If you want a challenging game that involves preparation, risk versus reward management, tactics in a lovecraftian setting with great narration and music, GET THIS GAME. Darkest Dungeon is an adventurer managing game that mainly has two phases.  The first phase is your Managing phase where you upgrade equipment, buy trinkets, teach skills, and watch your adventurers relieve their stress by meditating in calm seclusion, praying to whatever deities exist in this land, drinking til they get drunk and lost for a week or two, or just go out wenching (hey, whatever works), etc...  While your adventurers are relieving their stress or getting rid of a bad trait, they are unavailable for the next phase, the Adventuring phase.  It is in this phase that your adventurers head into a procedurally generated dungeon with an objective (scout, find specific quest items, clear rooms, kill bosses, etc) to find loot, glory, fufillment, or just get their brains scrambled by stress and die while gibbering in fear.Your success during the dungeon phase primarily depends upon how prepared you are and what risks you are willing to take.  Certain heroes are better than others in certain types of dungeons and will give you an easier time.  Your party composition is extremely important along with your heroes' positioning and selected skills, as most skills can only be used in certain positions.  The last part of preparation, which also ties into risk management, are the items that you take with you into the dungeon.  Before you head in, you can buy usable items such as food, torches, bandages, potions, medicinal herbs, etc.  They cost money so it'll cut into your gains (and possibly create a loss) and might be a waste if you buy too much and don't use it.  However, buy too little and you'll run into RNG risks non-stop.  If you run out of food, your heroes will lose hp and gain stress when they're hungry.  If you don't keep your torchlight more than 3/4 full, your party positioning has a chance of being switched around when you enter combat (the less light you have, the higher the chance of your party being surprised by the enemy when you enter combat and that switches your heroes around).  However, you can also prepare for this by equipping skills that move your hero around so that you're not caught completely with your pants down.  Most of the interactable objects you encounter in the dungeon are NOT completely safe unless you use a certain item (such as bandages for a rack of blades, if you don't use a bandage when you interact with it, you MIGHT get some items OR you can get injured and start bleeding).Don't stay too attached to your ALL of your heroes (especially early on in the game), as death comes rather easily if you tend to take risks.  Sometimes, you just don't have the proper counter item in your inventory as you approach an interactable object; you'll have to make the choice of whether to risk it for loot or just walk past it (Of course, we risk it and end up getting diseases which gets our hero killed).  If your heroes build up too much stress, they can get an affliction which makes things rather difficult, as they might start doing things that are out of your control, such as automatically repositioning themselves, refusing to let other heroes heal them, increase other heroes' stress, etc...  At some point, if you're not confident you can complete the dungeon, it's sometimes better to retreat (your heroes will gain stress from failing however, and if you don't have enough money to help them relieve their stress, you'll have to recruit new heroes and try again).The game can be rather unforgiving, but the more you play, the easier it gets, even after failed ventures.  Venture into the dungeons and you'll find heirlooms that you can bring out with you, and this will allow you to upgrade your facilities so that you can recruit more heroes, have more openings for relieving stress, relieve stress for cheaper, upgrade to better equipment, etc...  Eventually, it'll get cheap enough that sustaining some heroes and removing their bad quirks becomes viable, so you can keep the heroes you like.  The downside is, when your heroes' levels get too high, they refuse to take on the easier dungeons, so you'll need to rotate some fresh blood into your hero pool to do the easier missions.Pros:The game's ambience is incredible.  The art style, the music, the characters, etc...  Everything just ties in so well to make you feel the sense that horror does stalk this land.The narration is one of the best that I've heard in a video game and seriously adds to the Lovecraftian feel of the game.Challenging decisions - In other RPGs, choosing a skill, leveling the skill, and upgrading equipment just bumps a number up so you can kill something 3 seconds faster.  Here, choosing the right thing to level with your limited resources means the difference between life and death.  All optional equippable trinkets have a positive and negative aspect to them which makes choosing even more important.  Inventory management is another challenging decision, as you need to decide on what to keep, what to hold on to, whether you should toss that counter item for a possible interaction, etc... Combat - You're almost always on your toes in combat, as even the easy monsters can ruin your day by adding serious amounts of stress to your heroes.  Even more so if you ran out of light and your positions get switched around, or if you were ambushed while you were making camp.Replay value - Many different ways to play.  You can play safe and carry around enough torches to maintain your party formation, or play risky by bringing only heroes that have skills that reposition themselves while attacking for more loot from the darkness.  Or you can constantly make short incomplete trips into dungeons while switching and discarding heroes left and right.  It's up to you how you want to play.Cons:Early Access - At this point, there's only 3 areas for dungeons.  Can't sell trinkets yet either so your trinkets chest just gets increasingly cluttered.  The Hero list also gets slightly cluttered if when you have lots of heroes and it doesn't stay sorted the way you want it too.  If you've upgraded all your town buildings (this might take a while though), your heirlooms are useless.  Occasional bugs here and there.Bosses - Difficult in a bad way.  Namely a ""if you don't have the right team composition, you'll probably lose"" bad way.  You'll probably either have to look them up or lose a party to them to figure out what party composition you should bring.Not being able to bring any of your higher level heroes on lower level runs is designed to make things more difficult, but kinda makes leveling unwanted since I can't play with heroes that I've grown attached to.Lack of inventory space makes it so that there is less incentive in running the longer dungeons.  You either spend so much money buying supplies to last through it, that you won't make as much of a profit (and you can't carry as much loot out), or you end up not finishing it, which means that doing the shorter dungeons would've been more profitable as you can get the quest rewards for finishing it (and you don't have to deal with failure stress).  The only incentive for finishing the longer dungeons then is possibly for the trinket.Time only progresses when you go adventuring. Even if you have excess gold and want to take a week off of adventuring because your main heroes are spending a week relieving their stress, YOU CAN'T.  At the very least, you'll have to send a team into the dungeon every week, even if you immediately abandon the quest as you enter. "

												Still in early access but definitely shines.  It is the type of game you play for a few hours at a time, not all day or you might end up breaking a keyboard.  I backed the game from Kickstarter and am eagerly awaiting updates.  The developers keep their backers up to date and allow us to give input.Sale or not...buy it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Post Retail ReviewGreetings Everyone!  Thought I’d give some continued thoughts on this game now that I’ve beaten what is the retail release in all its glory!  If you just want the short hand, yes the game is still great; yes you should still buy it immediately.Let me start by saying the game is brutal, but honest (despite my emotional outbursts at it from time to time).  Randomness is a thing (RNG is a cruel mistress even more on this game) to the point of disastrous defeats and (less common) the miraculous victories.  The one thing you must understand is that your adventurers are disposable, all of them.  Equipment can be reacquired, afflictions cured and stress removed.  When all is said and done your hamlet is the real ‘you’ the important thing you need to focus on.Graphically the game is beautiful in its own way, yes it is not Triple A graphics or cutting edge but it is beautiful and well done.  Game play is simple but solid; actually would make a great tablet or even smart phone game.  Yes, it is a very simplified RPG, but like all great RPG’s the magic comes in the form of the interactions.  Balance is more or less spot on when it comes to the classes and yes, some classes feel useless (Antiquarian) and some feel essential (Man at Arms, Bounty Hunter, Vestal) but over all you can build your own unique groups and have a decent success rate.My one real critique is that the ending is a bit…well, meh.  I loved what they were going for (no spoilers) but the way they could have implemented it felt a bit lacking.  Again, I LOVED what the ending implied but felt it could have been better implemented.  The final dungeon felt a bit too easy too.Ultimately, if you like RPGs, Tactical Games, or even just Horror (specifically Lovecraftian) then you owe yourself at least a chance at this great game.  Would buy again, would back again (KickStarter) and in hindsight wish I was even more involved in the creation!  Buy it, support this company!			"

								SO FAR THE BEST HPL COC BASED GAME ON STEAM!!!Pro:1. The art style is unbeatable! 2. Dumbed down SAN system (stress system) that still keep most of it's taste, a really good starting point for all new comers to pick up the feeling of a COC game... Going insane might not be a bad thing in dire time...3. Risk And Gain! The torch system allow player to balance their way of play, you can ether play safe by keep your torch fully light most of the time, or take the risk by dim it down for harder fight but better loot.4. This game is HARD, not hard to control or learn, but just that when you venture into the dungeon, that simply becomes 4 adventurers against then entire world of evil and shadow. Everything want you die, even the lootable chest and bags might kill off half of your team and force the rest of them to run with their tail between their legs... And level up might not always be a good thing, other then getting perks, there are chance that you will get sickness or weakness as a reward for leveling up... 5. In the land of lurking shadow, there are no such thing as safety... Anything out there or a slightly not so welly thought decision might become the downfall of your adventurer... Welcome to the domine of The Old Gods!!!6. If that old man speaks the truth... We shall have a really cute silvery hair girl waiting for us at the deepest part of the dungeon... Nyaruko ist mine~~!!! \@o@/ SP-99Con:1. Err... This game is hard... You bound to lose team after team of adventurer, or have them withdrew barely alive and on the brink of insanity, This might be favorable for some player, but might also kill off some other player.2. Dev is still testing out different coding for the game, so every patch some part of the code might be changed, this results to fix bugs for some but also breaking game for some, so if your game is not working after a patch... it is normal, just keep an eye on the forum, as people will be working on a way to by pass the issue and make the game playable again... Usually through endless screaming, cursing, murking, trolling, noob calling, insult tossing, crying, jumping up and down on their bed... Err... That was another forum, the Darkest Dungeon ones are slightly better then that...Well... I don't think i have another else to say about this game anymore... Now I need to find some way to restore my SAN, it is -37 now...Will go insane for this game again! 10/10 -HPL			"

												This game is the best and worst of the turn based genre. Unfortunately, the WORST part is WORSE than the GOOD parts. A lot of the bosses feel downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They don't match their difficulty listings at all. ""Level 1 - Medium"" Party of level 2s with max gear and rare relics gets obliterated in under 3 turns at full hp. My party randomly didn't get to have their turns, even when they weren't stunned. The boss would take his turn with all 4 of his actions, then do them all over again. Bug or not, it has RUINED my opinion and experience with this game.Like the mannor you're supposed to restore, I hope this garbage rots in hell just the same.EDIT: I forgot to add this little tidbit:If your hard work actually keeps your group alive and gets them to certain level markers, they flat out refuse to do anything that wouldn't instantly kill them. Hit level 3? They refuse to do level 1 missions. It's not even a quirk. They're all just arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. For a game so focused on quirks and unique personalities, this is a pathetic attempt to keep the game ""Challenging"". This just takes away from the game's immersion when a character with a cowardly trait says the enemies aren't worth his time. WHAT!?			"

								Ah, this game, this game... Where to begin? I like a good turn-based dungeon crawler and I like Lovecraft, so solely based on atmosphere, art style and voice over, this game is worth 10 € and a few hours of my time.The difficulty never really bothered me, although it did cause me to sit up straight, swap beer for tea and just really try.If you apply a well planned strategy, take the time to understand the game, and prepare well for every mission, it can be done. There is just a steep, steep learning curve and every new patch will throw you off-balance a bit because they add new bits and bobs that you have to incorporate into your strategy.The Constant-Save forces you to think before acting, but the game is forgiving in that sense, that even when you've really arsed up, you still have the other heroes on the roster to try and fight. It's not a game ender, like in some games (I'm looking at you, Don't Starve!). Just remember, never think you can just click 'n kill in this one, because that's when you loose three heroes that were perfectly fine going in. Love it!			"

												Too much grinding.  Its super hard to make any meaningful progress and its really easy to lose it all.The game also lacks contrast.  It's all grim dark all the time.  It bashes you over the head with it and never stops.  The single note theme and story combined with the unrelenting grind makes for a tedious experience.			"

								Ok first and foremost, im not particualarly a fan of Roguelikes. I love to be able to start from where i left off. I get emotionally attached to my characters and i like being the savior of the universe, with no help from some stinkin friends!! That said, i love this game. Bought it yesterday and played it,non stop, for about 10 hours afterwards. The only bug i have had so far is i got shorted on one trip into the dungeons and somehow only 3 characters showed up on a trip to kill one of the bosses or mini bosses. I thought after reading all the comments on the game that id be meat. Turns out  i  must have had a killer 3 party members(one lvl 1 2 lvl 2, unsure of the exact party makeup but def had a vestal for healing 2 of the 3 were def maxed on armor and 2nd lvl spells) I believe the boss was the necromancer. But with stuns, which i expected to fail half of the time, it was a pretty easy beatdown. (one hit would stun first 2 combatants) Im sure it was also combined with the luck i had in finding the boss in one of the fist 5 rooms. and so far, i am loving the gameplay, style, music, voiceovers and yes even the banter amuses me wholeheartedly. Sure its rough at the start, but shouldnt all games be? Yes you have to run from battles and possibly give up on quests before your done with them and either retrain or party up your toons to get rid of stress/personality disorders you can accrue, and you WILL accrue A LOT of them if your not careful. Someone likened it to an adventuerer simulator? Not a bad analogy. You can expand your roster(so far i have a pool of 13, 3 to choose from at any given time, but also can be expanded), build your city up to be able to get rid of personality traits that can cripple you in battles, releive stress after a dungeon crawl and build your abilities.  I reccomend getting all the different classes and having fun with each, as they all have differing enough abilities that they all have SOME use, albeit, not all are as fun to use. (and im sure everyone has a favorite/least favorite class, which is what every game SHOULD have!) At this point ive only ""lost"" 1 starting character and 1 character from stupidity of not running. Any other than the ones ive re-named for myself have been ""let go"" by me because of the playstyle or just not wanting to relieve their stress. ;) Ive found if you have a deep roster of characters you like and some throwaways, you can run dungeons to stock up on cash and prizes while using said cash and prizes to upgrade your ""mains"".  Do be aware once your mains hit a certain level they will not go back into beginner dungeons. (veteran 3 was when i found out that they refuse to go back into lvl 2 and 1 type dungeons) So if youll probably end up not using your mains when you hit up some of the bosses for the first few levels. I also realize im just scratching the surface of the game even after 10 hours of romping around dungeons, sometimes barely making it out alive, and sometimes..well not everyone makes it out. Do you have to pay attention? HELL YES.  Can it be frustrating? also HELL YES. Is it SUPER HARD? I wouldnt say so. Its a CHALLENGE, something that is sorely missed in alot of the AAA titles nowadays and i thank god we have a few indie devs that get that and make the games THEY want to make while hoping we as a community like it to. And for whatever reason this game just has ""it"" for me.			"

								Usually I try to avoid early access. Mostly it is just rubbish that just gets tossed out in an attempt to make lots of money. But this is one of my favourite games already. I've got to say if it hadn't said early access, I wouldn't have noticed. The game feels well thought out, solidly coded and bug free so far.I truely enjoy the gameplay and the difficulty. If you like turn based strategy combat, this game will be a great addition to your library. Having to juggle so many unavoidable things, such as resources, sanity and health. It is almost impossible to keep everyone in your party in the best conditions.Controlling a ragtag group of adventurers through a dark and dangerous ruin is far from easy, but it is fun. Be warned, this game is not for the faint-hearted. The environment is against you, enemies are against you, and sometimes even your party is against you.Heartily recommend.			"

								Darkest Dungeon is one of the best games I've played in recent memory. It's hard to believe the early access tag.This game aims to keep the player in a perpetual state of discomfort. If you're looking to play an indestructible badass then stay away. Your party of heroes will be fighting in the dark, often bleeding and slowly losing their minds. As the game puts it ""It's about making the best of a bad situation"".The classes feel unique and combat flows well. There's just enough numbers to give the system depth while trying to keep things simple. Debuffs are easy to understand and the importance of positioning quickly becomes apparent.The game's not perfect by any means. The characters talk often and it wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't stop you from doing anything every time a dialog bubble pops up. My only other gripe is being subject to the randomness of available missions. Since specific mission rewards are needed for upgrades, not having any control is frustrating.Then again, the game is about making the best of bad situations.TL:DR Buy this game. It's maddeningly good.			"

Early Access Review
								Roguelike dungeon crawler with a lovecraftian flair.=early access review=  (build 7635)Did you play Darksouls?  Did you enjoy the difficulty but think to yourself ""Gee, the only thing that would make this game better is if I had to start over every so often from the beginning?""  Because if so, then you might enjoy Darkest Dungeon.  This game is no joke difficult.  Don't walk into it and get attached to your characters, they will die.  When they do die, they're gone, for good.  Not only that, the ones that do might be the lucky ones.  A plethora of madness and pain await the never ending stream of new recruits that arrive every week by carriage into your cursed town.  The plot is pretty great and you can build up your town, allowing your fresh meat to possibly walk to their deaths slightly better equipped than the last group you sent to their deaths.  Further more, even though I swore off early access games after the Spacebase DF-9 fiasco, I'm glad I didn't pass on this one.  I find myself venturing into the maddening dark over and over, and gleefully awaiting each new update.  With promises of new classes and 2 more dungeons, I forsee this being on my 'play' list for a while.For the price, if you like roguelikes, oldschool D&D vibe, with a splash of Lovecraftian horror, you will not regret buying Darkest Dungeons.

Early Access Review
								This game... Wow.. This is a rogue like I can get into. Name each recruit after a steam friend and watch them all develop, it's good fun (sorry a few of you have died..). But seriously, great game. It's hard but fair, crits seem to control combat a BIT too much. I also feel stress needs to have additional way when inside a dungeon to be controlled. Some runs it skyrockets so quickly and early without any method to contain it.It's a roguelike that will make you pull your hair out, but once you understand the mechanics you'll have no one to blame for killing your heros but yourself... Unless the enemies by fluke kill your hero by focus firing and critting multiple times in a row (RIP nyri).Pros:-Artstyle is fantastic-Insanely Difficult, but fairly so.-Each class is unique, and discovering the synergies is fun.-Dying is rage inducing, but not the end of your game nessisarily.-20$ game in alpha that has given me more fun than 60$ AAA titles, in ALPHA its more complete than most games!Cons:-Crits control the game flow too heavily-Stress needs more ways to be managed-Upon maxxing stress, the odds of a negative reaction seem WAY to high compared to a positive.-Dungeon difficulties is not properly lined up with your character's hero levels, meaning sometimes you have level 3 heros but only lvl 1 or 5 dungeons to do... meaning you're stuck in a bad spot.-Some heros are too weak (Jester and Grave robber)What I'd like to see for this game to be great:-More heros introduced-More dungeon/monster types-Different skins for heros to make them unique-More narrirator voice options			"

								Probally one of the funnest burst enjoyment I have had in a game for awhile now. I have not played the game heavily as of yet but definitely plan too in the future. This game allows you to actually show sympathy towards your heros, actually caring when your favourite character is on deaths door. Or when they cheer up the whole team with their amazing bard skills. Regardless this game made a brilliant first impression with its amazing looking hand-drawn art style and the narrations is top notch! The game always keeps you on your feet and requires you to carefully think about your actions instead of mindlessly trying to take on bosses without carefully considering there move set and positioning. From personal experience I can say this game is both unforgiving and so rewarding at the same time. There have few occasions when my characters have died, but theese were to silly mistakes or being too confident and forgetting to bring a bandage.Overall, this game is outstanding for early acces and cant wait to play when fully released. The combat feels great and works well with the dark atmosphere of the game. But most of the time I have to admit you rely on the RNGesus for quite alot of deaths making some really unique and funny moments. :)			"

Do be aware once your mains hit a certain level they will not go back into beginner dungeons. (veteran 3 was when i found out that they refuse to go back into lvl 2 and 1 type dungeons) So if youll probably end up not using your mains when you hit up some of the bosses for the first few levels. I also realize im just scratching the surface of the game even after 10 hours of romping around dungeons, sometimes barely making it out alive, and sometimes..well not everyone makes it out. Do you have to pay attention? HELL YES.  Can it be frustrating? also HELL YES. Is it SUPER HARD? I wouldnt say so. Its a CHALLENGE, something that is sorely missed in alot of the AAA titles nowadays and i thank god we have a few indie devs that get that and make the games THEY want to make while hoping we as a community like it to. And for whatever reason this game just has ""it"" for me.			"

												I don't typically write EA reviews, but DD is an exception. I don't like rogue-like games. I don't like games that are frustrating. I've gottent too old for games like that. I play games for fun. I play games to replax. So I shouldn't like DD. Yet I find this to be simply one of the better games I've played this year. It is exceptionally fun while being frustrating. There's a wonderful mix of tension, frustration and triumph. The theming of the game is exceptional - the voice-overs, the look, the feel all build this wonderful universe of gloom. There's tension around every corner and you feel every decision is meaningful. There's plenty of options to cater to your playstyle. I truly feel that every decision I make in Darkest Dungeon is a crucial one. Very few games feel that way. Thus I find DD to be also a fairly intense game to play. Furthermore, they've done a great job during EA of balancing classes, adding content and ironing out some annoyances. It's nice to see someone use EA the way it was meant - getting community feedback and using it to make the product much better with a clear plan to get to a truly complete release candidate. Props to them for that too.This is a game that will get you screaming at your monitor. You may even break your keyboard. But it's tense, brilliant, fun and I recommend it for every gamer.			"

								Great game! I have a lot more hours in cause it won't open inside of Steam. Check ""troubleshooting"" in forum if you're having problems. The difficulty is there ... but not unfair or punishing. Here are some tips:“Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer” – Don’t jump levels.-	Bring enough torches to keep light levels above %75 – Surprise enemies – Use light-based trinkets-	Keep mental track of which enemies have already attacked-	Scouting is good – Torch up before room battles.-	Always pack shovels and enough food to avoid going hungry-	Type “Darkest Dungeon Curio” into google-	Name characters after quirks to be removed and locations they are weak and strong in-	Always correct your character order after battles-	Experiment with push/pull tactics .. some enemies have nothing in certain positions.-	Always bring a Vestal – Healing saves lives-	Develop character’s guild skills so they have positional flexibility – Enemies will scramble you.-	(not all but) The majority of trinkets are garbage  – Drop them and keep better loot-	Accuracy is winning – Enemy dodge increases in later levels-	Criticals are winning - Flip the script on tough battles and reverse stress-	Dodge is winning - Reduce damage and stress taken-	Avoid trinkets that lower accuracy, criticals, and dodge (unless counterbalanced by other trinkets)-	Unequip core trinkets after battles – Give them to the next team going out.-	Always scroll over enemies to see their “stun-bleed-blight” susceptibility before attacking-	Stun is clutch – Stun enemies with the highest speed so their first hit is compromised-	Prioritize enemies that use stress attacks-	Kill weak enemies first so they can’t continue attacking-	Be selective about which quirks to remove -	Throw young recruits in the fire … if they live … Nice! … If they died … mehhh.-	Dismiss characters that are stressed out and saddled with negative quirks.-	A lot of Blight in the Weald – Plague Doctors Battle Medicine helps-	Bleed skills aren’t great in the Ruins – Too many skeletons "

												Darkest Dungeon is a strange game (but in a good way if you read further and peruse my reasoning).It's a gritty dark fantasy adventure set in an undetermined time. You act as an overseer who recruits motely crews of adventurers to unearth relics (and whatever isn't nailed down) from the ruins of your ancestors' lands. Unfortunately one of your ancestors dealt too far into the occult, unleashing some horror which wears down on the resolve and sanity of your heroes (that's where the Lovecraftian stuff comes into play).Seems fair enough, and enough of a reason to get into it and play it. What makes this game strange is the idea that failure isn't only a possibility, but inevitable. The grim, gritty atmosphere isn't only in the graphics (which are beautiful, inspiring, and decadent at the same time), but in the gameplay and feelings evoked by this game. Expeditions into the ruins of your ancestors will fail, and death/madness is a likely prospect given that your adventurers have both HP and stress to manage throughout the game.Gameplay wise, it plays as a party rogue-like with turn-based combat. There is copious strategy to be discovered and applied as you unearth the ruins and build a competent enough team to assault the 'Darkest Dungeon'. To prepare your hired cohorts, you can find relics and family heirlooms in the various parts of the manor's surrounding lands to help upgrade the hub village you use to rest and arm your hirelings. With these heirlooms, you upgrade the various businesses and buildings: upgrading the blacksmith allows you to better arm your (surviving) heroes. Upgrading the Inn enables your unhinged heroes to restore their sanity by taking their mind off the oppresive atmosphere via gambling, drinking, and of course whoring. Your more pious heroes benefit from the chapel, which allows them the option of prayer or sacrifice to hopefully assist in recovering their resolve. A sanitarium acts as both a mental ward and hospital to cure your hirelings of any debilitating diseases or psychosis. Even outside of battle and dungeon-delving, there's enough strategy in managing your town that any contemplative RPG-Strategy players will be satisfied.Unfortunately, the biggest gripe that I have is the early-stage grind required to build a competent team. Experience is only gained through successful runs through the dungeon, and not at an encounter basis, meaning a failed mission merely leaves you with a bunch of insane heroes and little treasure. That would be fine, but items can only be upgraded if the hireling's level matches the item's strength. And unfortunately, most dungeons increase in diffculty and strength as you complete them (regardless of the heroes you might have in reserve), meaning that one bad run due to a very cruel and unforgiving random number generator can easily wipe out your best and well-armed heroes, leaving you with level 0 hirelings to face the same threats your A-team took on. This ends up adding hours, effectively bashing your head into the wall, and sending heroes through the meat-grinder until the dice ends up rolling in your favor. That idea alone can be very discouraging.Still, if you are a fan of atmosphere and of the belief that it's persistence that wins you the day, then Darkest Dungeon is a worthwhile purchase and a memorable game experience! 4 out of 5.

												The game has a fantastic feel and atmosphere to it. You'll certainly feel like you're part of the darkest dungeon environment. The gameplay is interesting and challening. You never really feel like you've become all powerful. There's always a chance that things could go badly for your squad, even against foes that you've easily beaten previously. On the whole though, the game play is a bit of a slog. Your guys level up, but as they do, they're limited to playing the higher level dungeons, so their relative power remains somewhat constant. This is challenging, but doesn't make your team feel like they're progressing much. Don't fall in love with any of your characters, as there's always a chance they won't make it out of the dungeon alive. On the whole I liked the game. I'm yet to finish it, despite being almost 60 hours in. In fact, I don't even feel close to finishing it. The game has become something of a grind, and I can't see myself finishing. A fun game for a time, but not something I'm rushing back to.			"

												Kind of a cross between turn-based combat with a party and a roguelike. The game is fun enough but somewhat lacks depth because the interactions between the character classes are minimal.

												So having owned Darkest Dungeon since before release I can say it has given me quite the joy from time to time. I would recommend this game if it is on sale, but not for full price. This game has its quirks. It is a lot of fun to begin with and to pick up from time to time. However, if you are looking for a game that is fair as you progress late into a manor save file then no. This game has a lot of random events that happen that make it hard for me to truly feel as though the time I have invested is justified. having over 100 hours invested into this game I can say that it is well worth the purchase, but I would wait for it to come on sale. June is usually a lovely time to pick up this game. Cheers!			"

Posted: February 3, 2016
EDIT PLEASE READ FIRST!!!: I have been playing this game since the FIRST DAY of early access. Many things have changed since then but DD is still a great game. A lot of the reviews you will read on here that give this title a thumbs DOWN are mostly due to the difficulty which revolves around the RNG (Random Number Generator) of the game. While this is true that many things in the game revolve around computer generated ""dice rolls"" that does not mean in ANY WAY that this game is bad and as such I will NOT be docking points because people walked in here thinking that this game will hold your hand and give you a pat on the back (Pete's sake in the intro Red Hook even says that DD is about making the MOST of a BAD situation). I personally feel that there is nothing wrong with an RNG and that is actually one of the reasons I love D&D which is almost ENTIRELY based off dice rolls. *sigh*...It's all thanks to these MOBA-douches that are all about ""My skills as a player should not be dependent on bad rolls HUH HUH"" *stomps away disdainfully* Anyway..IF YOU FIND IT TOO HARD AND UNFAIR: Well my first inclination is to say go cry to your mommy you console peasant BUT...there are game play configuration options found in the game menu that you can turn off and on, things like enemies doing only max damage for crits instead of multipliers, turning off battle length penalties and so on. Now that all the crap is out of the way let's begin...DARKEST DUNGEON REVIEW""Ha ha ha! Let those dirty beasts worship the mud now!""Thus are the words of the Ancestor. Your Ancestor.In Darkest Dungeon you play as the Descendant who's Ancestor left a rich and prestigious estate...which has now been completely overrun by tenticle demons that came through a portal conveniently opened by your (now DEAD) Ancestor that sent a letter to you so you could clean up his mess.... GEE! WHAT A GUY!So you go to the manor and the estate, which is in complete shambles, and start rebuilding. As you go as a party of 4 into different dungeons and complete missions you will begin to rebuild that forsaken ground that was entrusted to you. You will recruit new hirelings and I say hirelings because even though Red Hook has said this game is a bit like XCOM it is NOTHING like XCOM. Your hirelings will die. They will die OVER AND OVER again.So let's get down to the *Nacho Libre voice* nhiitty grriiiteyPros:+AWESOME ARTWORK. Beautifully drawn characters which are VERY reminiscent to Mike Mignola's work on Hellboy. I don't think that was a coincendence either.+BRUTAL GAMEPLAY. Like I've been trying to tell you guys a million times: this game was made for masochists. It will punish you SEVERLY for even trying to step foot out of the Estate. But at the same time getting those crits or barely completing that mission with only one survivor makes it so worth.+GREAT SOUNDTRACK. It really is, lot's of drums and deep horns. Each dungeon has a unique theme song. The Warrens' is warlike and orcish sounding while the Weald's is more on the horrific side.+NARRATOR IS 10/10. I mean ""EXECUTED WITH IMPUNITY!"" doesn't grant an auto-thumb up?Now the Cons-FOOD. Food is a needed thing especially for long trips in a dungeon, manually healing your party and also for countering starving events which pop-up randomly. The thing is even if you feed your heroes manually and then move one space you might still be hit with a starving event. Would be nice to at least have a way to manually avoid that instead of wasting food on healing your team (you can't even feed them a ton of food because it will say they are full) to only be hit by a starving event.-STORY. A bit weak. Almost none at all. I guess the bosses have their own mini plot's but all in all it's not SUPER compelling. That's where the gameplay comes in to pick up the slack.-BRUTAL GAMEPLAY. Funny how this is a con and a pro right? I put it as a con as well because this is not a game for everyone. It's for those sick creatures that like to cut themselves with pencils and other slightly blunt but mostly sharp objects. It is very tough for players that are looking for a fair game as this is NOT a fair game and it most likely will stay unfair. I guess I'm one of those that likes the crazy difficulty. TL;DRFun, dungeon crawler that's based around dice-rolled combat and brutal difficulty which is backed up by great artwork and a stellar narrator. Final Score?: 8/10			"

												This is a challenging game, about loss, hopelessness, and the inevitability of death.If you're looking for something about as bleak as Dark Souls, or a team-based dungeon crawling rpg, then this is what you're looking for.Notable features:-Deadly Combat: Characters die, and die quickly. Even a top-tier hero probably has 50-60 hit points, with some enemies getting 90+ damage critical hits.-Tactical Positioning: Where characters are in your team roster determines which skills they can use and which enemies they can target. Pay attention to character special abilities when preparing an expedition.-Turn Timer Combat: Each combatant has a Speed, used to determine when to act in the order. Higher speeds go first more often, though the RNG can make even slow characters go first once in a while.-Inevitable Madness: Stress and insanity are incredibly, insidiously dangerous. When heroes get stressed, they get afflicted and stop being tactical. When they get too stressed they can have a heart attack and die. Stress is a killer, and carries over between expeditions.-Darkness Matters: Lighting and darkness have actual game mechanics that make the use of light into a risk-reward choice. High light gives hero buffs and high dark gives monster buffs, but high dark gives better loot and more frequent hero critical hits.-Downsides to Everything: One of the common loot rewards is a category of items called Trinkets. Trinkets have mystical properties that give a benefit, but almost always have an equal or greater drawback as well. And everything in the game follows this same model. Leveled up heroes will refuse to go to dungeons that are weaker than them, even if their gear and skills are inadequate to the dungeons they pursue. Many beneficial hero skills also have a drawback (personal debuffs, chance of allies bleeding, increase stress for allies, etc.). Loot items take up inventory space that you need for food or other supplies.-Genuine Triumph: Because you have to work for it, your victories are satisfying. Even the bleak and nearly pointless ending cinematic cannot detract from the satisfaction of having actually defeated the Darkest Dungeon.Overall: Lots of fun, lots of frustration, and a very satisfying sense of triumph upon completion. Recommended for patient people not affraid of Lovecraftian horror stories.			"

												Not your average dungeon crawler, it's hard core in the sense that you can lose your favorite heroes permanently and money/stress management is challenging. However your town still keeps its upgrades so there is progression. The attention to detail on the character interactions, especially when they lose their minds, is really impressive. It's rare to find a dungeon crawler where your hero will refuse healing on the verge of death due to masochistic tendencies.			"

												I'm honestly not sure whether I should reccomend this or not. It is extremely well made - the music is exciting, the sound, dialogue, and voice acting is great, and it has an amazing visual style.  It is challenging but actually fairly balanced IMO - once you know a general good structure for a team and the the bad luck that usually crops up in different places then things will become a lot less random. The first few runs will be a gong show while you are figuring things out though. As will the first time in a new area, or with a new team, or after leveling up, or against a boss . . .This is kind of why I am not sure about reccomending it - the struggle is real and constant.  Usually you get 'better' as you play a game - you have new skill, or the game gives you better weapons etc. In DD your team gradually levels up and at a certain point are too 'skilled' to run easier dungeons. Suddenly your 'A Team' absolutely sucks and you are getting out by just the skin of your teeth. On the one hand, this keeps the challenge up - you need to find new stategies and group configurations and there is always that anxiety about entering a dungeon.  Characters have a set suite of skills and can only be leveled up so much and even high level items seem to have some crippling negitive aspects along with the good. On the other hand, while you continue to achieve more difficult and amazing tasks, it is not actually satisfying. I would come to dread my characters leveling up. Most of the time I felt like a stressed out HR manager trying to fill vacancies.This was probably intentional though - the whole game is a bit of a commentary on what 'adventuring' would be like in the real world. Having to go out in the dark  and murder a bunch of horrible monsters would actually suck quite a bit wouldn't it?You know what - I'm going to reccomend this. It is something different and even if I didn't actually 'enjoy' it , it definitely had me thinking about it long after I was done a session.			"

												You'll see lots of people claiming that this game is far too random and that they have had times when parties of heroes have all been wiped out by crappy RNG. I've seen a few reviews where people have said its 'unfair' and its 'not if your heroes die, but when'. But sadly, that's kind of the point of this game. The game even says that most heroes will dies. People expect this game to be less harsh than it says it is. ive played it in early access and how it is now and it is a great game, you have amazing story, voice acting, immersion and a really dark, atmospheric world in which it is set. The only drawback is apart from the wealth you get from dungeons, there isn't much of a reward for long play time. 9/10 would recommend.			"

												You'll see lots of people claiming that this game is far too random and that they have had times when parties of heroes have all been wiped out by crappy RNG. I've seen a few reviews where people have said its 'unfair' and its 'not if your heroes die, but when'. But sadly, that's kind of the point of this game. The game even says that most heroes will dies. People expect this game to be less harsh than it says it is. ive played it in early access and how it is now and it is a great game, you have amazing story, voice acting, immersion and a really dark, atmospheric world in which it is set.

												Really beautiful art, amazing athospehre, innovative mechanics, Darkest Dungeon is one of those games from a genre I do not really like, but it still blew my mind.I've been playing this game non-stop for a couple of days now and though the game often punished me because of my newbie tactics, when you start getting the hang of it you get a nice rush of energy and just want to fight more bosses and upgrade more buidlings to keep getting your favorite classes stronger.I just adore the mechanics such as having good and bad quirks for characters, sanity depletion and such while inside a dungeon, the camping and all. It's just so interesting and REALLY enriches the experience.Again, the art is spectacular, my boyfriend adores it too. It's just so beautiful and atmospheric and detailed. Really really fitting style for the game.Highly recommend you try this game. It tends to find a lot of ways to kick your♥♥♥♥♥ but it just makes it feel that much more satisfying when you complete a quest.			"

												Game's hard. But that's the point. Game feels like it's full of despair and terror, which translates well into each dungeon dive. Each encounter is difficult and, unless super prepared (and even then), all can be lethal. Bosses are wicked hard, losing characters is a crazy bummer, the new events are insanely difficult. Hard as hell game that you can easily blame on ""Bad RNG"" if you wanna take the easy route. Go in knowing you'll lose and each little victory tastes that much sweeter. Expect those moments where you have to stop playing because your characters died to something stupid, so you can calm down and grieve the loss of your many Vestals.			"

												What I've learned so far in the game:  Upgrade the stagecoach. (Number of heroes arriving) Do not be afraid of losing your heroes.  Keep track of your stress meter. Can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Get used to fails. They may happen a lot. Buffing your heroes is VERY important. Upgrade more the Blacksmith, Guild and Sanitarium. Keep track of your heroes quriks, diseases and abilities. Don't interact with all curios, unless you know what you're doing.Of course there is more to it, but so far what I've listed is important too keep in mind. The game is difficult, the enemies are merciless (so do somethin to debuff their stats ex: use Man-at-Arms, Jester). Keep your torch lit above 76 and expect unfairness in higher levels. You gotta be well prepared for every dungeon expedition, get food, torches and some items that can cleanse the negative effects of some curios ( A curio is something you come across it and you my decide to investigate.Its kinda like the Dark Souls of dungeon crawlers. It can feel very rewarding after finishing quests.			"

												Make no mistake: this game is not for everyone. It is the type of game that requires patience, more patience and, every so often, the ability to chant mantras like ""I will not rage, I will not smash my keyboard..."" Pros:Art, SFX, replayabilityCons:RNG - the gods of RNG are easily angeredPicture this: you get a high level party and proceed to faceroll anything that comes your way, all the while listening to the awesome ""ancestor"" voice saying ""OBLITERATED!"", ""DESTROYED!"", ""MASTERFULLY EXECUTED!"" as you kill, bleed and poison your opponents. After the dungeon is complete, you collect lots of loot and you feel confident. Big mistake.As your ancestor reminds you, ""Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer"". But you think that this does not apply to you and so you start another dungeon, with the same party. After all they were successful in the previous run...And this is where DD reminds of who is in charge: enemies start handing out critical hits to your heroes as if it was Christmas all over again. And so, your vestal panics which in turn prevents her from doing her job: TO HEAL. The other members of the party get stressed because she is constantly babbling to herself about the horrors she has seen. This leads to more stress piling up and, quicker than you realise, they are all screaming and cursing and hitting themselves till they are nothing more than nervous wrecks left at death's door...And then the blissful silence of death...your heroes that so confidently defeated the evil hordes in the previous dungeon are now resting eternally in the graveyard. You look around and find only young and inexperienced recruits, barely capable of lifting their weapons.How many heroes does it take to appease the RNG gods? Only they know. But if you have the strength to rise from the ashes, you will find the time spent in the Darkest Dungeon rewarding.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a rare gem of Early Access games that made it to release, and steadily makes improvements to an already well-rounded and enjoyable game. The game itself is a rogue-like turn-based dungeon crawler with an art style that adds an omnipotent Lovecraftian theme, and basks in its difficulty and unforgiving gameplay. This is a must-have for fans of Lovecraft and Roguelikes alike.9/10			"

												Kind of a cross between turn-based combat with a party and a roguelike. The game is fun enough but somewhat lacks depth because the interactions between the character classes are minimal. Also, the pacing is bad due to too-long animations and flavor text, making the game take twice as long as it should and even become boring at times.			"

												So having owned Darkest Dungeon since before release I can say it has given me quite the joy from time to time. I would recommend this game if it is on sale, but not for full price. This game has its quirks. It is a lot of fun to begin with and to pick up from time to time. However, if you are looking for a game that is fair as you progress late into a manor save file then no. This game has a lot of random events that happen that make it hard for me to truly feel as though the time I have invested is justified. having over 100 hours invested into this game I can say that it is well worth the purchase, but I would wait for it to come on sale. June is usually a lovely time to pick up this game. Cheers!			"

												When my adventurers set off, they were sane.So eager.Drawn by the compelling tune of merciless avarice and desires for multitudinous glories, they paced into the dark alcovesof the damp cove by the beach. Some began to cast furtive eyes around. When would they first see action? When would blood first be drawn? Two rooms in, they got their wish.Two slimy fish-men, residue coating their scales and blood on their teeth, one fish-priest, wielding skulls and trinkets looted from adventurers long dead, and in the front, a hulking, tentacled mass, wielding sharpened wheels on clammy tentacles. For as much damage dealt by the warriors, more seemed to be dealt to them, leaving them bleeding and scattered in both mind and body.When the pack of monsters was dealt with, the warriors breathed heavily in relief, yet also shivered in anticipation of waht was to come.As they progressed further, pain and fear eroded their wills, as ancient evils had eroded the pits from which such beasts had emerged. Tentacles lashed out.Fangs gleamed.Torches faded to embers.uncomfortable truths were confronted.T'was the Leper, so easily able to deal damage to others, who broke first, developing an irrational, masochistic tendency to injure himself, refusing aid and healing from the Vestal, the team cleric. His gasps of pain led to further stress in the others, as did his eventual death at the hands of an unholy priest, wielding jagged blades to rend for the Old Gods. The Leper's death eventually broke the Vestal, who had been refused time and again by him, even as he bled out before her. She became abusive, hurling insults at the others, who were faring less and less well, as each new trial chipped at their minds, enabled further by their abusive healer refusing them aid when it was needed.As a result of this, the Highwayman found himself too in an early grave, as he bled out from an unsightly gash inflicted by sharpened blades plucked from shipwrecks by clumsy, fish-like hands.And so there were two.the Plague Doctor, the last (somewhat) sane member of the crew, decided to cut her losses and retreat to the relative safety of the village hamlet. However, the situation caused the Vestal to become so distraught that she collapsed on the spot, dea of a heart attack as the result of unbearable pressure.In the end, only the Plague Doctoe made it out alive, with all the loot picked up by the group and some trinkets salvaged from her colleagues' bodies. She retreated to the village bar, to drink away her sorrows. But what she had seen would forever scar her.As for the losses?No bother.There will always be more cannon fodder to send into the darkest of dungeons.    "

												“You remember our venerable house... opulent and imperial. It is a festering abomination!”Darkest Dungeon is a game that just oozes ambiance out of its many orifices; from the excellent art design to the deeply powerful narration of the Ancestor. The game is difficult, and you can expect to bury many of your heroes before you manage to cleanse the taint of eldritch horrors from your ancestral home (the game tells you as much on the title screen.) On the other hand, outside of the NG+ mode, there’s actually no way to lose the game, either – new recruits, available for free, will show up at your gates every week… and if you don’t have the cash to outfit them with weapons, training, torches, or even food… well, hopefully they’ll be able to make a quick run into one of the low-level missions, kill some cultists, grab some gold and gems, and beat a hasty retreat to refill your coffers… and if not them, perhaps next week’s batch….I think it’s a superbly well executed game. The low and medium level dungeons are forgiving enough that you can make some mistakes or run with suboptimal parties without getting your head handed to you, giving you the experience needed to face the elite dungeons, and eventually even the darkest dungeon itself.I think my only complaint would be that you do end up needing to run a lot of missions to collect the materials needed to upgrade your hamlet and level up your heroes. It never reaches what I’d consider a slog; but I also really, really enjoy both the turn-based combat and the amazing narration that goes along with it.""Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.""

Early Access Review
								Yes, this game is ridiculously difficult, and yes, much of it is tied to RNG. However, the RNG in Darkest Dungeon reminds me of something similar to XCOM. An attack with 95% chance to hit can still miss and its infuriating when it does. Has that stopped people from loving XCOM? No. So the only cause I can find for all the negative reviews from long time early access players is failure to adapt to the changes that have been made.Darkest Dungeon is made to be punishing, and it's void of guarantees. The design of a game like this is intended to force the player overcome impossible odds on a mission through careful thought in combat, and managing your party members well in town (in this case by properly budgeting treatments, upgrades, provisions, etc.) and if the player can successfully do these things then they will be successful to some degree.Failures come as often as these successes though. Party members will die, and you will be forced to abandon quests in order to save others. But some of the greatest satisfaction comes from salvaging your roster after losing one or two in a dungeon, and then using that roster to clear a dungeon or defeat a boss, then collect the fruits of your labor. The sense of accomplishment is tremendous, and the rewards are worthwhile.So please give this game a shot if you're looking for a punishing challenge with appropriate rewards and satisfying and intricate gameplay.

												What I consider an essential game of any RPG library. Gritty, hard and very beautiful. There's a lot of mechanics in this game which means that research outside the game is highly advised. Before buying this game you have to know that it's hard. Incredibly so at times. The game follows the setting of hopelessness with the graphics, music and gameplay very well. Characters are little more than resources. They will be diseased and traumatized till the day they die. There seems to be some biterness in other reviews when late game, the game messes with you for the umpteenth time. But I still loved it.In summary: Difficult, gritty, beautiful RPG. Not for the feint of heart but a true challenge for those who seek it.			"

One of the best game i've played in the last years.Pros :- A lot of different classes to choose from- Ton of abilities and setup possible to create efficient groups- Superb artstyle and gloomy feeling- Turn-based combat allow you to make strategic choices- The storyline is very well sewed during the gameplay experience- Very very addictive, even at 2:00am you will convince youself ""just one more dungeon run""- A great bang for you buck, will require at least 70+hours to complete everythingCons :- RNG will be the major factor on how you experience the game- Facing bosses unprepared can be quite punishing ( i had the wiki opened at all time )- Lossing heroes will force you to regrind for a few hours ( stalling your progression )			"

												TL;DRGreat game early to mid-game, but gets too grindy endgame. Still an 8/10Full ReviewI think I just want to address this first: If you really think that this game is 100% RNG based that can instantly wipe out your entire party in a single dungeon run, I can assure you that is not the case. A lot of the game is based on RNG, but unless you're being really stubborn, a crit hit on you or a few misses in a row won't be the end of you. You're given plenty of options in hero choices, trinkets, and skills to rig the odds best in your favor for a particular mission. But once a mission starts heading south, REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN QUIT THE MISSION AT ANY TIME. I hear a lot of complaints about how BS stress can be, but you always have the option to abandon the mission if too many party members are afflicted, diseased, ect. Pick your battles wisely, and you'll never have a party wipe. I beat the game without one, just check my achievments. The only place where RNG really plays a huge role is with Deaths Door, when a character reaches 0 hp. And thankfully because of that mechanic, it prevents instant one-hit party wipes. Though they are debuffed for the rest of the questNow, onto the main bulk of review.The story: An ancestor of yours accidentally unleashed an eldritch abombination into the world, so it's up to you to fix it.The main bulk of the gameplay revolves around sending heroes out to do various quests to collect gear, gold, and heirlooms, mainly to prepare for the assaults on the Darkest Dungeon. Doing missions levels up their resolve, which allows them to get better gear, better skill upgrades, and do harder missions. If you wanna purchase the better gear/skill upgrades, you need heirlooms from your various missions in order to unlock these. Later on, with a high enough Blacksmith and Guild(Used for skill updgrades), you can even upgrade your stagecoach to bring in heroes with pre-upgraded armors in skills, all the way up to level 4, which helps with the grind a bit. For stress and afflictions,  as your heroes explore, they'll accumulate stress and may develop ununfavorable traits. If stress gets to 100 in a dungeon, they'll either become afflicted negatively which will cause them to act irrationally depending on the affliction, or they have a slight chance of gaining a great buff, which can seriously help out your party. If stress reaches 200, they'll suffer a heart attack, which will either reduce their health to 0, or if they're already at Death's Door, instantly kill them. You can reduce stress in the dungeon by using certain skills, from camping. Out of the dungeon, you can use the Tavern or Chapel. Sometimes the traits can be really bad (E.G, -10 accuracy against a certain enemy type), but for the majority of the time, you don't have to worry way too much about these traits.When it comes to the main dungeon crawling, you take 4 heroes through a variety of missions, from simply explore the area to collect 3 amount of artifacts, to work your way up to the boss. As you start off, your worst opponent will be inexperience. As you continue to play, you eventually learn which team combos work best where, along with the fact that your heroes should have beter gear as you go on. It's a difficult yet fun curve, which takes a while to get over. Once you get over the curve though, that's when you start to notice the repetitiveness of the dungeons. Stronger enemy varients for just about every enemy is just a different name and higher stats, so you don't really see too much variation between enemys in later areas. It's the exact same for the bosses. You have to re-fight each boss 3 times, each one stronger than the last. This really contributes to the feeling late-game that you are pretty much only just grinding since you're seeing the same place and enemies over and over again because you need to level up heroes or need more gold/heirlooms. And trust me, the darkest dungeon is insanely hard, and you need to grind A LOT in order to prepare for it to prime your lv 6 heroes to perfection. Not to mention the ""Never Again"" penalty that your heroes get when they finish a Darkes Dungeon quest. Any heroes that successfuly assauled the Darkest Dungeon will never return there again, which means you need 16 lv 6 heroes ready to go. Because of this, I seriously don't recommend creating throwaway parties for suicidal gold runs.The Darkest Dungeon, the final area in the game, is true hell. All the enemies deal insane bleed, blight, and stress damage. Not only that, abandoning the mission will take the life of a random hero. On the plus side, there's no obstacles, no traps, and no chance of ambush, and the dungeon isn't randomly generated. The ""abandoning takes a random hero"" is really the only major flaw of the dungeon. Darkest Dungeon is a game where you NEED to learn from your mistakes, the Darkest Dungeon especially. For learning from your mistakes there, you're guaranteed to grind up at least one new hero. But the satisfaction from beating each darkest dungeon assault is imeasurably satisfying. All the odds were against you, and you still won.SPEAKING OF SATISFACTORY (SPOILER TERRITORY AHEAD)The second greatest flaw of the game has to be the ending. It's a forced bittersweet ending, and I mean FORCED. It's ""Well you may have literally killed this god, but you merely delayed the inveitable"", coming full circle and ending on ""Ruin has come to my family."" TL;DR, some dimwad decided to re-awake the monstrosity that lived down there AGAIN despite the (likely) 14 heroes you had who already knew about the terrors of the dungeon. The eldritch abomination was awoken because the Anscestor didn't know what he was getting into at first. WHAT REASON WOULD ANYBODY HAVE TO AWAKEN THE THING AGAIN? Hell, if they wanted to end it on a lovecraftian note, why not end it like how the Rats in the Walls ended, by just flat out destroying the entire estate that sat upon the dungeon? This ending is a forced punch to the gut saying, ""Lol I know you suffered a lot but that was pointless"". There are a million different ways this could have ended, and Red Hook took the ""Blatantly forced edgy"" ending.Despite it's shortcomings, the game is still great. The art and sound design is amazing, the dungeon crawling (for a majority of the game) will always keep you on your toes, and the stress mechanic is something pretty original that adds a new layer to the game's dungeon crawling. It's a good 8/10 game if you can tolerate the pain early-game brings "

												If you are afraid of difficult games then don't play this game.  This is not your typical turn based RPG where you need to only manage your health.  Stress is a huge factor and you must manage your hereos' mental state as well.I really love the atmosphere as it does a great job capturing the cthulian theme. I truly dread going into the next dungeon fearing that my guys will die or stress out and have a heart attack. The artwork works extremely well with this game as well as the dark voiceover clips that plays randomly when bad or even good things happen. With plenty of classes to choose from and every one of them doing something different, the gameplay never gets old... and it's a turn based combat system! The dungeons are always randomly generated and so each dungeon is much different than the last. Darkest Dungeon is one of the best games I've played in a long time and after 100 hours of playing this game I still can't wait to jump back in.

												Darkest Dungeon is a strange game (but in a good way if you read further and peruse my reasoning).It's a gritty dark fantasy adventure set in an undetermined time. You act as an overseer who recruits motely crews of adventurers to unearth relics (and whatever isn't nailed down) from the ruins of your ancestors' lands. Unfortunately one of your ancestors dealt too far into the occult, unleashing some horror which wears down on the resolve and sanity of your heroes (that's where the Lovecraftian stuff comes into play).Seems fair enough, and enough of a reason to get into it and play it. What makes this game strange is the idea that failure isn't only a possibility, but inevitable. The grim, gritty atmosphere isn't only in the graphics (which are beautiful, inspiring, and decadent at the same time), but in the gameplay and feelings evoked by this game. Expeditions into the ruins of your ancestors will fail, and death/madness is a likely prospect given that your adventurers have both HP and stress to manage throughout the game.Gameplay wise, it plays as a party rogue-like with turn-based combat. There is copious strategy to be discovered and applied as you unearth the ruins and build a competent enough team to assault the 'Darkest Dungeon'. To prepare your hired cohorts, you can find relics and family heirlooms in the various parts of the manor's surrounding lands to help upgrade the hub village you use to rest and arm your hirelings. With these heirlooms, you upgrade the various businesses and buildings: upgrading the blacksmith allows you to better arm your (surviving) heroes. Upgrading the Inn enables your unhinged heroes to restore their sanity by taking their mind off the oppresive atmosphere via gambling, drinking, and of course whoring. Your more pious heroes benefit from the chapel, which allows them the option of prayer or sacrifice to hopefully assist in recovering their resolve. A sanitarium acts as both a mental ward and hospital to cure your hirelings of any debilitating diseases or psychosis. Even outside of battle and dungeon-delving, there's enough strategy in managing your town that any contemplative RPG-Strategy players will be satisfied.Unfortunately, the biggest gripe that I have is the early-stage grind required to build a competent team. Experience is only gained through successful runs through the dungeon, and not at an encounter basis, meaning a failed mission merely leaves you with a bunch of insane heroes and little treasure. That would be fine, but items can only be upgraded if the hireling's level matches the item's strength. And unfortunately, most dungeons increase in diffculty and strength as you complete them (regardless of the heroes you might have in reserve), meaning that one bad run due to a very cruel and unforgiving random number generator can easily wipe out your best and well-armed heroes, leaving you with level 0 hirelings to face the same threats your A-team took on. This ends up adding hours, effectively bashing your head into the wall, and sending heroes through the meat-grinder until the dice ends up rolling in your favor. That idea alone can be very discouraging.Still, if you are a fan of atmosphere and of the belief that it's persistence that wins you the day, then Darkest Dungeon is a worthwhile purchase and a memorable game experience! 4 out of 5.

												The game has a fantastic feel and atmosphere to it. You'll certainly feel like you're part of the darkest dungeon environment. The gameplay is interesting and challening. You never really feel like you've become all powerful. There's always a chance that things could go badly for your squad, even against foes that you've easily beaten previously. On the whole though, the game play is a bit of a slog. Your guys level up, but as they do, they're limited to playing the higher level dungeons, so their relative power remains somewhat constant. This is challenging, but doesn't make your team feel like they're progressing much. Don't fall in love with any of your characters, as there's always a chance they won't make it out of the dungeon alive. On the whole I liked the game. I'm yet to finish it, despite being almost 60 hours in. In fact, I don't even feel close to finishing it. The game has become something of a grind, and I can't see myself finishing. A fun game for a time, but not something I'm rushing back to.			"

												I don't typically write EA reviews, but DD is an exception. I don't like rogue-like games. I don't like games that are frustrating. I've gottent too old for games like that. I play games for fun. I play games to replax. So I shouldn't like DD. Yet I find this to be simply one of the better games I've played this year. It is exceptionally fun while being frustrating. There's a wonderful mix of tension, frustration and triumph. The theming of the game is exceptional - the voice-overs, the look, the feel all build this wonderful universe of gloom. There's tension around every corner and you feel every decision is meaningful. There's plenty of options to cater to your playstyle. I truly feel that every decision I make in Darkest Dungeon is a crucial one. Very few games feel that way. Thus I find DD to be also a fairly intense game to play. Furthermore, they've done a great job during EA of balancing classes, adding content and ironing out some annoyances. It's nice to see someone use EA the way it was meant - getting community feedback and using it to make the product much better with a clear plan to get to a truly complete release candidate. Props to them for that too.This is a game that will get you screaming at your monitor. You may even break your keyboard. But it's tense, brilliant, fun and I recommend it for every gamer.			"

												I bought this game during the Summer Sale. I started playing recently and I absolutely fell in love with it. As many mentioned, this game drips with beautiful dark Lovecraftian atmosphere. The gameplay is alot of fun, but might get repetitive. However, in time, you will change the way you play. At first you most likely grow attached to your starting crew. But the further you go, the more this view will get stomped in the ground.You see, heroes die. Even your strong, upgraded powerhouses. If you get the hang of the game, you will realise this game is more about proper management then it is about picking favourites and winning the game with it. By the way, winning this game takes a LONG LONG time. In that regard you might compare this with a game (I know it sounds silly) like Stardew Valley. You build slowely but surely, and get a bit futher step by step.If you play this game for long stretches of time, it might get repetitive and boring, but this a game that is best played a few hours at a time. So the next time you come back you have some new ideas and things you want to try out.It's a great game, but it is a game that changes you over time. Your playstyle will adapt and thats the beauty of it. And be prepared to invest alot of time in it if your set on beating it!			"

Early Access Review
								I absolutely cannot recommend this game to anyone. A videogame is meant to be enjoyable and fun, but apparently nobody at Red Hook Studios was informed of ths. Every design decision seems to have been purposefully made to irritate, annoy and take the fun out of playing it. There is absolutely no enjoyment whatsoever to be had in this game, and this comes down to every element of the game being either mostly or entirely outside of your control.  Almost everything in this game is arbitrary. Random dice rolls are quite clearly rigged to favour good results for the enemy and bad results for you, and systems that supposedly work on fixed numbers cheat to produce unfavourable outcomes seemingly on a whim.The money spent to keep party members alive and sane outside of missions is inexpicably subtracted from the same pool from which you need to purchase supplies to keep them alive and sane during missions, and money, supplies and upgrade resources are never numerous enough to allow you to make any real progress except by sheer, blind luck (and don't expect that to ever come at a time when it might genuinely help you). Stress accumulates extremely quickly and can instantly kill your heroes even if you keep their health topped up. Enemy dodge rolls seem insanely slanted as compared to how often your own characters are able to do it. The items required to cure damage-over-time effects are insanely expensive compared to the average income of a mission and the maintenance costs of your characters.The game also crashes randomly with little explanation.Every single one of these issues confront you within the first twenty minutes of the game.

								Darkest Dungeon is a very thrilling game. A new kind of game that I really enjoy. The only thing I didn't like is when you first start out it's pretty difficult and kind of hard to understand. There was about 3 missions in a row where I had to quit really early because I wasn't prepared and whatnot.... Anyways it's a nice game to crack out on. 10/10 for sure			"

												Striking art style, well done animations, good narrator commenting along our journey. Darkest Dungeon is a fun turn-based dungeon crawler that offers an interesting twist on the usual mechanics by adding a stress meter for our heroes. The longer they stay exploring, the worse it gets. Each dungeon run imprints new traits both good and bad on heroes, leading to many interesting situations. And together with permanent death and a balanced set of risk/reward mechanics, Darkest Dungeon provides many hours of fun to be had.			"

								An outstanding title from a dedicated dev team.Darkest Dungeon is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. The game is unapologetically hard and unforgiving. This game will make you work for victory.Your heroes will face countless perils and inevitably descend into madness. The key is balancing the mental health of your heroes while making enough progress to keep the coin flowing for further ventures.The art style is simply beautiful with fantastic narration and an enthralling soundtrack to match the forever enclosing darkness. While the narrator provides a commentary for your journey, the members of your party will voice comments ranging from celebration of a hard won victory to hurling abuse at the rest of the party for the gross incompetence.If you are looking for a challenging gameplay experience where every move must be calculated and where sometimes, as hard as it maybe to admit, retreat is absolutely necessary for long term success look no further.For the price the dev team are asking, this game is an absolute bargain.

								Great atmosphere, visuals and sounds are spot on, difficulty is real. Runs can go from unforgiving to trivial and back in a heartbeat and considering your heroes indisposable is a big mistake, even when youthink them safe in your mansion! Sure, the game still needs some balancing and increased variation of areas/enemies/bosses (that hopefully will be added later on) but for an early access and 20$ is really polished. Any game that frustrates you more than playing XCOM ImpossibleIronman, gets a 8/10 hands down.May the RNGeezuz keep you safe from Shyphilis. "

								Darkest Dungeon is the ideal dungeon crawler. Like any piece of art, you chip at it slowly. More and more progress is gained as your game takes shape over time. That is the thrill of Darkest Dungeon. Your team members, town progress, the general sanity of the entire situation. It's a careful balancing act that makes you feel like you are spinning plates with utter ease, but not afraid to slap you in the wrist if you decide to be lazy.This is in Early Acess, and I am already looking forward to all the future promised content. The additions made thus far have added to the pot rather than a [Too Many Cooks] scenario.			"

								10/10 For early access. I'm pumped to see where they push this game- but it needs to be said that this game is highly enjoyable and functional in its current state. I haven't had one crash.This game actually strikes me as a mobile game, which is strange, but don't let that dissuade you. Darkest Dungeon has some of the most interesting art and narration. The combat mechanics are great, deep and interesting. The classes you play are not typical of RPG's we're used to. Again, the art and narration deserve a second mention- I fell in love with that.The game is excessively macabre too, which has been darkly humorous if your mind bends that way.Thanks to the devs for putting a game in early access that truly functions. If they make another game in an an even remotely similar vein, I will buy it and support them.			"

								Oh boy, how to properly give this game it's due? Here's the thing: You're going to lose or suffer horrible setbacks. That's pretty non-negotiable. However, the game is seemingly made entirely around that concept and it works. Under ideal circumstances it really feels like you're walking on thin ice and at any given moment it can break. Then, one of your 4-member Dungeon crawling group goes temporarily insane and every action you can possibly take seems to have negative and dire consquences - and it's equal parts crushing, hilarious and entertaining while it happens. Very quickly you will need to let go of any ""perfect gameplay"" style of gaming here. Even leveling up can bring negative quirks. Every magic item in the  game has a bonus but also a drawback aspect to it. While many games start out easier and get harder as they go along, Darkest Dungeon seems to take the opposite direction, although so far I'd never say it gets ""easy"", it simply goes from your adventures almost always ending with someone dead or crippled to a situation where now and again you can scrape by. Victories are rare but all the more sweet for the rareness. It's hard not to love this game. Also, while it is a work in progress, much of the foundation appears to be laid. There is plenty of content here for a lot of gaming pleasure.			"

								Easily worth the release price. The art design is fantastic, so is the narrator's voice acting. It's basically a final beta, it's the most polished early access title I've seen on Steam. As far as the mechanics go it's a modern Rogue with an abusive difficulty level, death is an integral part of the experience. It's insanely addictive and despite the difficulty never seems unfair but always rewarding. If you like Rogues, pick this up.			"

								Even though I adore this game on several fronts (the art style is amazing and efficient, the atmosphere at the start is great, the turn-based combat is better than most games of this type (but could be more refined)), i still have to give this game a massive thumbs down summed up in one word: Treadmill.This game is a massive treadmill, it almost feels like playing a mobile game. Putting your adventurers into the brothel to recover stress is amusing, leveling up that same brothel to level 10 is NOT fun or enjoyable in ANY way. You have to level up EVERYTHING in this game. The town buildings, the skills, weapons and armor of your adventurers. And all of those upgrades are just small improvements of basic numbers. After the initial phase of the game, which is very enjoyable, these treadmill mechanics kick in, and advancing in the game just feels like a hassle.It saddens me that would these mechanics be stripped out, the game would probably be amazing. The treadmill adds nothing to the gameplay and atmosphere, it undermines these at several fronts. While fighting for the life of your adventures can be tense and fun if you're into this sort of gameplay, losing leveled up characters to RNG is NOT fun. Because this event again demands more farming of you to level up a new character... ugh. No respect for a player's time.To further illustriate my point, let us compare to another roguelike-like game beloved by me and many - FTL: Faster than Light. In FTL the game is structured in 'runs' which last up to an hour at the most. Each of these runs is unique, and nothing is carried over into the next game (except unlocking new ships). This means that the gameplay is intense and it is all about about achieving things within THIS run. Nothing is there to be farmed. There is no grind.			"

												Darkest Dungeons is a roguelike turn based strategy game that draws heavy inspiration from the works of HP Lovecraft (Cthulu, Dagon, the Old Ones, etc). The gameplay, characters, and especially the VOICE ACTING are exceptional. The game has low system requirements and runs very smoothly. Despite this, the graphics are somehow very good and the art style is endearing. DD is the best example of an early release game that did everything right. There have been and there are still some problems with the game that have to do with clunky GUI and inventory management but I've noticed the developers have been constantly making improvements to the game with patches. They've been churning out fixes and even new characters and locations left and right. I get the feeling that the developers truly care about this game. I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. A timeless classic.			"

												This is recommended with a huge asterisk.Yes, the game is fun. Yes, it's worth the money. But it feels like a pay-to-win game without the cash shop.Any and all unlocks take exorbitant amounts of resources, especially hamlet upgrades and treatments in the sanitarium.Higher difficulty dungeons and bosses are exactly the same as starter ones, but with inflated hp and damage, with higher resistance to all debuffs.Stress is just another health bar, and is usually minor enough to be ignored in all but the most dire instances.Once you've killed off the first round of bosses, there's not much to do. Dungeons are either too low level for your main party to go after, or too long/dangerous for newcomers to rank up safely.The RNG is oppresively stacked against you, with higher level dungeon enemies able to dodge most of your attacks while critting you almost every turn.The Collector is a game-ender. I got him in all but one of my first boss runs, with him wiping my entire party in a few turns.Speaking of, the bosses themselves were♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, especially the cannons in the weald and the flesh in the warrens, giving almost no challenge aside from having over a hundred health and summoning help every turn.

												First things first, when I say that I recommend Darkest Dungeon, I recommend it for people who know what they're getting into. Personally, I love this game so let me start with the best parts that made me fall in love with this game. From the perfect dark, gritty atmosphere of lost hope and despair, to the eldritch abominations that plague the land as your foes, the setting and ambiance is perfect. You get the basis of the (admittedly simple) plot upon startup and that's where you meet your best frenemy that travels with the player's party out of view: the Narrator. As you travel and fight through the world, the Narrator WILL NOT hold your hand, and instead he comments on your escapades as well as failures brought out from your decisions. He perfectly compliments the setting, being the final icing on the cake alongside the subtle music that fits every scenario: The depressing tones in the Hamlet (your home base), the background noise while traveling (which is ominously no music, ironically... only occassional horrified screams of agony), and the battle music which, although it never sticks in my head (as it's really just background noise), I find it perfectly fitting while I'm kicking♥♥♥♥♥and getting my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on a silver platter. Now for the combat... It's a roguelike RPG with turn based strategy. With your team of four hardy fighters, you crawl through dungeon after dungeon and wait your turn while fighting another team of four (or three, or two, or just one...) enemies (For those unaware of turn based strategy, just imagine it like a slide on a playground, where everyone in the line gets a turn then restarts when everyone gets their turn). What makes this combat extremely interesting is that correct positioning of your team is key. Certain classes will work best in certain positions due to their attacks only working in certain positions (and said attacks can only work on certain enemy positions as well). With that in mind, you have your classic buffs and debuffs (better attack, slower speed, etc.), as well as status inflictions (stun, bleed, etc.), and even a unique one: Stress. As you go on and fight, your team will get stressed out (because ♥♥♥♥ it man, you don't see this♥♥♥♥♥♥on your everyday 9 to 5 and through the week). Pushing your characters to their limits will either cause them to bend or break under pressure, turning them into either heroes or total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ respectively. Here is one such example of the game's biggest theme: Risk vs Reward (in my opinion, it is). The risk to either fight or heal, putting chance to a missed sword swing or a lucky bullet crit. Another mechanic of the game is light level, which the darker it gets, the more rewards you can get but the easier it is to become stressed out. Even the items show this, as the best items for one stat will decrease another, such as increasing your armor but lowering your damage, or increasing your stress intake while also increasing other abilities' power. I love the Risk vs Reward aspect to this game as I'm a very cautious player, but games like this and Dark Souls push me to take chances for once.Now, sadly, for the negatives that lie in this game (and hopefully I can express why they don't bother me enough to truly walk away forever). I will admit that the RNG in this game rules over it with an iron fist alongside its brother, RPG grinding. Where others curse these two tyrants and walk away once the two have broken them, I relish in the anarchy. The RNG admittedly does leave incredible amounts of the game (if not every fight) up to chance, but through buffs and items, you can help your chances so you're not entirely up the river without a paddle. The game may be a huge gritty numbers game, but I'd much rather calculate what an item will do for me than an actual math equation (which I don't even calculate them myself, I just pick out items with good stats and jump into the fray). Now, it really is grind heavy... EXTREMELY grind heavy with character permadeath, but it does fit the theme of Risk vs Reward with how much you'll be pushed back from losing a character, wanting the player to play it safe, but the game forces you to take some chances as you won't be strong enough to persevere. With the excessive RNG, you're forced to take chances anyway, you just have to be willing to jump into hell instead of being pushed in.Now, when setbacks happen (and by god they will happen), you just have to persevere. Essentially, this analogy is the game: You are a little boy, this game is your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ older brother, and your bin of legos are your progress. When you're a little boy, all you want to do with legos is to stack them up to a giant tower, but your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ older brother being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wants to knock your tower down. The taller the tower, the more your brother will set you back when he knocks it down. Eventually, there'll come a time when your brother finally knocks down the tower, but what do you do? You may get upset and need some time to cool off, but eventually you brush yourself off, put on your big boy pants, and you build yourself a new ♥♥♥♥ing lego tower. Eventually through hard work, struggle, (chance), and perseverence, you make the best lego tower anyone's ever seen. Then you start it all over again... Much in the same way of Dark Souls: You fight, you die, you keep fighting, you eventually make it, then you start over.My final verdict: If you're prepared to gamble then jump on in. If you're a cautious gamer then this game will break you from being overly cautious. Start up the game and you've already bought your one way ticket to hell, meaning you're going there one way or another, so you may as well enjoy the descent.			"

												It may not appeal to everyone, but I love this game. Watch some gameplay videos and read some reviews if you're still on the fence.Pros:- The aesthetics, music, narration are all top-notch- The narrator is so good he deserves a second mention. Seriously- The gameplay is turn-based, so you can play strategically and thoughtfully- There's more than one way to ""succeed"" at the game - there's no single strategy that works better than everything else (but also see below)- The setting and unfolding storyline are great. Very Lovecrafian and GrimdarkCons:- Punishingly difficult. Some may see this as a pro. Be ready to cut-and-run, be ready to dismiss heroes that are damaged beyond repair, be ready to accept failure and death on a regular basis- Some classes/heroes feel noticably less useful than others, though there's not 100% agreement on which heroes- Though there's not one game-winning strategy that works all the time, some enemies and bosses DO require specific tactics to defeat, and if your group isn't ready for them, victory may not be possible. Again, that's part of the game, but this may bother some players.If you know what you're in for, and you're still interested, I'd give this game a shot, for the graphics and music (and narration) alone.

Basicallly do not get attached to any of your characters beasue they will most likely die. PositivesArt work is awesome.The narration is  well doneThe theme of the game is dark and brooding.The stress and affliction stuff is genius, more games should pull this mechanic.Great light mechnaic, it adds a lot to the gameNegativesThe lack of havng one main character really hampers the story. Basically you throw adventurers at dungeons until you are done. Lots and lots of them...The lack of consistency in monsters and dungeons is extreme. It is a crap shoot every time.The lack of a persistant inventory is annoying, not sure what they were going for but all the stuff you buy magially disappears after a dungeon run.The rehab is crazy costly, it seems that they were trying to balane out the large amounts of money I think.All is all it is more of a dungeon fighting arcade game them an RPG. If you want one of those here is a good one....as for RPG not so much.			"

												EDIT: After a long and steep learning curve where I really had big trouble with this game, I've decided to change my review to be positive. When you figure out how things work (the game won't explain even half of it!), it gets a lot more manageable and fun. Usually, I always recommend tackling games without a guide. THIS GAME IS AN EXCEPTION! Read all the guides you can possibly find! If you are willing to do so, you will be greatly rewarded with a cool experience.ORIGINAL REVIEWI really like many aspects of the game. The general theme is great, the graphics are really cool, and the narrator's voice is awesome and contributes a lot to the atmosphere. It's dark, relentless and unforgiving.All that sounds really great. The problem is that the amount of randomness in this game is totally out of control. Need some examples?- Will an attack hit? Random.- Becoming poisoned, or start to bleed? Random. - Turn order? Random.- Is the treasure chest a deadly trap? Random. - Will the hero die when he's hit while deadly injured? Random.- Will there be an act of bravery or a mental illness when stress is at max? Random.- Which party member will fall victim to a trap when you walk into it? Random.- Which new characters will be available after a dungeon run? What are their skills and stats? All random.... and worst of all, these random elements absolutely cannot be avoided by the player. The game forces them upon you. There are regular opponents in the game that can  inflict permanent (!) random diseases on your characters with their NORMAL ATTACK (for crying out loud), which cost an awful lot of money to cure. So, literally, if your heroes are unlucky, they WILL die. This is NOT under your control, not even in the slightest. What's more, the game also fails to display any kind of percentages with which an action will succeed, it just happens. Not even turn order is properly displayed when you have to take an action and make a choice which enemy to take down.To summarize, you can be the greatest tactical genius that ever walked this planet earth, but if you are simply not lucky enough with the random numbers, this game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥without a moment of hesitation. This is just bad game design.			"

												This game is not for everyone and reading through the numerous positive and negative reviews should give an idea if this game is for you.  I would suggest you need to go into this game with the right attitude.  It is not about getting attached to an uber group of four heroes you use to play through the whole game.  I put 20+ heroes in the graveyard on my 1st play through, but I think in a new play through I could likely lose none.  This game has great flexibility in party make up. Choosing the right heroes, with the right quirks and right equipment - for the right area, makes an huge difference.  There are a lot of complaints about the RNG, and I shared some of those when I started playing.  However, once I really learned about the different areas, attacks, heroes skills, etc, I found I rarely faced losing a hero even with back luck with the RNG.  The skill is learning how to mitigate Murphy's law.  If you are going into an area that has a monster that can kill a hero in 1-2 hits, bring a fast hero with stun and then another that can do a damage debuff.  Voila, no problem.  RNG only really hurts you if you are not prepared.  Most fights are won or lost before you embark on your mission.  Also, sometimes you just have to give up and retreat from a quest rather than risk a party on the edge of a heart attack and/or low life.  This game does require an investment in learning the nuances and thinking through every attack, but finishing the final quest, with no loading of prior saves, no cheats, etc. was very satisfying.  Artwork, sound and voice over are excellent fits for the theme.			"

												If you like a dungeon crawler with a twist for the obscure, a difficulty system that will keep you on your toes without being too extreme and the chance that a bad planning will probably end with your adventurers going back home in a wooden box, it's a wonderful game. Avoid if you're easy to frustrate or if you can't cope with the idea that each time you take your characters out for a stroll they'll probably need one to several runs to recover.Also, great developers. Not so long ago, when this game was in early access, I had a very different idea about it and am very glad to see they have heavily improved the basics. Cons would be that it's kind of easy to find the dungeons repetitive.			"

Early Access Review
								Fun Game, I got gifted this during the holidays. It's about a town that is surrounded by all manner of evil creatures. Skeletons, pigmen, bandits, witches, necromancers, and more. You send heroes in, four at a time, to get rid of them. The combat is turn based, like jRPGs, however positioning is important. If your healers are in the melee range, they can't heal well. If your melee is in the very back of your formation, they can't attack well. Besides combat, you also have to manage your heroes when they come back from their questing. Fighting in the dungeon takes a mental toll, and you need to spend money in order to get them back in fighting shape, along with outfitting them with weapons, armor, and training. The art is great, and the narrator is awesome. Just look up ""Wayne June Lovecraft"" on youtube and you'll see. I recommend this game, but it might be hard to get into. Most of the difficulty is in figuring out the mechanics, as you get more familiar with the game, you'll know what to do to avoid having your heroes die or go crazy.			"

												If you're considering this game, you need to know three things before you buy: 1. Your party members WILL die. Don't get too attached and salvage what items you can. 2. There is no shame in retreat. In fact, sometimes retreat is the only smart choice. 3. You will rage quit at least once playing this game. Darkest Dungeon has kept me on my toes and breathless for hours on end. This is a game with tons of nuiance and some very interesting game mechanics that push it beyond the regular rpg party side scroller. ITS HARD. I've never played such a challenging game that I couldn't just smash my way through. What brings me back every time however is that challenge. The art and game style are also incredible and well worth checking out.			"

												I dig this game quite a bit. It starts out looking like a pretty simple concept: get your team, get some gear, go kill some monsters, rinse and repeat. Then you start learning about the other concepts that make it complex. Stress is one; your characters don't just take physical damage. They take stress damage as well. They need a break after a hard dungeon crawl, otherwise they can develop harmful quirks or even die of a heart attack. It's an interesting thing; you end up having to juggle your characters while some are hale and hearty, some are having to pray or gamble their stresses away, and others may be getting treated for leprosy or rabies. You have to be able to pay for all of these treatments, too, so that just means more trips into the dungeons. It's a neat take on the Roguelike style. I've become a fan.			"

												This game is fantastic.You round up a team of heroes and send them into a dungeon to kill horrors and bring back loot.  However, these aren't godly JRPG superhumans you're sending in, your heroes are fragile both in mind and body.  This is reinforced both through the Mignola-esque art style and through the gameplay.  Even if you are well-prepared and cautious, you are always a handle of unlucky rolls from disaster.  The fact that you can and will lose heroes is mitigated by the fact that fresh recruits are freely available, and the upgrades to your hamlet are permanent once unlocked.The game design ensures that you will feel tense as you explore the dungeon.  Your stocks of food and torches slowly run out, and the dungeon becomes more menacing as the light level dims (even so, these dangers are balanced by greater rewards).  Encounters and traps will whittle away at your health and sanity, and much of the time you will have only limited means to recover.  If things go badly, it is often best to cut your losses and run away.  However, it's all too easy to say 'just a little bit further' and before you know it you've been ambushed and are being cut down.The devs have said that they are considering future balance tweaks, and I trust them to do a good job.  The gameplay is more polished compared to the initial EA release and the difficulty is very-well calibrated.  Combat is tactical due to the positioning mechanics and yet feels visceral given the possibility of huge swings of luck.  I have put hours and hours into this game and it still gets my heart pounding every time.  I'm still not at the titular 'Darkest Dungeon' but I already feel that this has been one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												Being new to games as such (roguelikes in general), this game can seem hard and unforgiving. This was especially true when in the Early Access, but after the release, the game seems much more fair. With proper part mangement, strategy, and some luck, you can get through each stage. The risk of losing a hero(s) is what makes the game, to most, uninviting. But honestly, that risk is what makes the game so rewarding: Without that, the game would be much less exciting. Pros:   TONS of classes. Each class feels like it has its own role in a specific party (except for plague doctor :\. Cant seem to find a place for him/her quite yet)  Variation of abilites.  There are 6 different skills that a class has. You can chose up to 4 at a time. Each new recruit comes with only 4, the other 2 you have to unlock (which isnt hard to do). You can swap these skills anytime when you are at the town.Pro/Con   Constant saves.  Can either be a pro or con, depending on how you view it. Basicly, the game constanly saves the game so you can't go back. Once your hero dies, he is dead. I honestly think this makes the game more immersive and adds to the risk to the game. You can get around this, but not as easily as other games.Cons:   Constant crashes when loading into a new area  Annoying, but not really a big deal since the game constaly saves, meaning all you lose is the time that it takes you to get back into the game. I have yet to lose any progress to any crash. "

												All the negative reviews are people who can't revise strategies or simply don't pay attention to the huge amount of info this game transparently gives you.Is this game difficult? Yes, but is it unfair? Only if you make it so.This game is all about strategic planning. It clearly lays out your characters strengths and weaknesses, and you must carefully consider how strong a combination of heroes can be against enemies that also have strengths and weaknesses.This is absolutely not a casual, every once in a while game. I generally play this a few hours each day, and it has yet to get old.Beyond the statistical fairness of the game, the art is unique and very emphatic. The narrator is seriously one of the very best sounding (and well written) of any game I've played.			"

												It may not appeal to everyone, but I love this game. Watch some gameplay videos and read some reviews if you're still on the fence.Pros:- The aesthetics, music, narration are all top-notch- The narrator is so good he deserves a second mention. Seriously- The gameplay is turn-based, so you can play strategically and thoughtfully- There's more than one way to ""succeed"" at the game - there's no single strategy that works better than everything else (but also see below)- The setting and unfolding storyline are great. Very Lovecrafian and GrimdarkCons:- Punishingly difficult. Some may see this as a pro. Be ready to cut-and-run, be ready to dismiss heroes that are damaged beyond repair, be ready to accept failure and death on a regular basis- Some classes/heroes feel noticably less useful than others, though there's not 100% agreement on which heroes- Though there's not one game-winning strategy that works all the time, some enemies and bosses DO require specific tactics to defeat, and if your group isn't ready for them, victory may not be possible. Again, that's part of the game, but this may bother some players.If you know what you're in for, and you're still interested, I'd give this game a shot, for the graphics and music (and narration) alone.

Early Access Review
								Not sure where this game is going but it does not feel like an RPG to me. It feels more like an acrade fightin game with a little story. Basicallly do not get attached to any of your characters beasue they will most likely die. PositivesArt work is awesome.The narration is  well doneThe theme of the game is dark and brooding.The stress and affliction stuff is genius, more games should pull this mechanic.Great light mechnaic, it adds a lot to the gameNegativesThe lack of havng one main character really hampers the story. Basically you throw adventurers at dungeons until you are done. Lots and lots of them...The lack of consistency in monsters and dungeons is extreme. It is a crap shoot every time.The lack of a persistant inventory is annoying, not sure what they were going for but all the stuff you buy magially disappears after a dungeon run.The rehab is crazy costly, it seems that they were trying to balane out the large amounts of money I think.All is all it is more of a dungeon fighting arcade game them an RPG. If you want one of those here is a good one....as for RPG not so much.			"

												I played this game like 30 hours to reach the end of the beta version, and another 20 hours after it's fully released.In my opinion, this game is not for everyone. However, if this type of games are your things, you just cannot stop playing. There're 3 reasons that I don't recommend it to everyone.  First, If you don't like cast away your heros like a spent torch, this is not your game.Sometimes you have to send them away because they're useless, or they just meet their fate on the quests, or you even have to recruit heros to farm a bit of golds, and throw them away. It's all about expendable heros clearing their(or future heros') path to the success.Second, the battle system is not for everyone. So it is all about planning your attacks. All the enemies are unique. Most of them are extremely strong or has devastating debuffs.Neutralize them before they kill you and make the most of every turns you get.Third, I must warn you, this game is rather unforgiving and challenging. You can lose all of your legendary heros in a minute. No guaranteed victories. Everything is unexpected, no easy wins. That's what makes this game fun and non-repetitive.If those things sound appealing to you(or you don't mind them), I highly recommend you to buy this game. Defenitely worth the price. 2000 yen... I mean, 15 dollars or so. "

												Not for the faint of heart, or somebody who gets mad easily.You will LOSE people, you will get completely BS rolls.  But if you like a challenge, you'll keep coming back no matter how much the game pisses you off.The game's spin on the whole dungeon crawl experience is a fascinating journey into the mind.  Nobody usually stops to consider the mental fortitude of adventurers except this game.  Consider for a moment the horrors and tribulations an adventurer faces has on a person's mind.  This game does that.  And keeping the sanity of your best people becomes a challenge in and of itself.Graphically - I like the stylized graphics.  The animations are really nothing to write home about, but it's not the game's focus and can be safely ignored.Music - It's solid.  Never got repetive for me.  I especially lke how it changes and becomes more intense the darker it gets.Overall, I give the game a 8/10.  Only let down a bit by a interface that could probably use some refinement and streamlining.  but otherwise it's a good game I don't regret buying and will probably put a lot more time into... even when it makes me scream ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, THAT ROLL WAS COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!  WTF!?			"

												So, the first twenty hours were pretty great. The art is the best thing ever, the writing is good, the combat very thoughtfully created and fun and nailbiting to play through.However, I lost interested and stopped playing after a while. The end objective is never really clarified (presumably, a tentacled Lovecraftian monster awaits in the Darkest Dungeon, the purpose is never really spelled out. You need to close a portal by... getting your guys to a high enough level to handle entering the final dungeon area? There's not even a ""gather four keys"" subplot.)  The game presumes the existence of repetive grinds is enough to pull you forward, but it's not really. Contrary to what you might think, there's not much RPG elements. You don't come across randomized loot, or make key decisions in how to permanently upgrading a character. What would make me want to grind up to level five or six?The game sells itself as a game where character death is frequent and permanent, but this is kind of misleading. You have an inexhaustable supply of heroes, you can rename them, recolor them, respec them at any time, and when they die, you can take their items off their corpse. So if your favorite Grave Robber dies, nothing happens other than you having to spend three hours leveling another Grave Robber to your current highest level and spending gold to upgrade them. Without limited numbers of heroes, or unique characters, death felt pretty meaningless. Why not just have them recuperate for three campaign turns? Or, maybe better yet, make the campaign itself more rougue-like, and shorter, so you have to make more consequential decisions on who to recruit.In the end, I'm really pumped for Darkest Dungeon 2. This game felt complete, but it felt like the prelude to a much more fun sequal -- it needed more plot, more environments, more hallway variations, some tweaks to the gameplay. And it needs support to make the late game involving, with more rewards with the harder difficulty.			"

												Might be my first ""turn based party RPG dungeon crawler"" ever. This game is difficult, but the mechanics are easy to learn and the UI is never cluttered. From artstyle to audio design everything is marvellous. The best part of the game beside the actual gameplay, is it's strong atmosphere. It is very twisted and dark, but often funny in a grim way. The game has a narrator that is superbly written and who explains you the story as you progress forward.Highly recommendable game for players who seek survival challenge, like random generated levels and strong atmosphere.

												It's an amazing game. It's unconventional and sure there are lots of divergent opinions about it... because peolpe get butthurt. The gimmick of this game is you will lose. You will go down. You will have bad times. And that's what makes it great, innovative and overall refreshing. It makes the victories that much more rewarding. I'm almost 30 hours into it right now and I feel like I barely even begun. I love long, slow-progressing games. And if you do too, this one's for you.			"

												This game has been getting some bad rap from some people. Said people walked into the game expecting something that the game isn't. So here's a fair review of Darkest Dungeon:1. Yes; the game is a rougelike. It is tough, dark, challenging, and will be punishing at times. Is it an impossibly difficult game? No. But it is difficult. At times it will have you frustrated, but that's the point. The game sets out to make sure you DON'T get too attached to your heroes. They will, in all liklihood, die. And that's what people hate. They hate that they can't just waltz through a game, get a few boo-boos, and then truck through the rest of the fight with no danger. The fights don't work that way. Hero death happens, and it's critical that you avoid it if at all possible obviously. But there are times when you weigh your options and you make the wrong choice. This game won't hold your hand for you. You are the master of your actions: you deal with your consquences.People often complain that their tactics in one dungeon didn't work in another dungeon. That's because each dungeon offers a range of new challanges that must be faced with new tactics. Why would your blight heavy party, who was able to destroy the blight-prone skeletons of the ruins meet the same monotonous victory in the warrens, where the pig men are used to disease and blight? Pick new heroes ffs. Get some curse and bleed up in there. (Pro tip, a party with no tank goes really badly. A party with no capability of healing also goes really badly). This game does what it's supposed to, and it does it rather well. It shows the player that your actions have consequences, and you need to put a decent amount of forethought into your strategies. Don't get too bummed out when a hero dies. It happens. Total party wipes happen. You can avoid those if you know when to retreat. But if it does happen, just move on and assemble a new team and learn from your mistakes, as you do with any other game (dare I say, and life in general).			"

												I played two seperate versions of this game for about 15-30 game weeks each.  Recently I decided to buy it because this is probably one of my favorite games I've played in a long time.  The first build I played which was probably dated from around 06/15, was a gruelling experience.  Many parties were wiped.  I was constantly barely hanging on, and everything was quite rough.  But it was intriguiging.  I later on found a more recent build dated from around 2/2015, and started a second playthrough, taking the grueling lessons I learned on my first playthrough by heart.   I started out much stronger this time, but still I made mistakes, and eventually I had a double party wipe combined with bankruptcy.  I set the game down for a bit a few weeks.Finally, I decided to buy the game.  So far Im about 40 weeks into this playthrough with at least one of every class above level 3.  I have no deaths, and have not started a single run without optimized equipment.  At this point I am unsure if the game has been made easier in recent patches (Healing seems much more available).  Though this is not necesarily bad.  There is always that faint line of balance where if I focus the wrong target, everything will go to hell (It's happened).  I also noticed a large number of complaints about the rng.  From what I've experienced, The Rng is much less random than people paint it out to be.  The worst case scenario is usually the norm, and anything other than that is a blessing.  When you play with this consideration in mind, the game becomes much more maneagable and feels much better.  I think the Rng Mirrors the style of the game.  On the outside it's hopeless, but deep underneath it creates  am environment primed in equal measures for hope and hopelessness.Also in terms of art review, It's fantastic.  The diction is beautful, and the writing lends to it so well.  Overall this is very very well done from an artistic standpoint, and can easily be worth about 10 hours of play to experience it on the surface			"

I personally like that, but others complain that its difficulty relies too much on giving you poor dice rolls rather than actually presenting tactically challenging situations.Those who complain about such things should remind themselves of the game\'s narration constantly tells you that you must make the best of a dire situation. Perma death, autosaves, no retries, It resonates perfectly with the artistic design choices. Even though many times you\'re going to get frustrated when a dice roll screws you over, just know that you\'re playing the game as exactly as it was intended.  "

Early Access Review
								I see a lot of people comparing this to Dark Souls, but in truth the only thing the two have in comon is their difficulty. Though this game isn't exactly difficult, unfair would be a better word. When you die in Dark Souls it's entirely your fault, but when you die in Darkest Dungeon chances are pretty good that there's nothing you could have done. I like the concept, I like the premise, I love the art, I like a lot of the gameplay, but I really can't reconcile with how heavily RNG factors in. I've lost characters because they refused to be healed while they were on death's door. That's a special kind of unfairness that you have to be actively searching for in a game to find enjoyable. It's a niche game for a niche audience made up of a combination of masochists and people with unfaltering resolve. It's not a bad game by any means and I've had some great fun with it, but it just doesn't appeal to me. But if you're the kind of person who finds enjoyment in having the odds stacked completely and totally against you then by all means go ahead. If nothing else this game mirrors its story perfectly, I can't play it for more than a few hours without going completely ♥♥♥♥ing mad.			"

												TL;DR - Die hard Rogue-like fans will probably find it too easy. People looking for a typical dungeon crawl might find it too grindy. It hit a sweet spot for me though, and the aesthetic is great. Def worth a play.----------------There's this card game called Mao. The rules are: you don't get to know the rules. The only person who knows the rules is your worst most annoying friend. If he says the suit you played doesn't match the 70s rock song he was thinking of, your card is wrong and you lose. His sister, who is really cute and who has totally figured out eye-liner, will laugh and in that moment you will realize that she was never going to go to prom with you pretty much no matter what. This part of the analogy isn't super relevant. The point is that Mao has a lot in common with Rogue-like games.When you play a Rogue-like you're at the mercy of a set of unknown rules. And it's not even your awful friend Dave who's making them up. The rules are written by some software developer who didn't even go to your high school and probably didn't even know Dave's sister back then. Maybe they're dating now, whatever, it doesn't matter.There are a couple of ways of looking at this power dynamic. You can feel bullied and cornered, or you can accept that you'll be defeated many, many times and decide to use each defeat to learn little scraps of information that will help you exploit the rules and do a little better next time. I'm no masochist. I mean, I added Dave on facbook to be nice, but I unsubscribed from his feed. If a game tortures me too much, I'm out. There's too much other good stuff out there to play. I do get the appeal of the second approach though. The game doesn't actually kill me in real life. It gives me infinite chances. There's fun to be had in hacking it until it breaks. It all boils down to how much fun I'm having figuring out the rules.Darkest Dungeon has rules and mechanics that are unique and fun to figure out. That's the make-or-break for Rogue-likes I think and that's why this review is marked positive. It can feel like a grind at times - like ""OK I get it, I learned this lesson. This party configuration should be shredding this fight but Dave just keeps lying about the rolls he's getting behind that DM screen!"" He's not, it's just bad luck. But whatever, Dave is the worst. Anyway, Amber return my calls. I know you're single again.			"

It should be noted, however that the game is incredibly difficult, requires some grinding at times and heros WILL die, it's an enevidability. The game will test your patence and tactics, you must be aware of your enemies and their capabilities as well as your own.  But as the ancestor said.

												I do not usually review games... infact I believe this is the first time that I actually am reviewing a game here on Steam.Anyways, Darkest Dungeon is one of those game that I was lookingat since it was in kickstarter and then forgot about it till about a week ago.I have read all sorts of reviews from good to bad and worst.I have to say that I love this game!It is challenging and hard and rough and you want to scream when everything you do and plan goes wrong every single time.The game notifies you that your heroes will die, horribly, and it does not lie.Try not to get attached to your characters... you will cry.The art is amazing, the game design is cool, the mecahincs are great.And remember, when all is lost, there might still be light at the end of the tunnel - when all fails you will find who you are! OOOOOO lolz.  It is not only bad, sometimes when the champions are stressed, they discover that they are truely heroic.I love it as each character is very different than the others and you find yourself weaving a story for the characters as you go (at least I do that).I got so attached to some characters that I was scared for their lives in so many points of the game at so many events. So far, 10 hours into the game, enemies are still unique and fun although you will get wipe and trust me, you will get wipe,it is part of the game.It is bloody hard, with no room for mistakes, and if you make a mistake, well, learn for next time and do not repeat it - it is not forgiving.Overall, 10/10 will need a heart pacer if things go the way they do :DI recommend it with a full heart to any type of players from casual to hard core just to have a taste of something a bit different than the usual hack and slash without any consequence.And remember... The shadow is only ahead of you when the light is behind you. So keep that torch lit at all times ya bumm!:D			"

												This game is built for the old-school gamer. The gamer that grew up before this hand-holding AAA garbage-fest we see today. Press F to pay respects. Darkest Dungeon gives you just enough of a tutorial to get you on your feet, but even then the tutorial itself is difficult. One of my heroes died on the first mission, something that would not happen again until several missions later. I've seen many negative reviews in the ""most helpful"" section complaining of bad RNG and steep difficulty. The only conclusion I can reach is those reviewers are millenials that need their hand held. If this game were any easier, I would not enjoy it. If this game had player-favored RNG, I would not enjoy it. If this game told me what to do and when to do it, I would not enjoy it. These seem to be the qualities some people desire however. There is a disclaimer before you even start your first save file and every time you load the game thereafter which states that this is an extremely challenging game. Your heroes will die. You will be compelled to abandon some missions (or face a party wipe). You will be forced to make many difficult  choices.  I mainly wanted to write this review in an attempt to dispel the false rumors you see in the ""most helpful"" section. The great atmosphere, art style, voice acting etc. can all be witnessed via the gameplay trailer. The RNG that people claim to be unfair is actually quite the opposite. The RNG in Darkest Dungeon is actually the most balanced I've seen in a game in a long time. Your players will get crit often, but your crits will land just as well. Your player will get their attacks dodged, but you can dodge just as many enemy attacks. Your players will go from 100%-0% in a single strike, but you can land the same blow. You are not favored in any fight. Neither is the enemy.The problem people have with this game isn't the RNG, but instead the difficulty curve. The game is always hard, but it goes from hard during the level 1 and 3 dungeons, to brutal in level 5 and insane in level 6 dungeons. The massive spikes in difficulty catch the average player off-guard and once a level 5 dungeon is started for the first time with the usual crew and they get demolished, discouragement is had and RNG is blamed when in fact it was their lack of preparation. In level 1 dungeons you can pick any composition you want, and still succeed. You could go in with 4 of the same class, all with no trinkets and still complete the quest. During level 3 quests, you need to mix up your roster a bit and start thinking about good class combos but it's still straightforward and can be tank and spanked. Then comes level 5 dungeons. I have a feeling once most players reach level 5 quests is when they start blaming ""RNG"" and stop playing out of frustration. The difference in difficulty between a level 3 and a level 5 dungeon is immense. In level 5 dungeons, your party composition is extremely important. You need to have a clear idea of what each class brings to the table along with their strengths and weaknesses. It's no longer a zerg rush where all your attacks land and you can just go full offense. Debuffs need to be applied. Stuns are your friend. Movement skills become necessary. You must camp at the right time. Your trinket selection is  vital.  All of these mechanics aren't new, but they weren't really a factor until now. Once you figure out how to correctly utilize all of the mechanics the game has to offer, level 5+ dungeons become ""easy"" again.So in conclusion Darkest Dungeon is not the unfair game with imbalanced RNG that the ""most helpful"" reviews would like you to think it is. It is a beautifully difficult game that has steep learning curves. These nightmarish creatures can be felled! They can be beaten! Confidence surges as the enemy crumbles!TL;DRDarkest Dungeon has fair RNG. It is the most fun you'll have while simultaneously wanting to rip your hair out. Buy it.			"

												This a great little turn-based RPG. It has the very basic premise of the player taking control of a group of heroes and exploring the corrupted locations (read: dungeons) around the hamlet in which he is based. Success leads to the hamlet being improved, the heores becoming more powerful, and the story slowly unfolding.It is a very hard ironman roguelike, so be prepared for the losses and setbacks. Whilst it is technically impossible to lose, you can be set back by a large amount in one game. There are a lot of threads in the forums about the brutal difficulty level and you just have to accept that things are just out of your control on occaision. That occaision could lead to you losing your favourite hero before you realise, and it is an ironman game, so dead is dead.This game is one of the most successful in setting the right atmosphere. The stylish Cthulhu mythos, brilliant hand drawn artwork and pitch perfect narration all contribute, imparting the right feeling of despair and struggle. It all enhances the game to elevate it from a good game into a great game.Positive:The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. The narration deserves awards.The game is addictive, well designed, and a joy to play.The simple design hides a depth that later leads to deeper tactics and hero synergies.Good learning curve. Forgiving at the start, but punishing if you do not bring your A-game to the later levels.The achievements are good fun to attempt to gather, and increase the longevity of the game.Negative:The RNG can be brutal, in a stacked game. You have to fight hard and enjoy the little victories.The gameplay can feel repetitive, and the grind, whilst enjoyable, can still be a grind. In recent patches the developers have been working with the community to balance this, and it is pretty much there.A few of the hidden achievements reward spectacular failure, and may even require specific hunting, so really could be considered anti-achievements...Notes:Be warned. This game has a very volatile and vicious community that is split right down the middle. This is due to a disagreement in the community about how the game progressed through development. Just recommending this game has earnt me the enmity of thousands of players.			"

												I strongly reccomend this game. It reminds me of a cross between X-COM and a dungeon crawler rpg. For each quest you have to bring a party of 4 heroes of a dozen or so classes. While you are adventuring you need to carefully manage their stress and health to avoid a quick and permanent death (the game auto saves so don't bother save-scumming. If your best hero dies, he's gone.). It seems pretty easy at first but as you start to play a bit more the difficulty ramps up fast and it becomes common to abandon your quests and suffer the penalties in order to atleast make it out alive.While you can rename your heroes i'd advise against getting too attatched to them.

								This game is great.  The atmosphere and narration really do a great job at bringing you into the world.  I like the combat , but accuracy is a little too low for my liking as more often than not, my party members are just swinging at air, but thats probably just bad luck on my end.  One thing I would like to see is the ability to throw out members that losing their mind.  This would allow the rest of your party members not to be dragged down by a few unlucky crits or focused fire from the enemy causing one of your characters to go insane in barely the second area of a dungeon.  I think this would be fine as you would lose a party member for the rest of the quest and that should be enough of a disadvantage in exhance for saving stress for the others.All in all, I recommend people play this game, It really is good even if rage inducing difficult at times :D.

								I'd have to give this two thumbd up in early access. I have put in about 60 hours and finallly I am getting most every class up to level 6 in anticipation of more to come. Its a tough game no doubt, having to manage health and the sanity of the team is a beast (Rogue like much?). One member goes insane and they start skipping attackes, moving places and talking too much; and when they talk your team starts to go mad too. There is enough game for now, I may have to start a new campaign in another 15 hours if they do not get the other dungeons up soon. I am ok with that. The art and theme hands down are amazing. Very stylized and the NPC voice over is top notch in wording and delivery. Very enjoyable so far.   Get this now.			"

												Obviously I haven't played the game very long but i recommend giving it a try. The art direction is fantastic and the gameplay is really exciting and difficult as you learn more of the mechanics. It takes a LOT of time. The game is difficult and grindy but hey, thats what makes it what it is. I can see how this might get tiresome after leveling multiple parties to 6 to do the Darkest Dungeon levels but as far as difficult games go this is my favorite (it just took me some getting used to not worrying about killing off all my lowbie characters since im used to being protective of any rpg characters im playing as or guiding). This game is incredibly promising and theres a lot of negative reviews based on mechanics that were put into the game on purpose, which should not throw you off if everything else about it peaks your interest.

												This game is amazing.  This game is very brutal though and you will struggle with it. If you have good management of your team/HP/Stress you will be fine. The RNG is not as bad as people say it is. If you feel that it is ""against"" you or ""unfair"" there are always things that will put it in your favor, like items or quirks. Do not complain how hard this game is or about RNG if you buy this game, you should know it is very possible you may not have the best time starting off adn blaming the game won't help. Just stick with it and you will find it gets easier. Even if you do not plan on beating this game it is still a very fun game to play. PS- Wtf is up with all the people with 50+ hours in the game not recommending it? Why did they keep playing? (This just really confuses me)			"

												There's so much good about this game I'm not sure where to start... But I'll do my best.First of all, the game has fantastic storytelling and narration. The meloncholy voice confessing his sins and warning you about what might be ahead really leaves you in a sense of suspense, and it really keeps that dark, end of the world type of tone in the game, where you otherwise might just think ""Oh it's time to skip into the dungeon and loot it again!""Second of all, the game is, for the most part, very fair. People often complain about RNG, but this often causes their defeat because they become too comfortable with smooth runs, and aren't prepared for the worst when it finally happens. While a hero dying is permanent, you'll often be given so many chances to save them. A hero can never been one-shot, in any circumstance. Instead, they enter death's door, where every hit beyond that has a chance to kill them permanently(If you want to understand this mechanic further, please research it online, there's plenty of info.)Thirdly, the art. The art looks fantastic! It really drips with that Lovecraftian feel. The characters all look really unique, and the locations are as eerie as ever.Of course, the game also comes with the unique stress system. While it is the idea that's supposed to keep the game so unique and seperate from others, it actually feels more like a secondary health bar. You try to keep it under control, and it will sometimes require maintenance outside of the dungeon, because your heroes do not instantly go to 0 stress after a mission, while they will fully heal afterwards(odd, eh?)The only negative thing I can say about the game is that it feels like it hangs around a little longer than neccessary. With a lot of skill, you can clear the game in a reletively short time, but the endgame is extremely difficult, and unless you find the information online, will probably consist of some trial-and-error. The problem is, because the permadeath, you'll find yourself having to re-train heroes from step 1 to retry the final dungeon. This can make the length feel a bit inflated for anyone unable to overcome that final hurdle.Overall, I'd say the game is fantastic, though I bought it on sale, I feel it was completely worth $15.PS: I normally despise turn-based games that don't involve 3D movement.

The dungeons can get a big same-y, and the game isn't complete yet, so you can't actually finish it, but as early access games go, this one is totally worth picking up.

								""There once was a plague doctor named Pancevolt. She proved to be an invaluble member of the team she worked with. Her skill in alchemy was unrivaled, and even the mightiest foes quivered at how she killed her opponents: making the enemy ill, and cutting them down if the other members of the party didn't do it before her. The team was glad to have her with them.But even the best fighters are not invincible.During one fateful expedition, the plague doctor was poisoned to death...a truly ironic fate, indeed. Her team was devestated. A fellow teammate, Dismas, lost all hope. He resorted to drinking, made even worse since he was a known cheat at gambling. The bottle was his only friend until he finally accepted that his friend was gone, and she was never coming back.The party has never been the same since. However, the people she worked for still carries on her legacy. They will finish what they started...for Pancevolt....""You'd probably think the above is a sob story I made up, but this actually happened to me in the game. Expect the same kind of thing to happen to you during your playthrough, as it is pretty much unavoidable given the game's unforgiving nature. Think of it as the Dark Souls of turn-based dungeon crawlers; except all deaths are final. Any sort of small mistake can potentially screw you over; especially when your fighters can actually go insane is they become too stressed, or even straight up have a heart attack if it goes too far beyond that.This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ It will not apologize. It will even keep a graveyard with a list of those who have died. I often have to abandon missions because I fear for the lives of those I put in the party.I ♥♥♥♥ing love it for that.If you don't like difficult games, don't bother with this one. For those of you like a challenge, however, you should AT LEAST try this game. I can guarantee you will not regret it, unlike the countless expeditions you will go on where party members will inevitably die trying to reach their objective. If you're a hardcore gamer like myself, or even casual gamers that may want to test their dungeon crawling skills, I cannot recommend this one enough.			"

								Can't stop... playing... this game.One of my first ever experiences delving into a Roguelike game. It was brutal at first, even daunting and futile until you get your♥♥♥♥♥whipped enough to realize it's not just the game being complex and difficult - it's you failing to learn and pay attention to the finer mechanics involved. From the specific text dialog in interactive prompts that give you a hint, to the varying degrees of provisions, management, and enemies you may encounter. Monsters and bosses scale and change with dungeon progression, as do the workings that govern and inhabit each of these places.  If there is ONE game that has done replayability correctly, it's this one. There are so many variables to take into account at every turn of this game that it's never the same, and there is always something new to experience and learn. I will say that there is A LOT of management involved if you are going to play this game 'correctly'. Every aspect of this game has things you may CHOOSE to manage and take into account. You can do the basic necissities, but you're going to feel the burn when you took your Plague Doctor with 4 bad quirks related to the dungeon you just entered, and you didn't have enough money for a satisfying quantity of both torches and shovels. Or completely forgetting that you can change  skills while you camp, and abilities when you're out of combat before a crucial fight. There is much to cover if you want to consistently maximize your effectiveness at every stage; alot but never too much. An important and well struck balance in roguelikes.  This game will test your wits, and challenge your attentiveness with: money, hero, and ability managamenet, limited inventory space, hero stress and health, trinkets, virtues and quirks which effect stats positively and negatively respectively. The list goes on and on. The more you play, the more you learn to manage if you want to stay one small step ahead of the challenges in this game. It's exhilerating. When you do things right and keep up with the learning curve it's a great feeling of triumph and understanding. You take that with you far enough until you foolishly bring two level 1's on a rank 3 dungeon and get your Legend Crusader sent to graveyard because you thought the game got easy all of a sudden. I could go on about this, but instead you should probably just buy and play this game and save me the time. Currently this game in my mind stands as 9.5/10 and this is still early access, with 2 major content areas still to be added along with loads more features, and improvements. The art is great, the narrator is awesome and even though you hear him a lot it really never gets old. There are times in the game I swear the developer put in small hidden scripts that respond to certain optional choices you make.This game is a ravenous evolving beast that wants you dead.			"

								So I have had a journey with this game, I bought it from my own curiosity and the reccomendation from a friend and I was looking forward to playing it. The first labtop I tried it on the game crashed from startup and no matter what my friend and I tried it would'nt work so I was at a loss untill I tried a different labtop. This is where it gets interesting the labtop ran the game, hooray, but my joy was short lived as all the background, skill icons, and map were invisible, still usable but not able to be seen, but I continued on anyway playing the game. After putting in over 30 hours unable to see most of the game and being at a severe disadvantage in a already hard game I have one thing to say ... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME in all its entirety and the only way it could get better for me is if my bug gets fixed or new expansions happen. This game is brilliant and I recommend it to anyone looking for a difficult rogue like game that has a beautiful art style and ask of them to look past any of its early development flaws.			"

								     For the little time that I've spent on this game, there's always a little part of me that was wishing it was playing something else. Something easier. Something less depressing. Something that didn't get my nymphomaniac hero stuck in a brothel for more than two weeks... and didn't even relieve him of all his stress.     Honestly, this game is hard. Dark Souls hard. It wears on your resolve and eats at your patience like cancer. The reason you come back, though, is cause you know it can be beaten. The stress system develops characters' traits in a way I've never seen before, and you start to weave stories in your head about how and why the character ends up with those traits through the sparsely animated combat scenes. On top of the gorgeous artwork and ominous narration, this game provides a lot of atmospheric pleasure and just the right amount of difficult to keep you coming back for more. 8.9/10			"

												Dismas was the first to die. His bones shattered like so many dreams upon the club of a Pig man.Next was Raynauld. In his time praying at the Abbey, he had witnessed true horrors, and refused to return. His own mind betrayed him in the bowels of the Weald. Next up was a Leper that went by the name of DuFrask. Dufrask was everything anyone could want in a leader, save for his nasty habit of cheating while Gambling. He was Sturdy, and a seasoned Weald Explorer. In stressful situations, he would bend like the willow but cut deep like the bramble. He lead multiple fools through the depths of the abyssal caverns beneath the estate, many died, but many rose to glory.In my hubris, I told DuFrask that he would be taking a regiment of men to face off against the Wizened Hag who'd taken up residence there. Much like the fools who still came to this town thinking they'd find anything but despair and death, I allowed myself a small portion of Hope. I see now that this was a mistake.DuFrask was accompanied by two other veterans of the caverns; Laci the Jester and Millith, a Vestal, as well as a newer edition to my regiment of explorers, Holland, a Bounty Hunter of few words.To make a long story short; it was a nightmare.Millith was killed almost as soon as we'd stepped foot in the dungeon. Like the fool I was, blinded by my own pride in my best warrior, I pushed on, ignoring the warning Millith had given us with her death, ""We are all doomed!"" Without healing, Laci was soon to follow the Vestal's example.DuFrask and Holland pushed on into the dungeon, but we never did find the hag. DuFrask was slaughtered by the repeated assault of several corpses, leaving only the Bounty Hunter standing after all was said and done.With no foreseeable chance of victory, I pulled Holland out and we returned to our dreary home above. He cloistered himself soon after that, and I did not hear from him for a week. When he finally returned to me, he was a changed man. This dungeon, it does not simply end when you leave its blackened halls. The darkness, the suffering, the pure malice of it stays with you, haunts you. Your mind is the one dungeon you can never escape.			"

								Fantastic game-Very difficult and frustrating. You will fail frequently.-Highly replayable, with varied mission types and enemies-Lot's of different character classes to experiment with-A great sense of accomplishment with each survived mission-Very engaging art and music sets quite a moodThe turn-based combat is a very entertaining balancing act.  Just when you think you've got the enemy on their heels, they throw something new at you.  Getting unlocks is truly rewarding because you have to work hard for them and frequently lose heroes doing so.  Team management requires timing (who rests for how long and where) and attention to resources, as well as a fine awareness of each character's perks and disabilities (which evolve over the course of the game).  The Lovecraftian dungeon exploration theme is wrapped in Mignola-esque, heavily inked art and set to a dark, oppressive soundtrack.  I'm really excited to see where the developers go from here, which is rare for early access.  I can't recommend it enough.			"

I really, really dig the art style but the voice overs can get a bit repetitive when you're played this 30+ hours but you can easily lower the volume down or mute it all together. While it's not yet the full version there's still a lot to play as it is even now, the finished product should find its way into each and everyones library of those people who like these kinds of games in general. :) Highly recommended!

												Re-doing my review as the game has come a long way since my earlier one.All in all this game rocks. The game crashing bugs seem to have been fixed and everything is in working order.This is a game that I think falls under the Dark Souls level of toughness, but with a Lovecraft world and creatures.The art for the game is amazing and wide in its contents, while still maintaining a dark gothic madness throughout.I highly recommend this game, even more so if you can catch it on sale. I sure don't regret buying it.Please keep in mind that this game may not be considered appropriate for some younger viewers, it is Lovecraftian after all, and so no sunshine and rainbows to be expected.If you don't mind spoilors and want a look at the gameplay before buying there are a ton of YouTube channels out there covering this game, such as this one: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVzhC8e1isejZ5Q8FCc2DjnXcqh4CHUGlIf you like what you see, hurry back here and support the developers by buying this great game.

There is a lot to see and do here.  The developer has also done a great job of making the dungeons feel dark and perilous.  The narrator is brilliant too with a foreboding H.P Lovecraftarian style.  I have a great deal of praise for this game.  If you were a D&D or AD&D player back in the good old days; get this game!  You will love it! 10/10  P.S  Early access and not a single bug, crash or issue in sight.  Plays perfectly every time.			"

												This game has a lot of potentional and feels like the devs put a lot of time in it, but it suffers from tedious grinding and a lot of RNG. People will tell you that this is the ""Dark Souls of dungeon crawlers"" but it's simply not. Surely both games are hard and can be comperable in that way but Darkest Dungeon is more of a frustrating experience and it gives very little room to learn something from your mistakes. As mentioned before the game is VERY grindy, things will quickly get a lot more expensive and you'll have to rely on safely grinding money and heirlooms with low level parties to be able to treat and upgrade your stronger heroes. If you check the global achievements stats you can see that only about 1% of the game owners have completed the game.. That alone means that the game is rather messed up.			"

												The game is novel and kudos to them for coming up with a brand new IP and new game mechanics. That being said I think the game ultimately falls a little flat in how repetetive the grind becomes. There is a lot of nuance and plenty of things you could say about whether the grind is thematic or acceptable or expected or what, but ultimately it is what turned me off of the game. You spend time and effort building up your team only for RNGesus to take it away, and then you are literally looking at hours trying to build a team back up again. Thematic or no, it quickly gets boring and tedious.I don't like the ""do you recommend or not"" binary choice here. If you don't mind grind then by all means go for it, it's a great game. If grind bothers you then I'd stay stay away.			"

												Few games on my playlist have such debate or ""salt"" in the forums... then again, just shows how varied the playerbase is for this game.Generally three camps; 1) people love it, 2) a few people loath it, or 3) the neutral switzerland of the bunch.... the silent majority that just actually play the game and stays away from the forums.I try and stick with the third bunch, its a game I jumped into thanks to seeing good streams - a better option of seeing how you'd like a game rather than these ""reviews"" lolFor me, its a 'little and often' game - I play a few hours pretty often; it does have very frustrating moments, the good, bad and ugly.It runs smooth and is a nice little dungeon crawler that ups the difficult and certainly falls into the resource management, with some grinding for funds, the stress, the food 'clock', and the RNGness, which after playing solidly can get annoying, and for new players just starting, is pretty naff... but once you get a good pace and varied roster of 'heroes' a few hours in, it evens out and you'll be ok :)But for a couple of hours play after a day of work, it works really well. The atmospherics are brilliant, the narration perfect; few other games I have had such atmosphere! Maybe Hand of Fate :PIgnore the salt, check out plays on videos and try it out for yourself; the worst case is you'll just refund it :)			"

												This game has a great look. On a technical level it also seems great. I didn't encounter any noticeable bugs, and I even play it in LInux.There is a problem though. The game is super grindy. It takes forever to get built up just so you can go on your ssecond quest. I took a long time getting four guys to level 2 got them all destressed and ready to go which was quite time consuming. To do that you have to send out many other parties just to be able to afford keeping them patched upi while you level. So when I sent out the main team they got wasted not even half-way through. Most of my game time was just on this one attempt. It is too much work if that much time doesn't get you ready.As much as I like the look and feel of this game I don't think I will return.  Can't stand it when games pad their gameplay size by making it so hard you have to stay down in the dregs forever just to advance a little bit. It isn;t worth the effort. It makes me sad but now I am going to uninstall it.			"

The game has a great premise, the story is cool, and it reminds me of Arkham Horror quite a bit, but just like all true Lovecraft novels, there is only misery, sadness and death awaiting.  The game needs serious rebalancing before I would touch this again.			"

								The game is good, only if you enjoy this kind of unforgiving death simulator.I played the game a bit, and for the type of game it is, I think it requries way too much time, compared to games similar to it. Basically, I'm saying, only buy the game if you are completely sure you will enjoy it. I took a risk on it, and it really did not pay off.I would've said it was ok if it was $10, maybe $15, but $20 is also too much for a game in this state, who is also really extremely picky and unforgiving.Now, I'm not saying the game is bad, it's just only for a very special type of people.

Early Access Review
								This game is fantastic in so many ways. What if at some point darkness was unleashed and there wasn't some super powerful ally of goodness and justice to just squash it under foot? This is that game. A game where adventurers go in and almost none return alive. It covers the stresses of dungeon crawling that no other game comes close to. Your adventurers get stressed as things go wrong, gain diseases from rifling through graves, and get cursed when messing with relics and shrines. There's so much more other than ""did you bring enough potions"". You need to worry about food, affliction cures, does my party compliment each other, do I have enough shovels to go through obstacles quickly, do I have enough torches so I don't lose sanity and hit chance too much. You also have limited carrying capacity and money to buy and carry all the gear and treasure you find. It's alot of fun managing all these different aspects. You also need to choose where to place your heroes/adventurers for your delve into the dungeon. There are four spots in total for both you and the enemy so choose wisely as to who goes where.I bought this game about a week after it was put up on steam and have been reading the patches as they come out as well as tinkering with the things they fix/change. Alot of the reviews I have read currently are about how unnecessary some of the new mechanics are. However, when you start a new game you can choose to turn off corpses and heart attacks (the two main reasons people are upset). Play the game and if you don't like them you can restart and turn off the ones you don't like.Let's talk about the corpse and heart attack features so that you can be informed about them before starting.The corpse mechanic is where after an enemy or hero dies, their corpse will appear in the square where the monster/hero used to stand. This is great because in this game there are abilities that rely on the position of the enemy and yourself. One example is the Plague Doctor class. She has an ability called Plague Grenade that she can only cast from the last two spots and that can hit the enemies last two spots. Another ability is Noxious Blast which can be used from the last three spots and can hit the enemies front two spots. Now here's something important, each class has seven abilities BUT they can only take four of those abilities at a time. You can swap them out in town but not in a dungeon so you want abilities that compliment your party composition and the placement of that particular adventurer. So if you stick the Plague Doctor in the back you want abilities she can use back there. The reason corpses were implemented is that when an enemy (or one of your heroes) died, the positioning of each hero/enemy would shift one spot forward in order to fill their spot. This would cause abilities to no longer be effective as the enemy is no longer where your ability can hit them or your hero is no longer in a position where they can use them. So if an enemy in the front died and all the enemies moved forward a square, the Plague Doctor will be unable to hit one target with her Plague Grenade as there is only one enemy in the last two spots. Another class that benefited from this is the bounty hunter which has a couple abilities that force move the enemies around. This new mechanic of corpses allows those abilities to be used and not just passed over for min/maxing your damge, now you have to strategize a little bit.The other mechanic, Heart Attacks, are an interesting feature because it used to be that your heroes could keep adventuring even after they went insane and lost all hope. This only applied a negative to their stats or ability to act so you could keep pushing onward disregarding an original mechanic, stress. Now however, you need to avoid actions that give stress (not eating, walking around in the dark, removing obstacles without a shovel, having stressed people in your party, etc.) and start using items and skills that relieve stress as well as leaving stressed heroes in town to calm down. If a hero reaches 100 stress they will gain an affliction (debuff) or virtue (buff) as before but now instead of being able to stay stressed indefinitely, once a hero reaches 200 stress they have a heart attack and die. This really solidifies the necessity of proper stress handling. You need to know when to back out before your supplies and heroes can't take the crushing darkness any longer.I really hope this helped clarify some of the complaints you may see and allow you proper insight as to why some of these mechanics were introduced.10/10 recommend to anyone who enjoys a roguelike, dungeon crawl, strategy, or any mix of the three type of game. Be warned though, the game is difficult.			"

												Game is fun, but will be extremely difficult, if not the most time intensive difficult game you will beat.Game gives you a unique 20+ hours of dungeon crawling with unique heroes, bosses, items to touch and add to.However, don't expect to beat this game, which only 0.05% have of writing this.  I saw a guy's youtube channel, the last level requres you to have maxed out level 6 characters.  Then you have to beat 4 levels of the dungeon.  But the rub is once you send a character in there, you can't use them again to enter the Darkest Dungeon.  The fights are challanging you will need to max everything and 150k - 250k or more gold to attempt to win.  So I just played about 20 hours worth after the full release and got burned out, and skipped through the guys youtube video where he put in 110+ hours in.  LOLThe game also stales out because you have to beat the same boss over just at a higher 'level'.Game is fun and challanaging, but gets stale late game, and is kind of drawn out for the sake of difficulty.

												Darkest Dungeon (a Lovecraft inspired dungeon RPG) is a  turn-based battler with an overarching structure, and one idea that lifts it way above the ordinary. This is stress, the idea that people subjected to the kind of horrors that dungeon explorers go through might crack under the pressure. Each hero has their own stress meter, which is regularly added to by everything from it being too dark to the presence of a killer god, and when a tipping point is reached their mental fortitude is tested. In some cases they’ll respond favorably and inspire their compatriots but, far more often, the mind breaks.The game begins with a foreboding admonition. It’s a game about making the most of a bad situation, you’re told from the outset. Your actions are permanent, therefore the quests you embark upon will often end in failure. “Heroes will die,” it says. “And when they die they stay dead.” That's what is one of the most striking thing, how the rampant and merciless randomness always keeps one off balance, struggling to stay alive. It comes in both the usual accuracy percentages for various attacks and dodges, but also unexpected and unusual places - even the turn order is mixed up by behind-the-scenes dice rolls. So you’re never quite sure, for example, if your Vestal healer will be able to patch up your Crusader tank before the enemy can deal a killing blow, permanently removing that character and all his progress from your roster. By robbing you of the certainty and predictability you usually see in a turn-based tactics game of this nature, Darkest Dungeon creates tense and terrifying battles where you’re never sure what will happen next.Then there are quirks, which can positively or negatively impact a hero’s effectiveness in certain dungeons, or against certain enemies, or cause them to independently perform actions, including stealing any money you see in the case of Kleptomania, and each hero can have up to five positive and five negative traits. Keeping track of them all – your stable can hold up to 25 of them at once – is a big task.Consider Lovecraft. No, consider the anglerfish, that Lovecraftian nightmare of the deep with its sickly glowing lightbulb luring you in before the wretched face becomes visible. The tiny, melted eyes, the cruel underbite, and the thatch, not of hair, but of teeth. This is Darkest Dungeon, even before the fish people turn up and are troublingly untroubled by bleeding. This is a game that's horrid in a way that means that you can't look away, a game of exhaustion and luridness and of terrible things happening in an awful, awful place. In other words, it's just lovely.			"

												Pros: Polish and design.Fantastic artwork that usually makes you forget it's basically paper dolls. Sound design so good, you want to keep hitting things just to hear the results.Narration that's simply delicious. Both the wording and delivery are like red meat that's been cooked rare and is f#$%ing you skillfully, but hatefully, in the ears. I would pay that guy to narrate my bathroom breaks.The content is so creative. Basic themes... a mix of fantasy and Lovecraftian horror... but the execution just oozes flavor and originality. I mean, The Leper is a front-line tank, and he can survive a lot because... he's really been through some sh!t, you know? Every element of the game is like that. A idea that's been developed, polished, tweaked, and polished more.Challenging. Strategic. Unforgiving. Constant choices with real consequences. Do you eat extra food in camp so you're at your best for the boss fight? Or do you skimp and hope to survive, so you can hang around for longer to scavenge afterward? Such great gameplay design. I've been playing this game since it was in Early Access, and it was so good then... they've since made significant updates (corpses, new heroes, new areas, etc.) that added depth without complexity. You know those great game ideas that everyone has that end up being far too complex and unwieldy to be fun? This is the perfect example of a simple game where the designer built up complexity, piece by deliberate piece, adding features because they WORKED instead of just being fun ideas, and in the end the gameplay is both complex and has incredibly good flow.Cons: It's addictive. Is that a con? If you don't stretch yourself and try new things, the game can start to feel repetitive. This can be the player's fault, for playing conservatively, but sometimes the best strategic choice really is to do yet another easy run to the Ruins. Which naturally feels grindy after you've done 20 times already. Though... you can still try new team compositions to keep it interesting. Learning how abilities and heroes work together is a long curve. "

								This game is a occultist/RPG fan's dream. It takes all of the fun of dungeon crawls, combined with a dark, hopeless feel that is a constant as you watch adventurers you send into the depths either die or slowly decend into madness as time progresses. With constant game dynamics like light/food/constant money loss, you start to feel it is hopeless and feel the need to fight harder, or just stop caring what happens to those poor folks you send in to fix your relative's mistake. Well worth full price.			"

												Ignore the whiny negative reviews that complain about Early Access. They're a mix of people complaining that the game changed too much, or not enough, and that has no bearing on how good the game is as it exists right now.tldr; it is DAMN GOOD right now.I played it in Early Access, but I was waiting for the full release to really dive in because I knew anything less was not 100% representative of what the final product would play like. A lot of other Early Access players seem to be struggling with that concept.So, what makes it good, DAMN GOOD, FANTASTIC even? The answer is simple:You are rewarded for paying attention to detail. In my first serious attempt at playing this game I made it to my 28th dungeon run without a single person dying, and only 10 out of a possible 112 ever suffered mental breaks during dungeons. A lot of those mental breaks, and my single death, could have been avoided if I were a better player with a little more experience and a little less willingness to try to kill a super special (optional) boss monster the first time I ran into one.Why did my teams survive so frequently? I paid attention to what classes were good at and formed teams that complimented each others strengths and weaknesses. I made sure they all had the correct skills assigned, and upgraded to their highest possible ranks before entering dungeons. I did the same with their Blacksmith upgrades and always gave them the best Trinkets I could, since the game has a handy ""unequip all trinkets"" button that makes giving each expedition your strongest Trinkets a trivial task. I did visit the wiki to figure out which Curios were in each area, and what ""key"" items were used to get the best results from interactions, but this is something anyone can figure out and memorize just by playing the game. No, more than any amount of wiki information, making good decisions based on paying close attention to detail is what saved *almost* all of my people (RIP that Jester).Anyways the videos will show you what kind of game it is, which is a turn based RPG that deals with the stress of being an adventurer. It handles the topic of mental health far better thant any video game about killing mutant pigs I've ever seen, as well. Your heroes don't have a ""sanity"" meter and they never ""go insane"". They have a Stress meter and they become Fearful, Abusive, Irrational, etc... but also possibly HEROIC.The theme is eldtrich horror, which is all about Lovecraftian tentacle monsters, ultimately. The game doesn't give up all the goods up front, though, and you'll run into a number of nastier / more unnerving baddies the further you get.The art is beautiful, and its direction is consistent throughout the game. The UI is very easy to work with. The sounds and especially the music and the Narrator's voice acting are top notch and do a lot to immerse you.11/10			"

												Beware before you buy this game Darkest Dungeon. Now do not misunderstand I love this game, but this is not for the faint of heart. This game is made to screw you over, and put you in the most terrible of situations, it all depends on how you prepare for it. Half this game is about planning, what to bring for the mission. Beware at naming your characters friends and family, as you’ll get attached and they will sometimes die. I mean heck I do it and I felt like a horrible person if I had to dismiss them or they were gruesomely killed. As I rewrite this I felt I wrote it unfairly. So getting further into the game, I will admit this is one game. There can be some improvements to the items and the cost of some upgrades.  It’s a brilliant game and just be careful. This is a gold standard to early access games, an exemplar, of the formula working. I love this game, even if it is a abusive relationship. odd I know but heck I love hard games. Positives+ Innovative gameplay, each class puts different talents on the table. Want a finesse fencing fighter, that can dodge blows and critical like mad; but is also flexible? Get a Grave Robber. Want a character who can both tank and heal? Grab a Crusader. Etc+ Art is exquisite, it fits the lovecraftian dark theme of hopelessness of it all. It has some inspiration from X-com meets dark souls. It has a dark graphic novel esthetic. + Sound design is great. It really has the disparity of it all. + Battle is refined, its form following function with every piece and detail, there is a huge amount of strategy, and you are forced to try out new classes, strategize. It’s satisfying. Be prepared to think on the fly.+ It has a high risk high reward game play, the further you are on the edge, the higher the intensity. You get this adrenaline rush when you succeed and get the epic loot at the end   + That announcer, I swear when he says: Confidence surges as the enemy crumbles. Makes me just bloodthirsty when you crit. +It fits the dungeon theme right, they are terrifying, full of risks, and they are the dark secrets of the world. Those whom dare to explore them they will find great relics and wonders, but also the world’s greatest horrors. A dungeon is not a place to get free riches, they are a test of your perseverance and will. Negatives -    This Game is not fair, it will put you in the most horrible situations that are unwinnable-    A lot of your attacks is a roll of the dice, same as the enemies so they can one hit kill you. Combat can be just risky at times. -    Have no emotional attachments to your team, it will only lead up to disappointment -    Be prepared to restart the game a lot….A lot. Salt will be common here-    Later weeks will become impossibly hard I got to week 70 and everyone died. No money and I am screwed.-    Dodging is a farce, as there will be moves that cannot dodge even with high dodge-    The enemies will always get initiative before you, and will always go first and sometimes they will cheat and hit you twice even if you have more speed. Yes I looked my perks and none of them were slow draw. -    There will be plenty of B.S parts where even common enemies will one hit kill you, no deaths door where you have a chance to save them, nope, they die-    Money and treasures are fickle, at times you will get almost nothing at times for going through a dungeon where surviving is your treasure, along with your team to be mentally intact.-    Bosses have instant one hit kill team wipes, they cannot be interrupted. Bypasses all armor and causes max stress.-    Even if you come prepared, you will still get your butt handed to you -    Stress is B.S at times where having a great virtue when maxed out stress and getting a good virtue is rare. There are times where a hero will refuse to be healed, as negative perks when max stressed will always happen. He is about to die and just gives up, the team then gets maxed out stress and one of them gets a heart attack. -    Murphy’s Law, the game. What Can go wrong will go horribly wrong. -    Enemies level up with you to rookie to veteran and they will always have better stats then you, I know a challenge to one thing but I feel that this game spikes up from hey let’s start you easy, to punching you in the stomach and shoving your face in the mud telling you: Know your place human. This game is Bipolar like that "

												I can honestly say that this game is a lot of fun... at first at least. The real downfall for me is that your heroes plateau too soon. I won't say the game is too hard, I'll just say that there is too much variability in each expedition. The random factors in this game can make it so that the exact same team, same strategies, etc. can win easily or fail miserably in the hardest dungeons. By the time I got to the Darkest Dungeon, I realized that I'd reached the point of diminishing returns for entertainment value. I managed to collect all the trophies (from high tier bosses), but I didn't finish the Darkest Dungeon — and I won't finish the Darkest Dungeon, because once you get to the Darkest Dungeon it's just not fun anymore. (Sorry not sorry.)I complained a lot here, but I'll say that the game really stands out as something different. Heroes in this game are paper plates for the banquet, and you can't get attached to any of them, because I guarantee you any hero you use frequently will fall victim to a catastrophic critical at some point. If you like challenging games, look no further. I would recommend you look at some Darkest Dungeon rage videos on YouTube before you start playing this, because this is not for the ill-tempered.Long story short: Prepare to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.			"

												I am not a big fan of harsh games. Dark Souls, for instance, is nor my cup of tea. And I must confess that I was initially discouraged by some of the reviews, which pointed out that the game was difficult, unforgiving, and severely luck based. Despite that, I decided to give it a try, and so far I must say it is well worth it. It is a hard game, that is for sure. Your characters are always affected by some debuffs and afflictions, and it doesn't get any easier as you progress. I don't think there ir an error with the probabily calculations of attacks in the games. The fact is: the challenges are really hard. Sometimes uneven. It is hard to see a good and developed character die, but so far i haven't faced any situation where the death couldn't be understood by the battle situation. And it is wrong to say it is luck based. Of course, there is a chance aspect, as in any other game, and in real life as well. But there are several strategy element in the way you build your party for a quest, which is affected not only by their skill, but theri equipment, and even their positioning within the party. Having said that. I still think they could either tone down a little the difficulty, or at least tone up the rewards you get by completing quests.But it a good choice for ppl interested in a squad strategy game with some rpg elements.

								An extremely difficult and very challenging game, but I jcan't help but keep coming back for more. It's challenge adds to it's amazingly gloomy and dark atmosphere (which is furthered even more by the phenomnal narrator), which really sets the tone for the entire game. Every room cleared feels like a major victory, with the odds stacked against you. The combat system performs very well, and the amount of heroes and their abilities encourages you to try different combinations of them, with different parties suiting different playstyles and coming together very well. Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes turn based RPGs, and wants a good challenge, with a great atmospheric setting.			"

Pros:- Beautiful game. The art style, music and creepy narrator all add to a gripping and enjoyable experience- Lots of depth between the different character classes, enemy types, itemization and dungeons- Extremely satisfying to finally crush everything in the game when you're experienced enough to know howCons:- Way too much grind. People say the game takes 80 hours to finish and that's about right. At 20 hours you'll have mastered the basics, 40 seen almost everything there is to see, 60 you'll have mastered the game in it's entirety and you'll spend the last 20 getting enough characters to run the final dungeon several times. This could have easily been cut in half with some simple changes to how you gain gold and experience and the game would have benefited from it- Too much reliance on RNG for me. When you run into situations where you start a battle, all enemies take thier turn first, focus on your weakest guy, crit him for all his life and he dies before you get a turn it's kind of an issue.- Minor issues with certain mechanics like some a town building taking trinkets from you when others dont, making it much less useful. Some confusion between the both fixed number and percentage based stat system, sometimes it one, sometimes it's the other but either way isn't straightforward with the way they actually work.Rating: 4.5/5I'm giving Darkest Dungeon a near perfect rating because for a game from a small indie company this has been one of the better games I've played in a long time. Both the setting and learning curve give off a very Dark Souls or Bloodbourne vibe and that's very hard to achieve. First the game will build you up with some victories, then it'll punish you and kill your hard earned characters, then you'll learn what you did wrong and when you finally get that 'aha' moment of gameplay it's the best feeling in the world, very similar to how you play Dark Souls the first time. By the end of the game I was plowing through every enemy with any party combination and it was a great feeling to see how far I'd come from being scared to enter each room of an easy beginner dungeon.There's several things to learn in the game and almost all of it comes from trial and error. First there's a second type of health bar for each character called stress. Take too much stress damage and they start to go insane, ignoring your orders or giving up their turn completely. Take much more stress on top of that and they have a heart attack with a change to straight up die. Managing the balance between hp and stress is the first challenge. Then there's the different classes and their skills, how those classes interact with each other, itemization and how those work to boost your abilities, the dungeons themselves with the layouts and encounters they provide, enemy types and how they work together and then strategy on what you need to prioritize in order to not die horribly.DD isn't without it's issues however and the grind is probably one of the biggest for me. I could hardly believe people when they said the game takes around 80 hours to learn and complete. How can a game with not a lot of content take that long? Well several things hold you back and grinding for gold and experience is one. Every time you lose a high level character on a long run because you were inexperienced, greedy, stupid or RNG decided to screw you it can take 5-10 hours to level up and grind the gold for 1-4 new characters to get back to max level... Without the beautiful artwork, great music and creepy narrator I probably wouldn't have been able to see the game through to the end but those aspects pull the game up significantly. I'm a huge fan of the art direction and and the animations are always a joy to watch even after so many hours of playing. Overall Darkest Dungeon is an experience I think many people will be turned off from at first but is absolutely worth toughing out to the end. Much like Dark Souls (I know the comparison keeps coming up) it's a game that you need to dive head first into and endure the frustration to really begin to enjoy. Without a lot of word of mouth and 'trust me trust me you'll learn it' from friends I fear many people won't give this game a chance but I'll be that person now. Trust me, get your♥♥♥♥♥in the dungeon and don't come out until every malformed, slobbering, chittering monster is annihilated!			"

												Now that I'm just short of 40 hours played and taking on long champion runs, I wanted to give my own review. Note that I played the early access versions for less than an hour each time, mostly because I would immediately find a class, stack it, and blow through every encounter using the same ability over and over. That was indescribably boring.This version *appears* to not have any obvious single-class stacks in it, and corpses have taken care of a lot of the issues with overefficient AoE skills. So now that I felt like there was a game to play, I dove into it headfirst!Mechanically, the difficulty level follows a vague u-shape with a long tail. At the start, it feels hard. You gain a few upgrades, and it feels easy. Then you hit the next tier of dungeon, Veteran level, and the upgrades and trinkets feel woefully underpowered or too expensive to upgrade The risk-reward seems to favor the game, and I can see why it'd become discouraging if you are forced out of your comfort zone around the same time that the game can nearly instakill a character. This I suspect is the cause of most of the negative reviews, and it's a well-deserved criticism. There is a middle point where the hill is rather steep and you could lose 20+ hours of invested characters on a bad dice roll.However, do a little thinking. In the apprentice dungeons, you could simply win by sheer damage and tankiness. You would outlast and destroy the enemy. In the veteran dungeons, the enemy begins to outpace you. So you must change up your style.First, pick up some mitigation to go with your damage. Debuffs and stuns are critical for holding down the front line while you clear the backline. Find a character who is flexible across a shuffle and make sure to have at least a backup plan on your skill upgrades so that you don't spend two turns moving everyone back. Get a debuff to remove protection or pick up some heavy blight and bleed. Get camping skills to clean up stress, even just before you get back to town.And finally, maybe most important, stop going on short and medium missions. They pay you far less money than long missions and they are not significantly easier.Selecting the right camping skills allows you to refresh your party every time you use some firewood. This means that on a long mission, you're guaranteed two to three times as much fighting in the field, two to three times as much field treasure, and the size of the mission is not three times bigger. Long missions also have guaranteed secret rooms, so find ways to buff your scouting and bring a few keys.Want to clear bad quirks? Guess what, long high-level missions are more likely to have the curios that combine with provisions in order to kill negative quirks.To put it another way, if a long mission pays you another 2.5k for winning, that's like finding another trapezohedron just for playing on that mission that week. And if you have to abandon, you've spent a lot more time playing and will be leaving with far more goodies in your pocket.Finally, 1.5k gold is worth less than 6 deeds in the early game. Stop ditching heirlooms for gold. Take longer missions, make up your gold with the quest rewards, and pick up all the heirlooms you can find until your buildings are fully upgraded. Every building upgrade is more money in your pocket in future weeks.Once you start setting up combos in your trinkets, combos in your party, building in flexibility and playing to the innate efficiency of longer missions, you'll start to crush your way out of the difficulty hump mid-game. Not to say that it becomes easy. You'll still face the risk of RNG death. But at least you'll always have the resources to recover and push onward towards bigger challenges yet.Thus, having come to terms with what Darkest Dungeon is like, I get why some people were unhappy with the random unfairness, but I feel it's all perfectly conquerable. My guess is that it'll take me another 20 hours minimum to approach beating the game the first time, and that I'll be far more efficient with my time on the second run.If you have a mind for this kind of thing, Darkest Dungeon will be a ton of fun. It's tense, you have to gamble a lot, and you'll probably have some serious setbacks to overcome.On the flipside, it will take a ton of time to finish, most people won't even reach a veteran mission (let alone a champion mission), and a failure could be very frustrating, making the recovery feel like a grind instead of a game. If you want something to sit down and play casually, this might not be your cup of tea.Last caveat. If you're EXTREMELY good at this kind of game, DD will certainly have cracks in the design, and you'll abuse them and suck the fun out of your experience. I haven't found one yet, but I'm sure they're out there. For this rare class of player, there are more technical, in-depth games.All that said, yes, it's a great game, I'm having a blast, and I recommend it.			"

												It feels good to have a game to really challenge you but at the same time have so many possible choices that you're not limited to a meta. There is a lot of trial and error to it, but it's a lot of good fun once you start to figure out how to finally rip all of the skeletons and Eldritch horrors apart instead of the other way around.The art style and overall mood of the game is fantastic too if you're into that Tim Burtinesque spooky vibe. Even made by the same folks (Klei) who put Don't Starve together, and that one was also well worth the hours spent until my character was slain.If you're an RPG fan, love a good challenge, and want to crawl some dungeons. Pick this up. Lots of cool bosses to try, tons of class combinations and skills to fine tune your party, and the narrator has a morbid, tongue-in-cheek way of pulling you into the world.			"

												Overall I enjoyed and recommend this game.  In my opinion its later levels are too dominated by randomness and grinding, and with the stakes as high as they are (permanent loss of characters and items that took immense time investment to get that far), that randomness starts to feel very cheap and oppressive.  That turns into tedious play, and the game stops being as fun in the end.There are ways to play that help to mitigate the RNG threat, but you'll never be free from bad rolls of the dice totally hosing your progress.  This is the disadvantage of a game like this -- the main (and most tempting) tool for upping the difficulty is easily overused.  I suspect this is a game I will never finish, simply because I cannot dedicate the time to it, and because tedium isn't fun.  I've been playing champion dungeons for about 10+ hours now, and I'm kinda tired of it.  Further, I'm told the final dungeon has even more tricks to artificially lengthen the game and force you to grind even more.  I'm just not up for that.  :(Don't get me wrong... The game can be grindy or infuriating at times, but overall it's been a fantastic experience.  That's why it gets a thumbs-up from me.  The experience falls apart in later levels and I'm disappointed by that, but I've had enough fun with the game that I cannot justify down-voting it just because of a poor end game.  The theme and mechanics treated me *very* well through most of the game, and it delivers fantastically before the RNG and grindy issues start to really hurt.Unless you're a completionist who would feel very uncomfortable walking away from the game before the end, then I greatly recommend this game.  Up until the end stages, it's hard in a fair and reasonable way, and you feel very smart when you figure out ways to mitigate the threats and have mostly successful runs.  The severe penalty of failure only sweetens success.  There are ways to make forward progress in the late game, but they're too slow for me and I've moved on to other games; please see other reviews' coverage of that content.Pros:-Fantastic Theme and Presentation.  This kept me coming back even when I was frustrated.-Very Interesting and Fun Mechanics.  Again, I kept coming back because the design is compelling, and I wanted to try out new ideas and strategies (which you can do easily in early levels).-I sank lots of hours into this game and don't regret themCons:-Steep Learning Curve.  Game does very little to teach you, and expects you to learn by doing.  This is pretty harsh given the sharp penalties of failure, though you can always recover (early game is pretty easy to bounce back).  But it can be difficult to learn the system without getting your rear handed to you an awful lot until it's discouraging.  I recommend checking the guides & wiki from time to time, if not often.  (and some guides are very out of date, so be careful)-Late game is dominated by grinding and randomness, and it's difficult & tedious to minimize those issues.  You're stuck playing a certain ""correct"" way, and it quickly becomes tiresome and unrewarding.-I'll probably never finish this game, and at this point I'm okay with that.  With my time so limited, I have to know when to call it quits.Overall: Good.  I recommend you pick it up.			"

Early Access Review
								I started playing Darkest Dungeon without knowing how it was balanced and designed on release.A few reviews for this game relate to the changes that have been made over time and the state it now is in.There seem to be many complaints about the fun factor having changed and the game beeing unfair and frustrating. Well I had now a good 30 hours of fun with the game. So far it demanded a lot from me in terms of:1. Ressource Management2. Party Setup3. Battle tactics4. My own greed and will to finish a run1. Ressource ManagementMoney is short and at best I accumulated 20000 Gold. I had to get inventive with my party setup and made sure I healed as much stress as even possible with the jester, houndmaster, crusader or via camp before leaving the quest. I had to pass on healing quirks which were either not relevant to be healed (like ranged malus on a pure melee character) or not that grave. 2. Party SetupBefor every run I spend about 5 to 10 minutes deciding which item i take along and which characters will do the job. Taking to account which enemies I will encounter and what my battle tactics will be for this run. There are tons of nice combinations and some that are just not a good option :D 3. Battle tacticsGoes hand in hand with the Setup. Once you are in battle and your party is for example not equiped with a stress healer like the hound master or jester you put hard focus on any enemy that inflicts pure stress damage. 4. My own greedIs key...Letting low level characters die in a dungeon is not a big deal and pushin forward is only rewarding. But well trained and equipped characters.. when all vanquished.. is just the worst.Summa summarum:The game is super fun. Good atmosphere. Graphics do their job and fit the game and the narrator is just epic. At some point I wished for even more variation in the narration just because you heard it all at some point but nevertheless genius.I recommend this game to:- Indie and Fantasy-RPG genre game fans- Round-based, dungeon crawling and Build-up simulation gametype fans- People with a taste for uncommon audio and visual settingAfter all everyone will make his/her own experience with the game and this is just a very very small view into how I experienced the game.

								It feels like a completed game and not at all like something in Early Access, which isn't as good as it might sound. It plays and feels like a flash game on the website of a developer making an AAA title. As if any minute it will skip to the website or show ""Loading done"" and launch the real game. It has lots of good ideas but remove the random generated areas and very little is left. Enough for a flash or tablet game, but far from what one would expect when buying a PC game, no matter the price.If you want to support a developer that does something different, then this might be a good pick. For someone like me that dislike flash games, tablet/phone games etc. it is just not worth the money unless they add 90 % more than is in so far (unlikely).			"

												This is exactly what I look for in a rouge light. It is brutally difficult, with many factors to consider. Sometimes things will come down to the roll of a die. However, the game is ultimately dependent on your skill. If you enjoy gothic aesthetics, RPG Mechanics, and games such as FTL and Risk of Rain. I would highly recomend this game.This game is the promise that so many RPGs fail to keep. Deep, engaging, and highly atmospheric. The Spatering of classic gothic and Lovecraftian horror are used to superb effect. Any one who has a heart for hard core analytical games will enjoy it.			"

												The atmosphere and art style is great. The gameplay is also fun. It's not a bad game. The problem is I'm 13 hours in and I've had enough because I know what to expect from the game. I found out online that you can't just use one party in the Darkest Dungeon. Once a party has cleared one level they'll refuse to ever go back. This means that you have to level up multiple parties to the highest levels. That's completely killed any desire I have to play the game. That's grinding for grinding sake. To me that's absolutely disrespecting my time as a player. I'm more than happy for the game to brutalise my party and kill of my favourite character unfairly,, I love the fact the heroes are disposable pawns, I can even tolerate how bad luck can destory a party. That's fun. But no game like this will ever endear me by arbitrarily deciding I can't use my party 'just because'. I'll happily lose a party I've built but I'm far from impressed the game just decides I can't use them. It's not challenging, it's not fun and it's designed to make me take longer to complete the game; screw that, especially in a game where bad luck can wipe out a party.If the idea of levelling up 3-4 parties doesn't bother you then I reccomend it. What I have played was a lot of fun but finding out the game just makes a party useless in such an arbitary fashion leading me to have to grind more has just killed any desire I have to play it. To me it's a deal breaker.			"

								Pros:announcer is pretty awesomecurrencies aren't too difficult to understandgood class variationart is fantasticCons:I felt constrained for play style.incredibly unforgiving.If you don't look up strategy guides on bosses, expect to lose many many many charactors, and a ton of your time.everything requires crests to upgrade, but the other currencies are just as common and far less useful.Overall, I enjoyed many parts of this game, but I don't feel like I have much choice with team composition, and boss fighting styles. It's a huge time dump. If you're in highschool maybe you have the insane amount of time you need to progress reasonably fast in this game, but i'd rather not get stressed out about losing 4 chars i spent several hours building in one turn of a fight.

												This is more of a review of my general impressions. I'll leave all the details for guides or other reviewers. I was on the fence about this game for a long time, and finally decided to take a risk... it paid off! I really enjoy it! 10 hrs of gameplay as I write this, and one or two characters are level 3.Dungeons that remind me of adventuring when I played Dungeons & Dragons. Grim and difficult, and you usually left with a handful of hitpoints, but bags of treasure.A game that has economy of gold that isn't too difficult to manage for a penny-pincher, but an economy of Stress that makes you second guess if you should send some of your heroes back into the fight so quickly.The recruit aspect of the game feels a bit like XCOM, or Ogre Battle. I think building your teams is half the fun in games like this, and it's not too complicated.Leveling them feels a bit like Final Fantasy Tactics, actually. Rotating who gets to fight, and who doesn't, to build them all over time. But the combat works more like a classic RPG turn-based game.I've been waiting for a game that had this style of combat, but didn't look like it was made with RPG Maker.			"

												I won't go in details what Darkest dungeon is - if you are on this page, you already know about it. So:Do you like being punished? Do you like suffering? Soon you will either will love it like half of your heroes or you will go mad like the other half. Darkest Dungeon to me feels the same like the old times when I played World of Warcraft with my casual guild:1) You prepare for a hard dungeon/raid2) You think you are ready3) You storm it!Just to find our you were not prepared - you haven't bought enough food or torches, or bandages, you did not play out the best of your squad, you mis-clicked as you were already pretty frustrated with overwhelming (bad) outcome of battle or the RNG just hates you.Darkest dungeon is the turn-based Demon/Dark souls for the tactics lovers, who prefer thinking over reflexes but equally enjoy being spanked and shown how misarable things could get. It is risk vs. reward and it is a damn guilty plesure.So - what could you expect? - Suffering, losing your upgraded heroes who were just finishing the quest? Yes! But add to that amazing graphic style, witty narrator, 'Lovecraftian' feel of evil and tons of fun.Highly recommended!			"

												I cannot recommend this game to you unless you meet a very small criteria of type of people.The other negative reviews hammer home the points. Certain classes are just better and the changes made over time with this game have not made it so those classes are stronger, at best, the strong classes became weaker or were changed in ways to make them weaker. When I first bought this game, I would take random parties for no light dungeon runs in order to make some quick cash for my main party to be able to afford some upgrades or be able to afford to prepare for a dungeon after buying a very good trinket. I came back to the game just today and have played for a few hours. I attempted what I did before with a little mix and match. It did not go well and not in an RNG sort of way. The party was just not effective and I abandoned the quest and them pretty quickly. Thus I was able to get back to my good party who was getting through dungeons with only minor problems and the occasional amount of stress reaching a moderate level where I would need to go to an off team to deal with the stress. The problem here is that it creates an absolute issue with regards to the classes. There are classes that are good and there are classes that are not. If you take the wrong classes, the game is hard. If you take the right classes, the game is not hard. Now I will say that the art, sound, and music are all top notch. They have been from the beginning. The story is Lovecraftian Horror, so think depressing. If you don't like the idea of a cosmic horror that is going to win no matter what and we are just delaying the inevitable. Do not play this game.Personally for me, I used to have fun experimenting with different parties and seeing whether they could scrape by while doing something that no sane real adventurers would do. That's not possible anymore and the design decisions all led here. I once told myself I wouldn't buy early access games anymore and this game reinforces that decision. Until I see the final product, I do not plan on buying most games.TL:DR This game might be for you if you like a game where there is one way to win and you like Lovecraftian Horror with a touch of RNG.

								My experience in the game so far: A Vestal (Nun), a Plague Doctor, a Leper and a Crusader embarked on a merry adventure, only to find ghouls that stresses them out and treasures that worth jack-sh**t. So the Vestal got too much stress and decided to be focused. Everyone got pumped and rekt everything until the Leper became abusive; with the Abusive Leper, the Plague Doctor cracked and became masochistic. The Crusader once a mighty unmovable figure became helpless due to the Plague Doctor's masochistic fantasies and the Abusive Leper's poets. So the party now consists of a very annoyed and focused Vestal, a masochistic Plague Doctor who wanted to take on ghouls and undead with her bottles, an abusive Leper who can't stfu and a Crusader who refuse to lift his sword up because he hates himself. Had lots of fun playing it though.			"

								While and interesting concept, the random number generator in this game is random to the point of frustration. One playthrough can be a breaze thanks to repeated critical hits and lucky finds while the next can have a single debuffed hound reduce a full party from 75% health each to deaths door as they miss eight times in a row. Mnay of the stress mechanics are simply out of whack and don't look like they're going to change. I've also had instances where my light level drops, I strike another torch, and it promtly drops again. I don't even know how the game calculates torch duration but it does not feel consistant whatever the method.			"

												I've been playing this game not too long since the early access came out and have loved every minute of it. Building your town, your team, your collection is all so rewarding and you start to care about the characters you bring in. Losing one hurts and you'll sit there, shaking your head, upset that one of your best has just fallen, but then you get angry, take your next group, and rip the dungeon apart in an attempt to exact revenge. The stress mechanic is great, it keeps you on your toes to watch out for the well being of your team in fear that their mental stability will cost the team a critical move, or end up dying from a heart attack! Each dungeon has its own style and tricks, with certain enemies only appearing there. Including the enemies, each dungeon has a unique boss, each with their own arsenal of attacks and hidden tricks.Dark, creepy, with an art style that is amazing and a soundtrack that will cause goosebumps, this is something to get if you like a challenge. There is the option to turn off some of the aspects that make the game whole (if you find things too challenging), but I ask that you don't. Red Hook has provided an amazing game and it should be played the way they intended it to.  "

												This game is really fun to play, even when you are learning and absorbing the mechanics. It's challenging, but fair, as once you figure out the classes and their associated mechanics, you can learn how to deal with the challenge better. The art style is beautful, and the narrator's voice is fantastic. The game creates a gloomy yet awesome atmosphere, and never stops being fun. I always find myself thinking, ""...just one more dungeon and then I'm done...""Due to the randomness, the depth and variety of classes, and the depth and variety of the RPG mechanics this game has massive replay value. This is worth your money. The developers of this game should get your money so they keep improving this game and making more.If you don't like challenging games, or play AAA titles on the easiest difficulty setting just for the story, or feel this compulsive need to click on everything then I do not recommend this game for you. However, it is not as hard and tedious as some people like to say.However, you should try it and make up your own mind.			"

												Don't buy darkest dungeon if you can't handle stress. Don't. I am more tense than a bow's string when I play this game.If you can handle stress and you like RPGs, don't even think and buy it.Good gameplay with multiple heroes and team combinations, and although it is hard at times, it is also very rewarding when you get the hang of it. Beginning a game is quite difficult for new players, but don't be discouraged!The ambience is amazing. The music and noises are good and help immerse you in the darkness, and the narrator comments many things in the game - even if I know his quotes all by heart I never tire of listening to them. Maybe because I love this game.I bought it as soon as it was available and many improvements and changes were made since then, the devs are still doing a great job and will continue.In a word: an RPG you shouldn't miss -if you can handle stress and challenges that is.

								There's hard and there's frustrating.  Darkest Dungeon gives the illusion of difficulty while actually being frustrating and rigged.  The concept for the game is top notch.  A Cthulhu-madness-Dungeon-And-Dragons crossover!  The execution; however, will leave you wanting a refund of both your money and time.  There are three enormous issues that the gameplay can not overcome.  First, corpses.  Google it.  Incredibly poor game design.  Second, the weakness of each character's will makes their death a sigh of relief.  When your Brothel-diving-table-cheating-irrational-rabid Grave Robber finally kicks the bucket you're going to cheer... a lot.  Don't waste your hard earned money on a title that you want to hate to love but end up just hating.			"

								I'll be honest I am not really a fan of hard games, sometimes I like a good challengeI love Dark souls and XCOM for instance but I have never been a fan of roguelikes, I keep trying them but they never stick,I saw (and heard) Darkest Dungeon (DD for short) and instantly fell in love, the character art has so much charm and my god the narrator and his script is excellent, the Cthullu dungeon setting is really cool and the misfit murder hobo heroes are fun,it really does have a ton of character.Sadly this game suffers from the strong vision of its creators, they wanna make a game true to the Cthullu mythosand that means, everybody is gonna go insane and die and well they kinda nailed it.A lot is said about the pro's and con's of RNG in games and in something like XCOM it's not so bad because you can stack things in your favor with strategy and careful play, DD doesn't really let you do thatall the planning in the world wont stop your whole team getting wiped out in single turn.and before I am told I suck and my opinion is dismissed, this did not happen to me for a fair whilemy graveyard was empty (though corpses and heart attacks went of right away, ♥♥♥♥ corpses are dumb) (even surviving an encounter with the Hag boss and finding that my team composition was totally unable to harm her, which felt like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me, I should be able to use the combinations I enjoy) right up until today when I first entered the cove I sent my strongest team on the apprentice lvl 0 mission, the first fight was a lil rough but nothing too bad, but the second fight, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the second fightI quickly suffered my first casualty and things are looking real bad, then an enemy exploded and put my whole team at deaths door facing enemies with 100% damage buffs,I ran and thats when I realised I did not have any bloody moneyand the meager progress I had made (I never felt like I was making much progress while playing, despite building what I thought were some strong heroes) seemed pretty much goneI think this game needs a difficulty selectan easy mode where you can actually feel like you are making progress and doing well.A normal mode which can be their original vision, untainted.And finally a super hard nightmare mode for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who always say every game is too easy and they 100% it on the hardest difficulty in one day because its so pathetically easy (I don't know why these people even play games, they never seem to enjoy them)Also I will say that the art was actually kind of a let down, the opening intro is so freaking amazing but honestly most of the enviroments and the enemies are pretty lame, mushroom people, pig people, skeletons, fish people and just plain old people, a few designs aside they are mostly kinda dull and not very scary at all, I had expected more to be honest.TL:DR I wanted to like this game but I never actually had any fun, even while winning.

Early Access Review
tl;dr -> My main character got stressed out and nearly had a heart attack, so I put him in the tavern to relieve some stress. Now he's a chronic gambler and refuses to leave. 11/10 realistic vice simulator.Normally, I have a rule not to review early access titles until they have been officially released as a finished product, but I decided to make an exception for Darkest Dungeon (DD) because of the great feedback the game (and developers) have received. I received a review copy and was extremely interested to try DD because I love dungeon crawling and rogue-likes, and the title had already received massive acclaim for being true to both genres.The aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the character models and environment is very high. Each character's skills are flashy and cool to see. The sound effects and music are great at maintaining a dark, intense vibe - enhancing the rogue-like atmosphere and reminding you that you can die (forever!) at any moment. The story is unfinished, but what currently exists is fairly basic - you must travel through different dungeons, eventually reaching the main one. Many have tried, many more have failed. You will also fail. Many times.Controls are easy to learn and the tutorial helps explain every mechanic in the game. The learning curve is moderate to extreme depending on your experience with rogue-likes and turn-based strategy. The developers have done an exemplary job of communicating with the gaming community, going as far as adding an option to remove a newer feature - corpses (killing enemies would leave behind a corpse that had to first be destroyed before the lineup of enemies moves forward - many people found this annoying) and heart attacks (your characters could instantly die if their stress reached high levels). The tutorial is good at getting you ready for the madness that is the Darkest Dungeon. There are a lot of mechanics to keep up with (in particular, player stress), but there are always tooltips for everything, be it while you are inside or outside of combat. Furthermore, new elements - usually reflected by new buildings being available in your main camp - are introduced slowly, so you have time to get used to things before a new feature is added. The most challenging parts of DD will be managing your party stress and maintaining a balanced party structure (ex: you don't want to go into battle with 4 healers lacking any offensive abilities).Gameplay consists of you traversing through a dungeon, exploring rooms and the passageways between them. You must complete a main mission - like exploring 90% of the rooms or completing 90% of the room battles - before you can receive a reward and leave the dungeon. If you retreat early, your party will accumulate significant stress. Stress can be disastrous, as it will sometimes cause heart attacks (if the feature is turned on) and can cause people to panic (granting either a buff/debuff for the duration of the dungeon).Combat is intense and can be very, very challenging. Replayability is high because you can construct your 4-member party from a large pool of characters, randomized whenever you return to the main hub. You can build a roster, which is highly advised because you need to alternate between healing/recovering stress party members - this takes a game day (or longer) - and using them in battle. Perks and disabilities can become extremely annoying, as these are also randomized, and debilitating conditions (ex: kleptomania will cause a character to sometimes open items and keep them - preventing the items from going into your inventory) can only be removed if you spend a considerable amount of gold.During battle, you will take turns attacking your opponent, healing/buffing your allies, or using items. One of my favorite characters can transform into a werewolf, but it will cause stress to the other party members. If a party member reaches 0, they are downed and can be revived by others, however, if they are continually attacked, they will permanently die.Overall, the gameplay is rapid, unforgiving, and a lot of fun. I must admit, for an early access project, there is a lot of content to enjoy even if you were to buy DD as is (with no future updates). If you are a lover of rogue-likes, dungeon crawling, and turn-based strategy, then you must try this game.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue ReviewsMy Website[theroguereviews.com] "

								This game is awesome, IF- you like the art style- you like a grindy playstyle- you like atmospheric games (which it is, although the story itself is a bit lacking imho)- you can tolerate losing your favourite characters to really bad luck- you really do need to be able to take a punch now and then. The game is the most unforgiving one of this kind I've ever played. (My personal coping strategy is to not play the game for too long in one run, because it sometimes feels VERY unfair if you lose 2 or 3 of your better/more liked characters in one run.)The game is working fine for me, and I guess I'm gonna be sinking a lot more hours into it.

Early Access Review
								For an Early Access game, Darkest Dungeon is incredibly well polished. It has an excellent introduction and narration and is very atmospheric. Some of the UI could use improvements, and it has the potential to turn into a grind fest, but over all I am very impressed.The basic premise is that you are traveling to reclaim your family manner which is overrun by monsters after your relative opened a gate to hell. As you travel through the randomly generated maps you need to manage your party's health, sanity, light and equipment.As your party succumbs to the darkness they may develop various quirks which means you may not even be able to trust your own team. You will die. You will die A LOT. Its OK, there are always more adventurer’s waiting.Mechanically the game is simple, walk from room to room dealing with traps, looting objects, and fighting. Combat is turn based and you have a handful of actions to chose from. These actions depend on where you are located in the party line as well as where your opponents are making it fairly dynamic. Also, you can retreat at any time, but it comes with a price - stress. Too much stress can make your character’s unplayable until they take time and money to recover in town.I look forward to seeing what comes next, especially if they maintain this level of quality. "

								Everything in this games oozes originality. And that says a lot for a turn based RPG. A lot of element of a lot of different style is in there. I'd describe the games has. A horror survival rogue-like turn based management RPG. And all those element are already well made even in early access. Just keep in mind that. You WILL lose some heroes. Even a lot if you're not cautious. You are not gonna be able to exit victorious in all your dungeon attemps. Sometimes you will have to flee after the first battle. But if you manage your heroes well you will eventually find that the game is getting easier. There's updates every other week or so. And the devs are really listening to the community. Fixes and content are added at a fair pace and the game is definetly playable even if two stages are still under construction.Be aware... Every decision you take is final. No loading no backtracking. If you keep fighting with you favorite hero under   1/4 of is life or over 3/4 of is sanity.. You might lose him/her. If you go unprepared in dungeons you might not make it to the first room. And if you think this game is easy you're gonna cry your mom and probably go back to candy crush with a severe depression. But do i recommend it ? HELL YEAH more than any game on steam right now.9/10			"

								Well played bit (>20 hours) this out of curiosity back in February at friends place and liked it, with 1-2 healers the starting level heroes were doable.Waited for a sale or release after that, now saw it at -25% and took it, saw that they added new classes, cool. Went in for a spin and also found out that there's heart attack at the end 2nd stress bar and it's not chance based like Death's Door. Not cool. Like really, at least make it chance based so you can gamble on it and try to finish the combat/mission or bail it.With 1-2 healers the dungeons were doable with starter chars, with the limited rng in the types of new recruits but with the heart attack chance, what I quickly tested, they will force me to fail a mission more than I can finish them at the ratio of 1:4 if I want to keep even half the chars alive from a mission.Not really funny with the limited pool of recruits. No really interest in updating their skills or gears if I can be sure they can't even last 2nd dungeon if they go in with even little stress leftover. Early Access is early and this was and is the one game I'm actually rooting for but as things stand now, very, very rocky rng start for each play is a big thing for now. Here's to the hope they really try to balance the heart attack mechanic and make it even gamblingly viable to do a dungeon without 2nd healer.OR reduce the stress incurred by aoe damage since +5 or something like that 'Stress Recovery' from single target skill from single char means nothing when you incur 5-20 stress every round and aoe/crits make it just that much more worse. Healer's barely keep up with the damage and now you except the chars to keep up with the stress mitigation WHILE also thinning the enemy numbers at the same time? Pfft.Stress is something you shouldn't be able to wipe clean 24/7 but it should at least be manageable and something you could gamble little on it, instead of nuh nah nope bruh, you ded, mission failed 5+ times in row.TL;DR Recommend but those on the fence, DON'T go for early access, wait for release and hope they balance this one out.

												Nearly unplayable due to how infuriating it actually is for such little reward. Artwork is incredible and the game is addicting, but it is over simplified and unforgiving in no good way. Let me add that I have attempted several dungeons over 29 weeks (in game) and there is nearly no way to gain purchase or progress. Basically the game is a meat grinder that holds little in the way of progress or intriguing storyline other than that of a Lovecraftian parable. It would be more interesting if it held greater depth of creation and a better method of gathering money and maybe side businesses or something? It is addicting granted, but I wish there was more...			"

								The game plays itself, you don't control much.  Too many odds are against you.  The enemies don't have stress markers themselves, they don't cut and run, they just continue on their programed way...attacking.  You can have all 4 characters with close to full life standing against one lone archer and your stress levels still rise - characters saying they can't go on anymore, etc...it's ridiculous.  Any consumeables you don't use on a mission, vanish from your inventory.  Speaking of inventory, If you want 10 torches, that's 10 times you have to drag and drop - awesome!  I know lets make the characters babble through a conflict, you not being able to do anything why they babble, only sit in front of a monitor watching the program do it's thing...I think I'd rather be playing a game.

								Great game but i'll reccomend it when stress becomes more manageable. Right now it's very overwheming and the game feels more like a resource/staff managment game than an rpg. spending more time trying to inefectivly lessen stress and disorders than actualy making strides on the game.11/30/15 updateThought i'dpick this game back up and see if the devs actally listened. Turns outeverything is still the same, stress is still absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. What I mean is that an enemy can do 25+ stress in one attack repeatecly while you can only hope to land a random hit that gives you a measily 1-3 hope. It litterally kills this game. You can't go in a dungeon without your ""heroes"" panicking not even half wayin which case you to lose control of everyone so at that point your only input is to watch and move left and right. This game sucks and i'm glad its always on sale.(curator) ""Stress system is uinque, fun, and worth exploring.""< who the hell paid you to say this.BTW the community for this game is insanely TOXIC.

												This game. This game is wonderous. It embraces its Lovecraftian heritage while also being a phenomnally crafted game. The art direction is bleak, yet it has a beauty to it. Yet that same bleakness also leads to some truly demented monster designs, designs that echo the sort of unspeakable horrors that Lovecraft spoke of. The light and stress mechanics weave together in a truly phenomanal fashion. This game, more then any other RPG I know, makes risks and rewards so damn satisfying. To give one of the best examples in the game, take the Shambler fights. Shamblers are rare, very monsterous enemies that can be summoned at Shambler Alters that you may encounter on your journey. If you place a torch on the Altar, the Shambler will appear. You enter pich-black conditions (monsters hit harder, cause more stress, but also player crits are more common) and your party will always be suprised, which throws the EXTREMLY important party order into a shuffle. These factors, combined with the Shambler's attacks, mean that you can be in a very dangerous position. But the payout for killing a Shambler is well worth the risk, as killing a Shambler gets you an Ancestral Trinket, easily the most powerful trinkets in the game. Thus do risk and reward entertwine to provide riches, or disaster, on every outing into the dungeons.The enemies are vicous, the dungeons are vast and filled with peril and glory. The bosses bring challenge to those worthy enough to face them, and both legendary glory and unspeakable evil await. So....will you heed the call... of the Darkest Dungeon? "

												Do you know Murphy? Well this is his game. If something can go wrong, it eventually will. The question is are you prepared enough to handle that eventuality?Darkest Dungeon is a game that follows the HP Lovecraft theme and it has the writing, voice acting and art style to match it perfectly. You will have to work with the abilities (and disabilities) of the heroes you recruit in order to build a strong enough army of adventureres to conquer the Darkest Dungeon.A lot people will say that the game has too much RNG, but the truth is the game has a lot of tactical and practical decision-making that is required for you to safely bring your band of heroes through each dungeon with minimal casualties and stress. This is not a game where you were meant to win by default just because youu have higher stats. If you want to win, you're going to have to put some thought into your actions and decisions and that might include retreating and abandoning a dungeon run before you lose your most powerful party.I can't relate to those who have a hard time with the game. I did my homework and haven't had a single death in my first 135 weeks of play and I've been having fun making calculated risks to see what I could get away with without sacrificing any heroes. As of writing this I'm preparing my teams to go into the final dungeon. For better or for worse, I know I'm going to have a lot of fun throwing my legendary heroes into the maw of this final challenge.Get the game... and see you in Hell.			"

								This game will probably be fun for you for the first 40 or so hours, but after that, it just gets very repetitive.   Effective strategies that clever players devise for success are ultimately nerfed in the patches.  To me, the pleasure of a game is figuring out strategies to overcome challenging situations, rather than relying on luck from a random number generator.  Even with the nerfs to your characters and the power boosts to the enemies, the game is still manageable and is not nearly as difficult as you might be lead to believe based on the reviews of other gamers on here.  However, the game gets boring because of the lack of customization for the characters.  There aren't any special armors or weapons to find.  You simply have generic upgrades, so when going on your quests/missions, there isn't really anything too exciting that you will ever find.  It just the the same old gold, and items that help you unlock generic upgrades.  There are ""trinkets,"" but these are nothing to write home about, and are also generic.  You will get multiple copies of the same useless trinkets.   The bosses can be cool, but it seems like the developers got lazy.  Rather than making new bosses, they just re-used the old bosses, but made them tougher.  So you have to fight necromancer level 1, level 2, and level 3.  This just adds to the lack of excitement.  I guess I get a certain level of satisfaction successfully going through this game while having only minimal causalties when I read how so many others are frustrated and can't seem to figure how to achieve consistent success.  However, this minor joy is not enough to keep me coming back for more.In summary, the game a lot more content (far more than it will ever have) in order for this game to be noteworthy.  Will you enjoy the game for the first 40 hours or so?  Probably.  Then you will realize that you are tired of going through the same process over and over again without any hope of a unique reward.  I am hopeful that someone out there will create a mod which makes the game a lot better.			"

Early Access Review
								I started playing DD on this last patch and I for one like the game. I cannot recommend it unfortunately. Echoing many of the other reviews that have been written recently, DD has a myriad of wonderful features, including excellent voice acting and mechanical rpg enhancements, the concept of stress, the artwork, and the music all serve to make Darkest Dungeon a joy to play to a point. That point is reached fairly quickly in the game due to the compounding effects of stress and the costs to combat stress and improve your crew. None of the provisions like torches and food you purchase for a given expedition that you don't use are lost upon return. Oversupply yourself and you lose a significant amount of coin. Underprovision yourself and you risk failing the expedition and really getting behind on your coffers. With the high costs of stress reduction and improvement opportunities, and expedition costs, I am starting to see a challenge in making any progress to the higher levels in this game. Recruiting newer characters that are too weak to explore your only choice of dungeons and being unable to use your higher level characters much due to the effects of stress or the many negative quirks they aquire that cost too much to remove means you end up playing only the very beginning portions of a given dungeon and make barely any progress.Bottom line, a really great game ruined by too high of a challenge level. You will find yourself getting frustrated playing it now so I would wait until another patch comes through that addresses the difficulty issues.			"

								On a positive note, I love the concept of this game, I like the art, the rogue-like elements, and in large part the execution is fantastic. It hooks you in with the progression of the town and your heroes and I genuinely felt excitement and nervousness at attempting a quest because you never know whats going to happen!Now on the more neutral side of things, but ultimately the downfall of the game, is the difficulty, which is ridiculously hard... and believe me when I say I enjoy really hard games.It took me about 2 dead heroes and 4 failed attempts at runs before I even finished my first run at the first basic quest. While I personally didn't mind this, I don't think this is a good way to bring new players into the game and it is going to turn a lot of people away very quickly.Despite the tough learning curve I began to piece together how things worked, I began developing my town and upgrading and recruiting a variety of heroes to put strategic compositions together to take town tough quests.It felt good.I was absolutely loving it... then, I attempted the Wisened Hag quest for the first time... with obviously no idea of what she did or what I needed to prepare for. Fortunately, everything was going swimmingly. I breezed my way through the dungeon and headed into the boss room on full health with practically no stress... Perfect!At which point, the boss randomly captured and reordered my units, with basically no way to stop it because they were all permanently moved into the one position they could not attack. If I tried to move one into the position it needed to be in, she just moved it back. So I completely helplessly lost my 4 best heroes at once, with no way to retreat or counter what was happening...Frustrating... to say the least.Don't get me wrong, I understand you're going to lose heroes, it's part of the game. And, as bad as it was, that wasn't the real issue.The zero option and severity of that fight just felt hollow. I could have done nothing about what happened because I had no idea what I was in for, I just clicked that button to enter the room and lost everything.But the really aggravating and ultimately insurmountable problem was that I now had nothing. No money, and therefore zero way to buy provisions for another quest; or de-stress heroes; or upgrade heroes; or in fact actually attempt to get back into the game at all.That was it: 9-10 hours of gameplay down the toilet.So lesson learnt, I suppose? All I need to do now is make sure I keep a buffer of gold in case things go bad right?Sure, but  do I want to start over and build my town up from scratch?Nope, do I heck. I'm done. I had a great time with it, but it just ended all my motivation to keep playing right there and then and I can't bring myself to spend the time starting over, only to hit the next boss I haven't seen before and I get set back another 10 hours.I'm confused why they thought this was sensible game design and what outcome something like this would have with anyone other than just feeling like you've been duped into wasting your time.So just like the heroes in the game, my resolve was tested:Did I become Focused? Stalwart? Courageous?No.At best, they might hope that someone becomes Masochistic and starts over. But, frankly, it just left me feeling Hopeless. "

								I can't reccomend this game as it stands in early access, though the artwork and vibe are brilliant and the core idea is solid, the only way I can see to progress in this game is to recurit newbies every mission, grind them to dust in a level 1 dungeon, barely surviving - dismiss them because you can't afford to deal with their problems and repeat.This means I've never had heroes get past level 2 and in fact I sent a fairly optimised group of level 2 heroes against a level 1 boss mission and they all virtually got one shot by falling rocks.There's hard and then there's just dumb. Am I supposed to grind level 1 non-boss missions untill none exist any more (it happens!) or is it now impossible for me to make any progress in this game? Why do enemies leave corpses in the way when they die and my guys just turn to dust and leave no corpse?If you make a game hard you need to make your losses feel non-arbitrary and like there's something you can try differently to overcome the challange and at the moment the only option I see is a boring as hell grind fest on characters than never level just so I can amass resources with no end in sight.I really hope release rebalances some fun back into the difficulty. Too much grind for too little progress, making every loss an excercise in random frustration, not exciting challenge.			"

For the most part they reward you for making an effort and trying to learn.  This game does not, it gives you two fights that you're supposed to win and then dumps you in the rest of the game with all the things you could use to improve locked until you let yourself get♥♥♥♥♥♥on.

Rinse and repeat until you have enough for your 'A' team of adventurers to venture in the lvl 3 dungeon (because they refuse to try the easier dungeon they barely got out of last time!), only for them to die on the home stretch in a boss fight who manages to both crit all your team to death's door and deal a death blow before your vestal can heal your team out of death's door. And sure, you can work your way up again to the same predicament before, but this game just becomes a chore and it's definetely not fun because of it.

Early Access Review
								Pretty cool game, but it's one of those games where they have probably spend countless nights balancing the random. A ""roguelike"" in only the sense that it's randomly generated and replayable with severe consequences. It just goes too far into the severe consequences it gets rediculous. It's like it's set on a hardcore mode that only a few would enjoy. It's got a tone, that just oozes smugness, telling you in the start ""Don't worry, we made this game to be no fun at all, because...""Take provisions as an example. Apparently these spoil instantly as they enter a ruin, and cannot possibly be used afterwards, they loose all value and probably get thrown away even though at the end of the journey they eat into your carrying capactiy on what you can bring back. So you are constantly in need of balance for how much you might get out of a quest, how much stuff you might need to pass a dungeon, and how much you might find? Add to this the fact that dungeons ""level up"" for no reason, and you're running out of capable warriors, it's like your playing a game over and over again, just increasing the difficulty level but not really getting anywhere.Another awkward balance to keep things ""tense"" is healing, you may have healers, but they can't heal out of battle. So instead of figuring out a system to balance having too much healing ability, the game designers chose to make an arbitrary descision on not being able to do something outside of lethal situations. This lack of strategy just leaves me bummed. This also makes it that there are tons of helaing abilties, and you just need to balance multiple party builds with enough healing, but not too much. Oh the fun. Lastly the need for 4 people in your party is just contrary to how the game begins with 2 characters. So even if you'd be okay with your 3 fresh and sane adventurers, to maybe just take a half way excursion into the dungeon, you NEED to take gibbering jim who really should really be spending time in the asylum instead. I mean it just wouldn't be fun if the game couldn't force its stress mechanic onto you every step of the way, would it? The characters in this world are also by far the most fragile examples of humanity. Someone says something bad more then once, steals all valuable loot, refuses to help, and then DIES!? Well oh no, why don't you all just slip on into eternal hopelessness. This is a game that was obviously designed by people who think getting ""triggered"" is as serious as social science wants you to belive. I suppose the real answer was to just let gibbering jim go, not get him help and maybe then the game would let me just play with 3 characters- ah who am I kidding, probably would have shown a kill screen and ended it all if I was that sick.I havn't really gotten too far into this game, and my above examples probably makes that clear. Its just one of those games where you need a community forum to go read over, to learn the basic concepts, ammounts and progression just to have fun. Although this is apparently what ""ruined"" the original game (before the hound and whatnot update)  because there was a strategy which could be applied, to far too great an effect. This broken game from the past apparently got all glowing reviews, and now tha game is just completely different, but some people are happy about it I guess? There is no amateur mode. The game also does such a poor job at teaching you anything I have the feeling the game creators just thought Deamons Souls was the greatest game in the world because who knows what the heck that game wanted, was really more of a community puzzle then a game. Those outside of the community aspects just had to try and fail countless times. However that game got one thing right which this didn't, you failed a lot but this was the ""normal"" state of things and it kept going. In this game you fail a lot and you just start over and over again, doing that same tedious fight, see the same tired cut scenes, progress the same 3 missions before you get everything in the game... Ugh. This games ""normal state"" is to fail, and get nowhere and start over again, so if that sounds like fun by all means, sign up to the closest darkest dungeon community forum, load up a ton of reading and pull an all nighter. Its got charm, it's got variety, it's just too much ""raw"" for my taste.			"

								I don't write many reviews but I really feel I need to warn people off this game. Look, I like a challenge as much as the next gamer but this game is just ridiculous. Here is the first thing. You actually might lose one of your starting characters in the tutorial. Let that sink in. You can lose a character in the tutorial (which, by the way, you cannot skip). I’ve never played a game so unbalanced. As you read further review or look in the forums, you’ll see many saying “These people are whiners, it’s not that hard.” I don’t know what game these people are talking about but it’s not this one. After several attempts at playing, it’s mostly an exercise in frustration. Your enemies will rarely miss you but you’ll miss them often. They will get several critical hits, you’ll get very few. The vast majority of “treasure” you find will be trapped and your party will only get wounded and stressed with nothing to show for it. When your characters become stressed to the breaking point (this will happen often) they’ll come down with some sort of affliction. This will slow the game quite a bit because every turn the afflicted characters must say something about it. I could go into a lot more but I just wanted to shoot this review off before I uninstall the game. This might be a good game sometime in the future but I regret having bought it at this point.			"

								Although a really interesting game in theory it's just too damn hard and frustrating. There doesn't seem to be any real strategy in dealing with stress and so the game becomes a frustrating grind where you feel like you are close to a win but then are forced to retreat... which probably fails... so you take more stress damage.... and when you do retreat the resulting stress kills your favourite guy with a heart attack... The whole thing just felt unfair. I'm all for a challenging game but I expect a strategy I can employ to overcome it, just dumb luck and feeling like everything is against you regardless of skill is not fun. Sorry.			"

When you are allowed to die in the tutorial i call that bad game planning. The tutorial is for getting you use to the game not for making you stare at your monitor and say ""What the hell just happened?!"" Don't get me wrong i am all for playing challenging games but this game puts you in a bad situatiuon from the beginning and every second it gets worse and worse with not even the slightest possibility of anything good happening.                     This game is so frustrating and irritating that i don't ever plan to play it again unless they fix some game mechanics..... one of them being the fact that your characters miss way more  (4 to 5 times more than the enemy) and that the enemy gets more turns than you and that all your meat shields (yes meat shields because that is all they are so don't get attached to any single one because he/she will be taking a one way trip very very soon on the corpse disposal wagon) have negative traits to start with and the negative traits just keep coming even the rare positive traits are not that good.I was really hoping this game would be a refreshing change but instead i find it  to not even be worth my time or the money i spent on buying it.

								I have to say I really like some aspects of this game. The graphics and vocals are dark and rustic. The many facets of the game lend well to immersion. It's too damned hard. I don't wanna babysit a bunch of heroes that whine about the torch not being bright enough, then going all clepto and stealing loot. They even throw tantrums and won't allow you to heal them, fresh new characters with full dang health. I am now done playing this until some changes are made. Wow, so much promise and such a failure, in my opinion. I can only hope they balance this game out a bit and make me feel like I'm commanding heroes and not some self-entitled 3 year olds.			"

								A brutally realistic dungeon crawl with comic book-quality artwork of a medieval Gothic style. Your heroes have quirks (both good and bad) and they can get stressed out, diseased, or worse when things go badly in the dungeon. Treatments and enhancement are available in town, but you really have to manage your financial and human resources: protect/enhance your star players and use other recruits as fodder. It's one hell of a hard game and worth the trouble... if you are a bit masochistic and tolerant of long-term planning and rewards.   In other words,  it is a great game for Dad's with very little time to play.			"

								Too much RNG, and not enough skill based combat. Yeah, I get it, turn based RPGs do have an element of RNG to them, but mechanically this game is just bad. Enemies out hit you and out stress you. I don't mind that there isn't a good way to heal out of battle, as it makes the game feel more like a test of endurance, but it's not uncommon that I will just get to an easy fight and drag it out for an hour just to heal, because all in combat heals restor a pathetic amount of HP. Also the Vestel feels like a necessary class due to having by FAR the strongest heals. In my opinion, having any class feel necessary is just BAD. This game really needs something of a way to heal out of combat. Add to that the fact that when you get a character to level 3 they refuse to do low level quests (apparently all the heroes in this game are just jackasses) Ugh... Lets just say this game has more going against it than for it at the moment. Anyways, I really do want to see where this game goes in the future, but it's gonna be several patches before I look into it again.  "

								I do not recomend this game mostly because its not much of a game, you dont really manage your heros that much, every building has a very linear upgrade system, actually everuthing is very very linear, and the battles are just super boring, the vast majority of battles consist of you wait and watching the enemy attacking you, again and again, and then you can use 1 or 2 of your party members before the enemy party gets another full cycle, and you have no input during their attacks, no precise quick times to either maybe give slightly reduced dmg or possible dodges. No you just wait and wait watching the enemy attack while your party members freak out and skip their turns because they dont like scurry monsters. I would think a Crusading Knight or a Murderous Highwayman wouldnt be affraid of little slug things or skeltons.How ever beautful and interesting it is i just dont find it a fun game. Its more like a sim of watching fail adventurers suck at DnD.UPDATE- Spent over 3 more hours, had lots of fun building a strong team of a healer, 2 gunmen and a crusader, fought through 3-4 dungeons using good tactics and won each battle, had a few close calls but i was ok, made it to the first boss and it ruined the game.The Wizened Hag, first turn she put my knight into a boiling pot instantly, the pot damages the hero inside every turn, not round, after each unit move, and she gets a turn after every pot breaks and after each of your turns, she spams area attacks that never miss, and 9/10 my attacks missed, also causes over 20-30 stress per attack, when a hero is not in the pot it is indestrucible and makes melee attacks vs her blocked.She killed one of my guys after haver 4 attacks in a row against me, i quit the fight finally after 3 failed attempts and i quit the game period, until they nerf the AI in many ways and make the fighting fair i cannot recommend this game, it is annoying, unfair, and overall very boring once you get spammed by enemies.Update: Nothing much has changed in the last week, still gameplay that is completely random and unfair, you still spend 80% of the game watching the enemy attack you and spam area attacks, still needs loads of balance work and refinement of the gameplay.Add- 8/15/2015New updates, same errors, just fought the wizened hag again, fight went well got her down to 20 health out of 66 with 2 highway men, 1 arbelest and 1 hellion when she dumped the hellion out of the pot at deathsdoor then istantly put 1 highwayman into the pot THEN Seasoned the hellion and instantly killed her,  then spew the highwayman out to deaths door, then took the other highwayman into the pot, THEN i got to attack, but none of the 2 could hit her, expect the highwaymans tracking shot for 3 dmg, then she AoE attacked and killed those 2 and i lost just like that. In summary the game has such amazing art, sound and setting but it suffers from boring and repetitive fighting, horrible RNG , unfair inbalances, and tedious and time wasting animations and dialauges that interupt the flow of the game and literally prevent player actions. I do not recomend this game to anyone until it gets a major gameplay overhaul.			"

								As a Lovecraftian fan, this game is pure excellence. It's unbridled focus on Necromancy, Cosmic Horrors, Weird Fiction Tropes and recently on an Innsmouth-centric revolt allows an atmosphere of insidious dread to prevail through such terrible game mechanics. Yes, I said it. Reveling in the diverse rogue gallery of lore-centric enemies is awesome. You'll feel like you got lost inbetween Algernon Blackwood and Lovecraft while crawling through catacombs as Wayne June proclaims your inevitable failure, and the masked Leper leading your party suddenly cracks. But I feel a unique, separate kind of dread when all four of my level 5's miss the basic skeletals and get wrecked. Or when Cup of Annoyance is cast 37 times in a row by their back line without giving me a turn, stressing my entire party to Hell itself. DD's combat engine is dicerolls from D&D, home brewed, without much semblance of balance.Darkest Dungeon is a sidescrolling click-n-crawl much like Grimrock, with a tiered party of 4 classes taking different depth charts. Positioning is important, as archers can't shoot from the front, and your crusader can't swing from the back. Following? You crawl down hallways, which are littered with procedurally generated loot, into rooms, filled usually with bad guys. That's all it is, besides for a feature creep styled town where heirlooms acquired can upgrade it to provide cheaper upgrades. No town events, invasions, 1-day missions, or anything resembling variation. Objectives range from scouting all the rooms, killing all the bad guys, or collecting 3 pieces of unique loot. All 3's results do not effect your party any differently, leading me to realize DD is a monotonous descent into the uniquely terrifiyng realm of boredom, and boredom that punishes you for being alive.

								Since my unpolished rushed review was actually getting some attention i've decided to go and write a proper review this game deserves so those who did'nt find it useful can maybe change their mind a bit n so enough of that off to the review:The game is from my expiriences one of the best dungeon crawling rogue likes i've played in quite sometime. This game in my short time I had with it had me wanting to come back for more. The game is quite creative with it's combat system in the way that after so many times your party comes close to death their mind is tested in which their mind will either snap or they will be heroic and reward your roster with buffs; or if their mind snaps it will cause some debuff to that character such as paranoia or selfishness. That system alone had this game sticking as unique in my mind. As for the rest i'm just going to do a quick Pros/Cons list.Pros:1-Creative Combat System2-Unique Art Style3-Great Environments and Ambience4-Good Voice acting5-Creative foes and Quests.6-Great Balance Combat and Exploration.7-Adds in Realistic Hunger elements to the ChaosCons:1- Game is buggy and tends to crash but fixes can be found, i personally had a glitch where it'd freeze at the hamlet screen n i'd have to wait for it to load and not respond then begin responding.2- hard for players new to rpgs or dont have previous expirience3- some deciscions you make due to the Randomness screw you over in ways you cant manage no matter what ^.^Verdict:9/10 - Amazing game but due to the bugs I had to lower it a notch however for an Early Access game it is superbly done and I would recommend this game to any of my friends. This is a great game and deserves the support.			"

								This game is kinda hardcore ""side scrolling"" RPG about dungeon adventuring, stress and heroic deeds. It's really unlike anything you had recently chance to play, it's dark experience exploiting flawes, venturing to deeps of human mental vulnerability. What's the point of living through passage of blades when the paranoia and stress turns you mad or stop your heart?+ XCOM elements of party management+ Light/stress factor affecting outcomes+ Beautiful graphic, animated movies+ Narrator+ Dark atmosphere+- Dificulty - definitely not a game for weak hearted (hhahaaha see what I did there? No? Ok :/ ) although I quite like it that way. - Randomness - sometimes it just got really messed up how it randomized encounters and outcomes, it's not adding to feeling that you can actually do something about it. But maybe .... that's the point?  Still the game is in early access - more content and balancing ahead. A hope for real greatness. 8/10			"

												I love this game, it is a somewhat low budget game with excellent design for the most part.~ The game is stuck on a hard difficulty and is very punishing, and that may bother some people.+ All your choices are meaningful, and the achievements and mistakes that you do carry over for a long long time, thus making the ""grindy"" part of the game feel very skill based and not feel like a grind at all. You rarely find that in other grindy games.- Removing the negative quirks is almost never worth it due to insane prices, especially with the newly added ""darkest dungeon"" You could spend LOAAAAAAAADS of money perfecting a team of 4, to suddenly find that they can only go to the darkest dungeon one time, making all those improvements a waste. The darkest dungeon should have had 1 quest, not 5. The way it is now, it is just a massive time sink beating a quest in the darkest dungeon the first time is the highest achivement you could do, repeating it 4 more times with 4 more groups is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I really like this game, and with some work, this one can be a top tier dungeon crawler RPG. But how the game stands right now, there is far, FAR too much reliance on RNG. I've restarted so many games telling myself ""Oh it was just bad luck, I'll do better this time"".The best games that use RNG also provide a way for the player to negate or prepare for possible strings of bad luck. This game does not have that, and there will be instances where your entire team dies because the enemies just landed several crits in a row.			"

								I wish I could recommend this game. The core concept is solid and the story and atomosphere is great. But the implementation is deeply flawed.The developers clearly wanted to create a challenging game but their idea of ""challenging"" was simply to add a bunch of random bad things that can happen. These things can't be planned for or mitigated and occur with incredible frequency.Combat itself is actually pretty good and is another reason I wish I could recommend it. But here again the strategy of the game is short circuited by the extremely random nature of things.To sum up where this game went wrong they confused randomness with challenging and tainted a decent core system.

								I want to say it's an amazing game but there are too many frustrating problems with it. - Everything and I mean EVERYTHING will increase the stress of your heroes. Wich mean that unless you are really lucky or spend alot of time using underpowered stress healing you will need to send your hero to a stress relieving activity wich cost aroud 1k gold..... for each hero..... when you probably made 5-6k gold in the same mission...... not including the gold you spent for the provisions...... so if you are lucky you might have 1k profit in your pockets.- Too much RNG. You can miss many many times in a row if the RNG gods are not on your side and when the enemy has a crit streak ? Oopsie you just lost that one hero you spent a couple of missions to level up. Oh and while I'm at it.- Leveling. Once one of your hero reach lvl 3 hes too good for low level missions so hes completly unusable unless you have a full team of lvl 3 heroes. Yeah that suck- Oh and you know when I talked about paying for stress relieving being too expensive ? On top of stress you have to pay 1k to cure your hero from a crippling negative trait or disease wich fall from the sky like rain. And you didnt have gold to cure that negative trait ? Oopsie now you have to pay 5k gold to cure it since its now a lasting one.I just love so many things about this game. The atmosphere is beautiful. The classes are so awesome and the combat is very interesting. I just wish that RNG wasnt such a big part of it because it makes good team composition loose their efficiency. That hero deal more damage to marked monsters ? Lets hope you dont have to spend 3 turns trying to mark it. Cool you marked it.... Oh nvm it changed position so now my hero cant hit it anymore.Frustrating and completly discouraging to new players who want to enjoy the game. They could keep the RNG I wouldnt mind but the gold cost are stupid high. You just end up having to pay for so much crap that you cant even buy upgrades.Thank god it doesnt cost anything to recruit new heroes. I guess I should just keep recruiting without leveling or getting back their sanity and send them in missions hoping the RNG gods are good to me.			"

												When you take a closer look at it, this game is the enhanced version of playing heads or tales. The game is extremely difficult and punishing, yet it punishes you for having bad RNG, not for misplaying.  After realising that you were playing a game identical to rolling a dice, you just don't see the point anymore.			"

								The problem with this game is that it relies too heavily on the RNG, and especially with the permadeath/stress mechanics you get in these wacky positive feedback loops where every character feels like skipping their turn because reasons and the whole party wipes through no fault of the PLAYER.If you are going to make a game like this, there needs to be certainty that the player is punished for his/her mistakes alone, and not random chance. Also, the balance is godawful.I really wanted to like this game, and certainly the core is there. The art style is pretty rad, music is nice. But it simply doesn't play well at this moment.on edit: After playing a bit longer, I wish I could change to double downvote. Characters refusing heals from party members, damaging themselves because they are too ""stressed""... ugh			"

Early Access Review
								In it's first release, I found the game fun to play with a distinct level of challenge and a stress system that was intensely punishing but sometimes offered up a moment's respite as your party became less and less effective as their stress increased.I took a break from the game, and about two weeks later, I came back and tried a new Campaign.  I lost half my party in the ""approaching the town"" tutorial mini-dungeon and from there lost at least half my party (if not wiping entirely) on every dungeon run I took there after.  At every stress threshold I could rest assured that my party members would get ""Hopeless"" or ""Selfless"" as a break, which happens about a little over 80% of the time.I'm all for punishing rogue-like mechanics, but it seems to be unnecessarily punishing when my party of 90+% are hitting in the 40to50% range before their stress penalties, and in the 10% after the stress penalties.  How do you even play a game like that?			"

So stressed that it affects your day to day life, when you're stressed in your day to day life, you see a therapist, when you see a therapist, people think you have problems, when people think you have problems they avoid you, when people avoid you you become a loner, when you become a loner, you get a cat, when you get a cat you get  5 more cats, when you get five more cats you lose sight of reality, when you lose sight of reality, you forget to bring a shovel.Don't forget to bring a shovel.10/10 stress simulator.

Early Access Review
								Overall one of the best games I've ever played for anyone that is a fan of roguelike mechanics or turn-based strategy. Pros:* Excellent aesthetic, from the art style to the overall theming and the voice acting. The writing is generally very good also. * Good variety of mostly useful classes. * Fairly easy to grasp combat system, but with a lot of depth. Cons:* A lot of the trinkets (items) are situational, but many are just downright useless. This has been really improved on over the course of Early Access so I have faith this will continue to improve. * Can be grindy at times. With only four dungeon environments it can get a little repetative, but the challenge of just about every run really helps make that less of an issue. * Some of the classes are clearly less useful than the others. Most classes can be useful to some degree, but there are some that are clearly better. This too has been improved over the course of Early Access.As a final disclaimer, I don't believe the game is nearly as difficult as some people make it out to be. You are punished for mistakes, but as long as you have some experience with strategy games and are willing to learn from your mistakes you will eventually get the hang of it. The constant threat of being punished for your mistakes makes the game still really fun and challenging even when you have become very competent with it - a slip-up will punish an experienced player just as much as a novice.

												This game is punishing. You blow through characters like cleenex and combat/sanity mechanics are just unpleasant. You just barely survived that fight? Well you're going to walk into literally invisible traps. Nothing you can do to avoid it. Oh, you have a good order for your characters? Well screw you! You get ""surprised"" and they change order for no reason. It will take you like 4 turns getting them repositioned during which you will be hammered by enemies. Just walking along minding your own business? Well people in your party just starts accumulating ""stress"" for no reason. Also, you can't use the healing abilities of your characters out of combat (for some inexplicable reason) and your one healing item - food - is basically garbage. Overall, this game is fine, but not really worth the money. It just isn't fun to play. The mood is great and the art is nice, but the deck is SO stacked against the player that you end up killing A LOT of your sprites which ruins any sense of accomplishment for the RPG mechanic. Why care about any of my characters if they have the life expectancy of mayflies?			"

Levels later I started to get fustrated instead of having fun. I lost a level 6 to 4 crits. IN A ROW. See the game is mostly on RNG and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ttery. A person with 50 dodge can get hit 9/10 times.Money. Money is one of your second worst problems. If you dont know how much to buy or need, you will drain cash easily with 2 dungeons. The cost for it is so brutal, the level 6 armor costs a whole lot so you have to choose wisely.if i lose my houndmaster im gonna cry god damnit game.			"

												You will lead the most PUSSIFIED band of adventurers ever. Every single round of battle, they are taking huge amoubts of stress, which when it his a certain point... like 4-5 rounds, they develop a rather nasty quirk--LIKE BEING TERRIFIED OF THEIR OWN SHADOW and getting massive debuffs as a result.Oh, and do you like games where the mobs get more turns than you? Then you are going to LOVE this game. I have actually suprised a group of mobs and I get off a single attack by one of my adventurers, and then all 4 of the mobs get their turns before the next 2 members of my party get their turns, and then 3 of them followed by 2 of me.... and you et the idea. Even though I am trying, in vain, to level my toons before facing higher level dungeons, it is a losing proposition. Your character will pick up 2 -3 diseases PER character per dungeon run. It takes a week and massive amounts of gold to cure EACH disease, so that a successful dengoen run against low level mobs leaves you owing 3-5 times as much gold as you gathered. Oh, and did you bring supplies you didn't need for the run? They are gone. At the end of the dungeon run they go *POOF*. You must purchase new supples EVERY single dungeon run, and they are EXPENSIVE. Purchase too many and you lose gold. Purchase too few and you must retreat from the dungeon--and thus lose gold.Also,you will not be able to reach the back mobs except for ranged attacks. So you take down the front two mobs, and...... AND YOU STILL CANNOT HIT THE BACK TWO MOB WITH YOUR MELEE CHARACTERS BECAUSE THE CORPSES OF THE FIRST TWO MOBS ARE BLOCKING THE ABILITY OF YOUR MELEE CHARACTERS TO GET TO THE BACK TWO MOBS! You must then waste valuable turns in destroying the corpses so you can reach the back two mobs!!!You can tell this game was deigned by someone who didn't understand that games are supposed to be FUN! Adventurers GATHER and ACCUMULATE loot -- theyare not supposed to become POORER each and every round!I'd like to give this game 2 thumbs down, but only 1 is permitted.			"

								I currently can not recommend the game in its current form. I was very much enjoying it for a time and when hitting lvl 3 dungeons (not even on a boss yet) some of my main team died, the loss was unrecoverable. Stress generation is insane and needs to be lowered, just walking randomly in a hall you accumulate stress for instance. Heirlooms seem to be far too heavy on certin types, id have 3 of one and 60 of another which I couldnt use as everything takes multiple types. Debuff heaven!!! I think most of my charaters had about 5-6 negative effects each which you cant keep up with removing as there far too expensive at first and take a whole dungeon round to remove as well rendering the charater useless (and you can only do one at a time!). There are some small things I think would make the game better as well for instance a ""Rooms: #"" on each dungeon so you can better plan for torches and food supply. Some GUI things i noticed were a little odd that could use improvement as well like when equiping items to charaters before a battle and having to close and open tons of windows to equip just 4 guys (a little popup would be cool as well if you have avalible items and one of your charaters is itemless, something along the lines of ""Are you sure? Your not fully equiped"" because using 15 guys you are always removing and requiping items I did find some dungeons I had missed outfitting on accident.			"

												TLDR: Great look and feel, but RNG goes beyond risk/reward and resource management and can just screw you anyway. Seems to be building towards a long and unfulfilling/frustrating grind.The game feels great when it seems like everything is calculated risk and resource management. If you get a disease or negative quirk from an object instead of treasure, that is fine because you know the risk and have the opportunity to abstain. If you have a character go insane from stress in combat, you likely didn't bring people capable of healing stress or brought someone you should have left in town for a round. A defeat from pressing on when you're low on supplies is also a learning experience. Essentially, you need to take steps so that even if something goes wrong it isn't game over.Unfortunately the variance is just too high. Maybe ~11 weeks (11 dungeon expeditions) into the game, my party of 60-75% health, low stress characters encountered a boss that was not marked on the already scouted map and was magnitudes more powerful than anything else in the dungeon. The party wiped with one enemy minion left.The problem with this is even if you take fewer risks, have an excess of resources, and the game indicates what is supposed to be in the next hall or room, you can still lose everything in a single random twist. That crosses the border from punishing to unfair.And if this is happening so early into the game, I'm expecting there to be a lot more situations like this one.Given that there is an achievement for finishing within 99 weeks, and the tremendous costs of upgrading anything beyond the first level in the town, I'm going to assume that this game won't be worth the time, effort, and frustration to complete.

								I realize this is early access, but I would not recommend this game at this time.  There is a fun game in there; the concepts are brilliant but the frustration is huge.  The spread in outcomes of the various RNG rolls results in unavoidable failure spirals where things will be going along brilliantly and then suddenly all of your heros are fully stressed, you are out of money, and no easy quests are available to attempt a recovery.  The overall balance seems extremely poor; some dungeons you will receive 50% the number of enemies, and they will all be of an easy type and other dugeons will have twice as many enemies and each fight will decimate your party.  Add in the unavoidable RNG (you can be unlucky with what hero types are available, giving you an unfeasable party configuration leading to certain failure) and this game is just not worth the price of admission.  I hope they refine it, because I feel like this could be a really good game.  One last thing; many people are saying the root problem is that you have to learn the game.  Some of my favorite games are the Souls games which are difficult, but once your endure and learn the mechanics you become powerful.  This is not that scenario; the Souls games are tough but fair.  This game's reliance on RNG outcomes yields and experience which just is not fair.			"

												It was my favorite game of 2015 and it wasn't even technically out yet.It's a hard game, but screwing up won't typically make you lose, it will just push your progress back. It's an RNG heavy game so if dying due to bad luck makes you rage, you shouldn't go anywhere near this game. The positioning based turn based combat is innovative but does get repetitive after a while, however with 14 classes in the game and only 4 slots to put them in, and considering some classes can be built multiple ways (Combat Vestial vs Support Verstial), it's going to take quite a while to run out of combinations to expierment with. Enemy variety isn't amazing but it's good enough.By far the biggest draw is the style of the game. The Narrator is a gem, the art is fantastic, despite how dark the lovecraftian setting is, I never get tired of looking at this game.I can't even comment on the community controversy, when I got this game when it released in early access I trusted the Devs to bring it to a solid completed state, I didn't care when they added corpses because it was their vision, I didn't care when they added the option to remove corpses because it's their vision. And I believed in their vision.What I'm saying is, this game is not made for everyone, however I recommend it becausse if you are the kind of person this game is made for, it is a must buy, even at full price.

Purely luck based game, and you are more likely to be unlucky than lucky.The enemies score ridiculous crits. I stopped playing the game, when enemy scored 5 consecutive crits. Some radomised map, you enter one room and the level is over. Normally the reward and risk system is not balanced, where the reward does not equal to the amount of risk, you put in.Virtually other areas of the game are luck based nullifying and thought and stategy, you put into the game.

No doubt that it will eventually be completed and polished to perfection, but even in my time of owning the game (6+ months) the bugs have been reduced nearly to zero, several hero classes have been added, and to top it all off I had a character named after one of my friends (Elo!) get infected with syphilis after fiddiling with the corpse of a dead body. 10/10.

												I made it about 10 hours into this game.  The difficulty of the dungeons increased beyond the capability of my characters and they died/I ran out of money.  The campaign is effectively over because any of the new characters I recruit are too low level to continue.  The only option is to restart the campaign.  I admit, I obviously leveled up my characters wrong and require to start over.  However, the game is too boring to start over.  I really like the concept of the game, but without a method to lower the difficulty or grind in lower level dungeons I refuse to completely start over.  I wouldn't recommend unless you're really bored.			"

Early Access Review
								I have spent some hours playing this game it is very frustrating and painful to play at times. While it is great to have a party go through dungeons of various types fighting monsters of various forms and trying to snuff out the villains there is other games that I could find my time with. This game is so hard right now that I am watching enemies hit more times than my heroes are hitting and it is a struggle to just keep them up against one mob.There are items that you can buy to increase your survival in the dungeon just for a short while however that will not help you even on the first dungeon that I played. The random number generators seem to favor the computer versus the player so it makes the game moot at this point. This game is still in early access and I hope that they change this game a lot because otherwise, I am glad that this was just a gift to me I would be wanting my money back.			"

												The game's random nature is absolutely disgusting and unfair to the player.It feels precisely like the ""random"" nature of ""free""-to-play games that beat you into dust if you don't pay. Except you just did. It will still beat you mercilessly because... it's a dark and gloomy experience? Nah, it's a Russian Roulette-type ""game"". Framed against you to boot. A roulette where winning is awarded by not having your party howled into madness by two ghouls in a dungeon, thus effectively removing them from the game, just because the dungeon randomized this way.Roulette is not a game, it's a scam. So is Darkest Dungeon most of the time.The game would have been glorious if not for the unbalanced randomness. At least add a mode where there's three times less crits! Crits that totally negate a nicely executed effective strategy just because the stars decided to ♥♥♥♥ you up.A game is to be understood and solved. You can't solve randomness, you can only use it to scam fools for money and make horrible game design.Some compare it to Dark Souls, yet Dark Souls doesn't punish failure, it encourages you to try more by saving your things and skills intact and giving a second chance to claim your souls. Here you can totally expect enemies to inflict critical strikes several times in a row just because ♥♥♥♥ you, thus getting you into a horrible death spiral of semi-permanently maimed top characters and suicide missions.It's not a game. It's a scam that doesn't even profit the creaters properly. A very nice game completely ruined by anti-tactical randomness. It's the Darkest Roulette.			"

												Seeing how many nevative reviews it gets, feel obligated to write one myself. So, if you get here not knowing what the game is - it's turn-based RPG, where 4 heroes (15 classes available) struggling through dungeons (5 types, 4 difficulties), slowly improving their abilities (each class has 8 but only 4 can be active in 1 battle, and learning costs) and armor (also costs a lot), plus getting some diseases, stress, negative quirks (more often) and positive quirks (less often), which you need to pay gold to remove or improve. You also collect gold and building materials to upgrade your town for it to be at least a little bit more cozy.. and less expensive. It's pretty dark. And hard. Most important part is that if your hero dies, he/she dies forever. And if whole party dies, not only that, you lose all items, including equipped ones, and those are pretty rare and expensive. As you can see, there are countless people who experienced exactly that. And they blame game for it. Ofc they should blame themselves, instead. Because when you lose 1-2 people in a fight, it's obvious that you should run, or at least try to. Or if you have 5% of health on 2 characters. Or no food or torches and 2 stressed heroes of 150/200 (200/200 hero dies). If game is too hard for you, you can actually lower difficulty a bit (altho i wouldn't advice that), then if you feel overwhelmed, maybe you should go and hire more heroes of low lvl (you can have up to 28 heroes at one time) and go on easier missions, which will give you some money to upgrade armor and skills for stronger heroes. Actually you can do a lot more stuff (change abilities, use consumables), but let me assure you, that if you played for 10-20h and lost everything instantly - it's your fault. Even if you played for 80h and instantly lost everything, it's your fault as well. RNG is always there, but if you're fully equipped and you know synergies - you totally can complete everything game throws at you. Excuse me for that rant there, it's just i see too much whining in reviews >.>Now to pros:-Great atmosphere (music, narrator's voice, art style, depressive medieval themes).-Actually hard and challenging gameplay.-It's one of those games where you can spend equal time on a mission and preparing for a mission, thinking who's the best for it and taking right items - makes you think. -Victories feel satisfying.-Game is actually very well balanced, no useless skills, and they don't look like some chars are only playable together, in fact you can create lots of different parties. Altho on higher difficulties only some will be good.-There are many interesting little things that add up, improving gameplay, like how the way you relieve stress on character sometimes can matter on the next battle, or how stressed heroes act inside the dungeon - they actually almost feel alive.And to cons:-As victories are satisfying, defeats are crushing. Literally. If you actually lose a party, you will sit in your chair with emptiness inside for a while. And maybe you'll need some long break from the game. Even losing one special person can be harsh. It's actually a good thing too, if you ask me, since it'll teach you life lessons, not like almost every other game, which lets you be child forever. But it would be odd to see in pros.-Balance or no balance, RNG sometimes can be weird, for example it still eludes me how turns are counted, when my character is obviously faster than the enemy, yet he can't have first turn. -Description of skills is usually helpful, but the problem is, you also have to know enemies to be prepared. And even tho you can see half of their stats, which are hp, armor and dodge, you can't really see their attack damage, negative effect chances or accuracy. Which are or wiki site anyways, so it's silly, that it's not in the game itself. Especially considering how hard the game is already.Alright, so in the end - if you like harsh, unforgiving, dark as the void itself experience - welcome home (such as it is). But be ready for doom, it's coming. And don't be shy to use some guides. If you don't like such things - please, stay away. For your own good.			"

												After playing 4 hours, I realized I've had enough when I spent three full turns being unable to do anything because of randomnesss. When your etire party skips two turns while the enemy pounds on you, you realize your experience is not enjoyable.Difficulty in game design is fine, but when random varaibles remove your ability to control what happens, there's no ""game"" involved. Instead you sit back and watch.			"

												Yes, I get it, this game you are supposed to make the best of a bad situation.  But it is a very slow grind to get your characters leveled up.  And when you're on a boss quest and it seems like everything goes the AI's way, and I lose (permanently) 4 of my highest level characters, and the good items they were equipped with, it just makes me want to quit.  I enjoyed some aspects of it, but I don't know if the remaining slow grind I have to go through is worth how angry this game is starting to make me.  It might be time to uninstall and try to forget.....			"

												When I first started playing this game, I was absolutely transfixed and couldn't put it down. The art style, tight combat system, and dark atmosphere was fantastic. Being able to experiment with various trinkets and hero compositions as well as lighting levels in the procedurally generated dungeons was a real treat.Unfortunately, once I got to the champion level dungeons that all fell apart. Heroes with the best equipment and rare trinkets were being brought down to 0 HP from one non-critical hit from the larger random enemies players will encounter. No matter how many buffs or debuffs I applied, no matter how many different party configurations I attempted, it was all in vain. I kept losing my best heroes. The worst part is, since gold is such a precious commodity, the fortune I used to equip them was also constantly lost.I have researched this game by looking up threads, wiki articles to learn more about abilities and afflictions (since those numbers and effects are hidden in-game) and many hours figuring out what worked and didn't. Then the game just stopped being rewarding for giving it hard-earned time and just began punishing me, over and over.I went into this understanding that death was part of the experience, but once you're near the end, the experience becomes so unforgiving, tedious, and malicious, it was practically begging me to exit the game.Sure, other people have beaten it. You might too, if you study this game like you're prepping for an SAT or dissertation. You will have to read guides, articles, watch YouTube videos, and spend just as much time watching the game as you do playing it. There is no room for experimentation in the end-game, you either think exactly the way the developer envisioned something being beaten, or you get to restart.There is no freedom or flexibility in this game's design. If you decide to buy it, good luck. I've long since given up on this product. It has sucked up too much of my time and left a bad impression in its wake.			"

Its cool in a lot of ways but I cant take my hirelings out for more than 2 missions without needing to be inactive for the next 2 or 3 to even have a chance to cure them. The arbitrary limitationss are frustrating but i understand they are to cause suspense and drama.			"

								There are a lot of games which are challenging and I like this types of games. But don't even try to put DD in this category - there is nothing about challenge in this game at all. ""This game does not like you. In all probability, it hates you"". It tries to kill you everywhere. You think, you quite safe in town after hard battle? You wish, the game tries to make you suffer even in such ""safe"" place like this.Actually this is the one and only bad thing about this game. The art of the game is brilliant, the gameplay is quite interesting (but little bit boring) and unique. But the game is still unbalanced in my opinion.			"

												Its a decent game but be very aware that the first two difficulty tiers are entirely different from the last two in terms of difficulty and time commitment. The difficulty is a welcome change. The time commitment goes up exponentially, and soon each battle takes 4-10x as long as they used to. I only give this a thumbs down because the game is entirely different in terms of pacing and feeling of progress from the start to end, and it happens abruptly.			"

												Please, please, please stop calling this game difficult in the reviews. I purchased this game because I love difficult games and I was assuming that there would be skillful ways to get around the RNG. There are ABSOLUTELY NO ways around the RNG. There is ZERO skill involved in this game and therefore can NOT be described as difficult. I have had fights where by the time I had my first turn, one of my characters at full HP and no debuffs was already dead from crits. There is no skill involved when you aren't even given a chance to do anything. If the RNG gods are kind to you and you enjoy just sitting around all day rolling dice with no end goal, you may enjoy this game. If you want a game where you build up skill to accomplish some final task, this is definitely not the game for you.			"

												The game is just so aggravating at times, I cannot possibly recommend it.You do have the tools to play strategically,  until bs kicks in, then prepare for weeks and weeks of doing boring same-old quests to make enough money to fix your characters that were stressed out by bad RNG.One party of mine, that was easily killing everything and hardly had any stress (because of how I built/played them) - in the next battle they missed 7 times in a row, stressing out the entire party til they broke; end of the mission, huge gold penalty to fix them, and shuts down any possible advancement until I can make more gold. There is no strategy in that, just 'suck it up'... well someone else can, I'm done.			"

												surprisingly not very fun, way to much rngedit; this game suffers from sever pacing issues that stem from its awful learning curve. you must grind easy fights for way too long to be able to equip a decent team to advance the plot.Another terrible design feature is not being able to use 'experienced' heroes for beginner dungeons. This has frustrating consequence of learning a bunch of new skills (or lacking abilities you began to relly on and understand) to grind through content you just completed easily with another group.Overall this game seems to have plenty of content, and would usually warrant several playthroughs. As is though, you will learn all the characters to death before you even begin to advance the plot, and by then the gameplay will just be monotonous.This game reminds me of FTL, but with completely ♥♥♥♥ed up pacing. Imagine that game but the second sector starts with the boss battle. You don't lose by having your ship blown up, you just restart the first sector sector with a random new ship that got to keep the weapons of the first ship.			"

Early Access Review
								Sorry but no,I tried to like this game. I really tried. A friend of mine recommended the game and the style and scenario sounded awesome. And it really is a good game and one day I might try it again.Bought it during mid-week sale and started playing; 4 days later on Saturday morning I was fed up with it. Most of the time you are just hoping that nothing “too” bad might happen. And most of the time things happen, which you cannot influence. A hard game is nice, but starting the game right now is just unfair. Even more experienced players might disagree, my friend also did.Following I like to point out why I do stand by my opinion:1. The difference between virtue und afflictions is just too much; if one reaches virtue everything is fine. If on the other side reaches one affliction like irrational the changes of ""success"" in the expedition are very low to no existing any more. One affliction will cause another one (best were three irrational people during one fight) and heardattacks are just waiting.2. Getting rid of stress is too hard. The enemy crits you: 10 stress for the target and some stress for the person next to him. You crit, maybe 3 or 5 stress relief. That's ok, but if you are a Vestal or a Plague Doctor who heals, the crits are rare. And lasts due to DOT's like blight or bleed do not grand stress relief. So no stress relief for you Plague Doctor. The worst is having a hero with a stress level of 40-50 in your town. Sending him into the tavern or the abbey costs a lot of gold (compared to your loot, I will get to that) and it might have a ""nice"" perk, like losing additional resources or him just leaving for a while. On the other side there might also be a disease (I love the plagues) or some negative character quirks which you was gifted during your last journey and might need treatment. I had one Level 3 hero which was then to proud to join my expeditions any more, due to all abovementioned I was not able to bring any other heroes up to his level and continue.3. The loot is just not enough for the current costs. I equipped not too much food, torches etc. but still I was barely able to loot enough to cover the costs of the expedition and heal from afflictions, sicknesses or negative character quirks. Not even speaking of healing a permanent negative character quirk or locking in positive one. That was much out of reach.All the mentioned things were not part of the game before. From what I read they became mostly part of the game during the last bigger patches and its unfortunate I just started playing; but I seems that many players who just started faced the same troubles. More experienced players seem to disagree. In my opinion they tend to disagree mostly due to affect that their mentions are already maxed out, the higher costs did not hit them that hard. Their heroes are already high level and are able to face the fears; just coping with them became harder. So more experienced are happy with these new dangers. But starting right now with them is just too much burden. RNG just crashes your endeavors from try to try. And to try dark runs without any equipment to gain a small amount of loot and get rid of the poor ""victims"" is no opinion for me; that is just stupid grinding! Furthermore it does not help the heroes you try to prepare for higher level dungeons and they might get die anyway due to RNG.So in conclusion I cannot recommend the game right now. Even with the option to disable heart attacks or corpses (which I think is not the worst of ideas due the importance of the hero and the enemy position for some attacks) I will recommend it. I wanted a challenging game, not one I can only start in “easy” mode.Maybe one day I will give it one new try!			"

Posted: February 3, 2016
												At the end of a 3.5 hour session i've resolved that this game isn't for me anymore. That 22 initial hours of the game came from the initial early access release and damn was it a fun, mildly rng based experience. With full release I came back with the idea to play and have fun with my hard rogue-like. Well boy was I wrong in assuming I'd have anything resembling ""fun."" The big issue is that if your game is going to be nothing but dice rolls and hoping for a good start based on the rng then you need a lot of opportunities for good rng. Which there really isn't, it's you getting crit, getting stressed (both in game and out) and then when rng finally goes your way and you get that lucky crit, or that solid fight it isn't satisfying or gratifying, it feels owed. Like ""finally the game is balancing out a little."" And when your players can't feel good about having a good thing happen it's a problem.If you're like me it just comes down to the idea that if the game doesn't make me feel good, if it gives me a completely uneven ratio of stress:fun, and if the game isn't rewarding or gratifying to play then it just isn't worth playing. It's the worst type of game that you want to like but in the end is just so frustrating and annoying to try and deal with you just can't. If I could refund this title I would, I'm sorry Red Hook, you had a great idea, but you executed your gameplay and theology of it like blizzard executes hearthstone, the difference being in hearthstone the rng will always balance out, in darkest dungeon it just piles on and piles on until someday you get the luck streak you need jsut to be able to play the f***ing game. Who knows maybe someday I'll try it again and that luck streak will allow me to get past level 3 heroes.			"

												Repetitious after a while. the challenge of the game is mostly to remain calm as low level creatures seem to be able to dodge most of your attacks and a character of yours with a dodge value of at least 70 does not seem to be able to evade anything. I am convinced that the numbers given in the stats are just arbitrary and the random number generator is skewed towards the game. There were even circumstances where an enemy party which was debuffed significantly still could land critical hits (of up to 21  damage) on a fully buffed party with high evade values. A frustrating game that offers nothing new after going through the low level dungeons. Just grind for gold and replace fallen members of the party. As much as I love the art style and theme, this is a game that falls short of being engaging.			"

												At first I was dazzled by not only the art style, but the complexity of preparation. After playing through some dungeons I noticed a pattern, and the sheer amount of rng. It's clear that you can never have the party you want, but rather are forced into a set simply to deal with the ridiculous amount of damage monsters deal (battle after battle).This game had an enormously good start but then exploded in my face, and I don't have the patience to replace that party member.

												As a lot of the other reviews state, the visual aesthetic, sound design, and narration are all amazing.  Hero design, enemy design, level design and progression are all excellent as well.  Where this game falls off is its midgame pacing and the somewhat flawed combat system.  I actually don't mind the RNG-based combat too much, although anyone that says this makes the game difficult is kidding themselves.  The problem is once you reach champion level dungeons, crit rates seem to make a huge jump and there are some battles where you get crit 3 or 4 times in a row and there's nothing you can do.  I wouldn't even have a problem with this  but for some odd reason you can't see the enemies crit multiplier even though you can see pretty much everything else.  Randomness is fine and even allows for skillful gameplay and strategy, but ONLY when you allow the players to play around probabilities.  Enemy crit rate is the biggest factor in making the randomness in this game feel unfun in my opinion, you can't do anything to reduce it or prevent it, and the game doesn't even tell you which enemies have high crit rates or moves with high crit rates so you can focus them.  It just seems like a baffling design choice especially since crits are so important due to the way they interact with stress.Another negative is that while losing heroes in the early game makes for very tense gameplay and atmosphere, losing a high level hero in  the mid-game due to the aforementioned multiple crits in a row makes you lose motivation to keep playing.  Not because the game is too hard, but because grinding a party back up to level takes too long and becomes unfun (once you clear the bosses in an area doing the dungeons becomes pretty stale), some people might say that this adds to the atmosphere and immersion of the game, but it just feels like bad design.  A lot of this stems from the midgame pacing issues that are supposedly going to be fixed with DLC, but it's just something to be aware of.  Another minor complaint I have is that it's too easy to make money spam hiring Antiquarians to trinket scrounge and just dismissing them when they build up too much stress, there should be a system in place to prevent abuse of dismissing too many heroes or abandoning too many dungeons. Also wish there was a little more boss variety instead of just a stronger version of the previous level's boss, or more random miniboss encounters like the Shambler/Collector, both of these things would help with midgame pacing immensely in my opinion.TL;DR: Midgame-endgame pacing and combat RNG are issues with the gameOverall the game is still very good, got a super enjoyable 25ish hours out of it, but after that it started feeling a bit too slow/grindy for my taste.  8.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								I've tried to play this game with the advise given on the opening screen. I'm aware that the game is designed to involve constant meat-grinding of the characters. That is not an issue I cannot overcome. There is a lot that, with enough polish, would make for an amazing game. Even meat-grinders have their place.So what went wrong? You know that feeling where you're telling Windows to do something but Windows is ignoring you to do something else? This game has something even worse. In this game, that frustration is an intentional feature.

If they had simply placed limits that were somehow understandable so that the player could work around them in-the-moment then cope with the baggage later on, the game could have been amazing. Unfortunately, what starts out as an engrossing every-move-matters strategy game quickly degenerates into something unpredictable. No more strategy.

Heal yourself more than they damage you. You can't account for the nuance anymore, so who cares about all of the flavor and the details. The game is just going to have disorganized shizophrenia anyway.			"

								DD is silly.  You play it.  You lose.  You learn to make it work.  Then you lose again.  You learn again.  That's all good and healthy in a game.BUT, the problem is you have to read about the major boss fights before you fight them or you will inevitably die (if it's a non-ideal group for the fight).  That's bad design.  In a game where losing is losing (fine), you can't make a fight that is SPECIFIC TO AN IDEAL GROUP.  That is BAD DESIGN.  Sorry, I really don't mean to be mean here, but their lack of understanding in an otherwise excellent game makes me want to design a game.			"

								The opportunity to create a tactical, interesting, and rewarding game supported by great art and spot-on tone has been squandered.  Instead, you are treated to a game where RNG is king and your decisions are only as good as your ability to get lucky enough that they actually take effect.Mechanically, the game is a complete mess.  If you take the time and effort to develop a party and learn how to leverage the systems of the game, it really does look like there is something special here, but is it worth the pain of dealing with sloppy mechanics for 15 hours so you can actually start playing a game where your decisions just start to become meaningful?  I personally do not think so.			"

								The game seems to play on losing quests, which is fun for 2 or 3 quests, but not 8 in a row. Constantly the hero's get ""stressed"" and decide to skip their turns which again could be a fun mechanic however I've watched an entire battle unfold with no possible interaction as all my heros kept skipping their turns. Often you will get to the last part and get slaughtered simply because your hero(s) got stressed and just stand there taking a thrashing. Not fun and not realistic in the slightest part. The game does have potential and could be fun but right now it's just no fun unless you like replaying the same 4 quests and watching yourself get thrashed with no possible way to stop it except quitting the game all together. I hope to see the mechanics fleshed out and made more ""fun"". Right now the smaller battles feel like they go on too long. "

								This game is based on a really neat idea and it looks amazing but jesus christ does it feel like it just drags on for no reason.Let me elaborate before you disregard my review.  As I said I really enjoy the aesthetic and the gameplay idea is really neat. It's just that everything takes forever. I have played for like 3 hours now and managed to win like 4 dungeons and after each of those I had to put my whole party aside to recover from the stress and basically start over from level 0 with another party. Which in turn I had to let recover and start yet again with a third party since the first hadn't recovered by then. The combat feels interesting and fun but every fight takes quite a while. And as good looking as the animations are after a few fight it just adds to how long everything takes.The game also lacks  instructions besides a basic explanation on how to fight. I guess for many that could be a plus point though so take that however you will.I wish there was an option of being undecided if you wanted to recommend a game or not as I am really not sure whether the sluggishness of everything makes me want to not play it anymore of if the mechanics and the style suck me in enough to pull through.

												after hours of hours of grinding, at the end, my A-team with nearly all the upgrades and most of the best trinkets has encountered a random shambler (i didn't activate it, it appeared when i was backtracking) and decimated my whole team(my team failed to retreat multiple times).......the level 5 dungeons are hella unbalanced, from 5-6 damage that honestly have a proper hit rate (50-60%), 1-2 damage bleed/blight damage per round to 15+ damage with at least 80% hit rate (i maxed all my characters armor out and the character with 50 dodge seem like he has 15% chance to dodge attacks) and 5-10 bleed damage PER ROUND. When your characters maxed out their armor, they would get an average of 25hp and 25 dodge, but the monsters scales much higher, esp most of them gets protection. this game used to be much more playable and more ""fair"", but once you get to the late game, you would most probably feel that what you've done to grind doesn't do jack, and when you're facing bosses, you'll most likely wipe at least a couple of times until you can defeat it, which the characters takes at least 15+ hours of grinding to level 6.It's no longer worth it to buy this game since the devs completely trashed the game with the combination of unfair scaling and brutal RNG.

												Characters have limited upgrade options and don't really gain anything from XP.  After a battle they tend to have negative effects and the best thing you can do is cut them loose - because it is cheaper to hire a new recruit than heal a sick one.The battles themselves are tedious and grindy.  If you don't bring 2 medic characters in each party then you lose.A no point do you feel rewarded when playing this game.  The 'loot' you find in the dungeons is worthless, even the rare items have little to no effect on the base stats.No character progression, poor loot.  There is no reward and pretty soon you are just grinding your way through.  I stopped playing.			"

												Downvoting this game because I don't want to upvote something advertised as a difficult game and is actualy boringly easy. I don't even know how you can ever lose. I don't think it's even possible, like seriously no ""game over"" mechanism. If you are bad, or very unlucky you may lose some units. But since they are free to hire, it really doesn't matter.The game is just a grind fest. They need to implement an upkeep cost, or ennemy attacks on your base, or really anything that can make you lose something. Too bad, the game itself is interesting.			"

But the way that RNG influences gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing far from great. You can go through a fight with no damage thanks to dodges or you can get your hero killed because 3 enemies had high speed, so they had their turns in a row, marked one hero and got 2 consecutive crits. If game gets it fixed, then buy It, because apart from that It's one of the best games I've played.			"

								I've tried to play this game with the advise given on the opening screen. I'm aware that the game is designed to involve constant meat-grinding of the characters. That is not an issue I cannot overcome. There is a lot that, with enough polish, would make for an amazing game. Even meat-grinders have their place.So what went wrong? You know that feeling where you're telling Windows to do something but Windows is ignoring you to do something else? This game has something even worse. In this game, that frustration is an intentional feature. As you play the characters you're controlling go insane, and they have a chance of ignoring your input to perform other, deliberately inconvenient, actions.

												This gets a huge mehhhhhh from me. The art style is amazing and the combat is fun and strategetic.. buuut my gripes with the game outweigh the fun I had which made me stop playing a number of times. Mainly to do with the stress. I liked the idea of your heroes getting stressed and without treatment going insane or getting some other affliction (like Rogue Legacy  a bit) but it doesn't really work. The problem is that your heroes all seem to have an intense fear of slightly dark places and major heart disease that means they can only go through one room before they're ready to pack it in forever and die.   The games already difficult enough without constantly having to leave half way through dungeons because everyones cutting their wrists and screaming at each other. It wouldn't be so bad if to progress the game didn't ask you to complete 90% of rooms, which I only ever managed to do two or three times after I ignored my heroes ♥♥♥♥♥ing and let a couple of them die.    I liked the idea in writing. But I found myself constantly having to spend all my money to treat the stress levels, meaning I wasn't progressing at all because I had no money left to buy resources or upgrades. It just wasn't fun anymore because I felt like I was playing a dumbed down version of the sims.    Also you'll hear the RNG system mentioned in almost every negative review, and I agree with that. Sometimes your screwed over for the sake of being screwed over and theres nothing you can do to stop it. It's luck. An example are chests which can be trapped and curse you, piles of rubbish which you have to dig to get past (without a shovel they hurt you) and of course the combat which can be really easy or reallly difficult depending on what the game decides.(thank you for reading my review, don't leave a nasty comment otherwise my stress will go from 0 to 200 and I'll go insane :D)			"

												If i could give this game something between a thumbs up and a thumbs down i would.It has great use of art style, narration, dungeon crawling, and the lovecraftian theme. The dark world you need to traverse affects your heroes on an emotinal and mental level. It really helps you feel the impact of the insane situation you find yourself in, watching your party slowly lose their minds from the horror they face.Every battle and dungeon expedition is narrated by excellent voice acting, and going into dungeons forces you to think about what supplies to bring and what to throw away for space. Sometimes bandages are more valuable than gold.I have a great deal of respect for what this game tries to doHowever...Many pivotal moments in this game come down to a throw of the dice. No matter how hard you preapre, no matter how well thought out your stratagy, everything can fall apart at a instant. A poorly timed miss, a weak heal, or a well placed crit can spell out death for the party youve spent a long time preparing, and there is nothing you can do about it. Hours of progress can be wiped in an instant.This unfortunately can and will lead to large amounts of grinding, whether for money or levels, through the same dungeons youve been to time and time again. Progress in this game is slow, painfully so, and the final darkest dungeon requires many heroes to be max level. Fully upgraded max level heroes that can die at a moments notice.I imagine the devolpers of this game wanted the player to feel as stressed as the party they are playing as, because every fight is a challenge, and the fear of losing it all will put you on edge, but when you lose a full team (or even a half team) of level 6 heroes, it can be depressing to the point of game quitting especially near the end game. Its like putting 50 hours into a big game youre trying to 100% only to have your file deleted.This game absolutely has its merits and you can tell the developer put much time into it. However, the heavy focus on RNG and the repetative grind hold this game back from being something truly special.			"

												This game has an end-game mechanic called the ""Never again"" quirk that applies to your heroes should they survive a journey through the final dungeon.   The result of this quirk is that they refuse to *ever* re-enter the dungeon.  They're done.  You may as well fire them, because all of your countless hours (or even days) of grinding just became meaningless.I cannot in good conscience recommend this or any other game that griefs its own players.

Its not that I dont enjoy a hard game I grow up with ninja gaiden 1 through 3 on my NES and they are brutally hard.

												Grind, grind and more grind with some RNG. Initial intrigue of the game quickly dies when the RNG and grind takes takes over. It's a RNG thats also stacked against the player, its one thing to build a challenege into the game but it grows tiring. Need more deeds? Grind. Need more crests? Grind. Need more paitings? Grind, oh wait, RNG, die then grind some more. Difficulty level from level 1-4 is fairly flat but then comes level 5 and I expeted the game to be free to play where I can't progress without spending real world money. The more complex dungeons also force a significant amount of backtracking to complete. No depth, all grind and RNG.			"

												Sorry but I cannot recommend this game. One of the cardinal rules of video games, in my opinion is that you don't put the player in a situation where they have to restart the game in order to proceed, losing all progress. You might react to this by saying, ""Well you just hate rogue-likes. You're supposed to die! That's the point!""I don't hate rogue-likes. I loved Rogue Legacy, for example. The problem with this game is that you can get quite far, and simply be unable to proceed, losing all of the work you've done to level your party, etc. This is just unacceptable, in my view. If this doesn't bother you, and you want a very difficult challenge, and a steep learning curve, and damn the consequences, then this game might be for you. It does have very interesting and unique mechanics. It's not horrible. It's just not for me.			"

								I guess this might be fun, if you enjoy losing constantly to a naive RNG. The game badly needs tuning, it's frustrating and feels like you can never gain traction unless you luck into it, which isn't much fun.edit: I've played enough at this point that I think I get what's going on: the game is over-tuned to defeat power gaming strategies, which leads to an un-fun experience for players who just want to jump in and play and aren't intentionally trying to crack the game in half. I really think a difficulty level option would fix this nicely; hell, lock steam achievements to the higher (classic) difficulty if you like but don't make the game so punishing for new or casual players that it doesn't catch on. That would really be a shame, the game is great fun at times.I still can't recommend the game to ""the average gamer"" at this point but if you enjoy classic roguelikes and can deal with the RNG deciding to randomly kill you at times the game is tons of fun, if a little rough around the edges.

												Pros:  The art is good, the sound is good.Cons:  Bugs (only some of which have been patched), shallow gameplay that pushes brute force grinding.Imagine a game, I have a number between 1 and 100.  We keep playing until you get it right.""Oh"", you say, ""well once I know the solution the game is easy"".But then I say ""well after you guess it right, I just change the number and we go again""Then I say the guessing game is ""hard"", ""offers replayability"", and other superlatives.  Well, Darkest Dungeon is like that pretty much.  Yes, there is some depth to Darkest Dungeon, yes it certainly has its good points, but the gameplay design just seems clumsy.  There are considerable assets in the game, and it's certainly a different experience in terms of looks and sound to a lot of games out there, but on the whole, I have to say it comes up short.I cannot recommend this game at this time.  If mods are released that address numerous gameplay issues, and bugs fixed, sure, it would be a great game.   The developers do continue to patch the game, and modding tools have been announced to be in planning, so there may be hope yet.I will update this review if changes are made sufficient to my considering the game to offer good value.Though this is a negative review, if you like the looks of the game and really don't care how it plays, by all means, go for it.

												This game has promise, but the insistency of keeping your heroes on a perpetual grind is something that I hate. At that point, you might as well design a 4-PC dungeon crawl because all you're doing is creating a roster of heroes (I think 25 is max number) and picking a combination of them to go through the dungeons until they beat the darkest dungeon, at which point those heroes can't go in anymore.In some aspects the game delivers on its intentions to bring out Lovecraftian horror: there are weird creatures roaving the areas you frequent, your characters have sayings and quotes that are amusing and horrifying, and the pressure built on you while you adventure with high-level heroes mounts the higher up you go.

												< 1% of people who play this game complete it. To give this some context over 10% of players who play Dark Souls finish it.The end of this game is terribly designed: it is repetative and punishing. Your reward for making it to the end game is knowing that it gets terribly difficult and you, like 99% of players, probably won't finish it. My advice to friends is to skip it alltogether. The game masks the difficulty in the early stages and ramps it up to absurd levels in the late game.

It's just too bad the game obviously plays with a stacked deck. The whole experience essentially boils down to grinding out a strong group and then praying the dice roll in your favor.

												It's actually a lot of fun for a while - sure it's repetitive, but it's still fun.  After a while, if your guys get too high level, and you can't complete every quest, you can't afford to rest your guys, then you can't afford to upgrade your guys, then you can't use your guys...  then you basically have to start all over.  Even with 4 completely different teams of 4 set up, you run out of money, can't sell anymore trinkets, and it's game over.I'm pretty sure I'm done playing this game.Fun for a few days.  Not worth $25.			"

												Extraordinarily grindy with bad endgame mechanics (heroes are prohibited from attempting endgame content more than once). Very RNG-dependant and extremely punishing. A masochist's game to put Dark Souls to shame.Interesting mechanics and rogue-like-like gameplay, but ultimately unsatisfying. There's a reason very few people have finished this game on any difficulty - it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥even if you're great at it.			"

												Like many others have said, Darkest Dungeon has fantastic visuals, with a unique art style, satisfying animations, and excellent voice acting. The game does indeed require skill, but the lack of a recommendation comes from the simple fact that many of Darkest Dungeon's mechanics rely too heavily on luck and RNG.  I like a difficult game as much as the next gamer, but when hours of progress are reset because of unfortunate map structure or heavy fear build up (to name just a couple of many mechanics largely based on luck), you are delving into the dangerous waters of bad game design. I want so badly to like this game, as there are many redeeming qualities, but the cons outweigh the pros.			"

												Disclaimer: I'm a relatively casual gamer. I don't like to invest loads of time into a game if I can help it, so bear that in mind with my review, which I'll keep pretty short.There's a lot about this game, visually and conceptually, that is amazing. The art is fantastic, the voice acting and music and overall sound design are loveable, character designs are nice, etc. There's a lot that, on the surface, makes this game seem like it's cream of the crop material. The turn based ascept is nice, and the concept of sanity and stress are good elements in this game. The story isn't all that bad either, and I like the idea of having adventurers going out to collect resources in order to improve a town over time.That said, it's unforgiving. A lot of suffering in this game isn't a result of player mishaps like in other brutal games like Dark Souls or Bloodborne. Rather, combat is mostly RNG in terms of who is and isn't being beaten up on, and the sanity mechanics are demanding in management. It's frustrating for someone who doesn't want to invest a lot of time into a game, because getting a feeling of accomplishment in this game is difficult. More often that not, you'll be losing heroes left and right due to circumstances out of your control, which left me feeling like this game's an exercise in futility.For anyone who's looking for a game to casually enjoy or feel a sense of accomplishment, I can't recommend it.

												The overall package of Darkest Dungeon is very polished. Great visual design, audio, the whole thing.But in attempts to promote their game as 'hardest of the hardcore', the devs basically skew the stats against the player in calculations.When at 60+ Dodge I dodge nothing, there is something clearly ♥♥♥♥ed up with the RNG numbers. I have seen mobs with far lower Dodge dance around my guys' blows. This includes an undead bloated corpse.I'm sorry, but no. If you want your stat-based super-tough hardcore game, you bloody well make those numbers on my statscreen mean something.Give me percentages, PROPER percentages, don't hide it behind arbitrary numbers. SHOW me the chance to hit instead of seperating Dodge and Miss chance. How exactly am I to know you are fair if you deliberately obscure numbers?Heck if enemies do have an Attack rating that fights against Dodge, then SHOW it along with their Dodge and Speed ratings that the game currently DOES show! Let it be consistent! Let it be truly fair!Maybe that new update with the new mode would help.But they should come out and say it, that 'mode' is an actual proper balance patch.			"

												Challenging, atmospheric and generally well made. Or it used to be. But at some point during Early Access ""difficult"" got replaced with ""RNG punishment"" and ""grind"". So after a while it just becomes tedious. Which is unfortunate.  If they toned down the grind I would recommend this game fully. But as it stands I would say: this game is best enjoyed playing for a bit and then ignoring for a long time and then jumping back in. That should make the repetitive nature easier to handle. But that really is working around a flaw in the game by not playing the game. Which is inherently wrong. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun to play for shrot periods of time, and like the I said the atmosphere, sound and art syle are brilliant. The mechanics are even neat in concept. So basically is a game that's more tedious than hard worth the current price for you?			"

												Graphics, sound effects and settings are great.Unfortunately, it's just very very very very grindy. You have to run the same 4 dungeons over and over and over. Going into a dungeon has a large cash cost, both for supplies and for curing whatever ailments and stress you leave with, and often the reward is simply just marginally smaller. Moreover, when your heroes level up, they can no longer go in the early level dungeons. But they are still too weak for the high level dungeons - you need to spend a huge amount of gold to simply make them read. So your starting heroes become useless after gaining a few levels, until you have grinded enough gold with a new party to equip them. And there's a LOT of grinding to do that, trust me. If this game had microtransactions it would have been called ridiculous and described as something you had to spend money on because the grind was insufferable otherwise. As it is, there's just a lot of grind.I really looked forward to this game, but having to run low level parties over and over to sequeeze out a tiny bit of gold in order to get my higher level guys ready has just killed my enjoyment of it. I really want to like it, but after playing an hour at a time I just can't stomach it any more, because of all the tedious micromanagement just to squeeze out a tiny bit more gold.			"

												Darkest Dungeon is a glorified slot machine disguised with a bloody, wild, dark-fantasy theme. Everything is RNG dependant, as well as being designed to work against you. Your healers barely heal even with trinkets and buffs, your sluggers often miss regardless of traits and buffs, and taking on the actual, literal 'Darkest Dungeon' portion of the game is simply an exercise in sadomasochism. Many are quick to defend the 'difficulty' of this game because of the current trend in video games (difficult games, ala Dark Souls, Binding of Isaac, etc.), however, the simple fact is that Darkest Dungeon isn't as tough as it is dependant on sheer luck. Crits, dodges, empty rooms and hallways, the discovery of treasure and trinkets that aren't totally useless and the like. Player skill is much less important than simply scoring a critical hit on a cultist with your Crusader or Leper.Until you struggle through the game and become rich, many of the upgrades to both buildings and equipment are simply too expensive to afford. The hero roster is pitifully small despite how easy it is for them to die, training heroes to their max level takes too long given how tiny said roster is and how quickly they can be killed, trinkets are often as needlessly debilitating as they are helpful, heroes become too stressed too easily (especially in the final dungeon).The game simply isn't fun to play...but at the same time, the gambling nature of DD makes it addicting. After 100+ hours I've come to realize that I've only been playing this game for those sporadic moments of utter joy that follow criting a tough enemy party three to four times in a row. Those times are wonderful, but they're also far and few between. More often than not, the enemy will be punishing YOU relentlessly, not the other way around.In summation: buy this game if you like to gamble. It's good for that. The art is fun to look at for a while as well and the narrator is a nice touch...at first. After completing your 20th quest, though, his repeated quips become reminiscent of nails on a chalkboard. The mechanics, however - the actual meat of the game, are rather unenjoyable.			"

For the hell of it on the tutorial level i god killed for no reason without even a worning and all i was told to do is to use attacks on a dude, so i did then the guy got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and 1shotted my poor knight <_<. I love games that give a fair challange and allow you to bang your head onto the boss untill you both bleed to death (aka all darksouls series, bloodborn, supermeatboy and xcom longwar ironman) this one is currently not fair. Ofcoarse i could boot up the youtube step by step guide for ""HOW TO GIDGUD SCRUB FOR DD POTATOES"" and follow it step by step then become so op that none of the monsters threaten me atall but this is just wrong; i want to follow and set my own rules in this otherwise great game but if you are not going the meta way here you are at best going to be stuck in endless loop of pain (and not the good type) the best enjoyment of it i got so far is to barely break even for the supply i buy to the mission.

												Let's start with the good. The authors absolutely nailed the Lovecraftian theme as far as the art, music, writing and voice acting goes. Which makes it doubly painful to realize Darkest Dungeon just doesn't work as a game, and furthermore, the gameplay mechanics clash with the theme.There are many problems with Darkest Dungeon, but the fundamental issue, the deal breaker, is that there are no adverse consequences for playing it super, ultra, 100% tediously safe (other than the mounting boredom and sense of lacking purpose, that is). Roguelikes in general always have one (or preferably several) mechanic to exert mounting pressure on the player. It could be the rebel fleet pursuing you. It could be your diminishing food stocks and the approaching winter. It could be an invincible ghost that spawns if you take too long to reach the exit. There is no such mechanic in Darkest Dungeon. You are perfectly comfortable where you are at all times; no schedule, no encroaching darkness, no enemies at the gates... no loss condition. You can abandon a mission not going your way at any time, with no consequences.And this absolutely murders any drama or excitement the game could have otherwise provided. Gone is the incentive to improvise and try all sorts of mad gambles to try and cheat death. Gone are all the memorable tales and memories. What's left is a tedious grind towards an inevitable conclusion.Now that the main issue is out of the way, let's explore a few of the game's peripheral failings:* The battle engine is prone to abuse. Healing moves are infinite and free to use, meaning if you're really bored and morally bankrupt, you could keep one last enemy perma-locked with stuns while you fully heal your entire party (both HP and stress) every battle. It comes to a point where just using healing techniques feels like cheating, because the game offers no hard rules on what ""legitimate"" use of them would be.* The game is chock full of tiny, inconsequential, boring bonuses/penalties. +5% chance to crit. -1 speed. +15% damage if Saturn is in conjunction with Venus. +5% evasion against your mom. You're expected to care and optimize this stuff that hardly makes a difference.* It's a bit ironic that a Lovecraftian game that sells itself - with very compelling imagery, might I add - on the psychological ravages of combat, is in fact so lenient and restrained. If you are expecting characters to slowly and permanently unravel, to become damaged basketcases progressively incapable of functioning, you're going to be disappointed. The penalties accrued by psychological damage are tiny and inconsequential, and furthermore, characters can accumulate a maximum of 5 of them. You can safely ignore this aspect of the game entirely, if you so wish.* It's remarkably hard for a (player) character to die in this game. As long as they have at least 1 HP left, they can take a nuke to the head and survive. At 0 hp, each hit has a 1 in 3 chance of killing them (for good, which means you have to grind for hours to replace them). Heal 1 hp, and they can take another nuke. This is bad on multiple levels. On one hand it makes the majority of the game an absolute (and pointless) breeze and encourages complacency. On the other hand, when death does occur, instead of doing something of consequence, something that could affect whether you win or lose, the game merely wastes your time.TL;DR: The game looks and sounds terrific, but the gameplay loop is a pointless, repetitive and extremely long grind with no loss condition, no drama, no excitement, and with an exploitable battle engine full of questionable design choices.

								I haven't touched this ""abandon all hope"" game in a while, but I was excited to see some new characters added to the roster and some interesting changes when I came back to the nightmare. But then I noticed something huge that couldn't be ignored: The enemy got some new debuff attacks. Not one or two. ALL of them. The stress damage and the crit rate was also alarming. The first five dungeons I tried angered me so much because I always lost at least one party member (the thrid one was a TPK). It was the sixth that I got a lucky break and convinced me to stick it out. So, out of six dungeon crawls, only one went the way I wanted it to? I don't like those odds.After seeing that I'm not the only one griping about the ramped up difficulty, I'm starting to lose hope. Rogue-Lite games are a growing favourite of mine, such as The Darkest Dungeon, FTL: Faster Than Light, and other Indie Rogue-Lites, but there's a delicate line between challenging and punishing. I don't know if the next patch will fix anything, but I don't want to lose hope in this game.For now, I can't recommend getting this game, as much as that saddens me to say so.			"

												Roguelikes or Rogues or whatever the term is have a certain appeal.  That ""I like to be punished and die a lot.""But I personally also like to progress.  And this game is too unforgiving too often.  I spent hours training groups to take on the ""Darkest Dungeon"" the difficult ones, and in seconds they were obliterated.  That isn't fun to me, that's just telling me my time spent was time wasted.I set the game down for a long time, came back, played through a dungeon...  I watched the stress of my party climb, I watched them one by one freak out, not one of them becoming valorous.  Then they started dying.  Then I remembered why I stopped playing it.I got 40 hours out of it, but after a few other experiences similar to this (FTL comes to mind), I think I'm done with the ""punishing"" / ""rogue like"" genre.  My recommendation is to avoid the frustration.			"

												The game is interesting enough, atmosphere and art are well done, the stress mechanism is very immersive.On the other hand, the permanent death mechanism attracted me, but eventually I found it anti-fun. When you lose four guys at level 3 (max level is 6), you are kind of screwed, but well you just hire four other guys and you keep the game rolling.However, when your four-man party gets wiped in the final dungeon, after a dozen or so of hours just to level and equip these guys, all that's left for you is to grind more hours. And then get wiped again, and... You get the idea.I play hardcore Diablo 3 (and played hardcore Diablo 2 before that), so grinding and restarting is not something I am opposed to. But Darkest Dungeon is not a grinding game, what is fun in this game is making progress towards an end goal (while in the Diablo series, trashing monsters and finding loot is what's fun). When your entire game is reset, it just feels like you've lost your time.For the record, this is one of the very few Steam games I own that I quit without finishing (too lazy to check, but in fact it may be the only one). Some would say I am just not good enough, I would say that it is not rewarding enough.			"

I've just started to reach complete wealth (I only need more crests to upgrade the Survivalist's bonfire, which is pointless because I've already purchased all of the camping traits I want.) and the only things I'm spending my money on are trinkets I might want to use someday and treating quirks in the Sanitarium. Only then did it occur to me that I hadn't unlocked the Coves or Darkest Dungeon and when I moused over them it said that they were going to be added later. The game is so polished and so well presented that I was under the impression that it was complete.I strongly reccomend the game to ANYONE who likes RPGs and doesn't mind turn-based combat. Evne to some people who find turn-based combat boring, the art style, sound effects, camera work and overall presentation makie ever hit feel impactful and meaningful.			"

								I've been craving a good RPG for quite some time now and after finally playing Darkest Dungeon I can say I found that game. What makes this game fun is its unquie stress system that can affect your heroes for better or worse. Finding out how to micromange their stress, treat their conditions, and manage provisions is all part of this games test. Finding good loot and landing those ever lucky crits brings thrill and excitiment, making you want to go back once again into the dungeons for more punishment. The game oozes with atmosphere with its unquie artwork and character design, narratoring voice, and dark atmosphere set in a lovecraftain era. Darkest Dungeon is one of the most polished early access games I've had the pleasure of playing. If you really like rpgs with a rogue like element in it; I highly recommend this game. Darkest Dungeon can only hope to improve from now on.			"

Early Access Review
								Darkest Dungeon blew all my expectations away. Here is a quick summary to why I love playing it:+ This game oozes theme and style. The aesthetic look and music really matches the gothic dungeon crawler nature.+ Gameplay mechanics that fit with the game's theme. Relating to the point above, but this game has great smaller mechanics that fit very well together like the stress system of seeing the horrors of the night. The torch mechanic, allowing you to burn up your torches to make things easier or let them burn down for a tougher challenge but greater rewards is great. But what if you run out of torches? Well then you are definitely in for a tough time.+ Varied characters and classes. Loads of variety here in both combat and camping skills that create charaters with purpose.+ Loads of content for an early access release. This is what early access should be: I've played 4 hours and I've only defeated the first boss out of nine. There is three areas to explore with two more on the way (I presume for the full release). I've only seen one bug, which was incorrect text and it wasn't gamebreaking at all, and has already been patched.+ Lots of player choice. This game is tough, everything goes wrong, but is still a lot of choice available to the player as they explore.This game is exactly my type of game: A game where there is tough choices (like XCOM), short rougelike missions (like Rouge Legacy/Binding of Issac), but have lasting effects and purpose over a longer campaign (like XCOM and Rouge Legacy again).One point to note:- This is not a negative, but there is a lot of random generation involved for if you hit or miss, if you do 4 or 7 damage, etc. Some players may not enjoy that aspect, I love it as it creates unique experience and amusing moments when my occultist healer does more bleeding damage than he healed.From the start you can see that this game has a lot of love and polish put into it. Every day over the past week, I have always been excited to return to Darkest Dungeon. Highly recommended by me, I'll keep updating the review if something comes up, and when it is fully released.If you wish to see dungeon gameplay, here is an episode part way through my Darkest Dungeon series that starts with dungeon crawling:

								--- EA Review ---This game has the potential to be truly awesome.Very unique and nice art style, great music and sound effects and everything in theme of the setting.Unforgiving and yet rewarding! 10/10 if they hold the course of the development which includes regular (about 3) patches a week, which where all great and usefull so far.That said, it still needs a lot of work. Story, Characters, Gamemechanics are incomplete; Balance is unfinished.But thats because its in EA.I can fully recommend the game if you like to play EA games and don't mind taht its unfinished and maybe even want to contribute to the development.All others: BUY THIS GAME WHEN ITS FINISHED.TL;DR: Very enjoyable, but unforgiving Adventurer Manager Rouge-like with the potential to be a 10/10 game. Don't buy if you want a finished game, wait for release in this case.			"

								During my first 6 hours of game-play I've defeated the first Wizard and party wiped against the Swine Prince (OMG, AoE stun is tough!) and I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Some dungeons are dramatically more challenging than others. Spiders/bugs tend to be much easier than skeletons/humanoids. Which is a relief at times when you are worried if you are going to make it through the next fight and you get bugs. I love the art style and I'm looking forward to seeing more polish. The developers also appear to be very active on the forums and with the community. Considering this is an early access game, I'm throughly impressed with it's current implementation.			"

THIS REVIEW IS OUTDATED BY SEVERAL MONTHS, TAKE ALL THAT IS SAID HERE WITH A GRAIN OF SALTDarkest Dungeon is an unforgiving dungeon dive into Hell that taunts you as you lose control of the very minds of your troops.The incessant hatred this game spews my way has caused me to reset my save three times already, where now I've finally hit a luck streak. However, that's just it:  Lady Luck must smile upon you for success. Skill carries great weight, but this game is a dice game with invisible dice; nothing is guaranteed, all is up to chance.However, this does not stop the fun from being apparent. The sense of accomplishment from completeing a dungeon, from slaying a foe, from defeating a boss... it adds up. Slowly, your forces become stronger, your choices become more wisely made, and you begin to master that which once ailed you.PROS:Tactical, rewarding RPG combatSupreme focus on gameplay over flashinessEasy to learn, difficult to masterA variety of class choicesPlenty of varied loot to findGrinding that doesn't feel like grindingRetreat is supported and holds little against the player...CONS:...except that your forces gain stress quickly while doing soDifficulty can be disuadingStress can seem unbalanced at timesReliance on chance hurts immersionGameplay8/10Story7/10Sound10/10Graphics10/10Overall9/10I would heavily recommend this game to any hardcore gamer, but I'd hesitate for someone new to the RPG genre. With punishing difficulty that rewards tactical thinking and good luck, this game branches out to be one of the most unique RPGs I've played in multiple areas.			"

Early Access Review
								I followed DD since early kickstarter reveals, and hoh boy. As a forward, I absolutely LOVE difficulty in gaming. I have way too many hours logged onto DotA 2, Dark Souls 1 & 2, XCOM, etc. because I look for that punishment in my gaming. That being said, Darkest Dungeon lived up EXACTLY to the absurdly high standard its hype set for me. I was glued to my computer for hours and hours, praying that the hag's cleave wouldn't snuff out my party at death's door, hoping to land that fateful crit or stun, and damn if I haven't lost a lot of dudes. But I knew exactly what I was getting in to (thanks to the folks at Red Hook being very open throughout development) and damn if I didn't get exactly what I wanted.Now, of course the game isn't perfect. There are a few typos, a couple issues, and ♥♥♥♥ Lockjaw. The divine wrath of RNGsus can, at times, be absolutely heartbreaking. But is that a bad thing? In this case, no. The game marketed itself on its punishing, brutal style. On its hopelessness, and on its faint glimmers of heroism. And they are all very, very real.And that's to say nothing of any of DD's qualities other than its fantastic gameplay; I'm not sure if anyone has had an issue with the art style, or the narration, but they're both spot on for the game's atmosphere. The chilling voice of the narrator can praise your heroes for crits and kills, or comdemn them for their failures and disappointments. One issue that was more annoying than invasive was that if a cleave attack (Breakthru, Grapeshot, etc) crits, especially if the crit kills, the narrator states his lines on cue, over and over per crit/kill long after the moment had passed, and sometimes after combat had ended. But more of that ghastly voice filling the halls? Not too bad an issue at all.All this said, and the game's just released on early access. JUST RELEASED. Early access has, as a concept, been plagued by the lack of developer care (abandoned titles, quick cash outs, AAA devs using it as an excuse, you name it) but this title is very clearly polished, and cherished by its creators. The folks at Red Hook took a lot of time, and a lot of effort, into making a product that would be adored by their followers, and by those just finding out about the title. And it really shows. I'm looking forward to everything they add, the heroic and the tragic, and I'd recommend this wonderful buy to anyone who loves difficulty, darkness, and tragedy.			"

Early Access Review
								I havent played alot yet, but beleive me I INTEND to. I tend to ramble, an bounce around so ill leave the summary at the top.TL:DR: This game is fantastic in the most grim, DIRE way imaginable.Story: If your interested in Lovecraftian stories, tales of hopeless all-consuming darkness, then you've found the right game. The setup is pretty simple, and i havent really played far enough to see if it evolves any further in the grand canon. HOWEVER, there is undeniably a facinating story to be found in the moment to moment gameplay. Examples: (In maybe my 2nd or 3rd quest one party member developed the ""masochistic"" trait. Later on, she is mortally wounded in a fight, when this happens you have a chance to heal them, but the next time they take damage theyre done. Before my healer gets a turn to bring her back around she cries ""I welcome the hangmans noose!"" and killed herself. im not even exaggeratting.) (Then there was the timei had completed the quest, but could see on the map another section to explore, we werent to bad off, and it was just one section so what could go wrong? 1 teammate died, the rest went insane and had to spend the next week drinking, praying, and fornicating respectivley. I FELT like such a greedy fool, the game didnt have to tell me in a cutscene. Combat: Turn based RPGs arent my forte, so its hard for me to coment on this part. I tend to get frustrated when i miss, or sustain a critical hit as it feels like i couldnt have really dont anything about it. Ill give this game a pass on that solely because it fits really well with the aesthetic and tone. That being said, no huge insta-gib moves that ive seen so its not particularly offensive, but still the randomness is strong. Enemeis are distinct and varied, your character classes are fun and interesting. Game doesnt hide information from you, tells you your chance, how much dmg the hit might do, all the enemies resistances, its rlly nice. OH one key difference, POSITIONING! All moves have a required position in the party line up, and a required position for the enemy to be in (Denoted by a series of yellow and red dots respectivley). which makes assembling your party all the more interesting.Systems: The sanity meter doesnt really feel as impactfull as id hoped, but some people may prefer that. Improving your town requires special recources, which is nice. Most stuff however is bought with gold, character improvements, recouperation, and most importantly supplies. supplies that vary from essential food and torches, to cure type items, and multiple ""key"" type items. There is visible depth even from the begining, and alot of hard choices on what to level and how to spend your resources.Aesthetic: 11/10 the art is what initially grabbed me on the project, finally seeing more I must say it continues to impress. The systems also strengthen the tone of general madness, like with the second story example. Finally, and most importantly...THAT NARRATOR! Wayde June absolutley kills it with his performance, and all the lines are perfect. Every line had me smiling the widest cheshire cat grin, its just so satisfying.Seriously? still reading this miniature essay? what else do I need to say, games great. Just pick it up if anything i said sounded remotely interesting.			"

								I've been craving a good RPG for quite some time now and after finally playing Darkest Dungeon I can say I found that game. What makes this game fun is its unquie stress system that can affect your heroes for better or worse. Finding out how to micromange their stress, treat their conditions, and manage provisions is all part of this games test. Finding good loot and landing those ever lucky crits brings thrill and excitiment, making you want to go back once again into the dungeons for more punishment. The game oozes with atmosphere with its unquie artwork and character design, narratoring voice, and dark atmosphere set in a lovecraftain era. Darkest Dungeon is one of the most polished early access games I've had the pleasure of playing. If you really like rpgs with a rogue like element in it; I highly recommend this game. Darkest Dungeon can only hope to improve from now on.			"

								I love this game. So far it's the best one I've played in 2015, and I can't wait to see what they add.Unlike many other early access games, this one feels complete at its foundation. Core gameplay is very much there, and more importantly it's fun. It seems like anything they add now will just be extra content and balance passes, the latter of which could admittedly throw things into disarray.This game is punishing, and sometimes it can seem unfairly so. But a bad roll of the dice usually serves to compound existing problems and flaws in strategy rather than turning an absolute win into an absolute failure. Bad luck can definitely ruin your day, but preparedness is key and the game's system for this feels innovative if a bit samey after a while.If you're on the fence about this one, just get it. You won't be disappointed, and even months out from final release you'll have a great game to play.			"

								Overall a very good game, there are dozens of different classes, you can upgrade skills and make builds, the game has an ver important tactical aspect to it, if you rush in like a no-brainer, you won't get anywhere, all in all it's really good, the only downside I can think of, is that this game needs some tweaking on some aspects, especially when it touches the enemies, while your characters rarely ever dodges or crits, your enemies seem to dodge/crit dozen of times per battle, I've had a streak of 3 turns of nothing but dodges, another streak of 2 turns of crits, the healing is somewhat weak right now, at least in lower ranks, you cross your fingers to heal 4, only to have your enemy swing for 5 and get you bleeding.The difficult is high, people who quit easy should avoid this game, it reminds me a lot of This War Of Mine, as to how it takes in account an interesting factor: the psychological aspect of your heroes, I've had a compulsive crusader, who opened everything, not even caring if it was rigged or not.The game is a 10/10 for gameplay and story, right now the only downside I can think of is the overpoweredness of dodge and crit in your enemies' hands :P			"

								So far, I am extremely impressed by this game. The artstyle and atmosphere is grittty yet gorgeous. The combat system is standard for most turn-based strategy RPGs, but it's visceral enough to make every turn tense. Upgrading your town and adventurers is done smooth with enough depth to give you plenty of choices for your party structure. Overall, the game has just about everything a good rogue-like RPG would need.But it doesn't stop there. The sanity and stress mechanics are what make the game different from anything else. Not only does it make the game more difficult, but it will completely change how you play the game from any other. There is a lot more micro-management along with trial-and-error when your adventurers start taking turns for the worst.I can only imagine just how much more they could add to this game considering it's still in Early Access. At it's current state, it's definitely a must-buy for anyone who likes dark fantasy RPGs.			"

								Well on it's way to being one of the rare Early Access success stories in my estimation. Fairly well polished already and the content that is in the game is steadily engaging despite being limited. There are a few minor annoyances in the game that can grate the nerves in a mild sense and a few possible class balance issues, but those seem to be the only downsides to the game thus far.I get the impression that most folks who seem put off by this game were not ready for the Roguelike elements of the game and seemed to be expecting a cake walk in a tea park, despite the warning the developers have put in before the title screen and the Lovecraftian setting. Just keep in mind that you will not succeed with every mission, regardless of how well you may think you have prepared, and that you will get ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥(hard) now and again. Once you learn to just roll with the punches you should find a lot here to love.			"

								This 2d side scrolling roguelike with a dark souls vibe is the first game this year to really excite me. Take a party of 4 adventurers from a pool of randomized characters, each with randomized traits and quirks, to clear out an ancient estate for its former family. Be prepared to have your characters die left and right due to your mistakes but the ones that survive will have earned their veterancy by surviving a trial by fire. After each dungeon, you'll return to a town that you can improve the way you like to give your adventurers the best edge possible. Plus you can send your party to gamble or pray so they don't lose their marbles. Essentially, if you like aesthetic of dark souls and the gameplay of roguelikes then buy this game. Right now. Also, even though this is early access, it in no way feels like early access. (i.e. no jenky combat or unavailable buildings etc) "

This However does not take from the game at all, it is still grueling, heartwrenching, eye covering, breath stopping, time slowingly cruel and heroes come and go. The turn mechanics are hidden to leave you in suspenceand you cant heal out of combat (i feel this really is good to keep you cowering) and the artwork is to die for. it is an original clever game.... its like darksouls had a baby with the love child of dontstave and final fantasy.

								Great great fun! I love this game, the look and sound of the game are perfect and it feels REALLY polished for an Early Accses, there are some issues, it is very hard but as a fan of Dark Souls ect i don't mind this, it rewards min maxing a lot, and its hard to get the gold you need to calm your guys down!. the positives far outway the negatives for this game, i heartily recommend this. is great for LP/Streaming also if your into that, as it allows chat participation as to which skill you use and such, its a real love letter to lovecraftian books. a solid 8 out of 10 as it is, i think possibly 9 or 9.5 once its finished 100%			"

								The game as it is could be released at $19.99 and be entirely worth it.If you like Roguelikes where you can lose everything due to an unlucky party-wide critical hit, but can win fights nearly in the first round, where you can enjoy the highs and the lows of the potential gain or permanent loss - then Darkest Dungeon is for you.

								I have to say that this is one of the best dungeon games I have play so far. Its unforgiving and dark, with a nice H P Lovecraft taste to it. The graphics are in a very nice style, the atmosfear is great and the voice over has made me chuckle more that once with its dark satire and stabing comments. All in all I would reconment this game to anyone into H P Lovecraft or any one into dark, very hard games.			"

THIS REVIEW IS OUTDATED BY SEVERAL MONTHS, TAKE ALL THAT IS SAID HERE WITH A GRAIN OF SALTDarkest Dungeon is an unforgiving dungeon dive into Hell that taunts you as you lose control of the very minds of your troops.The incessant hatred this game spews my way has caused me to reset my save three times already, where now I've finally hit a luck streak. However, that's just it:  Lady Luck must smile upon you for success. Skill carries great weight, but this game is a dice game with invisible dice; nothing is guaranteed, all is up to chance.However, this does not stop the fun from being apparent. The sense of accomplishment from completeing a dungeon, from slaying a foe, from defeating a boss... it adds up. Slowly, your forces become stronger, your choices become more wisely made, and you begin to master that which once ailed you.PROS:Tactical, rewarding RPG combatSupreme focus on gameplay over flashinessEasy to learn, difficult to masterA variety of class choicesPlenty of varied loot to findGrinding that doesn't feel like grindingRetreat is supported and holds little against the player...CONS:...except that your forces gain stress quickly while doing soDifficulty can be disuadingStress can seem unbalanced at timesReliance on chance hurts immersionGameplay8/10Story7/10Sound10/10Graphics10/10Overall9/10I would heavily recommend this game to any hardcore gamer, but I'd hesitate for someone new to the RPG genre.

								During my first 6 hours of game-play I've defeated the first Wizard and party wiped against the Swine Prince (OMG, AoE stun is tough!) and I've thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. Some dungeons are dramatically more challenging than others. Spiders/bugs tend to be much easier than skeletons/humanoids. Which is a relief at times when you are worried if you are going to make it through the next fight and you get bugs. I love the art style and I'm looking forward to seeing more polish. The developers also appear to be very active on the forums and with the community. Considering this is an early access game, I'm throughly impressed with it's current implementation.			"

								Why the darkest dungeon is worth the early access.Normally I go against any early access game simply because they are never finished and lack content to begin with, I've only logged several hours into this game but I've already fallen in love with it. The game offers a grim and difficult setting as you take your party through these dark and dreadful dungeons that instill a lack of hope into you. The game is ungodly hard as you have to manage your characters and manage them well, bring the right party members that compliment your characters, the position of them matters, bringing the proper amount of food or torches with you and the small inventory makes you decide ""is this item worth it?""The game briefly gets easier as you level your characters but only to get stomped by a harder enemy. You have to decide wether to go on or to abandon the dungeon and suffer the consequences of abandoning your quest. I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes turn based dungeon crawlers with a difficulty similar to games like dark souls. It provides a challenge and rewards you for sticking it out until the end, though its early access the amount of content is pretty good and I can't wait for more to come.			"

								A horrifying suffering simulator in which you send a team of heroes into a variety of terrible places in search of loot and the destruction of evil.  Your heroes will die.  If they are lucky.  If they are unlucky, they will go insane, and drag everyone else into insanity in a terrible death spiral that will ultimately kill your entire party.  The incredibly dark and oppressive atmosphere and wonderful art help turn what could be a mediore experience into an amazing one, despite the crushing loses you will take early on.On the other hand it's a lot of fun once you get the system down.  The initial difficulty curve is steep, and you are always at risk of losing people.  But there is a method to the madness, and with some time and upgrades, you recieve the satisfaction of having a team of incredibly flawed badasses storm into the dungeon and lay waste to evil, bringing out mountains of loot to shower upon your other characters to give them a fighting chance.Game is in early access at this point but feels very solid and well put together.  Well worth the buy.			"

								Darkest Dungeon blew all my expectations away. Here is a quick summary to why I love playing it:+ This game oozes theme and style. The aesthetic look and music really matches the gothic dungeon crawler nature.+ Gameplay mechanics that fit with the game's theme. Relating to the point above, but this game has great smaller mechanics that fit very well together like the stress system of seeing the horrors of the night. The torch mechanic, allowing you to burn up your torches to make things easier or let them burn down for a tougher challenge but greater rewards is great. But what if you run out of torches? Well then you are definitely in for a tough time.+ Varied characters and classes. Loads of variety here in both combat and camping skills that create charaters with purpose.+ Loads of content for an early access release. This is what early access should be: I've played 4 hours and I've only defeated the first boss out of nine. There is three areas to explore with two more on the way (I presume for the full release). I've only seen one bug, which was incorrect text and it wasn't gamebreaking at all, and has already been patched.+ Lots of player choice. This game is tough, everything goes wrong, but is still a lot of choice available to the player as they explore.This game is exactly my type of game: A game where there is tough choices (like XCOM), short rougelike missions (like Rouge Legacy/Binding of Issac), but have lasting effects and purpose over a longer campaign (like XCOM and Rouge Legacy again).One point to note:- This is not a negative, but there is a lot of random generation involved for if you hit or miss, if you do 4 or 7 damage, etc. Some players may not enjoy that aspect, I love it as it creates unique experience and amusing moments when my occultist healer does more bleeding damage than he healed.From the start you can see that this game has a lot of love and polish put into it. Every day over the past week, I have always been excited to return to Darkest Dungeon. Highly recommended by me, I'll keep updating the review if something comes up, and when it is fully released.If you wish to see dungeon gameplay, here is an episode part way through my Darkest Dungeon series that starts with dungeon crawling:

								In the Darkest Dungeon everything is out to get you, you will become sick, you will become insane, and you will starve.  The thing that makes this game so fun is that you have to prepare and deal with the consequenses if you don't prepare well enough.Sometimes you will get ****ed by RNG, other times you'll crit like a mofo and not even get touched by your enemies, your characters are not the only ones who will be stressed out by this game.A lot of what makes people thumb this game down is that it's mostly random chance and partly skill/preparation. Pros:1. Hard as balls, but rewarding.2. Atmosphere and art are fantastic.3. You have to work hard to get good results but it is not SO hard that you just quit.4. Devs constantly update all sorts of game content and attempt to balance damages and stress.Cons:1. RNG will KILL you.2. Early game is not balanced.3. Stress heals are worthless unless used at a campfire.4. Scouting chance and surprise chance are not balanced and seem completely broken. (You will get surprised more often with 100 light than with 0 light) Based on my experience at least.9/11 I would get quad-critical hit on after having my melee tanks sent to the back row again			"

								Darkest dungeon is Probably the hardest round-based strategic RPG I've ever played. It is definetly a Challenge for everybody with the motivation for achieving a challenge. The Price is even though the early Access Mode definetly worth it. It took me even about 10 hours of glameplay to figure out how to actually make progress and not suffer with all the stats you need to take care on. But for everybody who is in love with RPG's,this is definetly a must buy.Due to the high difficulty and the complete loss of your heroes you played on for hours it can be quite frustrating for somebody with weak nerves. PS: Without the Wiki it's 10x more challenging (I did it blind)			"

As you progress you will lose many many units. But thats ok! The unique twist is that every once in a while your units (warrirors, ect.) will recvie an atribut. some are good, some are bad. One example is a curse that lets you only heal/relax you unit by divination. only in one spot. while another unit might have a bonus to attack. its a unique game. i defenitly say try it out.

								This game has all the best features of old turn-style RPG systems, as well as a couple new ones.  It's frustratingly enjoyable (odd combo) to deal with your character's stress levels to keep them from going insane.  The dark atmosphere is spectacular, and the animation, though simple, is amazing.At the very start of the game I nearly lost a Crusader to madness due to skeletons and cultists, only to have him die after de-stressing him a couple journies later.  I ended up having money problems as my people became permanently stressed.  I could do better, so I restart.After restarting the second time, I realize that not all adventurers are built for the dark horrors of my family's manor, so as their stress level gets higher I excuse them from service.  With gold in their hand and jibbering on their tongue, they wander from my hamlet speaking of beasts and demons, but I'm sure the rest of the world will sort them out.Now I have a problem, however.  My coffers are over-flowing with gold saved by not spending a cent on weak-minded adventurers, but now I have inexperienced adventurers with no knowledge of what's to come.10/10, would pull my hair out again.

												+: Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike funded by Kickstarter, based on the idea of a more gothic ""emo"" style roguelike RPG. The heroes are not your bright and super courageous characters off to save the day, these heroes suffer from many mental, emotional, and personality problems. Everything is bleak in Darkest Dungeon, and the heroes aren't very heroic. I love this.+: The narrator is AMAZING. Almost as good as the Bastion narrator.+: The art style is also amazing, and some of the best hand drawn art in a video game I have ever seen.+: The music is ALSO AMAZING, and one of my favorite soundtracks.+: There's a lot of cool mechanics to the game, like light/torch. Light/Dark affects the different character classes and items and skills differently, and some rooms/items are only earnable in one mode. As it gets darker both players and monsters are easier to surprise and have higher crit chances.+: The battle system is one of the most unique turn based battle systems I've seen. It's a very interesting take on it - positioning is very key and plays a huge role in what abilities you can use and on who. Of course, there is a ton of abilities that can change your or your enemies positioning, so a smart player can actually deny enemies from using their good abilities by moving them into a bad spot.+: One of my top games of 2015, go buy this game, seriously.

Early Access Review
								The game is a solid 8/10.Read on if you want more detail from a player that has cleared what is available!The only real problem with the game is that it is not finished - as expected with an early access title.Its turn base combat is addicting and much like a 'Final Fantasy' of old or the newer 'Bravely Default', 'Child of Light' etc.The magic however is in the music and narration. The stern and chilling narrator sets the atmosphere and bits of pieces of information of your settlement are revealed as you progress in difficulty and reinforce your camp. The delivery is much like a Dark Souls game in that it’s dank and gritty with plenty of atmosphere with a story present if you choose to read and listen. The art is fantastic and the animations are great, two minor gripes were being unable to auto arrange/organise my trinkets and some form of accomplishment screen for my hour sink/completion.It took me 4 save files to steady a team into the harder dungeons and I managed to keep that team alive until completion (lvl 6 heroes and all 3 bosses of each zone available defeated) in 58 weeks (In-game time system).I recommend you buy this game if you want a throwback to a turn based combat system that is both unique (stress mechanic) and pleasantly familiar.Eagerly awaiting the descent into the actual Darkest Dungeon!Vas "

It's brutal, difficult, and rewarding. This is classic turn based RPG'ing done right, introducing stress based mechanics as well as quirks that present a different take on the adventurers life of dungeon crawling.You'll lose fights, you'll lose quests, you'll lose those you hold dear...learn from your mistakes, and hope you don't lose your mind...in the Darkest Dungeon.

								In the Darkest Dungeon everything is out to get you, you will become sick, you will become insane, and you will starve.  The thing that makes this game so fun is that you have to prepare and deal with the consequenses if you don't prepare well enough.Sometimes you will get ****ed by RNG, other times you'll crit like a mofo and not even get touched by your enemies, your characters are not the only ones who will be stressed out by this game.A lot of what makes people thumb this game down is that it's mostly random chance and partly skill/preparation. Pros:1. Hard as balls, but rewarding.2. Atmosphere and art are fantastic.3. You have to work hard to get good results but it is not SO hard that you just quit.4. Devs constantly update all sorts of game content and attempt to balance damages and stress.Cons:1. RNG will KILL you.2. Early game is not balanced.3. Stress heals are worthless unless used at a campfire.4. Scouting chance and surprise chance are not balanced and seem completely broken. (You will get surprised more often with 100 light than with 0 light) Based on my experience at least.9/11 I would get quad-critical hit on after having my melee tanks sent to the back row again			"

												Great fun, but a ton of options need to be added in order to make it playable. The granular nature of the character's traits is amazing - few games have such depth to the afflictions that your heroes can have. The combat is straightforward and tactically driven in a rewarding way.Having said that, the game is unplayable unless you've got it running on mute in a window while you read online or otherwise occupy yourself while the characters bicker amongst themselves with their meaningless random flavor text. If your characters become stressed (and they will), you'll go from a dungeon crawl to a dungeon full-stop while the game sorts out all the various interactions between them.I certainly don't mind the game's difficulty (you will fail and that's part of it) but the gameplay needs to sped up by an order of magnitude. I can't imagine playing to Week 20 at this pace.Edit: I came back after updates and it's even less balanced and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG death will punish you for no reason. It's not hard so much as it's insultingly random and doesn't care that you're grinding again because RNGesus hates you. Can't recommend this turd anymore.			"

												Výborná hra.+ Atmosféra, výpravy jak v Dračím Doupěti na kterém jsem vyrostl - jidlo, pochodne, lektvary - chce to trošku strategie abyste vydrželi do konce,+ Stejně tak to chce přemýšlet jaký tým do které lokality vezmete. Třeba charaktery zaměřené na krvacivé útoky na kostlivce asi ne =)+/-  Někdo by to mohl počítat za záporný rys hry, ale to, že hrdinové často umírají vám dává pocit opravdovosti. Ze začatku (jako milovníka Baldurs Gate atd) mi trochu vadilo, že mi hrdinové umírají. S tím, že hra nema žádný save/load si je budete hýčkat o poznaní citelněji.+ Hra se ukládá non-stop. Můžete ji kdykoliv vypnout a kdykoliv zapnout, hra se načte přesně na stejném místě. (platí i pro souboje atd). To dělá hru časově nenáročnou (přesto že celkové dohání časově náročné je), v klidu si dokážete užít hru i během půl hodiny.+ Hra se dá hrát donekonečna. Pokud chcete, dá se dokončit tuším za 20-30h. Ale klidně i za 200h, 300h atd. +/- Nedoporučil bych hru lidem, kteří chtějí intenzivní herní zážitek, a chtějí u té hry prosedět celou dovolenou (i takoví se najdou :-) . Protože hra začne být po čase dosti stereotypní. Ale těm, kdo se chtějí sem tam ponořit do temného gotického světa, s partou hrdinů procházet kobky, jeskyně a temné lesy, bude hra úchvatným zážitkem.+ Hrdinové trpí dosti reálnými neduhy, od obyčejných nemocí a úrazů přes psychycké problémy.Může se klidně stát, že budete mít v partě kleptomanku, která si poklad sem tam ukradne pro sebe, fanatika, který se bdue hrabat v hrobech ať už se vám to líbí nebo ne atd. Uroveň světla a jiné drobnosti na výpravě pusobí i na psychiku hrdinů. Někteří v sobě najdou skrytou sílu, jiným přeskočí. S tím souvisí i vylepšování vesničky, kde najdete budovy i jako kostel, nemocnici či hospodu. Tam všude můžou hrdinové za nemalý peníz odpočívat a relaxovat nebo se léčit. Pokud nebudete opatrní, budou tuto kúru potřebovat po každé výpravě. +Sběr artefaktů a pokladů. Každý hrdina může nést až dva artefakty nehledě na vylepšení zbroje a zbraní. Oboje je znatelné vylepšení, tak nevahejte investovat do dražších. Ale pozor, opilý hrdina může artefakt klidně ztratit :-)Shrnuto, podtrženo: hra se vyplatí ve všech ohledech (ano pokud uvažujete nad tím, koupit jídlo na víkend nebo hru tak se asi nevyplatí, jinak ano). Nikdy jsem neviděl hru, kde by bylo tolik reálných prvků hru ovlivňujíc. Sečteno s úžasnou kreslenou grafikou a temnou hudbou i atmosférou, 9,5/10.			"

Early Access Review
								Probably one of the best Early Access games out right now. That said, there are still some things I dislike about the game. 1. The RNG can feel a little TOO RNG and doesn't feel like you can manipulate it enough in your favor early on. 2. Buffs besides the Jester's Battle Ballad seem extremely underwhelming as you could just as easily deal more damage or keep yourself from taking more damage by attacking instead. 3. The lock on lower level quests when a character hits level 3 kind of sucks. It makes sense that they did this since it keeps on from power leveling characters, but since there is no middle point between dungeon lvls 3 and 1 (i.e. lvl 2) it is a huge spike in difficulty especially if one does not yet have the money/resources to unlock and upgrade their skills, armor, and weapons to a high enough level. On the topic of powerleveling lower levels, it is an even bigger slap in the face since Dungeons get harder the more they are beaten. In turn, it is harder to level up new recruits and becomes almost impossible. While this is somewhat interesting and gives a psuedo time limit on how quickly you need to beat the game, it is also extremely annoying and makes you want to almost start all over again and just say ♥♥♥♥ IT to your current save file.Solution to 3: If they want to keep this kind of setup it would be nice if they had dungeons set up so that even though they do increase in difficulty, there will always be one apprentice mission available for lower level characters. This will allow new characters to be recruited and allow people to play with party compositions more without hurting the increasing difficulty of the game's dungeons overall. These are my major gripes with the game. The rest of the game I find quite great besides a few minor things that will most likely either be tweaked or added to in the future.TL;DR This game is great besides a few things that will make you wanna flip a table.I will most likely update this review as the game gets updated and as I progress further in the game. I do enjoy this game deeply and have been looking for a turn based rpg like this for a while. Hope this was helpful. <3			"

								Finaly Early Access Game which is worth buying. After all those fails, this is a must have game for any1 who like RPG, turn based dungeon games.Pros:-Very hardcore, every misstake can cost you a lot and sometimes even force you to start from begining.- Excelent atmosphere. Enviroment, music and sounds are SUPREME.- Plenty of tools to keep you busy and come with different tactics.- Rewarding. If you succeed you feel the progress.- Very addictive.- Often updates. Just today 3 hotfixes. It seems that devs are trying hard to make this game succeed.- Unique. No so many games of this kind on the market if any.Cons:- Fights get repeatative, but so far not boring though.- Lack of planning because of RNG.- Descriptions of spells, skills, stats and so on deserve improvement in order to explain more what it does.Seriously the best deal on Steam I so far had. Highly recommending this game to almost anyone who enjoy this type of game. Do not give up cuz of cheap graphic, this game has all what succesfull games from 90's had. I believe that this game will become phenomen and there will be many games of this kind comming in near future.			"

								This will not be a long review I have not played alot of this but I might update this later on. Well I want to get this out of the way I F**king hate this stress system it makes almost no sense it's stupid I like what it is but I don't at the same time example of this every step you take your people will get stressed for no good reason and its frustrating, Another thing that would be great is a wait button when you are at the town or the abillity to skip a week but so you can't spam it that it's that is all I want. Unless the day and night thing works into that then forget my stupidity.Now good things the combat from what I have played very fun but the stress system lets it down, Graphics are very nice some very well designed characters and enemies, A nice story to go along with it nothing special though, Nice town system still need to figure somethings out about it though, Very nice dungeons, Very good if not fantastic atmospere, Very nice diffuculty kinda like dark souls.Well thats it I am not good at reviewing games at all but I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a hard game like dark souls and a nice dungeon experience.

								I really enjoyed this! I usually say no to buying Early Access games, but my curiosity got the best of me, and i decided ""meh why not"", and im glad i did. The D&D esque feel of the dungeon crawling is superb, and the combat, although difficult, it's still fun, and great once you get the hang of it. I especially love the afflictions and power-ups you get in the game. where you can be either powerful, or stalwart that can allow you to boost your team, or have such a range of afflictions like your Vestral becoming a Masochist, or your crusader becoming paranoid. I found it interesting (albeit annoying) when they would become so afflicted they would either, refuse orders, refuse healing, bring down morale with hopeless banter, attack others, or even kill themselves. this game gives me the satisfaction of having a group Dark Souls game, without the multiplayer or 3rd person combat. Even as a Early Access this game does a marvelous job, and i can't wait to see the full product, when it arrives.			"

												A dark dungeon crawler that is based around the standard RPG elements and the psyhological state of your characters.The game is very unforgiving and can be hard to newer players,luckily,you can reset the game at any time,but at the cost of your heroes lives...Pros:+The dark and creepy Lovecraftian look of the game+You are gonna get attached to your heroes simply by giving them a name and then later on by leveling and boosting them. But unfortunately things will go badly,because the game is a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥+The upgrading and leveling system+Narration (it adds to the charm of the game)Cons:-RNG:dodging,critical attacks,traps,status effects and much more are all RNG reliant.There really isn't a way to know if something like your stun is gonna work or if the chest you are about to open is trapped.The only way to improve your RNG is by increasing stats and buying items,but even then you can get royally screwed by the RNG gods-The game is kinda buggy right now and I'm having trouble running it on different Pcs (On one Pc the game works,but on the other one the game just freezes at beginning of the main menu.What's really weird is that the game works on the slightly worse Pc.)Overall pretty awesome game,but it will require much more customatizations options,heroes,quests and loot when it gets fully completed.

Early Access Review
								EDIT: What follows is still true, but after about 30 hours into I discovered some issues that, from the look of the answers in the suggestion forum, will be addressed before full release. For the best experience I'd recommend to wait. That being said, it won't affect you until late/mid game and it took me more than 20 hours to get there.This game is a challenging yet fair turn-based RPG with heavy management and a H.P. Lovecraft-like horror theme.This combination is pure insanity (no pun intended). If you were to compare game-design and skating, Red Hook pulled a 720 backflip with blindfold and hands tied. And got perfect marks from all the judges.Sure, it's kind of niche, the setting is not for everyone. But if it appeal to you, stop reading reviews already, it's a masterpiece.11/10Affraid of the difficulty? There's a mod to make it easier. I didn't try it, but I did have a look at the changelogs and it seems decently made. As far as I'm concerned I'm happy to see it's possible to mod the game that much, hints that more may be coming from the community.Affraid of early access? There's plenty enough to enjoy already, it looks polished and feature-complete. Definitly not yet another game released too early through this mechanism. Can't wait for the other dungeons to go live, but it's not like I'm done with what's available yet.			"

								Becomes dull very quickly. Last patch took them good amount of time bringing nothing interesting into the game but raising difficulty to the skies without almost no new content. Stopped playing.			"

								A great challenging game.Turn-based team fighting.You will be screwed over and you will loose terribly.Hope for some more zones and heroes in the future.Was winning the fight, Bounty Hunter turns sucidal and kills himself, Crusaders becomes a masochists and refuses healing.Lost fight.10/10 would sucide again.

								So, I just bought this game last night, right? And I have only just realized it is now ""this morning"" instead of ""last night"". Yes, 8 hours, through the night, without stopping or even noting the passing of time. It's that good.The art and music is beautiful; the difficulty is unrelenting but rarely fake. The only times I have felt helpless before RNG or overpowered enemies, I knew it was my own fault for failing to prepare or choose proper lackeys. So I scrubbed those missions, told the survivors to run with what loot they had, and plotted revenge. Play slow and patient but be willing to take risks and make sacrifices (and fire weaklings), and the game will reward you.			"

								First up: Nice job, developers! DD is a dark warhammeresque (WHFRP that is) rogue-like. As it is still in development there are some issues with savegames, crashes and balancing - but hey we all wanted it ASAP. In DD you control a party of 4 adventurers foolish enough to help you with the restoration of the old hamlet. To gain resources dungeons have to be cleared of monsters. You will see a lot of your heroes die and only a handful will suceed. Surviving the perils of the dungeons leads to insanities which can slowly degrade your heroes to crazy babbling wrecks. You can cure them but that takes time and money. Since you often get a whole list of insane behaviours it gets harder to cure them all. There is a roster of heroes from which you will choose and you will have to make sure you have two or three working parties to have at least 4 heroes that can leave the village without dying in the first combat. Of course you can also take your insane guys down in the dungeon but their behaviour might be unpredictable and even dangerous to the mission as they follow their inner demons.CombatThe combat system is a lot about positioning your characters and the enemies. You have 4 slots for the heroes and the same number for the foes. Some skills can only effect certain opponents/characters and your characters have to stand at the right position to do so. Combat is unforgiving and if a character has no hitpoints left he is nearly dead. All further attacks have a big chance of killing said character and since the game autosaves this hero is gone forever! Upgrading the hamletMost of your hard earned treasures will be used to upgrade buidlings. The buildings have a vital role in healing insanities and giving you upgrade options for your heroes which you can use spending gold.The pros:- strong atmosphere (of desperation ;) )- unique hero-classes and setting- great Immersion- superb art- good sound design and voice- interesting combat- permadeath and high difficultyThe cons:- still way to random (often party members are killed without you having a chance to act)- short dungeons are without camping option so you cannot really heal your party other than in combat- you cannot really prepare for the dungeons as you do not know what awaits you- hunger system seems to be unpredictable- if you are low on gold you will loose heroes due to bad provisioning which leads to low gold.I would recommend the game to anyone who loves rogue likes, warhammer frpg, dark settings and hard games. Its still in alpha and a lot of bugs have to be killed but overall it looks and plays already fantastically.  "

								Game's dark undertone stressed by amazing narration, fantastic art style and a game play, that keeps you on the edge of your seat as you watch madness filled, lovecraftian-like jurneys unfold, this is one of the rare instances where the early access game has great ammount of content, so much so that it feels like a complete product.Really worth considering if you enjoy rouge like mechanics, turn based strategy and dark fantasy/horror.

								A strangely compelling combination of old Final Fantasy-style turn-based combat, procedurally-generated dungeons, perma-death, town management, and loot gathering, and a nifty ""stress"" mechanic that works well with the punishing difficulty and the Lovecraft-inspired monsters. I can't stop playing.			"
