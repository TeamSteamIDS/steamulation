  TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE   The game is broken and unfinished. The game is abandoned by the developers.  They're censoring constructive negative criticism. They essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran. They're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.The GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered ""Finished"" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.MarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.  Eventually articles surfaced stating that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed  ""In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game.""  and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: Towns is very much alive and kicking.	 Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: So so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success. Dictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/or townsgame.com forum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for ""Boycotting"" ""Harassment"" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.ConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were ""burnt out"" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.RefundValve added a refund addition to Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that could potentially allow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.Originally posted by Valve on http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?l=english:You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.FeedbackDon't hesitate responding with any constructive criticism that I could use to improve my reviews. Also note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.			"

												This highlights the worst part of Steam Greenlight.  The developer posted a ton of ideas, some good-looking screenshots, and pitched a solid concept.Before I even get to the review, I'd like to note that THE DEVELOPER HAS ABANDONED THE GAME.  He took the ""Early Access"" money, cranked out an Alpha-at-best version of the game and left.  He got another developer to theoretically try to finish the game, but the hopes of that actually happening are looking pretty dim.So as for the game itself.  You build a town to attract heroes to explore and clear dungeons.  Sounds good.  The execution is NOT.  It's a buggy mess, with villagers having AI and path-finding so bad that they often get stuck and starve.   You control which heroes arrive, can't tell them what to do, and can't even sell them items.  The crafting system is tedious and the building system feels like it's constantly fighting against you.It's a buggy, barely-playable mess with no endgame, few sounds, and almost no animations.  Avoid like the plague.EDIT: The developers responsible for taking your money and running are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi.  I've been asked a few times to mention them here so if you see any projects from them in the future, you can remember this cash-grab and avoid them.			"

Buying this will literally be rewarding a thief with more money for ripping off others.Vaporware, Rip-off, Con-Artists, Scammers, Abandonware I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASE OF THIS ""GAME.""Update: Now with a New and Improved, Shill-run Forums!! Yes that's right! Get a completely unbiased opinion, so long as it's approved of by the new mod!! From bad to worse, this game REEKS of dishonesty. Stay away!! The devs  became ""burned out?!""  Of course, they got that way AFTER their game was sold... unfinished. Hope they enjoyed the 2 PLUS Million Dollars they made. I will never again buy from ANYONE who was involved in the making of this ""game"" . Rip-off artists, and scammers. They KNOWINGLY sold this game unfinished. This game was NOT an Early Access Game, but ""realeased as done."" They should refund the cash paid for the game, and remove it from Steam. Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! And BE WARY OF TOWNS TWO:The Con Continues[/b] "

												This game has been abandoned by the devs over and over again. During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as ""boycott thread"" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums. I have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!Here is why I was supposedly banned...You have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Towns General Discussions"": YetiChow Moderator 3 hours ago Deleted thread ""Don't buy this game"". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.YetiChow ModeratorI was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.Apparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.UPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!After a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:YetiChow ModeratorFor the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the ""second dev"" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.  http://i.imgur.com/Auuyizz.jpgSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE SMP DEVELOPS!!  They obviously have extremely poor judgement putting a guy like this in charge of their steam forums. "

												Original Dev took the $2mil Alpha sales and scarpered. Sold it to a second dev who said, after abandoning it:“I hope you are not too disappointed. And if you are: I’m really sorry. I’m quite new to indie game dev and I couldn’t really see that the game sales were declining that rapidly. I guess if I had more experience I would have seen it comming …,”Abandon ware.It's a real shame - what exists is broken but playable. If they delivered what was initially promised it would be a cracking little indy game.Moral of the story? Don't buy Alpha, Beta or Early Access of anything. Ever.			"

												So if Moderators or others push you to the demo, its not the best way to understand how the game is or how well it runs. First off, the demo does not give you the greatest feel for the game, just proves that the basic mechanics are working....I'd also like to point this out, HEAVY MODERATION in the forums, see link below. If YETI does not agree with you or finds a reason to delete ""negative"" posts, he will. If you post in the forums, YETI will justify and ""help"" you make sense of the horrible AI and how the game was built as SH***Y as it is but it was all done like this on purpose. He responds to every comment to mask the amount of players who feel the same way about the game. Discussions that become overwhelming negative he will delete because the discussion is going in ""circles"" Check his own delete blog on the link below. This type of moderation in the forums is one attempt to keep the game alive. He HEAVILY defends the game at every chance even with all of the people arguing with him. The only people who agree are Lvl 0 Steam Users with Blocked Profiles.... Enough said. http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/Now for the review:The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted. Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all. To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time. There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then. Development is next to nothing, look at the update history.			"

												Ok, I have a lot of hours in this game so maybe you could say that I got my money's worth - or maybe I just have a penchant for watching little pixel people go about their business(dying of starvation or eating everything in sight, dry-humping monsters to death or walking straight into a village full of hostiles) .. actually, I also go afk a lot and hang out in the kitchen.. that might be why :pAnyway, I do not recommend buying the game in its current state:- very buggy- rough and unpolished(for example, last time I played the little pixel people had like 2 frames of animation when walking and looked like they were dry-humping monsters upon attacking them). - feels incomplete, as in missing game-play features.- very, very slow updates(if you can even call it an update when one or two little bugs are fixed after several months).- Dishonest developer: this is the biggest reason for me right now as to why you shouldn't waste your money on this game. Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns..

												SEE BELOW FOR AWESONE ALTERNATIVESThis games has a terrible AI. Citizens will walk right into enemy territiory to pick up a random bone. They will refuse to stop working and starve to death. They are worthless at producing food weapons or anything else. Forget the grandoise buildings you see in the screenshots, just building a hut can be a monumental task.The game is otherwise very buggy, terribly balanced and lacks a lot of features. It has been completly abandoned by the developers.I recomend instead;STONEHEARTH; A very similar game that is constantly updated, already has numerous features, great 3D graphics and most importantly a great AI. Has made incredible acess since it first realeased.GNOMORIA; A game that is also very similar to towns, with a similar graphics style and a fourth of the price or less when on sale. ALso has much better AI than townsCOLCKWORK EMPIRES; A game with simialr gameplay to towns but with a steampunk vibe. It is regularly updated and the game has made great progress since its early acess release.In other words all these games will give you very similar gameplay with better AI, and more importantly, a developement team which is on top of updating and talking about their game. Just do not buy towns!DWARF FORTRESS- Probably the orginal game with a town building survival gameplay. It is incredibly deep, and a is practically a cult classic. It is infamous for its difficulty, but you can find it for free at bay12 games.			"

This game had a lot of potential and I had a blast with it a few years back when keeping in mind that it was Early Access.  However, it was very clearly unfinished.I returned recently to give it a go and I couldn't find any new additions or alterations.  The game is, sadly, abandoned.

												If you want a Dwarf Fortress Clone with graphics, please play Gnomoria. This game is a very low quality and not fit for release. It is a bummer that this was one of the first game to be ever Greenlit. Contrary to the public belief, this game is not and never was Early Access, yet we got an Alpha Version of the game sold. The store page also says that it will be continuously updated, but this does not happen. We get a patch all few months, which tends to break even more things. The visuals are okay, but the menus are just downright amateurish, the tutorials useless and the game absolutely explains nothing. Hello Developers, it is 2013, wake up. You don't need to hold my hand, but if you don't explain how your game works, then there is not fun to be had. Crawling through half the internet to understand how the game works is not something you want. Gnomoria is way more intuitive and has a clear progress line, even if you never played this genre. Don't touch it with a 10 ft pole held by someone else on the other side of the street.Update May 7th, 2014:The devs have now officially abandoned the game.

												Held off for so long on writing this.330 hours... Must be a great value right? Nope, nearly all of it was idle in the background while I waited huge amounts of time for the terrible AI to get anything done. This game is a tedious unpolished mess, filled with either insane levels of micro management or giant periods of idle time. The AI is dirt poor and starves to death doing basic tasks. Asking questions about it on the forums will get you told by the moderator how it's not a bug and is really your fault... this is only true because you bought the game.The dev also seems to think it's cool to appoint fanboy's and white knights as moderators. The Steam moderater doesn't moderate, he takes a clear side and bans people who disagree. Do not buy this game, do not support this dev. There are reasons why the reviews are mostly negative.Edit:Be clear anyone reading this that asking about this game on the forums will result in you being lied to by the few fanboys remaining, everyone else who'd give an honest answer has been banned.

												I honestly can't say I'd recommend this game at any price point.  There are quite a few other games out there that fill the same niche and many more currently in development, e.g. Banished and Stonehearth, and sadly actually have active development staff.  Yes that is currently a problem for this game.  If like me you picked up this game back when it was first greenlit only to assume that it would actually get patched and improved over time I feel your pain.  If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.  I can't say I've finished a single session with this game feeling happy about spending the time there.  You want fun, look elsewhere.			"

Development of this game has been cancelled, and no refunds are being given. The game went through Steam Greenlight prior to Early Access existing, which is the only reason it doesn't have an EA tag on the store page.

												The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's ""Greenlight"" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.Towns was billed as a ""Dwarf Fortress""-type game, wherein you build a town atop a ""dungeon"" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The ""tutorial,"" if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.Don't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement.			"

												I really didn't want to give this a Not Recommended, but due to how things have gone with development i just had to do it... maybe i will be able to recommend it if it can improve or gets a massive price cutDon't get me wrong, the game is very enjoyable, maybe even to a point where I could consider it good, but it is however an unfinished product. A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O However, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended) If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever...			"

												I liked the game when I first got it. Sure it was buggy but it was in early access and the developers were making progress and updating and making it better. Then they released an unfinished product and gave up all together. I could forgive the game's mistakes when it was early access but now that it's released? No. It's not worth the $15 anymore. Maybe at one point but not now. Go play Dwarf Fortress of Gnomoria if you want to play a game like this.			"

												This is the game that made me lose faith in Greenlight. I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.I bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.I also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.Now many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.If only I knew then what I know now.TL;DRShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game.

												It's difficult to recommend this game at the $15 sale price (4/23/2015), while there are so many other (more finished) games on the market.The game was created by 2 people. Steam added the game in 2012. The original creaters stopped working on the game in early 2014, and struck a deal with a single person to take over development. That person discovered there wasn't any financial incentive to continue developing the game, and let the community know that he was stopping all work.(Reference: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/07/towns-called-malice-development-of-city-builder-ends/  )I like the game's concept of town management and plowed ahead with multiple game instances. However, I had to put the game down due to functionality. Sometimes my townies would starve to death instead of stopping a task to eat. They would wonder too deep even though you're supposed to be able to set the max floor depth. etc.TLDR: I can't recommend buying it. If you're still curious, download the demo.			"

												My children and I play this game. We liked the look and feel of the interface. The game was interesting and fun for a bit but little things kept annoying us. Issues like folk will starve to death instead of dropping the task they are assigned and eating. I guess making that piece of armor was more important that their own survival. The town seems small compared to other games in genre. The depth is limited to about 19 or 20 levels. Some other games in genre go below 100 levels.  For over a year the developer has been releasing rare and tiny updates. The game is not polished, but playable. I gave up on game and went to other games in genre that developers are actively making their product better. I'd recommend game for a few $.			"

												I was with this game from the beginning. From the moment I heard about this game in the Royal Indie Bundle, I fell in love with it. I played tens of hours of it through Desura. I desparately wanted this game to succeed because it was like a beautiful growing flower that would blossom with so much potential. I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion. Then Steam Greenlight was launched and when this game was one of the first to be on passed through it, I was absolutely thrilled. And then, it all went south. The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.Don't get this game. It's dead and abandoned. RIP			"

												So...where to begin. This game I remember seeing back in 2011 on YouTube and I thought it was pretty cool. Found it on Steam when I joined, bought it when it was on sale for like $5. At the time, it was still being worked on, albeit slowly, so I thought ""why the heck not."" Looking back now, this game had potential but was left to rot by the devs and since late 2014 has never received a lick of development. It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state. The A.I. has always had a mind of its own and is hard to deal with when trying to set up runners, farmers, builders, and traders at the same time. Not having even just one person assigned to just one tiny task could end up causing your settlement to crash without enemies even attacking, simply because someone wouldn't go and make flour so you can bake bread so your dedicated farmers could eat and go harvest more wheat to repeat the cycle. It's a challenge, but if you're looking for a basic time waster, this game is good for that. I can't recommend it, however, just because of the state it's been left in without further development. If it's on sale for cheap and you like a nice, casual city builder, you might look into it. But for full price, look elsewhere. This game is going nowhere and will forever be that way.			"

												So what is with Towns? I would rather say it's pretty dead. This game came 2012 to steam greenlight and was a interesting project, where you create a world in which yo have to make andventurers happy and not to be the adventurer.But what did go wrong?It's pretty easy. The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.What's wrong with that?So the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game. I got very disapointed as i have heard that and my money is lost, just because someone did not manage to get their things right and just because he did not have ambitions anymore to work on this project, he stopped! I want to say one thing. I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!I do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game. He earnend about 2 MILLIONS $ with it and left the game just as it is, UNFINISHED!I would rather recommend you ""DwarfFortress"", it's free, developed by only 2 guys and can offer you much more.

Sounds - None of the 4-5 sounds adds any value to the experience, what so ever.Graphics - The graphics are all placeholder at best.Gameplay - Has potential, but the AI will destroy any play beyond the first hour of play.Steam should have pulled this title a long time ago as it feels like the developer made it available only to go on a permanent vaccation right after.

												I like this game, but I don't enjoy it as much as I should. It feels incomplete. The tutorials can be done in 5 seconds where it seems pointless to do them and the tutorials don't cover enough. Some pre made towns would be awesome. A news ticker would be great. A lot of this game is tranquil waiting. You send your townies to do something and it starts off being quick, but as the town gets bigger it can take them hours to build a set of small homes. Its a game you can watch TV and come back to while it plays.Oh and to top it off.... I've played one single game around 60 hours and NEVER EVER had any town that looks like the screenshots. NEVER EVER. I might not ever in fact. That's just how the game is. I often have the game playing in the background on another computer virtually unattended.			"

Product received for free
												This game was purchased for me a long time ago as a birthday present. Got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of good hours out of this game, but it was abandoned by the developers and left in a painfully unfinished state. It basically went straight from Alpha to ""Finished"". They flip-flopped on actually abandoning it for a while - they hired a new guy to work on it, which failed within weeks of happening...twice. Then they talked about releasing a Towns 2, despite this game being unfinished. The last attempt at saying ""yes, we still care about this"" was in early 2015, when a dev's house was supposedly under construction, so he had no room/time/internet to release a new patch. Finally, they stopped talking altogether. Their forums are a ghost town. This was one of the unfortunate early failures of the Greenlight system.Been a while since I've played it, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥don't buy this"" that is already out there. The game you're getting is not worth a 15 dollar price tag.			"

												tl;dr: STAY FAR AWAY AND DO NOT BUY___________________________________________________________This game could have been good. But the Dev abandoned the project. The decided to pick it up again. Then abandoned it again (I think). Its pretty infamous for being one of the first games out of Early Access and the first promising Early access game that sold a ton of copies where the dev ""took the money and ran"". This game burned a LOT of people on Early Access, and is still burning people. I cant believe its still for sale. Its a bug ridden incomplete mess taht never got out of Early Access and is being sold as a complete game.Go play Dwarf Fortress instead. "

												This game is unintuitive, poorly done, very buggy, bland, and disappointing. I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.The UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.I was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.Update 8/19/2015:Just wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible. I know I wish I had that option when I bought this game.			"

												I've come back to this game a number of times and sadly I'm unable to recommend it.While the graphics are generally ok, the font used is rather difficult to read - its simply a very poor and quite small bitmap - I've seen much better bitmapped fonts, from java even a pure opengl application its not too dificult to implement true type fonts...If only the text were the only issue, I could get past that and get on with the gameThe real issue comes when you attemt to create a building, it is almost impossible to be sure (even with their ""2.5d"" cursor) if you are building on top of a lower level blocks, and don't even start on a roof I hear its possible but a blavk art indeed.  A simple ghost block above lower blocks might help, but its just really confusing trying to work out whats going on.			"

												I have to give this a thumbs down.  It is very buggy, a very steep learning curve, and totally random.  I got really lucky in one town, and found a merchant willing to buy dirt, and sell me gold and some magical crap.  I gave 2 townies full stets of gold stuff, and they were slaughtering everying left and right.  I had a good working farm and started to grow my town, getting heros, but building took FOREVER.  I left the game running and the next day my build orders were not done.  I left it a few more hours to find that all my townies were slaughtered by some stupid monster, exccpt the ones with gold sets.  Well, kept trying to rebuild, but could never recover the population, too slow to build, too slow to do anything.  I just don't see this game going anywhere, really cool idea with little execution.Sadily, it has gone so long wtihout an update that I guess it will never be finished.  This game really had a lot of potential.  Buyer Beware!			"

												I really loved this game when I first started playing it. Had a ton of potential and it was very fun. If you wanna see a very good lets play and funny letplay of the older game then watch the sips videos on it. That is when this game was definatly at its most fun. Then gnomoria came out and had its fully 3d block system and the devs then decided they wanted to compleatly rewrite the game to have this feature. I guess many in the comunity wanted it but in my honest opinion this was a bad move. It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest. I would have highly recommended this game a few years ago durning its alpha but it seams soon as it hit steam it was pretty much abandoned. Like the other reviewers I no longer can even recommend buying this game. Maybe if it was 3 bucks but definatly not 15 like what its being asked for.			"

												This game hits a couple sweet spots for me, in that you spend your time designing and issuing instructions to virtual ""villagers"" (or dwarves, employees, etc.) and then watching them go about their virtual lives.  I purchased it rather early on in its existance, and enjoyed running through a few plays of the basics that were in place.  It certainly never felt even remotely finished, and I decided to walk away from it and give the devs time to flesh it out. They never did that.  The original developers lost interest, which is a huge risk for people who are paid in advance for the promise of a product to come, and effectively decided to cut and run.  They farmed the work to a new developer who was working solely for a percentage of future sales, and the small improvements that were being made never generated those. This game is not actively being developed and is not worth a third of the asking price in its current state, which is a damned shame, becuase this genre could use more finished games, and fewer abandoned skeletal concepts.

												Terrible game.  Development is slow to the point of almost being non-existant (6+ months between major patches).  The AI is bad, especially the player's Townies (they border on suicidal at times).  Heroes are nothing more than dungeon-clearing mooches that sometimes bring total death to your Townies by bringing a train of mobs when they run away.  Only one music track that continually plays.  Townies cannot tear down already placed structures and items.It's truly an alpha-stage game that is passed off as a release-ready game.  Look elsewhere for a city-building game.  Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria are truly better options.EDIT:  Also, do not listen to a word that YetiChow, the mod of the Towns forums on Steam, as he is a self-professed Troll that has no actual interest in the Steam community except to get rid of people who are critical of Towns and Town's developers.  http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=88t=8032&start=40&p=47838&view=show#p47838Everyone of the users that he's perma-banned on the Towns forums on Steam (listed here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/ ) were speaking only the truth about the history of Towns that included the actions of the Towns' devs and how they falsely advertised this game during the launch on Steam.  YetiChow doesn't want potential buyers to hear the truth because he knows that it will hurt the sales of Towns.  His only job is to be a schill for the devs of Towns.			"

HOWEVER, I must say this game is still the same POS as it was then... Hardly different.. Potential and My time WASTED!!?!?40/100Pros-potential (aha there was)-Some decent addons (this will make it just slightly more playable)-Not buggy (not seriously buggy, however it would be more enjoyable if you could think of all the problems as just a mistake)-:( still can't think of anything actualy enjoyable after my money was stolen for an unfinished gameCons-game will not be fixed (game is not gonna change now or ever GG)-AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid as hell.. ( they will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off so bad..)-Very boring and repetitive at times! (basic actions are way to simple and click heavy with very little aesthetic or enjoyment as a reward..)-Not replayable (since you cant really ever do much in the first play or second or third or fourth.. you will achieve very little in this game as everything takes forever)Don't BUY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRIDE AND WALLET!!?!!

												I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam. I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.  Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own. The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.			"

Next thing you know, it was just called ""release version"".  Nothing much has ever changed, and it is boring and buggy.  Character pathing is problematic at best, and the UI is generally wothless and confusing.  You would expect that a game with graphics this bad would make up for it in other areas like gameplay.

												One of the collective of Greenlight games that has been discontinued in its development.The developers have backed away from it entirely, after having instilled new ones to take their place.Though it has mods to take its replayability and value up a notch, it is not going anywhere beyond the most recent update.The game itself offers an interesting idea, where you are given a group of individuals who've managed to get stranded in the middle of a wilderness where survival is bent upon preparation against attacks from waves native slime blobs, werebears, skeletons, goblin-like creatures, and other manners of mythical beings. Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little ""Townies"" that inhabit the locale.Thus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.After creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.With certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.Other games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.I would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game.

												Edited at version 14d, in which development seemed to have a heartbeat again.The new update brings some cool new features, namely terraforming. This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their♥♥♥♥♥and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.Man, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.---ORIGINAL---I entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.Boy was I wrong.If you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start? The early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck. Lack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.			"

												|WARNING:|THIS GAME IS ABONDONED DO NOT BUY| (Unless you really feel like doing so)This game was promising but it was abondoned and very rarely updated by the devs. I can't deny that I enjoyed making a little town and watching NPC heroes come to my town to clear dungeons for me. I really liked the ideas and visions for this game but hence the devs, being the lazy procrastinators they are, it is definitely not worth your dollars.Do not buy this game in this current unfinished and abondoned state that it is. Try other games that centers on the same ideas as this game like Stonehearth.			"

												I don't recommend this- while I won't lie, it can be fun if you just want a time sink, but it will be very slow going. Building isn't easy, the Townies kill themselves more often than not, it's buggy as all get-out, and there really is no 'end game'- it's unfinished, ungainly, unpolished, and I wouldn't say you should buy it for three dollars, much less fifteen.

												This is the infamous game that has gave a bad name to steam's early release program.This was one of the first games to be available to purchase from a new (at the time) steam division which was intended to give funding to games which were partially developed and showed a lot of promise.  Back in 2011ish, this game was seen as having amazing potential. Lots of people bought the game, and we thought the money we gave would be used so that the programmer would work full time on the game.  (There is a big write up on exactly how much money was generated from game sales, I can't remember if it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more). What happenned instead, was that the developer took the money and stopped working on this game.  Disbelief, outrage, and anger from the community ensued.  No refunds were issued. Steam didn't withhold any of the cash.  So many people feel they were burned by this affair, that they swore off purchasing pre-release games ever again. And that's the real loss here.			"

												Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone. 5. Bugs.6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit. Really disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product. It's made me more cynical about buying into alphas, which isn't a good thing to be, either, I guess. Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.			"

I'm sorry but this is rediculious. Steam why are you letting games like this sell. This game you start it up and you die... You literally get killed.

												I adore Towns. I know it's not the popular opinion here, but I have spent a happy 300+ hours building and exploring and fighting. It was well worth the $10 or so that I spent on it a few years ago. In Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk. The gameplay is heavy in resource management and building but has a satisfying amount of fighting and exploring. Why are the reviews so negative? This game long been public and under development, and that development stalled and then eventually halted. There are lists of features yet to be implemented and bugs to be fixed. Many believe that Towns is an unfinished game and are very angry about this. My interpretation is that the developers were just too ambitious about what to include and ended up with lots of great features that don't all function perfectly. I think it's finished, just not polished.  So despite my positive review, buyer beware. Play a demo if you can. Think about what bugs get under your skin and what you are happy to ignore while exploring the game mechanics. Think about how many hours or what level of gameplay you need to shell out some cash. But I would buy this game again, even in its current state. But do not buy it expecting additional development - that ship has sailed.			"

												The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try Gnomoria. It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.			"

												Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.  Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.  Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard.			"

												As many others have been stating, this game has long since been abandoned. I used to play this quite a while back, and while I did have fun and enjoy it at times, it lacks in quite a few things that could've been improved to be much better. The game has quite a few glitches and issues, and I think it's a shame what happened to it. It could've been a much better game than it is right now. It has some potential, but I'm disappointed that the makers have stopped entirely, and I wish that I hadn't spent the $15 on it that I spent. This game has become one of the only games I regret purchasing.Likely the creators and developers do not have enough support, and things probably got too complicated. While I understand everyone and all developers have their own life and their own needs, I've seen so little effort into updating this game and bringing it back to life that it feels like the entire project is dead to them.It's sad when this happens to games. I've played some wonderful indie games before, but I'm afraid this one is just going to still be dead as it's been for so long. I wouldn't advise purchasing it, and I'm sure there are much better games that could be found of similar gameplay types.			"

												Towns is now the poster child for Early-Access-Gone-Bad. The devs took the money and ran. All I can say about Towns, is that it was the first (as far as I am aware of) game that mixed a usuable interface with Dwarf Fortress. The graphics were fine, and the music is meh. The game was really fun.I really want to give this a positive review because I got well over 20 hours out of this. I think I paid 15$ so I feel like I got my moneys worth out of this title. Would I tell you to buy it now? No. Go for Gnomoria. Trust me on this one.			"

												PENDING FUTURE UPDATES: As of now I can't recommend. This is a game that has a lot of promise but ultimately fails to deliver. The tutorials do not explain a whole lot, and are often buggy. (Random shutdowns.) There hasn't been muchwork done on the game. If you're going to sell a product, make it a playable product. One that delivers. The dungeon mentioned that is below the town? Not there. Character AI? Random, buggy to where it doesn't always respond to yourcommands. Everything else plays like someone put it together with a poor copy of RPG maker. I held off reviewing this for a while, because I liked the initial promise...but it has been months and months with nothing of merit added to the game.

												I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale. It's definitely more of a $5 game, not a $15 one. If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. *The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about.			"

After playing for a few hours i decided to leave it and come back when it's in a better state.And now this happens: http://kotaku.com/unfinished-steam-game-abandoned-after-thousands-bought-1572931721. Thats right. The developers just gave up! Got bored. Couldn't be asked. So they took their money and left. The game did have some potential but the fact that you cant even build a roof on your house without watching extensive youtube videos so that you don't screw it up and break the game is ridiculous.I got scammed and I feel sad about it. So now I'm venting my fustration through a review.Please don't buy this game. Although thinking about it you probably never would of done anway.  (Now I wait for the inevitable abandonment of the other unfinished game I bought Starbound)			"

												**** August 2015 Update ****Almost a year after being told the game development was suspended for ""home renovations"", there has been no word from the developers and the forums continue to stay without complaint (due to moderator Yetichow not allowing posts that factually state the game's status or factually state why the game is unfinished/needs improvement/general feedback).So, on that note, please make sure you avoid the game (unless you want to waste your money).  Read the REVIEWS of the game and disregard the forums (since Yetichow had decided to scrub them clean and ban any who disagree).   Congratulations, Towns.  You made it into the Steam group, ""ScamReport"".  You should be proud...(/sarcasm)****March 2015 Update****I wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.We were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014. Make your own judgement call from that...---------------------------------**** Initial Review ****Voted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.  Imagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.According to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!  Please note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not ""understanding"" how these type of games are to played.   That ""if we just gave it time"" we'd figure it all out.Screw that.Even over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)Avoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.  Matter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.  I will be.			"

												Why the heck is this game still for sale Steam??  Boo on you Steam.  Boo.   We should bring you up on charges of human rights abuses.  The cowards gave up on it nearly 2 years ago, and you still leave it up here for them to get more out of the player community?   Need a downvote on Steam as well as this game!So my review of the game.Well it showed promise for the first 6 months.  Had fun with it and was patched pretty often.  You could see it starting to come together.Then these two cowardly, piece of re-heated dead monkey lice they call Devs gave up.  Their names are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi if you'd like to read more about the story.  So then they give the development over to some poor schmuk named Frankenberger.  He couldn't handle it solo as he was more of a fan than a true dev.  So when he quit in Sept. 2014 that's exactly where this game has been.  Exactly.  18 month ago.So it sold 200K copies for $15-$20.  You do the math.  Someone got paid, and we got the shaft.			"

												The Short of it:This game has been abandoned, wait till a sale brings its price down if you want to try it.The long of it:Unfortunatly I can't recomend this game. I bought it when it was still young and worthwhile, full of proimise and hope, sadly it has been abandoned.Don't get me wrong here, I love the concept, I love the style and I love how the game works, but its unfinished, buggy and in need of some serious love. Perhaps the developers would be willing to part with it and hand it to someone who would be better suited to... finishing it off with all the features that I recall seeing on a roadmap... somewhere a long time ago....If theres anything I can say about the game its that its gotten buggier since I stopped playing it, perhaps thats just the age of my computer finally showing, but I don't think so.Its still quite challanging in and of itself, but like most of my towns end up, it is very unfinished, ""Hero"" mode and one other mode not implimented, and a lot of things requiring some much needed... laquer.If you are looking for a game that will play similarly to this one but has a more finished feel try Gnomoria or Banished. Hell even the currently WIP Hearthstone has a more finished and complete feel!Keep an open mind that games are always subject to change, and that, if this game is lucky, it will be worked on again.

												I wanted to like this game when I got it. I really did. I was intimidated by Dwarf Fortress and thought that this would be an equally fun little world builder game.No, it really is not.This is Dwarf Fortress's half cousin he really wishes wasn't kinda in the family. The menus are much less deep that DF, but at the cost of having what feels like very few options. The UI is terrible in general, and I found that after playing this game for 27.6 hours, I still felt lost and slow doing everything. This isn't helped by a TERRIBLE camera angle, and the entire game just feels in general like a poorly made and thought through Dwarf Fortress.If you want this game's experience, just get Dwarf Fortress and find some youtube tutorials. You'll thank me later, I promise.			"

Towns is sadly full of wasted potential.  On paper, it had everything going for it: resource gathering, micro management, needs of villagers, crafting, construction and combat. Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a cluster♥♥♥♥, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1. The graphics, well, it looks like it was made in the early 90s,    there were a few games using similar painted-art style, but I can't remember their names. The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not. Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable.   They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?  About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones.   Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are.   On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation.   They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise. Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working?   Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy? OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation:   a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns. Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game.   Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane. Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around.   It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

												i cannot condone the development history of this game or the moderation tactics of yetichow, a rabid fan of the game with a very sordid past with the game involving a long history of instigation, out right lieing, and baiting people in to arguements he can punish them for as moderator.if you found your way here and you think this game looks good, do your self a favor and check out gnomoria instead.

												Well, this game had potential to be great. Sadly it failed due to developer neglect. I'm sure the constant haranguing of the games rightfully dissatisfied customers did little to mitigate this, but as a developer you need to be able to look past that sort of thing and continue forward. Either way, the game is no longer labeled ""early access"" while still having several bugs and other various issues so I cannot say I would recommend buying this game.			"

												Honestly one of the worst game I've ever purchased. The original description and the screenshots made the game sound more then what it actually was.The lack of updates, The amount of bugs, And the very vague tutorial for the tools at start are enough to deter practically everyone from playing this. While a few people may enjoy it for a couple hours, That will die down fast.			"

												Don't get me wrong, this game is wonderful. I love pretty much everything about it, even if it is a buggy mess of incompletion. Like most people seem to agree, the one huge flaw is the fact that the developer abandoned it just because sales were declining. A truly passionate game dev wouldn't do that, and it's not excusable (especially considering his funds were quite sustainable, since this game really took off). If the dev didn't abandon it, I'd reccommend this for sure. As of now? Don't buy it.			"

												It was fun for a while, but ultimately it's nothing more than a good concept made into a hideous wreck packed full with frustrating glitches and false promises. This game was abandoned by the developers years ago before the game even hit beta, and people have barely heard of them since.A lack of content, development, and no goals to achieve all add up to make this game nothing more than a frustrating experience. Banished or Gnomoria are far better and will be far more worth your wallet than this.			"

												It started out as a nice game in developpement, but the human factor kicked in and the devs seem to have abandoned the game's final developpement stages.Don't buy, it's a scam at this point.If any game is made by Developer: Xavi Canal, Ben Palgi and/or Publisher: SMP, please use extreme caution when pruchasing their products. It seems they like treating their customers like suckers, lying about the game's legetimate value.

												This could have been a great game. Health and other personal problems have seemingly prevented the dev from finishing the game, if we believe the statements on the dev blog. Or maybe he took on more than he could handle. I don't see this product as a scam as some other steam users do, but knowing it will never be updated it's surely too expensive for what it's worth. At least I've had fun with it so for me it has been worth the money. I sometimes replay this unfinished gem and wonder whether a similar game will ever see the light of day.			"

												Before you read any further: this game has been abandoned. Any flaws, problems or glitches will not be fixed. Towns might have been the first Early Access game I've ever bought and it made me skeptical and wary of all future Early Access titles. It has a great premise that is executed poorly and although you might have a bit of fun with it for a few hours, there is little here to recommend an indepth playthrough.I don't mind isometric, retroish graphics but these are, more often than not, absolutely annoying to look at. Towns has gone for a sort of Populus/Simcity kind of look, all graphical tilesets and while I think some of it works, particularly outside of the Town in the woods and forest, it often just looks totally ugly. There's no definition or clear sense of layering; what lies in front of things and behind other things can be really hard to tell. When you do have a Town, it all runs together and looks like someone who just found out they can download Final Fantasy sprites and has mashed them all together. Certain textures really grate on the eyes, particularly the water texture which you see a lot of.Controlling this game isn't much better as the inteface is awful.  I've played a lot of games with clunky interfaces and struggled my way through them but this might be one of the worst. Absolutely nothing about it works properly; you'll probably have to hit every key on the keyboard to figure out what does what and even then, attempting to divine the systems that control anything in this game is like trying to scry the future or turn lead into gold. Towns had a lot of potential for growth (with a bad launch, but hey, potential?) - I mean, running a town built over a dungeon and attracting heroes, managing the enemies that come out, building the town up with facilities for the adventurers? It sounds like a perfect blend of Recettear, Diablo and Dungeon Keeper. But this is not that; Towns is a shoddy, abandoned game with very little to recommend it. It usually comes on sale for 7.49, discounted down from 14.99. It is not worth playing at either price and the fact they want you to pay $15 dollars for an abandoned game is repulsive. You shouldn't be paying for abandonware - speak with your wallet and say no to Towns.NOTE: Steam shows 0.1 hours on record but I know for a fact I played at least a day of this - it felt longer, honestly, but trust me you don't need a whole day to see the flaws in this one.

												Steam Greenlight is a great idea but like all great ideas, people have habit of taking advantage of the situation and Towns is made by some of these people. The ""About the Game"" part of the store page lists features that either barely work or will never make it to a final build as the developers have moved on and left the game in a terrible condition. I didn't pay full price so I'm not upset by the matter but hopefully people will read these reviews and stay away. I'd rather throw my money away on Steam Backgrounds rather than games that are never going to be finished.			"

												Not worth any value to play. The game has no depth in story or play since. It is really just a low graphic, insanely frustrating sandbox. Yes you can have fun for the first 30 minutes of game play, while you try to learn the ropes of the game and see how far down in the dungeons you can go. After a while you just either get frustrated at all your towns people not doing what you wnat them to, or everyone gets slaughtered by some random monster. The game doesn't have any potential at this point.			"

While it was fun, anyone who plays this game for any length of time will realize that it's unfinished both in terms of balance and requested/necessary features.There are other games out there that, while they might not be as user friendly, greatly surpass this in terms of quality.Also I discovered recently that the devs decided to halt all production on the game, citing it as 'stable' after a year with no updates, leaving disgruntled fans all over the place and at the same time touting they plan to make a sequel. If they seriously think Towns 2 is going to make it on steam, they're kidding themselves with an almost religious fervor.			"

												While Towns clearly had potential as a city builder/simulator with hints of Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, the development of this early access title has officially been abandoned. This means that no further updates will be made, plus it will very likely never reach ""full game status"".While there might be opportunities for talented modders to salvage what is left, paying customers will inevitably feel cheated. Buying the game at this point is a waste of money and time, unfortunately.			"

												I loved this game when it first came out, Looked forward to the development of the game. Unhappy with the changes they made to it, makes it impossible to get more villagers. Also, it's a shame the devs abandoned it like they did. I get it they made some money and are done with their paying customers. Just a shame is all. it had a lot of potential.			"

If this were stable and had half the features and functions promised, I'd give it a solid recommendation; however, being in it's current state don't waste your time or money.			"

												I don't recommend this, simply for the reason that the developer of this game doesn't deserve a cent of anybody'd hard earned money.Sure, the developer must have put some extensive work to get this game up and running, but the game got put through on Steam Greenlight, it was released as ""alpha"" and then the developer abandoned the project, using the excuse that he's ""burnt out"". Yet, the developer is working on other projects, AFTER he took everybody's money. Everybody gets burnt out and frustrated at times, but why just abandon the project altogether? Especially when so many people paid for it, expecting patches, fixes, new content, etc. The game is fun, and it's good for what it is... but it will unfortunately most likely never be finished.			"

Not saying anything.The premise of the game is solid just it still lacks so much that would make it a good game, is it playable sure and you could probably have more then a few fun hours but the fact remains we shouldn't be rewarding devs who just dash off with our money like that. Was the first and last time I put any money on an early access game.

												I wanted to like this game. I really, really did. I played this for days, almost obsessively. It almost seemed like it was starting to get better, after many hours of having it constantly crash on me, I got into the habit of saving compulsively. After losing progress, hours upon hours of progress I'd start anew, stronger, faster, better prepared. But I don't think it was ever as fun as it seemed at the time. It was horribly tedious. I often had another game going on another system at the same time, as I waited for things to happen in the background. That's not a game. That's a simulation. And if I wanted to play a simulation, I'd run one with more polish and more things that were interesting to watch. This has neither. I'm certain there's something similar, better, out there. Find it. Play that instead. Don't waste your time like I did.			"

FREEZE! Before you even think about buying this game, let me ask you a few questions. Do you like unfinished games that try to pass themselves off as ""finished""? Hopefully not.Do you like extremely buggy and unplayable games that make vanilla Bethesda games pale in comparison? You really shouldn't!And finally, do you like wasting money on a game that promised continual updates? Of course not!""Towns"" is the epitome of unrealized potential. Lazy developers took what would have been a decent time-wasting game and somehow managed to turn it into a mess.

												Towns was a fantastic concept, something that I had been looking for for a long time. As the game was ""improved,"" however, I quickly lost interest. The game is dead. It has been for years. The only good thing I can say today about Towns is that it tought me a valuable lesson about impulse buying. Do not learn that lesson the hard way. Do not support ""cash grabs"" like Towns. Do not support SMP. This game could have been great. Instead, it ended up half-finished and abandoned like so many other early access titles. Avoid this game like the plague.			"

												I hate to give bad reviews, but this game deserves it.  I was one of the many who jumped in early when this game was first released, mainly on the promise of what the devs said it would become.  I played the game a lot back in late 2012 and early 2013 and enjoyed it for the most part, but there were lots of things that still needed to be fixed, most notably the AI and the way it would handle performing tasks with your villagers.Reinstalled and played the game again a few months ago.....and found that nothing had changed in almost 2 years!  Reading about how the original dev abandoned the game and ""sold"" the rights to someone else is almost heartbreaking.  Indie games have a bad name with a lot of casual gamers because of behavior like this, and I'm ashamed that I contributed to this jerk walking away with more than $2 million in sales.			"

												I played this game back when it was in alpha, back when there was still active development and a very active community. A friend of mine did a Let's Play of it and I enjoyed what I saw and played. Sadly, the last developer has finally called it quits, and I personally doubt this game will ever leave its alpha/beta state. It is fun micromanaging your town, trying to get immigrants to come to it and attract heroes to it as well, but the food system seriously needs to be reworked. My villagers can go all the way down to the bottom of my mine before needing to come back up again to eat, and since your town can experience hunger lock (Where you don't have any food at all and all villagers can't do anything due to starvation), expect a massive kill off if your food supply ever dwindles to an incredibly low number.There was a lot of potential behind this game, enough potential that I threw my money behind it back in 2011. Sadly, that potential will never be truly realized since its own developers and the last man working on this game gave up on it. If there ever is a Towns 2, I will not buy it due to the lack of interest the developers had in the first game.			"

												Don't buy this.  Don't even consider it.I made the mistake of thinking this was a near-finished product that would be a bit easier to play than Gnome Fortress.  Not as complex but you know- a town simulator of SOME degree.  So I bought it more than a year ago.  The ""tutorial"" was garbage, as was the interface, the gameplay- basically everything was atrocious to one degree or another.  I promised to never touch it again until it was released in a finished state.News: IT WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.  Seriously.  Look at http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=11402.  They're done ""updating it.""Basically, this was a Greenlight product that was released before it should have been.  This is the one game that made me completely cautious of ever supporting any Early Access title whatsoever- AND THIS WASN'T EVEN EARLY ACCESS.  IT WAS RELEASED AS A FINISHED PRODUCT.  FOR 15 DOLLARS.This is a perfect example of what developers have the potential to do with your money.  Promise to make finished products and then back off and reap the rewards without any reprimand.  Sure, it sucks that the developer got burned out but he should have realized what he was doing before he was able to put this on Steam as a completed game.  And shame on Steam for allowing it.Don't buy it.  Don't touch it.  Just don't.			"

While it is a good game, it is unfinished and not all of the features that have been mentioned throughout development has been implemented. The developer has taken the money and has run off to make a new game so that they can undoubtably do the same thing again. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT SUPPORT THE EXTORTION OF TRUSTING CUSTOMERS.			"

												This game itself was quite fun when it came out on early access ages ago.  I had a couple of extended playthroughs even though it was buggy and clunky, but it was fun nevertheless and showed heaps of promise.However, it was never completed, there's no signs that it ever will be, and so it joins the growing ranks of unfinished early access games :/If it was priced at a couple of bucks, I'd say get it and you'll get a bit of fun out of it.  But not at the current price for an unfinished game, with no sign it will ever be completed..			"

The AI is this game is more brainless than the original AI in Master of Orion 3.Run away, don't read about the game, if you see what it was supposed to be you will just be sad that it never made it to that point.

												Disappointing.This game is a clear example of why one should be cautious when buying into a beta, alpha, or early access title. When I bought into this, Towns was in early alpha, and looked like a promising graphic upgrade to dwarf fortress. However the game is not a completed product, missing many of the features that were promised by the devs, and full of bugs. The devs left the game in a beta state.That being said I did get some enjoyment out of the game. The base idea for the game is a good one, and what is there is fun to play. However it gets old quick. I come back to the game every now and then, play an hour or two, and get bored again. All in all it was fun while it lasted. It is an unfinished game, and a good reason to be wary of early access games.  "

There are better games for town building and better games for dungeon adventures. While this game mixes them both, it does so it a very lack luster way. If later on down the road there are some sort of objectives, quests, goals, or really anything to help give the game some momentum it may be worth revisting. For now however, I cannot reccomend this game. 4/10			"

Towns is nothing but a reskin of Dwarf Fortress (A FREE game with graphics mod already available and better also for free) with no intresting mechanics, a poor tutorial that will frustrate those not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, among techinical issues I experienced (frame drops galore on Mac). Towns is also infamous for being one of the first projects taken off of Steam Early Access. That basically means the dev, knowing it was unfinished, decided to take his project off leaving the current version available with no future updates. An unfinished project that sets a terrible, unfortunate precident for furture projects in the Early Access program.			"

												Definitely not a fast paced game.  Be ready for a tutorial that waves in your general direction and then says ""you'll figure it out"".  I seriously recommend looking at the demo before trying this, as the game needs a lot of work.

												In a nut shell, Towns didn't make any sense. The game was extremely boring and quite dull. There are many better town builder games out there which are very similar, but better, then Towns. At first glance the game seemed interesting and new, but it turned out to be buggy and unpleasant. It being the one of the first few games to get Greenlighted, Town had a lot of potential. Some of the blame for the flop of Towns goes to the developers. I feel like these Devs almost completely ignore there game and get out around 2 patches per year. For a game that is still this buggy the devs should be working harder. The upside to Towns was it gave me a hour of mediocre fun. Overall, don't buy Towns.3.9/10 Sloanster Score			"

You'd need to accept the challenge that it'd be and work things out on your own for the most part but when you do, its fun.I lasted 13 hours before I got tired of it and the minor bugs i had run into at that point. All the same, I cant recommend it, especially at the ridiculous price they are asking. I got it for like 8 bucks near the beginning of development so saying 5 bucks is worth it still applies. "

												Unfinished game that somehow jumped from ""alpha"" to a finished game in the span of a week. At launch day, the game had such devastating bugs that made it mostly unplayable, and only some of those fatal bugs have been fixed in the year after the launch. There isn't really much actual gameplay involved, that portion of the game is out of balance and broken. Most of the things in-game don't actually do anything, they're just decoration and ""make believe"". Once you get food production running (and half of that is broken due to new patches implementing flawed animal feeding system etc), there's no longer anything interesting to see. Unless you like wasting your time building pointless things. I suppose some people do like that, but I don't. I would've actually liked to see some of that ""city management"" in the game instead.

												The game has an interesting concept and was the first Greenlight title.  Take a typical RPG setting and control the town instead of the heroes.  Your job is to build up sufficient infrastructure to attract and keep heroes happy for...some reason.  Who knows.Most of the 36 hours I spent playing were staring at the game in frustration trying to get it to work.  It has some similarities to Dwarf Fortress but it felt like I didn't have as much control.As others have said, get Gnomoria instead.  Cannot recommend this game to anyone.However I must give Towns at least a 1/10.  Due to its incredibly broken and frustrating nature, I had to look up help on YouTube and that led me to discovering Sips for the first time.  So thank you Towns for helping me find one of my favorite YouTubers.			"

												The game has an interesting concept and was the first Greenlight title.  Take a typical RPG setting and control the town instead of the heroes.  Your job is to build up sufficient infrastructure to attract and keep heroes happy for...some reason.  Who knows.Most of the 36 hours I spent playing were staring at the game in frustration trying to get it to work.  It has some similarities to Dwarf Fortress but it felt like I didn't have as much control.As others have said, get Gnomoria instead.  Cannot recommend this game to anyone.However I must give Towns at least a 1/10.  Due to its incredibly broken and frustrating nature, I had to look up help on YouTube and that led me to discovering Sips for the first time.  So thank you Towns for helping me find one of my favorite YouTubers.			"

												There were no refunds.There was no time.Only fire.And then nothing.These two devs had a chance to make something really truly cool and wasted it with petty nonsense, if you cruise the forums for even a minute you can see what I mean. No matter what they do at this point it will be too little too late, the worst of the ideas they have is to start working on a sequel because it would be easier to cut and run then actually fix things.

												I bought Towns on sale just over a year ago...in that time it has received a few updates and undergone some changes.  However, this does not change the fact that this game left an utterly appalling impression upon me not only with the game but with the people working on it.  The tutorials were shamefully unhelpful, the gameplay was unintuitive, and the art style was unique but lead to an overall crude feel due to the games clunky play.As time has passed I'd expected this game to get refined some and updated to assauge some of the issues I had...but to this date the progress has been glacially slow and it remains the same lump of an overcomplicated mess that it always was.  Perhaps I'm being overly spiteful given my own impressions, but I can't for the life of me find any redeeming features about this game after it has remained the same awful product for so long.It's possible that you might enjoy this game, but I would heartily advise in-depth research about it, if not choosing a different product outright.

												I'll keep this short, This game has a learning curve thats quite steep, and it will be about 3 games before you figure out the basics. By the time you have a thriving town that can sustain itself you'll feel very acomplished. Soon though, things stop being so rewarding. Your townies are irritating at best, they can die from starvation because they straded themself 2 blocks high wile building, or drown because their path took them into water. Your buildings will very quickly trade estetics for fuctionality, possibaly a gribe for someone only as perfectionist as myself. There is nothing really to do after you figured everything out, because besides for a stray orge or something random like that the challenge is gone.I'm not saying not to buy this game, if its on sale by all means buy it, the learning curve wile give you enough entirtainment at least. But, this game is buggy and unpolished, and updates are nearly non existant, so it is a risk.			"

												In a word, Unfinished.In many -- Towns is a promising, but rough experience. Nothing seems to work quite as intended, the UI is a little finicky, mouse clicks don't always register in the right place (if at all), and digging is a nightmare. The further down you dig, the more erratic the mouse behavior becomes.At 15$, I'd say the price is steep -- comparing to Minecraft, which released at a similar price, the level of functionality is far less. Though then again, the requisite functionality is far greater in the case of Towns. However, this game is flawed for a far simpler reason, it was released onto steam with no notice that it was an unfinished, alpha game -- I'm an alpha-player, I love to play and watch as a game evolves, and I am _more likely_ to purchase an alpha game than many non-alpha games. I know many of my friends feel the same way, but  this game released to steam (via Greenlight) purporting to be a fully-ready 1.0 release, and that's just not what it is.I say wait. Maybe get it if the price drops to the 2-5$ range. It has potential to be quite good, if the development continues, but everything about the more general practice smells of a smash and grab on my wallet, and I don't much care for it.Weak accept on potential, Strong Reject on Honesty.

Even though promised updates kept me optimistic I have since fallen from that high for this game. Now it is full of bugs, new stuff that causes more bugs, and absolutely no community updates on how or where the game is going next.

It's cheaper, the UI is easier to use, there's more too it and its still being worked on. You can even name your Gnomes the only downside is that it doesnt have the Hero's that towns does.

This game sold pretty solidly for a bit before that, but when it was dubbed as being ""garbage"" by a majority of steam, it seems the devs lost interst in further developing it, and moved on.Sad, but true.

												I originally bought this with the thought of ""Woah cool, a town simulator!"" in my mind.  After all, the screenshots showed some very epic looking towns, and the game wasn't in the Early Access category. (meaning it wasn't an alpha/beta, but rather a full release)Boy was I in for a surprise.. and not the good kind.I can sum up this game in one single word - Awful.  There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.  I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away.  Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them.The game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs.  They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage.  There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears.  Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.Don't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.  These developers don't deserve any of your money.			"

I wanted it to be great, but between bugs, long periods with no updates or news from the developers, and a dying community (for good reason) I have to give up hope.This game was a great idea that was poorly done and evenly more poorly managed. At this point the game is unplayable for me and many others I talked to. The last update was months ago, and it was more broken than anything to date.Remember, this is still an alpha game, it can be fixed and I would love to change my review, however I don't want others on the steam community buying into a game that seems so hopeless.

												This game is abandoned by the developers so no more updates to fix this buggy pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I played this game before it came out on steam (so my hours played is wrong), i was in an area with no internet and had a new computer so i only had towns installed because it looked like a promising game; with awesome stuff to build, nice customization (many blocks and armours) and a cool endgame with adventurers helping your town, but after some hours of playing i'd rather just look at a plain wall for three days. The stuff you see in the screenshots are quite ""end game"", even the most simple structures, your ""townies"" will most often sleep eat and work outside because you won't be bothered building houses because the building system is VERRY frustrating because:1. Your townies do not indicate whether or not they can build something unlike Dwarf-Fortress and Gnomoria and your townies can't reach♥♥♥♥♥♥2. Most building-blocks require some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥items like slime ""stuff"" (can't remember name and this game is to horible to back and look) to make some stone bricks. Why? I don't know but it hampers creativity.3. You can't build floors unlike DF or Gnomoria so every story you add you need an extra layer just for floors (this may have canged, it was a long time since i played)There is a solution for the reatching problem and that is ""scafolding"" a block that can be stood upon, walked troug and climbed up. it's completley free so it feels like cheating using it. In other games that adds a scafolding sort of thing they usually cost resorces because scafolding tends to be realy good for moving around. The scafolding tool has been dubed a ""god tool"" by the comunity because it is realy OP. Other god tools are things like the ability to drop lava anywhere on the map.At least you can get a lot of hours out of this game, but i would definetly NOT recomend it. Go play Gnomoria (that is 2 euros cheaper), DF (that is free) or any other city builder but definatly DO NOT play Towns.			"

The menus were pretty bad, and it was annoying to build anything. The tutorials were terrible as well. I stopped playing it because I was hoping that it would eventually become finished with a nice and polished menu to build your town. I hadn't seen an update in so long that I forgot I even had the game. I do not wish to ever do business with the developers after this, and I will be very careful with which games I choose to buy and greenlight from now on.

												I thought it was gonna be a fun game, similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim City only in an older century, but what it is is similar to Infestation: Survivor Stories. In otherwords, unfinished, boring, glitchy, and not worth the $2.00 I spent on it.			"

												As a patron of Minecraft, I very much enjoyed musing the idea of having multiple people placing the blocks, especially in the form of a functioning town rather than a purely aesthetic one. Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not. Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.In conclusion this game was greenlit with the hopes of it being grown, expanded and ultiamtely polished. Here is how it looks. Greenlit - September 11th, 2012Last Monthly Update - September 21th, 2013Date of Review - June 24th, 2014It has been nearly a year to the date of this review since anything signficant was changed and it will be a surprise to see another.

												Seems fun, was kinda fun for the first 10 hours then you hit a point where you see all that is wrong with this game. It's unfinished, not supported anymore, hardly fixed with mods, redundant and to top it all you can lose all your progress if you arent careful and something goes wrong with AI (which WILL happen at one point or another). To try and make it possible to have a lasting town, you better read the wiki and follow every single tidbit of info. so basically you read a flowchart, apply it and you can see what it has to offer, which by the way once you read the wiki loses most of it's appeal. Another one of those could have, should have, would have games that had a lot of hype that failed to deliver. get gnomara instead if you absolutely want a game of this kind on steam (or even better, just stick to dwarf fortress)			"

												By general standard this is not a ""complete game""Graphic of this game is....let's say retro.AI in this game is poor.Last update v14 was released in September, 2013. V13 was released in May, 2013. The changes that was implemeneted in these patches contains very few contents and minimun bug fixes. It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""Heroes don't need jack. All it takes to attract heroes is to boost your population and have an area set up as ""tavern"". The ""tavern"" area doesn't have to be enclosed. Meaning that heores will be perfectly fine sleeping on the ground looking at stars just because you painted a 3x3 block purple and called it ""inn"".There is no intereaction between your townsfolk and heroes at all. They have very poor AI and die very easily if you are new to the game. Gearing up these heroes is not an easy process and sometimes random. You need to put the items on their path or ""hangout"" area and hope that they pick up the gear you want them to wear. ""Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.""The only RPG elements involved in the dungeons is ""there are mobs, they drop loot"". The only strategic aspect of the game is ""pray to the gods that when you dig down, you don't dig directly into a group of mobs because your townsfolk are dumb and they will not flee"" and ""dig open dungeon walls bit by bit and hope your townsfolk don't try to engage the mobs""There is minimun strategy and minimun RPG elements in this game. Townsfolk has a hunger bar, a sleep bar and a happiness bar and that's it. There is no ""leveling"" for your townsfolk and leveling for heores is meaningless.""Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!""Like stated above, there is no interactions between you and the heroes. About the loots, here's the funny part. Once you clear a dungeon, it's best not to collect loot from the dungeon because there's a billion of trash loot lying on the ground. Heroes will pick up gears when they feel like it. It's best to leave those in the dungeon.The best loot is often not dropped in the dungeon. Once you have a market set up, travelling merchants will come and they will randomly sell you the best gear in the game. So in order to get the best loot in game, you priorites a market over anything else. Regardless your progression in the game, you will be able to buy best gears purely based on luck.""Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!""Mobs in the dungeon will come to your town only when a hero engages them with low health and decides to run away. Those mobs will not stop chasing the fleeing hero until one of them is dead. This normally leads to a few townies dying because of the poorly designed AI. There is nothing unique about the weapon and item designs. They are very generic items. I wouldn't describe loots to be ""randomized"". 90% of them are trash loots and 99% of them are just junk on the ground waiting to be sold when a merchant arrives (if that merchant has enough money and willing to buy these crap. normally they just don't want them at all).In summary, this game is not worth its asking price. Yes, it's about the price of a very fancy subway sandwitch in Canada but I assure you that you will get more satisfaction out of that sandwitch than this game. If you are desprately looking for a game like this, wait for it to go on sale and do not expect any updates because it's not very likely. There is a modding scene for this game. It's small and I suggest you to go to their forum and check out more information there. Simply google ""towns"" and you'll be able to access their website and forum. Thank you.			"

Check the Official Forums, keep an eye out for developments or any news pertaining to this and if you see nothing new in the coming months (development with the new programmer starts in March, and this guy seems to really want to take the game forward), then I'd turn away and never look back.Then again, there is a good possibility that should things not go according to plan with this new programmer, that this game will go Open Source anyway, at which point you'll be paying £10 for some DRM and an older version of the game :P			"

												The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.  Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.You start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.One good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder.

The developers have abandoned their dream - something that happens all too often. Don't buy. It's not worth $15. I thought it was too much when I paid $5 for it, but I thought it would be continued. I was wrong. This is a shining example of why you don't buy into these early access scams.			"

												0/10Do not buy Towns.  It has ripped off too many people.Towns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.A few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.Fast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.phpUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed. The following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.So here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.I hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.Moral of the story.DO NOT BUY TOWNS			"

												I so wanted to see this game finished. As it stands, there are far too many bugs in it and the AI periodically commits suicide doing dumb stuff forcing you to repetitively micro manage everything. Imagine the old sims games where you had to tell your sims to go to the bathroom or they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants, now imagine the old sims games where you had to micro manage 50 sims spreadout in a ridiculously huge area trying to click on them to each tell them to go take a♥♥♥♥♥♥before they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants.I dunno where I am going with this, all I know is that the devs have abandoned the game and are treating all the paying customers like absolutely garbage. The game's AI is god awful and lots of seemingly simple things have repetitive and/or unnecessarily time-consuming or drawn-out ways of doing things and you will spend majority of your time making sure your AI don't kill themselves by being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The micro management doesn't only involve the AI, just controlling your resources is a massive headache. As a person who has programmed several Unity games, one of them ended up with 2 million plays, I have absolutely no idea what possessed the developer to take this game in such a sensely complex direction. I can understand that not all game programmers are 'game designers' and are incapable of seeing the flaws in their design, but♥♥♥♥♥♥at least run it by a friend who can give you honest feedback. This game went horribly wrong at the beginning and the dev likely abandoned it due to needing to spend too much work redoing 90% of the game to make it actually make sense.			"

												I have to say, I'm very sad. It's 2016, it has been officially released, and I can reiterate what some have said previously: the game feels unfinished. After messing around for 3 hours, I found that very quickly it gets unplayable. I will say that it is similar to Gnomoria in a lot of ways, so if you are interested in Towns get Gnomoria instead. I tried towns out hoping that it was just people pitching a fit but really, it's not worth purchasing.			"

												Well for what it is the game seems good.....LIESIt felt broken and unresponsive.  The controls do not work if they do respond and the people who you give the commands to tend to take them as suggestions rather than actual commands.Support for the game is nearly nonexistant.It is a great concept just needs ALOT of work and some turtle wax to make it shine.

												I really loved this game and got it way back before it was on steam or even greenlight. I was excited by all the updates and look forward to them fixing the AI with the towny's (cuz they could be just dumb sometimes).  I haven't played in a long time and came back hoping for new development only to find out it was abandoned b/c of burnout in May2014. What a shame, I paid my money to support the project and  it's sad that it will not even get to beta. The main Towns website and forums are down now. I would have given this a hearty thumbs up but must vote no. Tired of getting taken from developers promising something great, showing the potential but never coming through aka Cubeworld and many others.			"

												I so wanted to see this game finished. As it stands, there are far too many bugs in it and the AI periodically commits suicide doing dumb stuff forcing you to repetitively micro manage everything. Imagine the old sims games where you had to tell your sims to go to the bathroom or they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants, now imagine the old sims games where you had to micro manage 50 sims spreadout in a ridiculously huge area trying to click on them to each tell them to go take a♥♥♥♥♥♥before they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants.I dunno where I am going with this, all I know is that the devs have abandoned the game and are treating all the paying customers like absolutely garbage. The game's AI is god awful and lots of seemingly simple things have repetitive and/or unnecessarily time-consuming or drawn-out ways of doing things and you will spend majority of your time making sure your AI don't kill themselves by being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The micro management doesn't only involve the AI, just controlling your resources is a massive headache. As a person who has programmed several Unity games, one of them ended up with 2 million plays, I have absolutely no idea what possessed the developer to take this game in such a sensely complex direction. I can understand that not all game programmers are 'game designers' and are incapable of seeing the flaws in their design, but♥♥♥♥♥♥at least run it by a friend who can give you honest feedback. This game went horribly wrong at the beginning and the dev likely abandoned it due to needing to spend too much work redoing 90% of the game to make it actually make sense.			"

												0/10Do not buy Towns.  It has ripped off too many people.Towns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.A few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.Fast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.phpUpon hearing the news, I was again disappointed. The following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.So here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.I hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.Moral of the story.DO NOT BUY TOWNS			"

He knows his job is to acquire new prescriptions for his large community. Now, there are so many new drugs coming out every day, that Gaben has to ask his community, ""What new drugs should we offer at the pharmacy?""The community heard some neat things about this Townsicol, a do-everything drug. Gaben can only assume that his community knows what they want, even though they don't often know how to get the information about the pharmaceutical companies that made the drug, at least not as profieciently as Gaben. The people assure Gaben that yes, we want Townsicol in the pharmacy!So Gaben orders Townsicol, even though it hasn't gone through proper FDA qualifications.The people buy up their prescriptions of their new drug and GOSH!

Worse, there are those, like yours truly, that watched everyone throw up, walked through that lake of vomit, waded to the counter in all the puke they had expelled, and bought a bottle of Townsicol for themselves.TL;DR game's bad; developers ran with the money; don't buy it, ♥♥♥♥♥.

												Abandoned.Many others have mentioned all this before but it's worth warning anyone considering a purchase.It was a game with a decent look and a ton of promise in terms of what could have been developed but the initial creator was... immature in his handling of the project and, by the time someone else was hired sales weren't enough to live off of and the new guy had to move on.If it were still under development this would probably be a recommendation but it's current state, as a final product, it's nothing near what the initial goals had been, nor in a state one would expect.

THE HEROS FLEE, NOT THE CIVILIANS! the heros have apprently honored in Flight or fight class... The one thing that is super dumb that I find is... why did the remove that mechanic? I mean... ugh...

												This game is addictive and has so much potential to be great, but right when you start asking yourself where this game has been all your life, something bugs, or glitches, or you can't do something in the game that seems obvious.  I bought this game in beta and was excited to see how it would come out.  I guess I bought it on the last update, because there have been no more and now I hear that this game has been dropped from production.  I am dissapointed in the devs for throwing out what could be a potential classic, and I'm mad at steam for selling me a game that is still being made, then allowing the game to stop.  I had fun with it and if anything I think the modding community will pick up where the devs left off and give this game the polish it deserves.  I had fun with it and I tend to play it for days straight then don't play it for months then give it a few days again.  I would only reccomend this game if you are into modding, otherwise save your money because it is far from perfect, yet close, but at some times it's not even good, if that makes any sense.			"

												 Who ever wrote the AI for this game should be arrested for inventing a new kind of torture.While playing this game, I had the impression that is was ""rushed out the door"", as numerious bugs, AI problems and design issues were easy to spot. When first playing the game, AI problems are not an issue, however after 2 hours or so you will be banging your head off the wall.Here is a short list of issues I have with this game after 2+ hours of game play:1: Hunger cycle is too short. This is a game breaking flaw.2: If you have harvesting set as a higher priority than cooking, your peope will eat the raw food instead of cooking it.3: If you have item crafting set as a higher priority than chopping, your people will often times not bother to chop trees in tree farm to make stiff with.4: After a couple hours of game play, your people will only do the top 2 or 3 proprity chores, and ignore everything else.5: Never cook anything that requires 2 or more different ingrediants. People will often times stoop what they are doing, and the ingrediants they are ""holding"" dissapears.6: People often times drop what they are carrying and go do somethign else.7: People will almost neve use a stock pile or container, reguardless of how close by it is.8: Some times people stop doing a chore, and what ever they have in their ""hands"" dissapears.9: There are no sprite animations for sleeping, sitting down, fighting, chopping, harvesting, or doing chores.10: The AI is too stupid to eat when hungry most of the time. If cooking and gathering are not your 2 top prioritys, your entire population will eventually starve to death.11: An infinate loop of ""gathering - cooking - eating"" happens WAY too often, mostly caused by the short hunger cycle. This happens reguardless how filling the food is.12: Raw and prepared food containers do not work.I just bought this game yesterday, and have been spending many hours tryng to figure out how to play the game around all the issues. I want my wasted time back.  "

												Pending an Edit, I might change this in the future.This game has great potential, but it all fades after about 20hrs of gameplay.The early learning curve of the game is very steep. Infact, since there is no ingame help of any kind, you will be going to the internet to figure out some mechanics of this game.Villager path finding is always shortest route, regardless of danger. Hostile NPC's do have random and specific spawns, but more often then not I feel they are hunting me down.Building is somewhat confusing till you get the hang of it. The only drawback is, if you don't build in small sections the game seems to hang on larger designs. The same goes for most the resource managment. Even after giving out specific jobs, and setting priority's all my villagers do is eat and sleep.Fact is, this game has loads of pontential. But fails to deliver. At best this feels like an Alpha Version of a game.I do not recommend this game.			"

												Interesting. Where did all the reviews go? Wow. Starting on a blank slate here, maybe?Let's be honest: The premise of Towns is as quirky as it is unique: You build a fantasy town OVER a monster-filled dungeon, so that heroes will come and explore said dungeon- and with your town being endared by the monsters but at the same time able to provide important services to the heroes the game clearly has a tongue-in-cheek approach to both town-building and fantasy tropes in general.Let's be honest: This is an early access game. So you can expect it isn't done yet. It allows you to build a diverse range of buildings and services, and heroes do occasionally pop up and do their thing, and yes, there are monsters.And that is the catch, the premise is really interesting but at this stage, the features that are in don't make for a very interesting game.

												This is a game that, as of yet, still has great potential. I worry, however, about the direction things are heading, based on the previous few updates adding some fluff (buried towns?) rather than refining core gameplay. I definitely enjoyed Towns at first. However, there are still other games doing the things that Towns tries to do, and doing them better. At the end of the day I think that I got my money's worth. It doesn't have any huge complications in further development from what I know (Unlike Godus's need to scrap in-game purchases) and I think that this game can still improve.-=-=-=-=-REVIEW EDIT: Not too long after I wrote this the game imploded.

												I purchased this game a very long time ago, before it was even available on Steam. I enjoyed playing this game - A LOT - but it has long since been abandonned, and will remain unfinished. Therefore, despite the game having great potential (that will never be realized at this point), I would not recommend anyone purchase it.			"

												DO NOT BUY!It's remarkable that this game costs $15. It's even more remarkable that the game hasn't simply vanished. Every once in a while, I fire it back up to see if I can approach it from a different angle; maybe I missed something the first 30-40 times I tried playing it. It always ends the same; villagers follow no discernable path, nor can they be directed to follow a reasonable path, villagers will get stuck and eventually die of starvation, basic mobs that roam the surface will overwhelm even 3 or 4 villagers at once, villagers will not retreat if they are wounded, issuing building commands is fruitless, at best, etc.Don't give SMP or the devs the benefit of thinking they've made a good game. They stopped supporting it over 1 year ago and have no intention of ever proceeding with its development and improvement.			"

												I clocked up huge hours playing leaving this game run in the background and once over night after setting up a nice functional village. However, this game always felt like it was designed for a tablet or phone and was horribly unpolished and glitchy with poor AI. I can't recommend it because development has stopped. Progress through different coloured ores and baddy drops didn't appeal to me so I never bothered digging past the first few levels of dungeon.A nice distraction and would be good if finished. Unfinished it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps play Rimworld instead or I hear there is a similar dwarf game.			"

												Oh how I wish I didn't have to give this game a negative review. I can tell, that this game, if it were to be finished, would be a game I'd cherish. The aspect of this game, the functionality, the rpg/sandbox/strategy elements of this game are all my cup of tea when it comes to PC games. Unfortunately, I cannot give this ""would be"" game the approval for others to invest their time and money into. Every feature this game has to offer is unfinished and unpolished. Perhaps because there was a lot of tweaking and additional content planned for this game that have yet to be implemented. I really hope this game isn't dead for good, but it has dug itself into a rut with its massive amounts of negative reviews. I cannot disagree with them. It is wrong for the current developer to sell it as a complete game. Unless this game gets any further development, my negative review shall remain.			"

												There are already many reviews explaining why you shouldn't buy this. The devs took the money and ran. As great as Early Access and Greenlight are for getting new games out there you might not regularly see, it leaves the door wide open for these sorts of abuses. I've gotten burned by several Early Access and Greenlight games. No longer.			"

												This is essentially beating a dead horse - nobody is going to buy this decayed, partially formed abomination - but I wanted to just say that this game is the number one reason I will never, ever, EVER, buy an early release game again. The developers got whatever chunk of change they made off this and dropped it. The game had a fair amount of potential, but the people that bought it got burned, and left with an unfinished mess.

												DO NOT BUY!It's remarkable that this game costs $15. It's even more remarkable that the game hasn't simply vanished. Every once in a while, I fire it back up to see if I can approach it from a different angle; maybe I missed something the first 30-40 times I tried playing it. It always ends the same; villagers follow no discernable path, nor can they be directed to follow a reasonable path, villagers will get stuck and eventually die of starvation, basic mobs that roam the surface will overwhelm even 3 or 4 villagers at once, villagers will not retreat if they are wounded, issuing building commands is fruitless, at best, etc.Don't give SMP or the devs the benefit of thinking they've made a good game. They stopped supporting it over 1 year ago and have no intention of ever proceeding with its development and improvement.			"

												I clocked up huge hours playing leaving this game run in the background and once over night after setting up a nice functional village. However, this game always felt like it was designed for a tablet or phone and was horribly unpolished and glitchy with poor AI. I can't recommend it because development has stopped. Progress through different coloured ores and baddy drops didn't appeal to me so I never bothered digging past the first few levels of dungeon.A nice distraction and would be good if finished. Unfinished it doesn't cut the mustard. Perhaps play Rimworld instead or I hear there is a similar dwarf game.			"

There are far better titles out there (See: Gnomoria and/or Banished) That are still being improved.The Tutorial explains next to nothing aside from the VERY basics, the UI feels odd at best and at times needlessly tedious. Many players have expressed practically being FORCED to go through online guide after online guide just to understand how this or that works. There is also currently a petition on the forums for this game demanding a refund.			"

												As it is this is not a game you want to spend more than $5 or less on. If you are looking to spend a long time building and making slow or no progress this is it. There are a few tricks to pick up that allows you to actually achieve some progress but due to the programming allowing your townies to starve because they have traveled to far, or gotten themselves stuck its still a slow and frustrating game. I keep hoping that the developers will adress some of these issues and still nothing. The food issue is the worst as you can do nothing to adjust for it, once you go into the ground mining and exploring your townies will die and fast. The values for food and sleep run down to swiftly, and outside of stopping your townies from digging completely you can not keep them from entering the depths where once you go ten levels down they die from starvation. Some of the tools are intriguing, and fun to play with as long as you refrain from going past -10 in digging. Once you come to terms with these drawbacks its a fun little game. Oh yea to clear out the monsters in the dungeons you do get heros yet they are completely random and you must account for them as being three population wise thats how hard they hit your food supply. There is so much potential in this game and it is sad to see it left so broken. If given an overall score for entertainment, novelty, and playability at best its a 3 out of 10.			"

												Pros: Building your town one block at a time is good fun, and exploring the random environments is enjoyable,Cons: It contains a ""happiness"" mechanic that rewards you for not playing and -- annoyingly -- forces you to leave the game running on its own for long periods in order to advance well.Certainly worth a look, but lacks the long-term appeal of Terraria.

												I´ve voted ""No, i do not recommend this game"" but i really would like to say: ""Yes!""Why? This game really gave me some good time, cause i like the freedom in which you're able to build up a town, the retroish graphics and the possibility to alter the game due editing some xml files. Unfortunately the problems start right there: Since the engine limits the world to a 64*64 cube, you have to choose between dungeon roaming and building high up in the air, when altering the world generation (only a change in values). Last one is my favorite playstyle... or: would be, if the engine would not getting annoyingly laggy with more than 12 surface leves. There seem to be too many transparent blocks which affects the game as soon as you are giving more than two orders to your Townies. So, i am just not able to build high buildings without having a second lag, a second none, a second lag, a sec.. you get it. And that ""really grinds my gears"".Also, the menu is crap and the tutorial basically only explains how to move your mouse from left to right and bottom to top. Furthermore, there are some serious bugs, which are a total pain in the a**. Check out the Community Hub's discussion to get an idea of them, it is a long list.And yes, the devs spoofed those who bought this game, cause updates came in irregularily, were minor and the communication to us customers is worth mentioning.At the moment rumors say the devs are looking for someone new to heritage this project. We´ll see.After all Towns is a perfect example for everything which could go wrong with Steam's Greenlight/Early Access policy (or which mechanism else failed).I recommend to keep this game in mind, check for updates and buy it when the ♥♥♥♥♥torm moves on.

												I followed Towns before it ever came to Steam. Back then, the two guys working on it were releasing updates pretty regularly, and the basic gameplay evolved on a monthly basis. Then they broke up or had a falling out, or perhaps just got bored of working on this project, and quit rather suddenly. There wasn't any official word this was happening: the updates just sort of stopped coming out. This game is dead for no better reason than they didn't want to work on it anymore.			"

												(Game has been abandoned by the developers at what feels like late alpha / early beta)I haven't really read any of the other reviews, except a quick glance at some of the positives, as I don't want mine to be influenced by them in any way. I will note that many of the positive reviews seem to be accidental recommendations, and Steam needs to remove that as the default option :PSo.. Towns. Well it's a decent base for a game, and I generally enjoyed the parts of it which worked properly, but that's really where it ends. If you try, you can perhaps push 20 hours or so out of the game, but ultimately the bugs and complete lack of content and polish will leave you despairing at the developers, who have abandoned this game.The screenshots paint a pretty picture of flourishing towns and wonderful defenses, but it doesn't really apply to a real game, and you'll find yourself becoming frustrated at how fiddly everything is and how face-palmingly unintelligent the AI is, being almost unable to self regulate their most basic requirements. They almost seem suicidal.. but given the state of the game, I won't hold it against them.Ultimately what you see in the screenshots is pretty much everything, and at it's unlikely best (visually). I strongly resent paying full price for games being brought to market which are late alpha/early beta, especially when the developers dump them and run off with the money because they don't really feel like doing it anymore. That's theft where I come from. I don't think the game was officially an 'Early Access' game? Just Greenlight perhaps, but either way I won't be buying a game until it's fully released from now on, and I wish Steam would pull this game off the store and stop putting it on sale. It's a skeleton of a game and will never be more than that.			"

												The game had a good concept, and was being sold by steam for a long time to help the development process. The game was never really finished and barly playable imo, I suffered game breaking bugs every round. So 6 months after paying full price on the promise of a finished game, all I got was a tiny patch. few more months I found out that they will not be developing anymore. So how will I be reimbursed? I agreed to pay full price for a broken game to support the development, I am really tired of greenlight or indy games. Even Large titles are abusing customers with pre-orders. If you dont have a finished game stop marketing it like its a good product. I refuse to pre-order or support developing games, even ones I want finished now.			"

												These unethical developers took their alpha game and released it as a full game without any notice to potential customers.  After the backlash that ensued, they added the line about continually developing the game.  This is a lie as the game has not been continually developed.  It has been patched a few times since release, but really isn't much better than the released alpha it started out as. I REALLY wanted to like this game, I thought the concept was great.  I tried so hard to learn to workaround all the missing and broken features looking for the fun inside, but never found it.  I regret giving my money to unethical people and regret every minute wasted in Towns that could have been spent in a real game.  It is a very sad story as this game had tons of potential.  Ultimately, all it is right now is wasted potential.  Even for the sale price, there are TONS of better choices out there for the same amount or less.  Don't give these unethical people any more of your money, they've already made millions off the rest of us suckers.			"

												Got this game back when it was still alpha, for very cheap. Knowing it was alpha, and browsing the forums, the game was a very fun experience. There were contests, and a bunch of good spirited discussion, etc. I definitely had my moneys worth of enjoyment from this game. Sadly, devs started delaying new updates, kept cutting out parts of the game that were promised, and eventually ""settled"" that the game was finished in the current state, which let me tell you, is not even close to what it should be. From that point the game left its ""alpha status"", apparently went through a very short beta period, and it released here on Steam (I only have little time with the game here on steam, because I played a lot of the standalone version). Like it was a full game or something...The rest is history now, but in case you don't know, it goes something like this: The general public in steam find that the game is really lackluster for a full game, and complain. Devs promise to improve, despite insisting that the game is complete. At some point one of the devs simply disappears without warning. After some time, the guy reappears, saying that he had problems and he couldn't deal with the pressure the players put on him, or something of the sort... and promises to try and get back on the game again. Never heard of him since then...The game as it stands still has a ton of balance issues, incomplete features, and despite that I really enjoyed my time with the game, I doubt anyone can really enjoy it as it is today. The promise of future improvements and the community is what made the game fun, other than that I admit that it was pretty mediocre. I advise that noone buys this game, if anything to keep their moral integrity and not fund half-baked abandoned projects. If you still wanna buy it, at least be aware of what it is.Thanks for reading,Jon_jon13, self proclaimed ""watergineer"".			"

												tl;dr - Game is abandoned and overpriced, but if you pick it up for $5 you get your money's worth and have a new game to spend some weekend afternoons playing.Years ago, this game was fun. Nothing in this game hadn't been done before, but it brought a lot of things together in an enjoyable package, and new content was being brought out that added facets to the idea of managing a town catering to adventurers and trying to survive the dangers of a D&D world. Now, the game is exactly the same. That's the problem; the end of Towns' beta came purely because the dev wanted more sales for less work.It's really too bad that the development of this game became something of a hot potato due to fewer sales than the original developer wanted. Towns was developing in an interesting direction, and at the end of the updates had started introducing some enjoyably complicated ways to use basic water channels to make tasks easier. However, it never got to a fully mature stage, instead slowly petering out with updates being smaller and much less often. Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most. Something to stick on the wishlist and pick up during a steam sale.

The developer abandoned the game a couple of years ago so it will never get finished, but it is still playable, as long as you don't mind not having an end game. It's hard to pick up, difficult to master, but still very satisfying to build a working, living settlement.			"

												Re-Review.The game was abandoned, picked up, abandoned, shuffled to a new guy who gave up becuase Xavi lied to him in regards to how many copies were selling, and now its being 'worked on' again.every time the sales pick up. he disapears until they drop again, usually citing things on the official forums like ""The community is mean so i quit"" and other lame excuses. The game is unfinished and he has no plans to even attempt to finish it. Instead he added more to the tutorial instead of fixing the horribly broken AI.			"

												From initial release the dev team of this game has mislead customers on Steam.  Initally it was released as a complete and playable version.  However, it hadn't hit it's full version number in beta yet.  The UI was terribly implemented, the pathing, AI, inclusion of god hand mechanics to work around lazy coding problems, and a plethora of truly unproffessional issues plagued the game.  To top it all off, there wasn't a patch for almost 4 months after release.  Last December the Dev threatened to quit the game and then quickly changed his mind during the holiday sale.  Since that initial release there has only been 5 patches of minimal consequence to ongoing issues of the game - in fact trying to add features to an already broken game has caused even more problems than before.Even though now that the Store Page has been updated to read, ""Towns is continually being developed and updated to bring you the best experience possible,"" it simply isn't.  You can go months with zero dev updates on their work.  Patches are released up to 5 months period in between patches.  None of the prior mechanics implementations have been fixed.  And now the dev is saying he is trying to hire another coder.....The owner of this game is a self admitted full time employee of another company.  He has said on more than one occasion that they can't keep up with updates cause they have to work their jobs.  Don't support a game where the devs are not committed to it.  Let it die, and perhaps some of the more fanatic fans can take the code and do something legitimate with it.			"

												Towns has a wonderful idea but the devs abandoned it. Here are two games that are pretty much better versions of towns (Not Copies, just better)1. Timber and Stone: The lesser of the two but still a good game with a better combat system for those people who want to fight more enemies >:D2. Stonehearth: Stonehearth is (In my opinion) the gem with good graphics and a nice city building style. You will still be harrased but less so than in Timber and Stone but they will be changing that soon.			"

												This game was Super fun, Addicting, and Great for a graphical version of Dwarven Fortress Lite. However I can NOT reccomend this game no matter how many hours I've put into it. In fact I will be requesting a refund from steam after this review. This is a green lit alpha game. Most of us bought it before even then. It had LOADS of potential. Sadly here is why I say don't buy it. THE DEV'S HAVE ABANDONED THIS GAME! After making loads of money off the prospect of a finished title. The programer has gone off to ""Work on another title they are making."" Well thanks for telling me not to buy that one either. Finish what you start. That is the mantra that should be followed. There are Many other games that are better. However this game had soul... until it was abandoned. They aren't going to release it a freeware either. ""Because he may come back to it."" Sorry I don't think people would have supported NOTCH if he stopped in the  middle of minecraft.  Currently they are looking for another ""Java Programmer"" but they've been looking for 3 months now. No telling how long before they told us. No I WILL NOT support a game that is abandoned half way through production.			"

												So, Towns, as the game is no longer in development. Yes it is a hefty price to pay. But, i have played the ggame for around 111 hours, and still have not gotten close to finishing a game. I Self tought myself from my failures, and still love this game. Learning about the game from Old Sips playthroughs, i could still recommend Towns, because its still fun. Sure its not going to be updated any further. But its a nice break from the more advanced Prison Arch. and Rimworld, etc. etc.. It adds the difficulty that  like. Now thi coming from somebodys thats been with the game for years, and particurly likes the genre, and feel. If you love these types of games, you can still get some fun out of it. Though if your deciding between this game or one thats still updating, and can only choose one. Well thats obvious. But hey spare money. Do it.			"

												First of all, I have to say that the game has been abandoned leaving a lot of things unfinished, missing objects, UI and gameplay important changes that we'll never see... It's a pity since it was a very promising project. Despite of this, I've been playing enough hours to say that the game is playable, especially if you watch some gameplay videos before, as the game has no tutorials. You should know this before spending money, as you won't get a finished game with no bugs. For me, the 12$ I payed for the game gave me a lot of hours of fun, being worthy in terms of entertainment. Said all this, I recommend to try it if you see a nice discount, as it's only a game in development.			"

They tried to modify some elements like the most wierd one... wheat crops.To build your town you need to produce bread from wheat. At the release of the game on Steam dev simply forgot that when worlds are randomly generated you may be unable to find enough wheat crops...They resolved it by being able to plant harvested wheat. Could they do that before ?!Add to this the fact that feeding your population is a real burden and you got something real painfull ,uggly and controls are terrible.TOWNS is not a good game and even not an average game !

I never really did figure out how to do that, so that I could experience the 'sieges', or the deeper bosses.  I only made it to somewhere like the 5th or 6th underground level.Buyer beware.

												The game had so much potential, it was going great and was really popular. Towns was on the buggy side, mind you, but it didn't stop the game itself from being fun. Then the devs slowed down to a crawl, then announced it was done. They made quite a bit of money as this game sold pretty damn well for how early-development it was. Then they tried to hire a programmer and basically refused to pay him a living wage and the game ended.Game was considered ""Finished"" half-way into Alpha, is a great concpet but no longer developed, and the developers had the balls to suggest they'd make a sequel.Dwarf Fortress with graphic packs is your only hope.

												I've been playing this game for several years. I don't find it to be particularly buggy, but I'm really disappointed that the developer abandoned it. It really did have so much potential. I'd buy it again, on sale, if I didn't own it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else who doesn't like janky city. I'm known for collecting and loving misfit games.If you're looking for polished graphics or decent progression, this is not the game for you. If you're looking for a city builder that allows you to play in dungeons as well, this might be a decent bet if you can get it on sale.If you just like city builders that are well-supported by the community, go for Banished or something instead.

												So it's not an easy game to master, at times it seems buggy until you realize you're clicking the wrong block level since the camera can be difficult to manage at lower levels. However, I have played towns on and off again for almost 2 years. Many people have complained about the difficulty and 'lack of updates' but I have enjoyed this simple but addictive game. The hero system and village management is very enjoyable. Building with idiot villagers is actually a lot of fun.			"

												Note: I posted a previous review but I want to elaborate on it now.Overall SummaryThis game is having tough times. Sure the devs have took the money and, almost entirly stopped development (They release fixes, and such). But this is because at this point I can say this game is done! It has many features to explore with alot of replayability in it, the Alpha may aswell be finished. I can say if the community would lighten up and, maybe release a few mods this game would be even better!Though I admit you can say ""They took the money and, ran!"" you cant blame them after what they have given to us. It is a finished game that I beleive is worth 15$. If you dont beleive me, please try the demo and, see whether it is your cup of tea. Gameplay reviewThe game is highly replayable with diffrent challanges rising, and some just repeating. Your successes may be minor at first but they get bigger and, bigger, and even bigger as you continue through the game! Once you mastered one floor, suprise there is another full of harder, and newer enemies. You can send your soldiers down, but do you want to risk a seige assualting your town when it is ungaurded? ""Oh no! Robert Died!"", these all arise in your game, and I assure you it is a intresting game when on hard difficulty.RatingsCommunity: 7/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Replayability: 9.5/10Major Update Frequency: 2/10Minor Update Frequency: 7/10Features: 9/10StyleStoryline: GeneratedCharacters: RandomizedArt: BlocksMobs: FictionalWeapons: VariedArmors: VariesCrafting: YesRTS (Total War): NoRTS (City-Builder): YesSimilar Game: Geomoria, Tropico (Similar in the way you build the town, and buildings but not directly control the people's choices.)Recommended?: Yes!

Posted: September 9, 2014
												Ok, first off, I just want to say that this review should be taken with a pinch of salt. This game has had an intense history for the time it's been around, and after witnessing a fair bit of it first-hand, I can say it wasn't pretty. I'll explain further on, as it does actually have a small amount to do with this review, but for now, let's get to it: Is the game good, and what's it about?What is Towns?: Towns is a top-down isometric strategy-RPG-simulation thingymabob. Most easily compared to Dwarf Fortress, it contains similar mechanics but without as much complexity. You control a small group of townies which require food, shelter, and equipment to survive. The world contains many dangers that will constantly threaten your civilization as you explore the underground dungeon for sweet loot, and farm the terrain to create vast fields of food. Everything can be controlled with your mouse with ease, from planting and building to digging and fighting. Of course, if you want to use those hotkeys to be a bit faster, then I don't blame you. You'll probably need them. While the art style may not be to everyone's taste, it's easy on the eyes and makes the world interesting to look at, providing you with plenty of colors to play with and enjoy.Reasons it's good: I've personally been a big fan of games like these since I found dwarf fortress a while back. So, I decided to pick this game up on sale and give it a bash. And I can honestly say I had fun. The overall simplicity of it made it easy for me to jump into it and understand most of what was going on right off the bat (though that may be in-part from having played similar games before-hand). The game looks pretty good most of the time, the blocks you can use to build have a lot of variation and color to them, so you can create some really nice looking builds. The A.I. has been a bit derpy sometimes, and I found myself often needing to fiddle with what my townies were doing regularly, but that's kinda what you'd expect to put up with when going into a game like this. When it boils down to it, I don't think towns is a game meant to be played with a hardcore mindset like one would play Dwarf Fortress with. The game is a lot simpler, and I found it to be a good game to play on my laptop in bed before going to sleep.Reasons it's bad: Now, some of the things that were good about it, worked kind of liked a double-edged sword. Yes, I had to fiddle with my little civilization, but it wasn't on things I wanted to do. Usually I had to deal with occasionally derpy A.I. that did silly things like leave items laying around that needed to be stored, or not building things correctly. Granted, these were problems I had some time ago. I haven't played much of the game recently (which I'll explain why in a moment), so I do believe some of those A.I. issues may have been resolved. The art style, while nice and simple, is maybe too simple, and could've used something to make it feel a bit more... energetic maybe? I guess beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I think most people would agree that it's not a fabulous looking game. Good, but not fabulous. The simplicity, while nice for this game, could've used a few more things. Maybe a quest system, or thirst. Perhaps bigger maps would've even helped. Just some stuff to make it feel a bit meatier is all. Now, if you haven't figured it out yet, you should be wary of the game's history. If you want to dig deeper into it, go read the game's forums or discussions in the community hub. A VERY small summary of it could be boiled down to: The dev's got burnt out, people got upset, game slowed to a near-death crawl, and hasn't really recovered. The updates are few and far between, mostly consisting of bug fixes and patches. So don't be too hopeful about new content for the game, since in all likelihood, this is about as close as it'll get to a final product. Final Thoughts: I really, really can't hate too much on this game. I had fun with it for the time I played it, and I got my money's worth. But I can't whole heartedly recommend it either (at least at full price), so if it's on sale for a few bucks, then by all means, pick it up and give it a shot. I really only lost ~5$ on the deal, so I'm not too sour about it. For 5$, it was a nice, relatively relaxing game. There is the issue of the game's future though. Honestly, I'm not going to be the optimist, because from what I've seen and heard, optimism won't change much, if anything. I will say though, that I don't believe calling the game dead or abandoned is suitable either. Perhaps we can say that the game has become a husk, an empty shell of sorts. Or perhaps even more correct, would be to say it's a game that's suffered grievous wounds. The game has a chance to recover, and to stand back on its own two feet. Will it ever be what people hoped for? I doubt it. Will the community ever fully recover? Probably not. But, sometimes these things happen. Being too optimistic for something that very well may end up as a dead game is just as harmful as calling it dead outright. I'd love to see this game get built upon, and see amazing thigns happen. But after the toxicity I've witnessed, I'm not sure it's realistic to expect this game to be any more than a game you play in bed for an hour or two to chill to with some music in the background and a nice beverage. So if the game's ever on sale, and you need a nice game to fall asleep to (Warning: do not fall asleep to this game. Shut it off, and THEN go to sleep, lest your town become a graveyard), then pick it up for a few bucks and maybe buy a new CD from your favorite band with the money you saved. Like I said earlier though, take this review with a pinch of salt. While it is much simpler than Dwarf Fortress, it still has those FUN* mechanics in there under the layers of color, loot, and vast quantities of skootenbeeten. If you're not into the idea of watching everything you build up die from rogue werepigs, then buy with caution.Side Note: As it is somewhat important, it should be noted that the lead developer has been the focus of a lot of the controversy surrounding this title. While this should not be a major factor in your decision of buying/not buying this game, I do recommend at least making yourself aware of the situation with the developers. The details can be found by hunting around in the forums and whatnot, but here's a small summary to at least give you an idea: The toxicity of the community can really be traced back to the almost non-existant PR of the developers. After tensions rose, the lead developer was accused of basically taking the money and running, leaving behind a game that to most people (myself included) seemed like little more than an early access title. After minimal updates, and a new Dev that didn't stick around, things weren't looking good for the game, and still aren't. So if you have problems with supporting a company that made some mistakes from day 1, and ended up making themselves look untrustworthy, then take an extra pinch of salt with your final decision. I do believe though that the game should be viewed as it is, which at this point is something more closely relatable to a game you'd play in bed as I said earlier, without believing that it's a horrible piece of abandonware. 'Cus really it's not. It's a small game, not meant to be played on a bigger, more hardcore scale. It's got enough depth to keep you busy for a few hours at least, but not enough to really justify spending elongated hours on it. Regardless of what the developers did, or what the community says, it's a nice little pick up to add to your library for a couple bucks on sale.			"

												I think this game is overall not too bad. My main complaint is about how to A.I. for the Townies works. I just feel like it is very lacking compared to some similar games I've played. A smaller complaint is a lack of features, but I haven't tried modding it yet, so it might not be as lacking as I feel it is.Overall, not a bad game. You should get at least 10 hours of gameplay out of it before the lack of content will become a problem.			"

												Towns could be a great game. It has a lot going for it. From the unique perspective to pleasing graphics it has the base to be a enjoyable time sink. Unfortunately the execution leaves a bit to be offered.The game itself is quite good. You control a group of townspeople who have started a town that happens to be on top of an active dungeon system. You go through the usual gathering and building phases, but are also tasked with dealing with monsters. As you begin to dig into the earth looking for resources you find caverns and tunnels populated by the genres classic baddies. Everything from spiders to ogres await you hapless townsfolk as they dig deeper. You have to build up a guard force to keep you town safe from these creatures, and at a certain point you can even attract ""adventurers"" that are much more powerful and able to really beat down some baddies. It's a fun mix of dungeon discovery and building and offers quite a bit of content as is.The bad part of it is that you can only pretty much count on it ""as is"" the ""early access"" part of this game is seriously slow. There have been exceptionally long gaps between developments, at some points even rumors development had stopped. Issues between developer and publisher have not helped things. So if you're willing to shell out for the game as it is now you will get quite a bit of content, just don't rest any solid hopes on it advancing. The chances of it ever actually being finished and brough inline with the initial goal of  the game is even less. Because of the issues I simply cannot recommend this game to someone. If there were regular updates and some progress towards completion I would completely back this game, but as I can't recommend a game I don't think is ever going to be completed for someone to buy.

												Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game. It is STILL unfinished, nowhere near completion, and will most likely never be done. The developers haven't been active for months and sent the alpha out to die. Early Access was introduced partially due to the bloody mess of this game's ""launch"", and yet it never actually received the Early Access tag, and instead is being sold disguised as a finished product.Not much has happened since then, and it is unlikely that this is going to change in the near future. Yes, it has its charme, yes it had potential, but this potential has not yet been touched by the developers - and this game launched on Steam A YEAR AGO!If you are a fan of this type of game, I wholeheartedly recommend Gnomoria, which is not only cheaper, but also well underway to being a finished game. It wears its Early Access tag with pride, and releases patches very frequently. Just this week they released version 0.9.2, which tweaks, rebalances and fixes a LOT of combat mechanics, and the game itself works and looks charming. While not done yet, it is very much playable without the level of frustration Towns will give you.Stay away from Towns.			"

												Overall the game is very fun at first but doesn't really have any long term replayability.  I bought it because I enjoyed similar games (mostly Gnomoria) and wanted to see what else was out there.  If you enjoy that style of game you'll get a few good play throughs on this (maybe 10-20 hours, even though I got 43 out of it) and they you will run out of things to do.  If that is enough entertainment for you to be worth the cost then you should buy it.There are a lot of negative reviews about the game being broken.  It isn't.  There is a big difference between broken and not nearly as good as it could have been.  I don't usually review games but I didn't feel like this game deserved most of the comments being made in the negative reviews so I wanted to provide another point of view.			"

												Honestly I can say I really enjoyed playing towns, I didn't clock the hours not having fun. It is abandoned but if you can find Blue Steels mod its pretty worthy a play though. I am conflicted on recommending it but ultimately I had fun with it for 80+ hours so I can't just rate it down in good faithIT IS ABANDONED but again with bluesteels mod its relatively fun, quirky in a way I ended up enjoying, and on sale its like 5 bucks. There are far better games but personally I did enjoy Towns, I just hope one day it gets remade to be everything it could have been.			"

												Yes play this game it is very fun and maybe you will enjoy it as much as I. I have played a couple hundred hours on a few maps and never finished the dungeon or building a town. I played today and will be playing tomorrow also if all goes well. There are some recent videos of the game that may help you decide. Here is a You Tube link

			Towns is a super fun game on Steam. I am not super skilled at it but it makes me very happy and I hope some of that will be contagious.		

 to one. The bad part for me is it crashes now and again usaully in bunches then it will be fine for hours sometimes its hard to tell if this is the game or my computer probably both. This can be very frustrating to people I bet I know it did me at first.			"

												I must say, it is incredibly disappointing to read all the negative reviews on this game. First we must realize a basic concept here... for $15 if you expect developers to work forever on a game, and never stop, you're expecting too much. Beyond that... it's a great game! I've played over 500 hours off and on for years, and is one of the few titles that I will pick up and play over and over again. Buggy: I believe most people are playing minimal time and doing stupid things (like queuing 1000 tasks to 10 townies and wondering why they aren't doing a specific task) then screaming ""buggy buggy!"" Because they can't admit that they suck at the game. Towns is a great game. I have 0 issues with how it is, as is. Perhaps it's because I don't suck, I know how to play the game, and even more importantly, learn how to overcome obstacles instead of cry like a baby to have someone patch and fix a games challenges so that it becomes easy (boring). Pull up your big-boy pants naysayers... Towns for $15... I would have paid $40 and still been happy. To current date (and I'm still playing!) that's $0.03 / hour. Keep in mind - NEVER had 1 crash, never had one broken save of any kind. In 500 hours I've yet to see a ""bug"". It does not frustrate me, and I don't expect more.Towns is a great game to whittle away time, get off your high-horse baby-wagon naysayers and learn to play the game instead of cry broken because you can't manage a toon town.

												Definitely worth 5 bucks and under. As a dickey little town game its pretty solid, just could have been waaaay better.Dont think it quite deserves the panning people are giving it, but its pretty frustrating that there isnt regular updates, especialy considering it just needs content, content and more content. Serioulsy, just more content.			"

It took a bit to figure out but there's a wiki because what game doesn't have a wiki these days ( http://towns.gamepedia.com/Towns_Wiki ).  You can get most/all the information you need to be able to play the game here as well as access to mods or where to get mods.I like how you're able to relocate/make resource areas to where you want them.  In a lot of these games, generally they just regrow in an area that you've already harvested or you have to craft a special/specific building to harvest any additional resources.  In this game, you can take saplings/seeds/fruit/etc and create an area where you'd like them to grow.  Flowers, trees, etc will still grow in other areas but this allows you to have say 5x5 of trees (for lumber) that will continually regrow in that exact same plot (after being chopped down, a sapling will begin to grow in it's place and after a few minutes you'll have a fully grown tree... this applies to wheat, fruit, etc.).  This makes your villagers much more efficient at gathering and better for your resource management.  It is also significantly safer than traversing the area filled with random monsters like brownies, goblins, ghosts, etc.The big downside of the game is that a lot of people feel it isn't ""finished"" or ""unpolished"" and the lack of further development.  However, the game is fully functional and the balance may be a little off but that's easily adjustable via the xml files or mods.  Also, game can be pretty brutal at times such as when you expand a bit too early or get raided by monsters and your villagers have no armor nor weapons at their disposal in addition to their piddly health pool.If you like these kinds of games (city building/resource management) and don't mind that there won't be able more updates then buy the game but I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale.  Even if development has stopped, there's a lot of mods for the game which add content or change texture packs, etc.			"

												Alright folks, the game doesn't deserve all the hate. Well, ummm, actually it does, but not to this extent. I originally bought the game at version 8 (now it's version 14e), so yeah, I'm amongst those who were ""cheated"" by early promises, and I will still give this game a thump up.Why it does deserve the hate? Because it's clearly unfinished.-Several in-game features are clunky, for example ordering your troops around: you can't simply say ""go there"", you can only place patrol points. So exploring the dungeons beneath the surface is like: right-click somewhere, place waypoint, wait until they get there, right-click on waypoint, remove waypoint, right-click somewhere else, place waypoint, wait until they get there, etc. Since there's no other option I can live with it, but I'm not lovin' it.-Poor pathfinding. The townies may just ignore the roads, although they walk parallel with them only one square away.-AI is lacking. The haulers tend to choose stuff to pick up far, far away, instead of that exact same thing they are standing on. And, please, don't go to sleep or eat when several dozens of spiders are besieging the town. Also, don't try to gather loot in the middle of the battlefield, because it's dangerous to your health.-The variety of stuff to build is a bit underwhelming, although not always. For example you can build one type of wooden chair (not counting that one which needs gold besides wood), but at the same time there are like twenty stone wall styles. So building homes is not on Sims level.I think these are the negatives worth mentioning, may update if I encounter something I haven't written here yet. Umm, okay, others may say the music is repetitive, but I don't mind, it's not horrible.Why it does not deserve this much hate:- Contrary to a lot of other reviews, I have not encountered _any_ bugs, at least not apparent ones. No memory leaks. No hangups, no slowdowns, no CTDs. I don't really get what others mean when they describe this game as ""buggy as ****"". There were a lot of them in earlier versions, but right now this is one of the most bug-free games I ever played.I will not make a list about other pros, because they are subjective. I just leave here this: I still prefer Towns way over Gnomoria, and if it was a terrible game I wouldn't have come close to play it for 270 hours. Not many of my games can boast that much playtime.Thus, I dare to say, if you like building towns from blocks, and if Towns is on sale, try it.			"

												I am not one to write lengthy, detailed reviews, but I must say that this game is definitely misunderstood by many.If you are looking for a game in which every detail is given to you, where there is nothing to be learned and no difficulty in creating things, then continue no further.If you are someone who likes unique, one of a kind games that contain many interesting elements native to that game alone, then I do suggest Towns. It is a somewhat addicting city-builder with both rpg and survival aspects. Building is complicated at first, even for simulation and survival vets like myself. Even after the horribly furstrating first attempts at creating a town, I find myself coming back. It's definitely a challenge at first, but as you slowly get a grip on the isometric perspective and somewhat aggravating UI, you begin to discover new things and gain new knowledge, and that is part of what makes this game so golden.The game isn't broken, it is just difficult at first. It definitely is not for everyone, but if you want a unique, expansive, and nostalgic city-builder, please buy this game. You will not regret it.			"

												The difficulty of this game is making your townies happy. You have to make a lot of things to make them happy, but they have to build/make it and work makes them unhappy! It's a very slow game, and if you want to, as long as you have things being made constaintly without you telling them to on your own using the auto-craft, then you can have the game run all night. Carefull about autosaves when you do this. It may not work out like you want and you'll end up with a town of ghosts! Dispite all that, I find that it's not too daunting to take on this challenge and there are now tutorials up to get you started on your way to create the best town you can. Don't forget, you can turn some townies into soldiers to protect them at the cost of them not acutally crafting things, but at least you can protect them. They can also protect themselves you outfit them  properly as well. Just try it out and have fun with it. If the game you are working on doesn't work out, you can always make another, thankfully.

												Towns is an addictive little game. Sure, it's not finished yet, but if you're one of those who enjoy building stuff and watching your world grow, it can be fun. I find it amusing that of all the games I have, this indie title is the one that has clocked the most hours for me.I hope that the developers pick up the development pace and finish it, and if there is a feature I would like see implemented, it would be the possibility of manually equipping visiting heroes with gear. They tend to arrive with primitive equipment and forcing them to replace it is so much work that I have not even bothered. The result is a dungeon cluttered by the remains of heroes who blithely bumbled past that Armor of Immortality or Longsword of Instant Death you lovingly crafted for them. Serves them right, I suppose.			"

												Bought this over a year ago, and I loved it then (83 hrs). I've read about the new updates, and I can't wait to play it again.Towns can be difficult to learn at the beginning of the game. It has a deep level of complexity due to how flexible it is for player building. You do not get complete control over your villagers. Rather, you place a series of instruction for your villagers to follow. As is typical for town building games, your villagers can be pretty dumb sometimes, but that is all part of the fun. You think that you are safe to leave your people to work on the things that you assign them, and sometimes, things go horribly wrong. I've had several cities that have failed horribly, but I have no problems restarting. It just gives me more delivery and more fun.			"

												Towns is a simulation game where you play as citizens of a town in a world populated by heroes. The goal is to build a town to attract as many heroes as you can.

												A very fun, very challenging game that just keeps on making you want to play more and more. If you like minecraft, you'll LOVE this game. The graphics are blocky, but just like in minecraft, you can build what your imagination gives you. The occasional siege might set you back, but it only makes you want to make your army better and explore the dangerous depths of your world. Create a Tavern and soon enough you'll have powerful heroes to help you explore your dungeons, and who knows, maybe you'll get some famous heroes in your village, such as Sips, Vechs or even Sir Punchwood! Set up your farms, get buildings going and make your own kingdom!			"

												At first I thought this game was beond crap, but now its a game i cant put down. Mainly because its hard to get the heng of and you need to correctly manage resources and food production aswell as command a millitary to protect your citisence from encounters with wild life. If you are considering this buy i owuld recomend it but be warned that it has a learning curve.			"

												Only 20 years ago i had more fun with games.It's a pretty game for oldschool folks with nice detailed pixel art , remembering the boost from vga to svga.Maybe there are technically better advanced games of similar base-mechanics at lower pricing , but this game does have an aura of its own like it was with many games in the past , and i really like it.This is my opinion and i would recommend this game for a try , but  a recommendation is factual useless because it depends on the human handler and his state of mind.

												A great game to kill time with! It takes town managment to a new level of fun, along with creating a vibrant and alive city~Don't expect the whole pie here, folks..expect a good portion of it, as updates are massivly slow and the game buggy...but dont let that fool you out of a great game! Its aspects are much alike with Dwarf fortress, only simpler and a less massive UI. The UI itself is a masterpiece, and learning how to play the game is cake-walk...though youll need plenty of trial and error. A great buy...though, as much as i love it, you might want to wait on a summer/winter sale on it..if you have the money, buy it now!!			"

For example, the AI will try to automatically collect stuff even if it will get them killed, so you can get through 6 hours of play, then lose all of your people 1 by 1 as they spend 10 minutes each trying to run through a labyrinth of badguys to reach a piece of stone at the bottom of some dungeon.

												The concept of the game is that you are the town that supports the heroes that explore the caves beneath it. A bit of a twist on the adventure game. I personally turn it into Sparta. All the men and women of my town are in armor and have weapons. I enjoy sending 50+ soldiers into the dungeon to clear it myself at times. Overall this game can on some level play without you and does at later levels when you are stable, micromanaging chores out to the towns folk. Just make sure to have some tasks prepared for emergencies. (like graves) Other wise you will end up with your town folk dying off to ghosts some where. If you like building, fighting and don't mind the graphics. You may enjoy this game. If you purchased this game, check out these 2 tutorials that may help.

Then this little crack baby meets you and then you're both addicted to crack. If you don't mind 8/16-bit graphics and you like City Builder games along with RTS games, then you might wanna try Towns. It's definitely worth the money. My biggest suggestion is to watch tutorials on the game first before actually jumping in on it. After all, you don't just jump right into smoking crack.			"

												Towns is a very nice little game. Although it has yet to reach completion, it is still very much enjoyable if you're looking for something a little more docile out of a gaming experience. Everyone complains about the game's tutorials leaving a little- okay, A LOT- to be desired, however this means that you can have the enjoyment of discovering how to do things yourself instead of having your hand held the entire game. I have yet to see any bugs out of this game, which is a very impressive feat on the devs' part.			"

												Towns is an addictive little game. Sure, it's not finished yet, but if you're one of those who enjoy building stuff and watching your world grow, it can be fun. I find it amusing that of all the games I have, this indie title is the one that has clocked the most hours for me.I hope that the developers pick up the development pace and finish it, and if there is a feature I would like see implemented, it would be the possibility of manually equipping visiting heroes with gear. They tend to arrive with primitive equipment and forcing them to replace it is so much work that I have not even bothered. The result is a dungeon cluttered by the remains of heroes who blithely bumbled past that Armor of Immortality or Longsword of Instant Death you lovingly crafted for them. Serves them right, I suppose.			"

												Bought this over a year ago, and I loved it then (83 hrs). I've read about the new updates, and I can't wait to play it again.Towns can be difficult to learn at the beginning of the game. It has a deep level of complexity due to how flexible it is for player building. You do not get complete control over your villagers. Rather, you place a series of instruction for your villagers to follow. As is typical for town building games, your villagers can be pretty dumb sometimes, but that is all part of the fun. You think that you are safe to leave your people to work on the things that you assign them, and sometimes, things go horribly wrong. I've had several cities that have failed horribly, but I have no problems restarting. It just gives me more delivery and more fun.			"

												Towns is a simulation game where you play as citizens of a town in a world populated by heroes. The goal is to build a town to attract as many heroes as you can.

												Most RPGs take from the ""you are the hero"" vantage point, but I never thought to be the one who controlled the town/village that housed the adverturers, and I didn't expect to like it so much.I'm not sure why but this game was a lot of fun when I was playing it. There is something about the difficulty in discovering how to do things that made it all worth while. If you can catch this game on sale and/or have your mind open I think you'll be happily surprised at this gem. It's light hearted, simple, yet difficult to master and really rewarding when you get everything working smoothly. A lot of reviews talk about how buggy it is, but when more than a year ago when I was playing it most I didn't experience those problems.			"

												A Isometric town management game where instead of you playing the RPG, you are the RPG. Instead of giving quests and farming and such, you are all of these things, commanding your heros where to go. It is a completely different experience than most other town simulators. Unfortunately, the developers have abandoned the game, thus it will not be developed further. It is a shame to see this happen, especially since the game's reputation took a big hit because of it, but that doesn't stop me from recommending it.Bottom Line: This game is great fun if you want to be the one who gives out the quests and sends potential heros on adventures, instead of the one doing all of the work as one person! This is great fun if you also like managing cities. The music while repetitive suits the style of the game, the mechanics are serviceable, and the graphics pay homage to games like the Ceasar Series, which look great!

												I got this game with the impression that it was going to be like Minecraft. When I started playing it, I realized just how wrong I really was. Towns really gives the impression that you are playing a minecraft clone from a bird's eye view, but what you soon learn is that amidst all of the building and gathering you would expect to have to do, there lies even more. Managing your citizens happiness, raising livestock, and creating automated systems to gather and plant crops, all of this just to skim the surface. As a game still being constructed, Towns has a very promising future. Highly recommend this series to anyone who likes the Sims franchise or any castle building games.			"

												You will find a lot of critiscism about how the game is broken and abondened. It's still a fun game and the fact that things are ""broken"" makes it more fun and harder. Nowadays games tend to be too easy but having to deal with broken AI and weirdness actually brings the fun to the game. For me atleast. People say that they played 200hours of this game and it was very broken bla bla.. The fact that you wanted to play the game for 200 hours says it all.			"

												A game with great promise that has been abandoned by it's develops - who are now talking about making towns2.  They won't be seeing any money from me.  An involved, fiddely and engaging game marred by a clumsy UI and a grinding build process.  The sort of game you need a wiki open on your second moniter to work out.  Towns is a tragic game, it could have been legendary - now it's edged out of the market by clones. 3/5			"

												Despite all the flaws you can find on game like that, I've spent more than enough time to say that it worhs the little money you can spend on it.Of course it's infuriating to see the peons running right in the middle of a pack of monsters without weapons with no self-preservation whatsoever, of course it's stupid to see a peon starving because he has started a long task when he was already hungry. Not mentionning the heroes who flee faster than the light and bring home monsters that will decimate your population. And I forgot some...But still, how fun this game is, you have a sim game, where you can grow a whole village with many aspects (food, buildings, construction, armors & weapons, trading...) and you have a dungeon that reveals itself and brings a lot to your experience.

												This is a great game for someone willing to dedicate time to understanding it. The tutorials are rather poor and most of the learning is done by understanding what little the tutorials teach and applying it elsewhere. The game is a lot of fun and offers some replayability. It's a great challenge that I enjoy. I know there's a lot of bad reviews, but I honestly don't think these people gave their best effort in trying it out, and the game improves greatly with each update; most of the reviews were done before the game's main components were complete. I think it's a great game to play, but it takes a certain kind of player to enjoy it. I'd recommend trying the demo out first to make sure you like the game.			"

												This is a fun little town simulation game with challenging gameplay and lots of facets to it.  I have definitely enjoyed it, despite the fact that I have gotten stuck numerous times trying to figure out how to progress which leads me to the game's problems.  This is still in development, and it shows.  A lot of aspects aren't explained very well and a lot of things about your villagers are hard to control.  For example, to get more villagers your villagers need to be happy.  Happiness is influenced by numerous factors, how nice their rooms are, what variety of things they have to eat, what kind of decorations they have to look at but also how much work they have to do.  If they have too much work they get stressed but if they have too little they get bored, there's no way to tell villagers how much of their time to spend relaxing and how much working (aside from a somewhat unpredictable job assignment system).  There is a great community forum with a lot of mods for the game and that helps but I cant help but wish they had more streamlining.Pros:Neat ConceptGood MechanicsTons of replayability (due to procedural generation)Fun and not overcomplicated simCons:Less-than-optimal controlsPoor in-game instructions			"

I lost my first game because the forlorn spirits of slain townsfolk rose from their dismembered corpses and slaughtered all that remained.  It was epic.  If you're willing to put in the time to learn how to play, it's really fun.  Also the bone seller being an actual skeleton on a bone tricycle was hi-larious.			"

But exploring this game was a ton of fun (with some help from the wiki). I'm done with it for now, but that's after 34 hours of playtime, so can't complain much there. If you're looking at this game to build structures that you see in pictures, don't bother. If you're looking to upkeep a decently complex town with work groups and a military, this game is worth it.			"

												I've owned Towns for quite a while now and although some poor decisions of the developer have thrown a lot of flak it’s way recently, I’d like to say that the game itself is still very enjoyable.Throughout its development, Towns has been all over the place in the performance department but it has never been unplayable. There is ample content for many many hours of creation and enjoyment and even since the last time I played there has been some significant addition to the game. The UI is very functional, the art style is charming, and compared to the titles which inspired it, Towns is extremely accessible for newcomers to the isometric, town building, minion ordering.. micro managing... I’ll try that again- Towns is extremely accessible for newcomers to the Dwarf Fortress genre of game.			"

												I caught it on sale for real cheap.  At first I thought I wasted money on this game and It took awhile, but I am really into it now.  The paths to success are not obvious and it can appear extremely simplistic at first but there is a much deeper game to be found.  Even in the current state of the game you can build a fully functioning economy.  Its kind of like playing with legos, except you have to keep your people alive and obvious oversights can lead to starvation or running into momsters that will happily eat them for dinner.It is not for everyone, the basic functions are all there.  There are some features half implemented but the modding community seems to have taken care fo the holes (I am not currently using any mods).  I have no doubt the finish product would keep me playing even longer than i already have... but it will require some patience for this game to get there... if it ever does...  If all the the above issues dont turn you off and you want to Alpha test the foundations of what could be an amazing game I'd buy it.  Like I said before you can build a functioning town. However,  DO NOT EXPECT A FINISH PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED.			"

												It's nice after you get into it. No proper tutorial makes a bit hard in the beginning, but no deal-breaker. This isn't the short 2-hour game, you can really spend time there, it's a crude version of Sims combined with Minecraft in strategy mode where you command a lot of ""minecraft players"", your citizens. The commands are leaned towards automation so you dont have so much direct control, but enough for sure.Note: this game was supposedly made by one programmer and one artist and the programmer has allegedly quit this project (and there's rumors this project was never a high priority thing for him) so dont expect the bugs to be fixed. I did enjoy the game, but that's because I like to discover new things, even find out the game mechanics instead of having them explained to me. Anyone who feels differently, you shouldn't buy this game because there's a lot finding-out to do with game mechanics, and that's most likely not gonna change.The game mechanics work though, it's just a long try & fail process often. But you can also make up for your failures, like build new if buildings get destroyed (they shouldn't), get new villagers if old ones die (how compassionate) and even buy new animals from the visiting vendors.I feel this game has a lot of potential, but is poorly polished. I dont know how much the developers make with this, but they could make 10 times more bucks if they polished it, hired the crew and decided to listen to people.			"

Some can be easily ignored, others may get annoying. for the current €12,- steam is offering this game, i'd say its too expensive.

												This game is pretty much a DF extra-lite. Legos with monsters. It's not difficult, but there are city building and management aspects. You need to establish a food and resource hub so you can build a bigger city and get more ""Townies"" as they're called, then dig underground, build a tavern, attract some heroes, and dig deeper for better resources.The goal of the game isn't to reach some unknown boss. I'm not even sure there is an endgame with Towns. I never reached the maximum depth because I never held it as a main objective. I played this game because I have a god complex and want to create a thriving city and watch my citizens thrive by my grace and strategic expertise.The sieges are kind of a joke, but they're a good source of spiderite and goo. My only wish is that the devs went more in depth with the town defense aspect of this game, but it's no big deal. I have ~100hrs in this game, so I think I got my money's worth.Personally, I don't understand all the backlash this game got. I got this game on sale roughly a year and a half ago for ~2.50(?). Worth every penny, given my playtime. I'm pretty sure if I knew how much time I'd spend playing it, I'd drop 10 bucks on it in a heartbeat.I think a lot of the anger has to do with entitlement. Games in this genre now adays (legos with monsters: DF, Minecraft, Terraria) are being released as full games, and the devs are devoted enough to the games to continue to release content. I don't think Towns needs to release more content. I think it's fine how it is. Some people may not think it's worth 10 bucks. To me, it is, but I'm 100% certain it's worth at least 5. Then again, I didn't enter this expecting updates. They appear more as a pleasant surprise for me.			"

I personally dont think that the game is that bad to be honest. I have played this game for 35 hours and my brother has played it too for about 40+ and after we stop playing towns me and him both felt it was a fun good game with some bugs of course. In ending thought, if you have a chance to pick up Towns, then i suggest doing so. I would give this game a 6.8/10 rating which isnt bad but could be better.			"

												This game is awesome. I really like the concept of building a town that heroes visit, and then having the heroes clear out the dungeon so your villagers can mine. While there is a limit to the amount of playtime you can get from one city (It's not necessarily limited, but there will be a point when you've done everything), it's really fun while it lasts, and takes a ood 50+ hours to dig every layer of the dungeon and kill everything and have a full roster of townies (villagers) etc. And you can always start a new Town! The tutorial is utter crap at the moment in time I'm writing this, so don't depend on it, I'd just watch a few YouTube Playthroughs, as that's how I learned how to play it. But fo' shizzles, this is a great game, and a great buy.			"

												This deserves deeper analysis that I'm about to give it, but this is one of my favorite ""small game"" experiences as of late.  When describing Towns to people, I decided it was like telling 10 people how to play minecraft… but without the patterned crafting.  So much of minecraft is lived in telling someone where to put something in a 3x3 grid, but in towns you just say ""Go make a wooden sword"" and they must goto the wiki on their own and look it up.Towns places you in the traditional omniscient 3rd person viewing angle that Christ himself enjoys.   You get a randomly generated world with 11 citizens of your ""Town"".  You drop orders for what to do, and the citizens go do it.  Chop down all these trees I've moused over.  Harvest this apple tree.  Build this wall.  Dig this tunnel.  Oh crap, there's spiders in that tunnel.  No, no don't die… run away… crap.And then you start a new game and realize there's much more you need to do before you plumb the depths of your little block world.Towns is an impressively deep game where it does not appear to be on the surface.  I mean that literally as well as figuratively as while at the surface of the game it's about Townsperson happiness management (oh yea, they need to be happy, not over worked and if you can manage that, you'll get more people showing up in town… that's an important mechanic that I didn't think of until now… see… deep) and setting up replenishable resources so everyone doesn't starve and you've got plenty of wood for that epic barbarian castle you just dreamt up.  Dig down only a couple layers and there's combat to be had.  Not super impressive combat, just your people wiggling at the beast until one of them makes this strange death noise.  You can't control the combat at all.  Soldiers can be designated, even set on patrol routes, but they intervene somewhat rarely which makes taking them off labor to just stand around with the best sword you've made so far a little useless.Again, this game goes so much deeper than I'm giving it credit for in this review… suffice to say, it's quite enjoyable. If you like economy heavy RTS, dwarf-likes or civilization games give it a whirl.  I recommend buy-in at $10, but that's only because it's a little bit of a gamble as to wether you'll like it.  I'd be willing to give this game $25, but that's knowing how much I enjoy it after playing it for hours.4 Visuals8 Gameplay8 SlantOverall : 67			"

												First to say, I have spent many hours playing towns. MANY hours, and most of the 'towns' i created ended up bugged or lag-based on all accounts or glitched on load. So many faults, but i found it most likely i was building or mining something that was 'illegal' and had in previous versions faulted the game. New not good enough last ever update fixed some of the errors. My latest game or town i created, makes me rank this game AS WORTH HAVING, since no new updates are ever going to be created, possible it might be modified at some point some where on if... possibly nothing if or possible. The game recent, the only possible idea that could make this game work is more glabol control.Point 1,IF! if the game had an 'unlock all objects' key, which would be including those on top such as 2nd story roof and up, and scroll across the map, and a ignore all unlocked items, fading them from view so that you could rebuild as you expand, say 20 townies later on you might want to change the look of your town so that happiness is added more fluently(happiness draws in more townies, tip block all roads with fences and 1 block openings still fenced-in although the spot is used with a high happiness decoration, all townies must take the fensed roads, and always gain happiness, the fences should block line of sight too, for all other lower decorations that make your town unique looking and worth creating and blocking sight of other unhappy such stuff [corpses lol]!) so to wrap up point 1, once you build something expect to keep it, even if u realize you wasted a whole lotta space with little useless alleys that u got to block off anyways or whatever your reason. as well as each building wall block needs to be clicked to unlocked(why no auto unlock key?), It is fun to create brick by brick so to speak until you have clicked thousands and thousands of times, and you only have maybe 20 fully furnished and roofed structures(like 15% of the map if you build BIG), but where is the schematic page, where you can create and paste what you want.. I MEAN COME ON WTF stupid person could not add a schematic setup so that you do not neED to place brick by brick every damn BRICK. You might not understand the awesome happiness system, i do i love it, as is I gain 4 townies every few minutes until i reach about 100(ofcourse the townies live in unwalled unroofed houses with a single high happiness object each, only until later do i now design my town), maybe 2 hours of playing saying that at some point(in the past sometimes my game just would not load, or whateverbug at the time, since update final ive had almost no issues with bugs, sometimes lag after a while and i just have to restart towns game and its fixes) some point i dont lose my game and ok and i cap off my residents because i am tired of making the same structures to fit each part of my town, i make 80% the same with different base or roof designs. END POINT 1.Point 2.WTF my townies die for the most stupid reasons, and when one dies the rest follow, it takes 30 seconds for 1 high level enemy to sneak past a new hedge that grants access into your town to murder all of your townies before a single soldier townie arrives. The soldier system is laughable, the level system is worse, the townies ability to form soldier groups looks near identicle and stands on the screen right next to the 'return townies to civi status' and if you do that that once soldier loses all levels and expereienced gain. So two hours in my level 30 warrior reverts to lvl 1 cause i missclicked. Do i reload? wait i just cleared that floor and salvaged some structures (I do not want to reclick the structures brick by brick to move together to add more what/ever is needed floor layout). Its a bummer, the soldiers four options are useful, well 1 is useful the 'patrol script', say you have 3 soldiers and a single patrol point, at least one soldier will be there if that single spot needs defending. So you can bundle your town opening with your dungeon opening and that one soldier can last until heros or townies or your actual soldiers get off thier fat behinds and leave the dining room to fight or patrol is what it is. What could be added, is a auto level for all characters based on time they have been in your town, or gain experience for all townies, but soldiers gain double. As is the soldier usage can be annoying, i try to make 1/8 to 1/4 townies into soldiers since i play on the hardest difficulty and i do survive most instances of invasion.Point FinalAs was townies die, or the game glitches because some townie is trying to fly off a roof, or climb three spaces high for that first piece of stone or ore and cannot reach, that does now with the last update usually cancel all actions for a townie that cannot reach or interact with a ai-script(farming,mining,building) and does not cause too much of an issue. Unless that townie is behind that 3 story wall just too far to reach the ground, and dies of starvation, scaffolding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF WHY is there no auto build SCAFFOLDING when something is just out of reach, or why start up the map with stupid stone bricks i need to mine on the surface of the map stacked up like some tower. REcent update added scaffolds decay after time, so no need to delete them unless that immediate space is needed, wait a while and the scaffolding will fade away from the game, its kind of cool getting a 3 story structure up and watching it unfold as teh scaffolding decays away and reveals the time you spent clicking each brick into place, each window painstackingly placed. It makes it worth it too, if like I do often I show off my towns online or to friends i say hey look what i spent four hours making.( I got one friend to buy the game, and after about ten hours of playing he had about 15 townies, i wanted to cry) The game has no introduction, as well as no explanation, examples being bone torch=1 happiness, harp=2 happiness, decorated wall= go ---- yourself(i think to myself) it does not add any worth while happiness as it does override all better happiness objects. EXTRA POINT------------------------------- MAKE ALL WALLS,optional decorated(same look but with makes happiness) and costs say 1 extra material of a single needed of a single variety.Back TO last POINT of interest------------- Play this game only if you understand ai scripts and basic map editor knowledge as once you get the hang of it, its totally easy to play even on the hardest of difficulties, my favorite too because you do not get stupid molerats stealing your food, instead just some ogres to fight. Yes i recommend this game to anyone who has a brain and enjoyings a challenge, it is unfinished, good chance what there is is all there will ever be in this game. So far, I have yet to find a single piece of useful information on the forums and online searches, you need to learn from the game, find the flaws and single them out.My personal example of playEither map type,FIRST ACTION-------------- CREATE 16 resident tiles 3x3 each, wait 30 seconds, you get more townies to start the game with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SECOND ACTION----------- Make into soldiers all townies and hunt down all of the monsters on the surface of the map, no not leave a single monster alive. Change all but the best soldier(based on stats, only hp and offense matter) back into townies(equip the townies who are your lumber workers with the dropped weapons from the monsters.

												I actually like this game, i think it needs more work to be complete. But i will recommend the gameI don't recommend paying the full price for this at the moment. 5 Euro would be a better price for what you are getting imo.Its a fun little strategic view minecraft game. I found that most things are fairly intuitive and easy to learn. There are a few problems with the game.mining is a bit annoying at times because marking areas works in a weird kind of way.there are some problems with buildings when you place a roof and stuff like that.But in general i think this is quite fun to play.

												The Towns Tragedy: A Case Study in Early AccessSo first off, I recommend this game... but just barely. It's pretty fun for the money, and you'll get pretty engaged managing your little town. It has a lot of complexity, but not very accessible... be prepared for a little front loading on tutorials. The features are a bit haphazardly put together, but you can still cobble together a pretty good experience out of it. The tragedy here is that the developer quit working on the game before it was completed. In all honesty, I wish Towns had been where it is now when it was put up for early access. Developers calling it quits or settling for ""almost good enough"" is getting pretty tiring in the independant market.			"

												Great simulation game. You manage harvesting, planting, storing, building, mining and exploring, etc. Very steep learning curve, which is nice. Took me around five hours and as many restarts just to achieve a self-sustainable colony. Great music and lovely graphics.Edit: addictive as HELL. Multiple times I've played for just one more cycle of harvest/replant, well into the night, well past my bedtime.Somethings I'd like to see added/improved: - bigger maps - more fluid animations (on your Townies) - more in-game tools to fix things, change things (create Animal in case you wipe out a population, etc)Those are just suggestions, not criticisms.

Regardless of what you read this game is VERY much playable and fun. It is also easy to mod.

												I have a feeling this game will be hit or miss with people.  If being thrown into an environment where you're just left to build and figure stuff out appeals to you, then you'll love it.  If it looks like butts to you and you can't be bothered to figure out the gameplay mechanics , you'll probably hate it and uninstall immediately.I got roped into this pretty hard just because of the initial learning curve.  My first few towns got ruined immediately by starvation or murloc invasions, but I stuck with it and figured it out and was, I feel, rewarded for my efforts.  Building a town to house heroes is pretty kickass but then on top of that getting to manage the many levels of dungeons below is pretty cool also.  I've sunk a buttload of time into this game, like 120+ hours, and still don't want to stop until I clear the 18th level of the dungeon.   It does get pretty repetetive at 100 hours... but what game doesn't?Love it.			"

												A game with a lot of potential that really falls quite short at the time.  The concept is cool; build a town and let adventurers clear out the dungeon for you.  On paper it all seems great but in practice not so much.  While the devs admit the game is still being updated (and they have been updating it) there is still a lot of work to be done.  One redeeming fact is you can edit game files to modify things in the game to make it more enjoyable.  I recommend this game because it is a really neat concept, but i'd wait for more patching and maybe a price drop to make sure you are getting a complete product to get your money's worth.			"

												Wow, my last review was huge.Before you buy, (who is looking to buy this game anymore??) be sure to check out various reviews and decide for yourself what you expect.  Yeah, there are bugs, the game is unfinished.  At launch, it was one of very few city building sims on Steam that had that element of RTS/Hero management.  Banished for the same money is a near-AAA experience, so don't go buying this game unless you own that or Cities: Skylines.  If you are into resource and development sims then Factorio is infinitely a better choice.  There are others, but I'm only naming ones I have a lot of experience with.Towns can be considered an early Java template game, it doesn't stray far from what you usually see in typical browser games, but I love it and that's that.  This game has a much better experience than Towncraft, an abandonware game that is way worse of a consumer-trust relationship.Make sure you educate yourself if you're actually consider spending full price on this game.  There are hundreds of games on Steam that would probably be better suited for that amount.  If you want a unique glimpse into what was one of the ""founders"" of how Steam became the conglomerate of early access/scam gaming, you won't be disappointed.  And hey, once you get past the bugs and logic-defying mechanics, you might even enjoy playing it a little bit.  I sure as hell did, and that was back when this game was front and center in the Steam Drama world.			"

												ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE DYING AND A CHALLENGE.It is not that bad of a game. If you give it enough time. If you are wanting to build an elaborate fortess with 5 stories and everything perfectly place in it, you will get mad and quite the game. Instead look at it as a survival game mod with ever increasing sieges that force you to explore the depths of dungeons so you can equip your villagers with good enough weapons to survive the 200 spiders that spone inside your base. It does have many bugs to it: having to set flags at every square to explore a dungeon, a villager ignoring your minimum level setting and going into the 5 floor just to pickup a set of bones, the over bulky food production (only efficient way is to eat T1 food that only fills 20%), the ""heroes"" that drag dungeon monsters into your city, the glitchy animal farming, the complete lack of certain resources on maps (excluding that random unreachable piece of coal placed floating ontop of the lake). But these are all part of the random events and part of the challenge. Every time you get killed off, you learn a new aspect of the game. The reason they don't explain much of the tutorial is becuase they want to you figure it out in the game.It has a lot more depth into the game: dealing with traders, forming an army to defend sieges, creating a badger areana, wood working, smithing, fishing, glass blowing, vanities (cosmetics), inlisting heroes, killing monsters (orcs, goblins, ogers, giant, trolls, ect), a death cycle for villagers (disease, disposal of corpses/ wraiths), farming, pastry making, complex item system, and a lot more that you have to discover. But you do not see these with just playing for the first 5-10 hours and calling it crap.			"

												Going to put in a few words to defend this game. Everything people say is true - it's unfinished and abandoned, and I wouldn't pay $15 for it. However, if you can get it for like $5, and you like this sort of game, I'd say go for it.I haven't played it since like 2 years ago, but I have to admit I liked it when I played it, despite its unfinished-ness and bugs. Like, there's Dwarf Fortress, then there's Gnomoria, which is DF-lite, and then there's Towns, which is Gnomoria-lite. Relatively easy to play and fun to build up your little town. Not too much micromanagement. Fun to zone out to.			"

												This game is a mixed bag. On the one hand, you get a deep sims style simulation with a dungeoun. On the other doo-doo hand, you have an overcomplex simulation with no instructions on how to do things. I am smart enough that I grasped the dynamic, but once I had my town running I had to deal with spiders spawning inside my town. This made me unhappy. This is well done for someone slamming some java code together. Well done, but developer, try instructions and possibly a narrative. This would help your game significantly. C+			"

												An awesome mixture of Minecraft, SimCity and roleplaying scheme! Start from pretty much nothing, command your people to harvest wood, gather apples, grow wheat and afterwards bake a bread out of it. Crafting is as necessary part of this game as it is in Minecraft. In addition to this, you should really take it as a serious matter to equip swords and armor to some of your townsfolk, because if you face a vicious tree, a ghost, a spider or anything between them, you're pretty much dead. By setting your military men to patrol around your village when building it towards to the greatest empire on earth, you should feel pretty safe!

												Love this game because 491 hours of gameplay said so. I don't know why people are saying there is only 7 hours gameplay in there. So not true.Yes it's been halted due to being launched before steams beta program meaning the game stopped getting advertised and people stopped buying it but it's still a solid game with very few bugs.I think half the problem is that people get frustrated with not knowing how to actually play. When did the world start needing tutorials to function in games? Just jump in and figure it out piece by piece.It's a great game in my opinion and it's been well worth the money even if it doesn't have all the features we were promised			"

												I have owned this game for over a year and i can honestly say it is one of the best strategy games i have ever played right up with rollercoaster tycoon. Firstly the art style unlike dwarf fortress and gnomoria dosent take away from your ability to tell whats going on. secondly the ui is very helpfull and will tell you important stuff like total resources, allow you to reasign jogs (so your bakers dont go mining) ,and build easily. The difficulty curve might seem slightly offputting but trust me it gets better quick (watch vechs on youtube for a good idea what to do first). And lastly the updates are awesome, we have goten caravans,world event,water features,lighting and so much more. All in all you should DEFINATLEY buy this game.p.s.  everyone who down voted this game dosent read news, the game is in develepment stillp.p.s. we will miss you burning pet			"

The game mechanics are very nice and playing the game is fun, but without a campain and a little more information how to play i understand all the negative feedback.

The UI is terrible and there are some features missing that would really help round it out, but it has a lot of potential.  However, it appears to be updated once or twice a month, adding new features and fixing bugs.

To be fair, the game feels like it still needs a fair bit of spit-and-polish (several menus aren't labeled, you'll need to make multiple references to the wiki to figure out what you're doing) But the game's still early in its life and they're promising they're still working on it, so I have high hopes for it, and I see a fair amount of potential. And its fun regardless. (Although can be tricky to actually get your town growing instead of dying at start.)			"

												[EDIT] Holy crap they released a patch Apr 2014 and are taking suggestions for v15. It's alive!Objectively, the reviews below saying ""not recommended"" are correct. The game is really not finished, and given it has an development for many years, and has not seen an update in a while, and the developer statement that he is ""burned out"", I would not expect any more updates.With that said, I still spent an enjoyable month or so playing this game. Coming from Dwarf Fortress and wanting something a little prettier, this game provides a nice twist on the genre, rather than mining you ""dig too deep"" by hiring heroes who explore dungeons.It provides an interesting and detailed tech tree, one of the best workshop designs I have seen in any such game (you place zones for workshops and then crafting stations within zones).That said, I am obsessed with this genre and desperate for other games in it. If you want to try something like this but with active development and far more polished, I highly recommend Gnomoria (and keeping an eye on Stonehearth and Clockwork Empires).I would still recommend this game, although given it is unlikely to see any updates I would personally want to see the price knocked down a little given its incomplete state.I really hope the new developer breathes new life into this game, but I feel like once the game gets into a negative feedback cycle developers have little incentive to do so -- when everyone is panning your game on Steam and no updates have been released for a year and a half, what is your incentive to continue working on it?Even if you decide not to buy, I would keep an eye on this game just in case things change.This game has a tremendous amount of potential, and is farther long than many games in the genre.

												As a player of Towns with 72 hours, I'd say it's pretty much finished. It's a decent game with (last I played) not many bugs and had many solid features. Easily worth a measly 15 dollars - I honestly thought the devs were finished with Towns as there were no longer any updates, I didn't think they abandoned it.2 cents from a person who's actually played towns.also note it's not perfect - what indie game is?A better game in my opinion is Gnomoria. It's a fun game that takes a while to learn but it's being actively updated every 2-3 weeks (aside from last two months cause the creator had a child and was focusing on being a father; the updates started back up). Easily worth the cost.A lot of people are coming here and posting because they read it was 'abandoned' and wanted to write a review, yet they've never played. This game is also a niche game, make sure you'd be interested before buying. I would also suggest watching a lets play or tutorial of it because it's easier to learn from watching than the in game tutorials. (for either game)			"

												Hello,First of all, I would like to point out that this game is not anywhere near a finished, polished product. It has bugs. It has some issues. It lacks some fundamentals of the genre. This should have been released as an early access game, and it is my firm believe that Steam should take matters into their own hands to put it there. This game may or may not ever be finished; updates are quite slow comming.If you can look past this, you will find an entertaining game. The modding community helps to make it even more so. If you are a fan of this genre of games, I would whole heartedly recommend it to someone after this disclaimer, but only after they've bought and played ""Gnomoria"".			"

												Game is a great survivial game, it puts all the surviving factors together, starvation, wild life, etc, aswell with traits that took place back then and even today, including Rivalry, Citizenship, and currency. Although it has good factors, it has some bad ones too.  The game seems to bore you a bit too easily, and the randomly generated spawns can quite frequently put you right on top of a biom with hostile natural life. I have 25 hours on it, and i've had it for nearly a year. In my 25 hours of gameplay, i've never figured out how to get Iron, and make needed tools. I try to build a town, but every time I try to, my citizens starve to death, or Ghosts kill them. To fix this, I focused a TON more on food, but that didn't stop the Ghost of Heroes past's from attacking and slaughtering all my people. This game does have alot of Pros compared to Cons though, and i highly reccomend it    to any survival type people out there who love to play a survivial, and always ask ""Can i build a city on it?"" type questions. I would rate it a 8/10 if it was up to me. Graphics might be a bit dissapointing, but if you don't only look at games for their graphics, and just want the fun, this is a good game. I never noticed many bugs, maybe a few, and I seen the comments.			"

												This game is a lot of fun to play and I've spent hours on playing on and on. It’s a nice twist to what the game concepts are and it is a good start of city management games. Just beware though you might need to reference online time to time to get started but once the concepts are there then the concept of further play development is understandable. This game is also good for on the road travels since it doesn’t require lots of processing power to play.			"

												[EDIT] Holy crap they released a patch Apr 2014 and are taking suggestions for v15. It's alive!Objectively, the reviews below saying ""not recommended"" are correct. The game is really not finished, and given it has an development for many years, and has not seen an update in a while, and the developer statement that he is ""burned out"", I would not expect any more updates.With that said, I still spent an enjoyable month or so playing this game. Coming from Dwarf Fortress and wanting something a little prettier, this game provides a nice twist on the genre, rather than mining you ""dig too deep"" by hiring heroes who explore dungeons.It provides an interesting and detailed tech tree, one of the best workshop designs I have seen in any such game (you place zones for workshops and then crafting stations within zones).That said, I am obsessed with this genre and desperate for other games in it. If you want to try something like this but with active development and far more polished, I highly recommend Gnomoria (and keeping an eye on Stonehearth and Clockwork Empires).I would still recommend this game, although given it is unlikely to see any updates I would personally want to see the price knocked down a little given its incomplete state.I really hope the new developer breathes new life into this game, but I feel like once the game gets into a negative feedback cycle developers have little incentive to do so -- when everyone is panning your game on Steam and no updates have been released for a year and a half, what is your incentive to continue working on it?Even if you decide not to buy, I would keep an eye on this game just in case things change.This game has a tremendous amount of potential, and is farther long than many games in the genre.

												As a player of Towns with 72 hours, I'd say it's pretty much finished. It's a decent game with (last I played) not many bugs and had many solid features. Easily worth a measly 15 dollars - I honestly thought the devs were finished with Towns as there were no longer any updates, I didn't think they abandoned it.2 cents from a person who's actually played towns.also note it's not perfect - what indie game is?A better game in my opinion is Gnomoria. It's a fun game that takes a while to learn but it's being actively updated every 2-3 weeks (aside from last two months cause the creator had a child and was focusing on being a father; the updates started back up). Easily worth the cost.A lot of people are coming here and posting because they read it was 'abandoned' and wanted to write a review, yet they've never played. This game is also a niche game, make sure you'd be interested before buying. I would also suggest watching a lets play or tutorial of it because it's easier to learn from watching than the in game tutorials. (for either game)			"

												Hello,First of all, I would like to point out that this game is not anywhere near a finished, polished product. It has bugs. It has some issues. It lacks some fundamentals of the genre. This should have been released as an early access game, and it is my firm believe that Steam should take matters into their own hands to put it there. This game may or may not ever be finished; updates are quite slow comming.If you can look past this, you will find an entertaining game. The modding community helps to make it even more so. If you are a fan of this genre of games, I would whole heartedly recommend it to someone after this disclaimer, but only after they've bought and played ""Gnomoria"".			"

												Game is a great survivial game, it puts all the surviving factors together, starvation, wild life, etc, aswell with traits that took place back then and even today, including Rivalry, Citizenship, and currency. Although it has good factors, it has some bad ones too.  The game seems to bore you a bit too easily, and the randomly generated spawns can quite frequently put you right on top of a biom with hostile natural life. I have 25 hours on it, and i've had it for nearly a year. In my 25 hours of gameplay, i've never figured out how to get Iron, and make needed tools. I try to build a town, but every time I try to, my citizens starve to death, or Ghosts kill them. To fix this, I focused a TON more on food, but that didn't stop the Ghost of Heroes past's from attacking and slaughtering all my people. This game does have alot of Pros compared to Cons though, and i highly reccomend it    to any survival type people out there who love to play a survivial, and always ask ""Can i build a city on it?"" type questions. I would rate it a 8/10 if it was up to me. Graphics might be a bit dissapointing, but if you don't only look at games for their graphics, and just want the fun, this is a good game. I never noticed many bugs, maybe a few, and I seen the comments.			"

												This game is very challenging, but enjoyable. I do wish there was a way to strengthen your heroes more before you send them to the lower levels (other than raids), but at least they don't stop coming. Sure I had to look up some things on the wiki but it was the same way for everybody for games such as this, or Minecraft, or they had a friend who told them the recipes or the way redstone works and ways you can implement redstone to make something awesome. I hope Towns has more updates in the future to fix certain minor things, but other than that I very much enjoy playing the game. Another plus is how simple mods are done, unlike Minecraft I can get most of the mods I want to work (Not to dog on Minecraft because I love Minecraft too, but the mods are done poorly for it) For towns you just have to drop the mod into the mods file, while Minecraft will make you download other mods to get mods to work. Also Towns has (I think) an official mods website that you can go to, while Minecraft you have to trust your instincts on whether to download said mods. I know there's the wiki and stuff for mods, but when I download them and drop them in the mods file it always crashes my game or just doesn't work. Maybe your experience is different with minecraft and towns, but that is my experience.			"

												I poured many hours into this game. I will admit that a great deal of them were while I was afk, letting the world run itself, especially if I was in a bit of a recession. Towns as a game is a great idea, and had the potential for greatness in it. It had some fun elements, digging deep into the earth looking for ore, while building a utopia above.It has it's fair share of bugs, and the AI leaves a bit to be desired. Can't tell you how often I've lost an entire village while afk because the guards don't know how to protect the villagers and then go heal themselves properly. Can be a real spirit breaker. As it is, it is playable, and a certain level of fun can certainly be had for this game, but I give you fair warning here:THIS GAME HAS BEEN ABANDONED BY THE DEVELOPERS. That means this product will come to you AS IS, with no thought of change to make note of. It's not terribly expensive, and I've certainly poured enough time into this game to have made it worth the 15 bucks I paid for it, but all in all, you may just end up avoiding this game and try something with a similar touch to it, but is more polished.

												It's odd. All these games that are so clearly very much like Dwarf Fortress just lack almost all of the appeal of Dwarf Fortress. Towns is one of the worst in that regard. The complex, text-based menu system of DF is here replaced by a seemingly MORE complex icon-based menu system.The gameplay is very similar to DF's Fortress Mode, having you build a Town from scratch by harvesting resources from the land and using them to build tools, then using those tools to harvest resources more efficiently, then using THOSE resources to build structures.I can't really put my finger on why DF has such an appeal to me while Towns (which, as stated, is VERY similar in most regards) just doesn't. If you like town-building sims and managing a population, this is a good game. If you don't like complicated menus and long♥♥♥♥♥tutorials to teach you how to use them, try something else.			"

												The game was origanally going be fleshed out more but seems the developers have stopped work on it, even if so i have gotten a pretty good amount of time (24 hours and counting) from playing this game aint exactly a huge thriller but it is nice little game to play and especially if you want mind grueling horror of building a town, which i personally enjoy (seriously i do not sarcasm, spawning in and having 2 villagers die while chopping trees totally worth it brings fond memories of TPK's o baldurs gate) overall would rate 6.5/10 for being a enjoyable game few ai bugs i dont really care for and game play after a while gets boring but again i love having it and playing it when im done with other games nice palet cleanser i guess, price is a bit higher than i'd pay for now which why a bit lower score but it comes on sale often enough			"

												This game is very challenging, but enjoyable. I do wish there was a way to strengthen your heroes more before you send them to the lower levels (other than raids), but at least they don't stop coming. Sure I had to look up some things on the wiki but it was the same way for everybody for games such as this, or Minecraft, or they had a friend who told them the recipes or the way redstone works and ways you can implement redstone to make something awesome. I hope Towns has more updates in the future to fix certain minor things, but other than that I very much enjoy playing the game. Another plus is how simple mods are done, unlike Minecraft I can get most of the mods I want to work (Not to dog on Minecraft because I love Minecraft too, but the mods are done poorly for it) For towns you just have to drop the mod into the mods file, while Minecraft will make you download other mods to get mods to work. Also Towns has (I think) an official mods website that you can go to, while Minecraft you have to trust your instincts on whether to download said mods. I know there's the wiki and stuff for mods, but when I download them and drop them in the mods file it always crashes my game or just doesn't work. Maybe your experience is different with minecraft and towns, but that is my experience.			"

												Basically if you're a fan of Dwarf Fortress, or think you would enjoy an easier version of DF you will definitely get your moneys worth with this game.  I sank many hours into it after buying it on sale but it's worth even the 14.99 regular price.This game has a LOT of negative reviews simply for the fact that the Devs officially announced that they were ending development on the game.  You can see that hundreds of reviews were posted around the same date they announced they were stopping development   It seems however that they have restarted development.  This game is worth your money even in the unfinished state, but now that development is back on it's even more worth your money.  I would honestly suggest, if at all possible, that someone from the team go through and send a message to all these people that left negative reviews on that basis.  This game has massive potential and I would love to see the community in support again.  Website for the game does appear to be down however.			"

												I don't like this game too too much. It is pretty grindy. If you like town/city build games and point and click for adventure style games. Then this might be your game. The game itself is very unpredictable, sometimes you think you are fine but in minutes you are dead. You have to always keep an eye on all of your resources and outposts.EDIT:Since the devs kinda walked away from this game I would not recommend this game if you are kinda into games that get constantly updated like minecraft or starbound or something like that.But still if you just like the idea of managing a city/town and you want a challenge. This is your game, I highly recommend trying to mod this game or make your own mods for this game because some things are not really balanced, such as food.Food is like a really big concern, they should've called it ""Don't Starve""... but I guess that name has already been copyrighted...

												People, stop reviewing a game in a negative light for the sole reason of it being abandoned. It is childish! So ironic that I see so many reviews stating that they ""loved this game early on"" and then proceed with something around the lines of ""but the developers abandoned it"". The fact remains that even as it stands, in an abandoned state, it is still worth playing. I vote it up not because I want to prove a point, nor do I vote it up because I support the developers running off with my money. I vote it up because of the question the ""Yes"" or ""No"" asks, ""Do you recommend this game?"" That yes or no answer is a recommendation for the game, not the developers. This game is well deserving of at least trying it. I played it before it got on Steam for countless hours and enjoyed every second, and also experienced no ""bugs"" at all. So stop your ♥♥♥♥ing whining over something you can fix and move on.			"

You gotta get resources make sure you have food and armor to keep them safe and healthy.Build a hospital if they are injured. Build each of your villagers a home and add decoration to make them happy to allow more villagers to join in.Build a trade market get resources you have hard time getting from the merchant and sell your resources you been gathering for money.build a tavern with tavern room to get heroes to join the village dig below the cave to allow heroes to explore for more rare ores.Build a animal farm so many bones drop? no problem make armor out of them and build your homes bone are useful material in this game.Keep your villagers happy and give each of them a task so they dont over burden their works if you make them work to hard they will die so careful what action you do to give your villages and watch them prosper.

While your watching your civilization burn to the ground and everyones dead becouse you didn't feed them, you learn what to do next time, and then next time you do better. This game offers hours of gameplay (aslong as you dont speed throught it). I've been playing it for a while and im not even half way through the doungeons. I recomend this game to anyone that likes a challenge, can handle loosing and frustraition, and wants a casual civilization game.			"

												Despite almost nothing but horrible reviews, I found myself quite liking this game. Never played Dwarf Fortress, so I'm one of the few who can't really compare this to that. To me, it's like a mashup of Minecraft and Majesty. There's definitely room for improvement, but the developers are saying this is still technically only an alpha build of the game, so if they don't drag their feet and actually listen to feedback from their community, this game could one day go from being a fun little time waster to a truly great game in it's own right. For what it's worth, this is what had it's hooks in my almost nonstop until XCOM Enemy Unknown entered my stable. And then THAT one blasted everything else, including Guild Wars 2, right outta the water. lol			"

And be prepared to spend a lot of time at your PC because this game is highly addicting. If you like RPGs and Minecraft, you'll like this game!			"

												Towns is a good little game. If you want a cute little town builder then look no further.  The interface takes a little getting used to and the wiki for the game will surely add a few new tricks for you to try. I like it, you might like it.			"

												This is one of my favorite games. Yes, it is difficult to get into at first, how to understand where to put things and hot to make buildings look good. It is a challenge, and for that, I am grateful! This game makes you use your brain to figure out how to overcome obsticals. How to make water go where you want it, and how to prepare for sieges. I love how the people will try to do things together instead of one person trying to do it all alone. And yes, it is difficult and frustrating trying to get more people to your town at first. But don't fret! It does get easier. This game makes you constantly wnt to upgrade your town to make it like a real place, something enjoyable. Although, there are so many things they could do to make it better! When I first played this game on my boyfriends account, I was puzzled. I think I played it for about 6 hours straight just trying to figure the game out. Finally, when it started to make more sense, he was intrigued by it and also wanted to try again, even though he called it stupid because he couldn't get it before. This game has so many possibilities, so many things  you can do, oh and watch out for werepig!!			"

												All the negativity about the a.i. is overexaggerated. I'll be honest, i haven't experinced any problems with the a.i. to an extent that it caused me to rage and quit. A.i. does get stuck sometimes into buildings but that's nothing new. I personally love this game. I haven't had really any negative experinces and enjoy attempting to build a town. The tutorial isn't per se a tutorial but there are let's plays on youtube that compensate for that.

												It looks like most of the reviews here are just people who buy the game and get mad after a while of playing it, probably starving to death or traveling down into a dungeon. If you're like me, you were digging and lost 20 people when they hit water and drowned in the flooded mine shaft. But this game has come a long way since some of its earliest versions, even before this game was on Steam. The developers really put a lot into making this game better and better, so much that when I found this game on Steam a long time after I played one of the earlier versions on the website, I didn't know what I was doing. There was so much more for me to do and figure out. I would say that this game isn't for everyone, but I personally love this game and respect the developers for making so many improvements. If you're not sure about this game, try watching someone play it on youtube to get a good idea of what the game is all about. I highly recommend this game to my friends and anyone who has the patience to build a beautiful town out of only their natural environment.			"

												6/10 I had an earlier review of this game in which I was very positive about it despite the lack of development. I'm knocking my score down from 7/10 to 6/10 because although I still occasionally enjoy this game it feels very limited. This game had excellent potential that was never fully fufilled. The difficulty is also very biased. If you lose more than a couple people your first hour playing your town proably won't have enough people to feed itself, protect itself, AND build and expand.I feel I got my moneys-worth from this game, but if you're considering buying it I highly suggest you wait for it to go on sale as I don't forsee it ever having another update, unless for some reason a lot of people suddenly start buying it, and then the devs may become re-interested.I give it a 6/10 because although it's frustrating it can still be enjoyable.

												While this game, highly critized for the way the developers sold it, is still fun. There is a charm to how obnixously difficult it is to get your little workers to build things where you want them too, and how you want it to. Is it perfect? No. But I found it charming, and the stuff you build with your little towns is really cool. Now If I could only convince them to actually listen. If you like this kind of sandbox town/dungeon builder, then I would advise keeping an eye out on it, especially if it goes on sale.			"

												People are so butt-hurt about this game, I don't understand why. I was actually an extremely early supporter of this game, well before it arrived on Steam. I bought it directly through the dev's website, through Paypal. At that early stage of development it had only around 10% of the features that the modern version has. Nothing was animated, sounds and sprites were missing.. there were no buttons, everything worked through these weird broken context menus. Despite all that, I thought it was a really cool game, a grid-based town-builder similar to Dwarf Fortress, except with this additional dungeoneering element. To date I still think this is the best DF-clone that has ever appeared since it's easy to learn, easy to use, and lots of fun. I prefer this to Gnomoria too.People have a lot of complaints about this game, about broken promises or features that were never implemented. Well, I have a different way of looking at it. I've played this game for at least 30 or 40 hours. And it has been extremely fun. It's a really really fun game. It's the perfect game for when you want to play Dwarf Fortress but you want to chill out and take away the complicated bits.So ignore the haters, try the free demo. It's a brilliant game. People say it's not finished, I disagree. If you can spend 30+ hours having crazy fun with a game then it's finished enough in my book.*Note: I played it mostly as the DRM-free version, downloaded from the dev's website, not through steam.*			"

												TRY THE DEMO! It's free, and believe me - it's the best test of whether the game is worth your money. TRY THE DEMO!So, Towns. Oh boy, where to begin...This game is not a game for casual play. It's not a traditional game (although I will always believe it helped pave the way for an emerging genre) like most people will expect, and it's not most peoples' defenition of ""easy"".It's a game where you get out what you put in, and then some. But the catch is, the ""and then some"" is an exponential value. After a while, you realise that you've gone from mildly interested, to challenged, to excited, to inspired, to totally hooked. Now, in all fairness, the initial challenge is steep. Like I said, it's not an easy game, it's not pick-up-and-play-and-eventually-win.  In fact, Towns is designed to encourage experimentation and multiple approaches. There are no unlocks, it's quite possible to take your first town through the whole game and reach the ""end""... but to get there, you'll need to unlock your own creativity and disaster management skills. That takes practice, plain and simple. But like any hobby, after that initial investment the first wave of reward convinces you to keep going, and after that it just gets better and better.Towns gets a lot of flak. Partly that's because it is genuinely lacking in content - at least, compared to what the content was obviously intended to be. However, I'm convinced that the flak is only spat so vigorously because Towns forces players to take a look at themselves and their own play style. In my view, a lot of the complaints are based off of the horrible realisation that some people just can't get their heads around the new strategies required to do well at this game. Because Towns is a game of strategy. It takes a keen perception and a lot of understanding to see the strategy in all its layers, but there is an underlying logic that is oh so satisfying to crack.That's not to say this is a game only for super-nerds. Rather, it requires a bit of patience and a bit of humour, plus a healthy curiosity. The patterns are simple enough once you spot them, and infinitely scaleable - that's the beauty of this game. Once you crack one challenge, you can expand and expand that solution and take the same basic logic into other challenges. That's not attractive to some players, but for others it's an absolute joy.Fortunately, there's a free demo - so you can see for yourself whether you enjoy that challenge or not. I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone who is prepared to invest the time and open themselves to the experience. It's not what everyone will enjoy, but those who enjoy it will enjoy it a lot. If you're sick of the instant-gratification games, the ones with no substance or originality; if you just want to deeply engage with a challenge and figure it out; if you're the kind of person who thinks ""gah, this is so complex... I love it, how do I solve this?"", then Towns may well be one of the games you never entirely forget.			"

												Great game, fun to play and its nice to have the ability to design buildings and your entire town and how it runs is intuitive. Would Recommend this to everyone who likes Town building down to laying the bricks of each building yourself.Note: Due to halted devolopment by Xavi (reason of course is he's to bored of working on it to continue making updates and improvements. Also that he decided to work on another project while he was working on Towns). At the moment of this update a new programer was hired to take over for Xavi's obvious lack of updating of this game. So it's really a risk to buy the game, till there's real progress put in by the new programming lead. SMP atm has lost all respect from me, considering and I qoute Xavi said, this game was pretty much a learning experience for him nothing more. So everyone who bought it was really just paying for Xavi to learn to program so he can work more on other projects he started while working on Towns. Awesome.			"

												Update: Abandoned now. It is what it is. Not exactly broken but neither finished as such. There are other games instead. Sorry.A rather cute sandbox game set in medieval time. The graphics is really nice retro. It is in a 45 degree turned isomettric view. This is also the low-point of it, it can't be turned that I know of. The menues are in the tiniest format, it's as easy to delete a game as it it to load it. That said, the menues inside the game are much better. Which is where the main production value seems to have been spent.The sound is very nice, slightly reminiscent of Settlers, the very first game, in the mood at least. I wouldn't say it's intrusive but you won't remember it either, which to me is a good point for game music.The actual game is fairly straight up management with the added fun of actual being able to lose quickly. The learning curve is steep, not overly but it will take a few games to get it like you want it. The management increases over time as you gain more people living in your town.You are very much victim of circumstances with this game. Sometimes you find iron at the surface, sometimes there is none to save your life. The caravans are an offset but dreaming of gold statues after a few hours, you've really struck gold. This makes every game a new challenge which is nice. Pretty much as Civilization was.The main thing to say about this game is that it's a time thief. You constantly look for the next thing you'll 'just do before quitting'. It sort of reminds you of minecraft in that aspect.			"

												You'll hate yourself for playing this game. You really will. You see, this entire game revolves around using an annoying UI to control villagers with an intensely annoying AI to handle logistics poorly and theoretically command them to eventually get around to doing the things you'd like to do. Sort of like Majesty, if you had to build your buildings from scratch, the only part of them that was technically necessary outside of aesthetics was the floor and your kingdom had a rule of law that all new citizens born in the nation must be dropped on their head.You start out with about 11 morons to shepherd around, gradually kit them out in safety harnesses and protective helmets so that they'll be safe when you shove them out the door and hope that you'll lose as few as possible. Eventually you start getting heroes and such that you can use to explore the dungeons that extend deeper and deeper into the map and who protect your village from the increasingly difficult sieges laid by enemies, which can feel satisfying as hell to watch them fight after getting used to your moron brigade's perpetual failure.This is also one of those games where you open a wiki while you play, just so you know. Otherwise your village will completely and totally fail because the only way to get new villagers depends on the happiness of the village, which is designed in a way that either you intentionally build your village with them in mind, or else you die and start over.I dumped about thirty hours into it over the course of a week, then didn't touch it again afterward. That's pretty much the type of game this is.EDIT: About a year later, coming back to this review I'm changing my review to negative and adjusting the sarcastic-praise slightly. The game is still fun (and from playing it a bit more, the AI is less moronic than I recalled), and the UI is tolerable now that I remember how it works (though it's still not good). That said, you shouldn't buy this game. Buying it supports the developer, and he abandoned it without shame. If you want to play it, by all means do so, just don't give the developer money in order to do that. I'll leave figuring out how to obtain the game without paying the absent dev up to you, but that's my suggestion.			"

												Towns is a superb game.  It would have been an all-time-epic game if it was created a decade ago.This is a game to have if you like strategy, simulation and a pile of creativity.			"

												Horrible game. Shady developer who just used the greenlight project to make a quick buck. He *lied* to the entire customer base, promising a full version of the game, took the money, never delivered anything.			"

												I want to like Towns, but I can't.  The tutorial is buggy and confusing.  The controls are unintuitive.  The game lacks overall cohesion.  The game is abandoned by the developers.			"
