												I want to reccomend this game, ..But a year ago, I reported a major game breaking bug, that -several- people were encountering,Mission 4, If you kill a production unit, while it is just about, or even finishing a unit, it will create an un-killable unit, that you can not hurt, can not interact with, and your own vehicles can't run into it, -however- the game thinks it is alive, and therefore you -can not beat the mission- and yet, Here it is a year later, and apparently the bug was never fixed, and people are -still- encountering the very bug that I posted a year ago, even in the same place and circumstances..... So I think the company kind of sold this and then left it...without fixes to game breaking bugs.I have seen reports of similar bugs appearing also on MIssion 5, and other levels it seems.			"

												I really wanted to love this game, I've tried so hard but it's just not quite there.The story is great, the homeworld(ish) feel is just right, the graphics and visuals are top notch and the missions are varied.BUT, there just isn't enough variety in the unit types and abilities in an age of Starcraft's and total war's.  All the factions are essentially the same with different appearances and the gameplay is heavily scripted [/spoiler] where the AI always throws endless units at you forever until you complete the objectives[/spoiler].  Couple that with annoying oddities that still aren't fixed: bombers that don't bomb first strafe so get shot down, units taking weird paths and dying, the tactical view doesn't perfectly represent the actual map, it's hard to tell if a unit can shoot or not though some weapons can fire through hills and structures (sometimes), etc, etc and it leaves me frustrated.There was so much potential and I hope they give it another go as the fan base is loyal and keen and judging by the reviews, very forgiving.  Bring on Homeworld 3!			"

												Just picked up the soban DLC(you'd need GIANT gonads to call that DLC+have the gall to charge for it) Dont clone a race and charge for skins/MINOR changes to the race you cloned to make ""soban""I'm still not quite sure what I paid for. Game dev 101: dont release a $50 game with minimal maps, races, and content in general and proceed to reskin a race with miniscule modification to actual gameplay and expect a direhard homeworld fan to purchase for $6.99Price doesnt even come into play here - DONT try to sell me skins. ~a disappointed homeworld fanPS - I've always loved homeworld(played since inception) and have all homeworld titles available on steam. This is a massive step in the wrong direction. Do not attempt to milk money from the fanbase you've inherited.			"

												TLDR: GAME ABANDONED BY DEVS, DO NOT BUY!It's sad that I need to NOT recommend this game. It seems like it would be a great game. Unfortunately I'm stuck on only the 4th map in the campaign because of a game breaking bug. The bug has been known for months and acknowledged by the devs a long time again. However the devs have abandoned the game so the simple to fix bug still exists.It's been so offputting that I can't bring myself to play it more.			"

 Deserts of Kharak is a well made sequel to Homeworld - tactic and RTS fans get their money's worth. Since I was fortunate enough to participate in the beta test I have played long enough to give you my review.StoryThe story is actually a prequel to Homeworld 1. In part 1 the intro reveals that alien artifacts have been found within the desert of Kharak which made the construction of a mighty spaceship possible.And the latest part Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak tells you the story about the search and excavation of the artifacts on the planet Kharak.GameplayYou control some sort of rolling aircraft carrier called Kapisi (your mobile HQ) through the life-threatening world of the planet Kharak. Kapisi allows you to store resources, research technologies, and the production of units. Although Kapisi has the functionality of a base, its mobility helps to set it apart from traditional RTS games. Thus a proper base building does not exist. You're looking for a suitable location and gather resources to enlarge your fleet and to research new technologies.Above everything else it's a strategy game. You can use the units from previous missions in upcoming ones, therefore you should keenly collect all resources and build units before moving on to the next mission.A unit limit prohibits you from taking too many units to the next mission. Grr. The roughly 15 hour long singleplayer campaign is tactically rather moderate and not very rapid. Most importantly you must take over good positions step by step to intercept your enemy, gather artifacts and finally destroy the enemy. In the online mode and skirmish battles everything's much more rapid, there are also 3 different win conditions in the skirmish gamemode.Otherwise one notices the well executed control system, the fitting sound, the good lighting effects and the breathtaking graphics within the gameplay. In terms of gameplay it's a well made game, though the shortness of the singleplayer campaign and the Interface, which needs getting used to, disturb a bit in the beginning. Pros: Breathtaking graphics and great effects thanks to the Unity engineSound &. Music fit the game very well and sound greatEasily learned and uncomplicated unit controlsGood animations and short video sequences with real actors in between missionsWell done and very innovative multiplayer mode. Expect tense fights with differing win conditions, like for example destroying the main base, total destruction or the hunt for artifacts (a kind of Capture the Flag)Good physics and you can use the terrain to your advantageSteam Achievements & SteamcloudNeutral: The AI is not completely stupid, but currently only hardly reacts to areal attacks and it's easy to properly position oneself, trick the AI and intercept the constantly reocurring attack pattern.There is no minimap but a tactical interface.""Only"" 13 singleplayer story missions which are beaten within 12-15 hours on medium difficultyCons: Newcomers to the Homeworld Series are left with unanswered questions regarding the storyInterface and construction menu requires getting used toThere is a pretty generous unit limitConclusion:Someone who likes RTS should take a closer look at this innovative, graphically well done game, but only if one's not only keen on a singleplayer campaign, but also enjoys a few skirmishes or playing online.This review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.Total rating: 8/10If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												SUMMARY: It's Broke Jim! Beautiful music & visuals, but game-breaking bug destroyed it all.---UPDATE Jan 3 2017: See comments for workaround to Mission 4 ""destroy remaining forces"" bug. I've decided to keep my ""not recommended"" rating, because the bug is still present after a year and I believe consumers deserve a minimum level of quality for their money - you shouldn't have to research and follow precise instructions from other consumers to work around an otherwise-blocking bug just to be able to play your purchase.---I had such high hopes - I loved Homeworld's story and I knew I'd love a prequel story. However, a few hours into playing this game, I encountered a game-breaking bug that prevented me from progressing past Mission 4 (Kalash Site). I've tried multiple times with different strategies and it's just stuck. Some people say I just have to delete & reinstall and play from the very beginning because the save file is corrupt. I played Homeworld when I was a kid with plenty of time. As an adult, my gaming time is very rare. I don't have the time to replay it all because of a bug.The internet shows this is a very well known and common bug, known in January 2016 and still unfixed after nearly a year in December 2016. They have good engineers... so a year without a fix makes it clear that this game is simply not receiving investment.For whatever portion of this game you do manage to play, you'll enjoy the gameplay, especially the beautiful visuals and soundtrack! I look forward to the day when my children, or perhaps my grand children, can download a patch and experience Missions 5+. Until then, I just can't recommend wasting valuable gaming time.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but for this one I just felt I have to. First of all let me super straight - the game brought a lot of positive memories from my past when I spent dozens of hours playing Homeworld, then Homeworld 2 and then the Complex fan-based modification. The graphics, the music, the gameplay, the story, the general vibe of a Homeworld game - it's all there. Unfortunately there're a lot of other issues with the game that I found rather disappointing. All of them seem to align with what other not-so-excited reviewers are writing. First, campaign length. I've spent about 10 hours playing campaign only. I've tried to obtain every resource available on *all* 13 missions and it only took me less than 10 hours to get this done. I felt quite disappointed when I realised this is it. Second, the AI is just, well, dumb. There's no real challenge here. Just built dozens of AA units and fear that AI will send ground units only? Don't worry, they'll keep on sending those fighters. Worry an enemy AA unit will rush to help his friends being bombarded 100 meters away? Don't worry, the AA battery will just nicely sit there, waiting to be eliminated by your ground troops once you clear the area around using air units. I haven't lost a single mission in this game. Hell, it was more of a... cakewalk. Third, just five maps in skirmish mode? Really? So tl;dr;. Would I spend €46 for this game knowing how short my satisfaction would be? Probably not. Would I recommend it to a die-hard Homeworld fan? Probably yes, but only if you're really willing to spend this amount of cash for a game so short.			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, the fourth game of the homeworld franchise and its first non-spacial RTS. In short words: Worth every single cent you put on it.Warning: I never played any other homeworld game, I didn't know its story nor had read about it before playing this game. But I'm an RTS Veteran, I've been playing RTSes since WarCraft 2, going through all games from the C&C Franchise, AoE and AoM Franchises, StarCraft 1, BW and 2, Company of Heroes 2, Grey Goo and many others.Singleplayer: I started playing the campaign, hoping for a few hours of good story telling, that is not what I got. I got an outstanding, catchy story that made me complete forget about my schedule and keep playing, the famous ""one more mission, just one, I want to know what happens"". Solid storyline, characters development is there, and as the story goes, you get to know more of each one, including side characters.Playthrough is not repetitive, levels have good variety and there is replayability for its campaign. It mays sound odd, playing the campaign again, despite being the same missions, the combination of reactive army + RNG makes the singleplayer extremely interesting to play over and over again. What do I mean with reactive army? the opponent's composition is based on yours, even on easy difficulty, imagine now in the hardest one.The whole game is beautiful, and it has in-game scripted moments, that gives youa feel that what you play is what you watch (the player never feels dislocated like watching a movie instead of playing the game). Immersive, if you want a ""gamer like"" word.Multiplayer:I bought it when patch 1.0.1 was live. It had its flaws, won't go easy on this point, netcode was unstable, we had no replays, and just 2 factions, that was back in February 20th. Now we are in the version 1.2.1 (June 24th), after patches 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.1, 1.1.1 and 1.2! And  A LOT HAS CHANGED, AND FOR BETTER! Replay system was implemented, new maps were added, netcode was fixed, tweaks in-game made the user experience a lot better. Two more sub factions were released as paid DLCs (worth the cost, they are cheap and add a lot of diversity to the game), and a new future DLC was hinted (no official word about it but other players and I speculate a singleplayer DLC is coming).Balance has been tweaked a lot to the point that DoK is one of the few RTSes in which you don't have to tech up to get imbalanced units, or do timings following a strict and 100% effective micro/macro management. No, the game is fluid, it allows you to set your pace and fight your opponent based on your rhythm. It is most important ""feature"", the thing that you should master to be good in DoK's multiplayer, is Game knowledge combined Map awareness. Positional play is the key, to the point you can turn the tide of a Battle if you know how and where to place your army. But it is not restricted and mandatory like Company of Heroes 2, where you must secure territories in order to have fuel and ammunition.There are strong units, but everything has a counter. There are ""super weapons"" that, despite the name I gave them, can't win the game, and it ends up falling into the player hands the  responsibility to use such weapon as a tide turning tool combined with his army in order to win the game.Development:As I said, in 4 months 6 patches were released, 7 if you consider that 1.0.1 was released in early February. Blackbird Interactive is a small studio when compared with other companies, and yet they are able to consistently update the game, deliver content (paid and for free), hear feedback from the community and answer to it.Here it is a little something that may sound as me using my ""bragging rights"": During a chat in one of the communities hub (the most active Discord server[discord.gg] related to homeworld franchise) I mentioned that would be cool to race a ""random"" faction, so I could enjoy the game at its fullest by just having the faction selected by the game (I play as random in pretty much every other RTS). A few weeks later, this feature was implemented. By no means I'm saying it was because of me, but one thing is for sure: Devs listen, acknowledge, and if it is reasonable, they implement it.And just recently they added support to OS X! You have an PC and a Mac? No problem, the game you bought back in Feb is now compatible with both platforms!I have a lot of faith in these guys, and I hope that with them DoK only has one future: a brighter one.Extras:Expedition Guide: If you're like me, a complete newbie to the homeworld universe, the expedition guide is an excellent acquisition. I read it after finishing the SP by the first time and I was in a awe with the amount of backstory they developed for this game. I only felt like this with a game once: When I was a little boy and had bought StarCraft 1 that came with a huge manual telling the lore of each from beginning of time. If you're a Lore lover, expedition guide is a must.Soundtrack: Love good songs? like a desert kind soundtrack with plus of mysticism, technology and apocalyptic aura? DoK gives you 111 tracks of it, in FLAC!  Instabuy for me, it may be for you too.Soban and Khaaneph Fleet packs: here is where things get tricky. In a DLC filled world, adding factions to a game as paid DLC could be called Pay2Win, and that could not be more far from true with DoK.DoK Factions introduce, by a small fee, changes in the factions, adding new mechanics, new skins to existent units, and new ways to play it. As I said before, nothing is OP,  and that is also valid to the expansion Fleets. Does it worth? yes, $7 is more than fair for a whole new way to play a game that I enjoyed.Want an example? Khanneph Baserunner (scout unit) can create a blast drone, a fast little bugger that explodes dealing massive amount of damage. Sounds quite OP right? not really, while it is fast and has a lot of damage, when spotted, it can be taken out by the most basic unit such as sandskimmer and LAVs.PROS: Immersive Singlplayer with incredible in-game scripted scenes, good dialogues and excellent audio work (voice and soundtrack) Replayability with an combination of RNG and player's choice (you can challenge yourself by putting your army in a bad spot); Involving Multiplayer that does not make you feel overwhelmed with its micro/macro intensity like StarCraft/Company of Heroes, but it is not simplistic enough to make you bored after a few hours; Hardware requirements are not extreme - despite what is said by other players I've been running it in a 2 yo computer with everything on ultra and at 60 FPS, if I disable AA, Vsync and anisotropic I can reach 150FPS easily. Extremely hardworking development team, keeping the game fresh and updated; All DLCs have a good price tag for what they add to your game experience.CONS: Due to its small playerbase you may feel ""alone"", but there is a community behind this game; Despite everything it still lacks a few basic features that I would like to see added such as: A more complete replay system, an observer mode, a few tweaks here and there; It is not exactly a con, but I would love to have more content.Personal rating? I bought this game out of the sale, paid full price for it and all DLCs. And I would do it again. 10 out of 10, best RTS of 2016 imho.Update: This game still is one of the best around.			"

												Positives:- Wonderful audio- Gameplay is very fun- Art Design and Graphics are good, the game looks very good overall- The story is fantastic, especially for a RTS. If you liked the old homeworld games lore, get this one asap. Interesting characters, well written story and dialogue. Did I just write that for a RTS game... Yup lol. Best writing in a RTS since World in Conflict.- The Atmosphere is very well done, it feels like Homeworld, oozes the whole feel perfectlyNegatives Or Things that can be improved:- The AI needs some work- More maps would be nice (I have seen today the devs announced free maps are on the way down the road)If you prefer a slower RTS, over say Starcraft 2 or if you want a RTS with a great campaign that is well written and  a blast to play, pick this up. Not perfect, but quite a good addition to the RTS genre, especially at a time when RTS games rarely come out and if they do they are usually multiplayer focused, nice to have one doing a good job with the campaign, story and atmosphere. Not as fast paced or twitchy as the popular starcraft2, but at the same time, the multiplayer in starcraft 2 has alot more options.I will post more impressions and thoughts late on when I have more hours on the game. So far it is very good though! Very Immersive, audio rocks, it looks nice and it is fun to play, despiate the ai issues and lack of maps for multi on launch.			"

												I love this game. It doesn't mean I would tell someone to buy it.Just finished the game.  Classic Difficulty.  I had a blast playing it as an old homeworld fan. Won't lie was hoping for something that was more Homeworld: Cataclysm then the other two games.   It feels and plays like a Homeworld game. Each unit has a purpose and excells in that roll, but as far as the campaign is concenred there is a certain point in which anyhting smaller then a Cruiser becomes useless. This is very much Homeworld 2 over the previous games which might turn some off. The hard part though.  Would I tell someone to spend 50$+ on this?  As the game is right now no.  Unless that person is a major homeworld and rts fan there is really no reason to buy this. Even then it is a hard sell.  The campaign is 13 missions long which is fine, but the skirmish and multiplayer as others have said before is where an RTS survives.  The fact the game shipped with 5 maps and a barebones AI which you will notice in the campaign really makes me worry about the longterm survival of this game. That and the lack of marketing on gearbox's front makes me worry that gearbox doesn't expect this to live long either.Edit:2/1/2016There are now 6 multiplayer maps.  Multiplayer is reciving balance so meta is a bit better now. Ai is still braindead.			"

												Deserts of Kharak is an amazing RTS game and my most played game of 2016.With a solid narrative Campaign tying into the original Homeworld series and dynamic fast paced Multiplayer it has alot to offer.If you are looking for just the single player experience you should be able to get around 10 hours game time.If you want multiplayer you will find a sparce but dedicated community, I highly recommend you look into the community group Legacy of Sajuuk as well as the Discord Homeworld Universe.Otherwise you are just going to be put off by empty server lists.Anyone who reads this review and is convinced to try, feel free to message me or send a friend request, I'll happily introduce you to the existing community and help get you accustom to the MP.DoK is an amazing game which with more players could grow into something truly spectacular "

												This is a true spiritual successor to the Homeworld series.  Every little touch that made Homeworld so memorable is in this game.  Unfortunately, for a $55 dollar price tag this game is woefully lacking in content.  I completed the 13 mission campaign in under 10 hours of playtime.  Whats there to do after that? Not much.  Theres a skirmish mode against an absolutely horrid AI, even on the hardest difficulty.  There is also a multiplayer but the map pool is so tiny (5 maps total? only two of them are for the most played online mode 1v1)  Just bare bones content wise all around.  This is why i cant really recomment this game for this high of a price tag.  There is zero replayability in the campaign, its a once and done kind of thing and the multiplayer is just barren.  Get this if you absolutely need a homeworld fix, but personally id avoid this until it goes on sale for at least 50% off. Just nothing to do in this game.			"

												This game breaks my heart mostly because it could have been so much more. The gameplay is stellar, there's so much potential for it to be on of the greatest. I finished single player (which was good), and went for the real treat to play multiplayer... Long story short it had many problems on release, and now the game is basicaly not supported by the devs any more. Because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launch there's basicaly no community apart from some few fanboys that will tell you otherwise. I hope that one day they will announce some ""2.0"" patch of expansion and learn on their failures. Maybe even re-release the game with more multiplayer focus. If you are more of a single player guy then sure - grab it. If you want a multiplayer experience then no - this game is a wasted potential and was killed before it even had a chance to become big. Real shame, because it's the best multiplayer experience I had in years. Can't really recommend.			"

												The best RTS Ive played in a long time, hands down.The campaign is an absolute masterpiece. Great atmosphere, immersion, visual style and music. SUPERB mission design. Every mission is very different without being gimmicky, and offers a wide variety of strategic play. The game favors strategy and tactical control over twitch micro, much like previous Homeworld games. 10/10While somewhat slim on multiplayer features at release, DoK has already had 3 major patches, with a fourth coming this month. The developers continue to support this game with new maps, multiplayer features and balance changes, and DLC. The MP community is rather small, but very friendly and welcoming to new players.If I had to find fault with the game, its the occasional bugs in the Public Lobby for custom games. Sometimes there are issues with p2p connectivity, but you can generally resolve them with a restart. If you like RTS, Homeworld, or Sci-Fi, buy this game.			"

												A quite awesome addition to the dying RTS genre, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak done a prequel story perfectly: setting up story points that were kinda ""out there"" in the originals, turning the game into a well made ""new first game"" of the series (chronologically speaking). There are obvious problems, especially when it comes to the braindead AI in multiplayer, but if you're someone who's more into singleplayer RTS games, this one is just right for you.I do have to say that it seemed like I found the exact opposite what everyone else was talking about regarding the campaign, including TotalBiscuit. They said the campaign is very easy, there are too many resources, you get unit types out of the blue without explanation, etc. I found all this to be false, as I had a rough time on Normal difficulty, I was always out of resources, and every single unit type you get is explained. So that particular criticism is weird for me. But maybe it's just me.So yeah. I'd recommend this game to RTS fans, and especially those who were fans of the original Homeworld games. It's rare if we get RTS games nowadays, so this is definitely one shining diamond.(One more note: The game is called -Deserts- of Kharak. So don't be surprised if all the maps are set in a desert.)

												Not sure why this gets such high recommendations. The single player game is pretty awful. Enemy AI seems to be non-existent instead relying on pure scripting. The enemy doesn’t even need to harvest resources. New units just appear at regular intervals. The campaign only lasted for 20 hours. Far too short for the price.I am a big fan of the original Homeworld game and RTS games in general. Replying the original Dune or CnC would be better than playing Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. "

Hello everybody.About myself: RTS player, usually oriented on competetive multiplayer experience (CoH, SupCom, MoW:AS), have limited experience with Homeworld franchise overall but definitely a persone interested in lore.In short: Game is great. It has some issues, but there is no core flaws which can make a game unplayable or effect its replayability. Game core mechanics are pretty deep, It has rich solo experience and well thought-out competetive oriented multiplayer. It is defenitely a Homeworld game from Homeworld developers. You can feel the soul of game universe while playing this game thats for sure. Amount of work those guys put in lore, game details and gameplay is huge and you can be sure that project not gonna be droped like some random moneygrab. Get this game and invest in quality game development.Core mechanicsGame is defenitely self sufficient as Homeworld game and as real time strategy. There are multiple gameplay layers from terrain to unit active abilities and veterancy system. Solid groundbased strategy overall which can be compared to original Company of heroes.Solo campaignStory is rich, gameplay is really immersive. You have great wrighting, voice acting, awesome cutscenes\videos, unit persistance with veterancy system and pretty intence atmosphere overall. Expedition Guide adds alot for lore guys like me. All you need is a bit of imagination and good headset to dive into desert. On the other side difficulty even on classic is not that hard, but game do not hold your hand all the time like TotalBiscuit tells you. MultiplayerInformation about multiplayer was limited before release to say at least and this part of the game come out as a great surprise. You can clearly feel that original Shipbreackers project was oriented on multiplayer. You have 1v1, 2v2 3v3 ladder system with matchmaking and skill tiers. Artifact retreaval game mode in ranked saves this game from passive camping of original annihialtion gamemode of Homeworld multiplayer. Belance is pretty good for a fact that there were no closed\open beta for multyplayer. You can play 2 factions with really good diversity, dont listen to those who tells you that they are all the same. There is no identical units at all and there are huge core differencies in strategy\abilities\unit compositions etc. With great game core mechanics this game have a possibility to became a noticable RTS game like CoH or SupCom. There is no replay and observers system which are essential to form a competetive community around the game. And 5 maps are not enought thats for sure. Devs have a lot of work here if they want to bring this game to competetive standarts.You can look at competetive part of the game here - ""First Ever Shoutcast!

												This will be my final write up on this review, as I have now completed the campaign and because of that alone my opinion is now a very, VERY cautious recommendation IF all you are after is the prequel story in a rushed format. If you're after replayability, hours of skirmishing etc, then go play Homeworld Remastered/ClassicsI've played the Classics since I was a kid back on a 98 os system (all the way through xp and windows 7, I've probably put over a 1000 hours into each) and I've put well over a 100 hours into remastered just so you know that this is an opinion on the game from someone who has been tainted with the previous Homeworlds. A new fans opinion may obviously vary from mine.I'll start off with the positive:	 The art style of the cutscenes is fantastic, it's actually something I wish other media would uptake it's so pretty. The music is classic Homeworld, desperate and dramatic tones of orchestra, it's great. There's more dynamic battlechatter (for example when an enemy is detected but not seen units will report they have signals but no visual conformation) which is a very nice touch Guard formations are back, (took us this long to get that back?) Atmosphere and story is very homeworld, a desperate struggle against a formiddable enemy Love the fact Rachel is a unit, any game which lets you some way have a badass chick is usually good in my books Artifact recovery is a fun little thing to do, and it's a great asset, they offer great strengthening factors to your fleet The prequel story is very compelling, not to spoil anything but after the end of this I immediately went and started playing Homeworld 1 againNow the negative: The game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥when compared to remastered, even on ultra, ship textures are okay and the explosions are....okay, but the other FX look pretty poor and the sand textures look extremely lat and lifeless, to the point where I look at the screenshots above and scoff. Combat has a serious lack of individual unit importance, the only way you can win is mostly by unit spam, you'll throw a lot of the starting units straight to the winds There's no ballistics, at least from what I can tell, rail gun hits seem to be RNG and everything else is just falsely animated when compared to what's actually shooting and what's actually taking damage No docking? No harvester drop off animations? What? TERRIBLE unit clipping, like half the stuff on the surface doesn't actually exist, I've got scavengers just driving through the wreck of the Kalash like it's nobodies business Very little unit variation both in each race and between the two races, one race hovers and the other doesn't but in terms of combat they are identical Only 5 maps for Skirmish/Online The controls are pretty butchered, unnecessary button changes to a system that was well understood and well loved, and you can't even get that system back because the controls are NOT-REBINDABLE  No ALT focusing, making trying to keep an eye on your units in combat even more difficult without them clipping through sand, mountains, bigger units and resources Unit target priority is very odd, rail guns will try to shoot tiny fast LAV's while another railgun is killing them, it's like they just defend themselves from what they see first which will ALWAYS be the LAV's I know this is precise but, the support carriers guns will all fire when in combat, even if not all of them are on target, so you get bullets just flying off the thing in random directions for no reason Missiles and bombs have very random velocities, they'll launch/drop at reasonable speeds but as soon as they get close to a target they'll accelerate to ridiculous speeds and perform seriously unbelieveable changes in direction. I understand a bit of smudging to make stuff like that hit but, this is immersion breaking I find very few of the scenarious in the campaign to be imaginative, you've got your standard first mission of testing resourcing, production and the like and from there's it's just been engage and destroy the enemy mostly (as well as the aforementioned artifacts to recover) Skirmish AI is both useless and a dirty cheater at harvesting resources much faster than you ever could Camera gets stuck at certain zooms sometimes Sometimes turret animations will simply fail and rounds will come out the back of them instead of through the barrelOf course some of this can be fixed in patches, we NEED Alt focusing again and we DEFINITELY need rebindable controls, as well as a fix for the buggy clipping, certain odd unit behaviour and some busted animationsMy final word is that I really want to say I enjoyed this, hell I probably did, the campaign (as un-imaginative as it is) is enough to make you want to complete it, but that's pretty much all you're getting. If you're a die-hard Homeworld fan and you want to experience this epic journey of the great expedition then be prepared to experience the feeling of a very rushed game along with it. Buggy animations, unit clipping, fairly certain I've mentioned it all. And it will ruin the immersive moments, even the end of the game was almost ruined for me, as the final scene plays and the beautiful animation style shows us the sky of Kharak, Rachel was saying her piece and was interrupted twice by the blockhead Intel Officer saying ""Galsien fighters approaching"" even after I'd killed every single last one of them.I just chose to ignore him (the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) "

												There's just not enough content to justify the full asking price of £30 for this game. If you want homeworld, get the remastered edition. Wait until there's a gold edition and maybe there will be some good content. Campaign is short, and linear. Is this 1999? I expect more depth from my strategy games these days. It's shallow, but beautiful. Listen to the soundtrack on youtube. Skirmish is a let down, when it was released there were five maps, all taken from the campaign, and off the top of my head, there's less than a dozen units for the coalition, a similar amount for the gaalsian. If you like RTS and you've heard of homeworld, don't get this one. It's not finished. It feels like a demo. I completed it after a few days and thought ""was that it? I could have got more enjoyment out of £30 of booze.""			"

												L I T E R A L L Y  H O M E W O R L D.RTS vehicle physics look better than my lifeHomeworld has always been a game that's very intense with the art direction, so the world looks absolutely flawless, though perhaps it might not be for some. All of the cutscenes thus far have been fantastic with their animated art concept. The actual gameplay is very similar to Homeworld, but now instead of a groundbreaking 3D space RTS... we're on a planet. Blackbird made sure to try new things here though, and they want to keep some aspects of the original game alive in that now the game feels quite authentic. The terrain isn't flat, you have topographical maps and need to pick and choose the best positions to place your forces if you want the advantage you desire. The storyline is top notch.			"

												Full disclosure: I'm one of those people... a 90's PC gamer that was blown away by the first Homeworld. It's been propped up in my mind as one of the greatest strategy games of all time. I've gone back and played it ad nauseum... yadda yadda yadda. I'm one of those types.People like me will tell you that Deserts of Kharak has mighty big shoes to fill. And... It doesn't quite live up to it. How could it? Homeworld is more or less an 'ideal' at this point. But I'll also tell you in the same breath that Kharak is a game worth playing. The art is stylish. The graphics retain that sense of scale that made the original so impressive. The story is decent; more about representing a sense of place than of character development (very sci fi). Most importantly, it feels like a Homeworld game.Like I said though, it falls short. The game is over much too quickly, and the pacing is inconsistent. Kharak is a road trip game, but its jerky flow makes it seem like you're missing out of huge swaths of the game's story.The gameplay is flashy and nice. The vehicles are awesome but you'll find yourself falling into a successful routine and ignoring the game mechanics that are introduced later in-game. There's just not enough space to breathe and explore these new styles of play. Kharak lacks the replay value of the previous games.While I honestly can't see myself revisiting the game on it's current merits, I feel Blackbird took a step in the right direction. It ain't a retread. Ground-based combat was refreshing. It opens up new avenues in the future.Luckily for us Homeworld fans, Deserts of Kharak sold well enough. That's the takeaway for me. The game is a servicable successor, but most importantly, I haven't been more excited about the future of the franchise in a very long time.			"

 An (awesome) indie game with the price of an AAA game First of all, I feel bad for not recommend this game, the game is great, RTS at its finest, complex, hard, offers variety of strategic... is the best RTS I've played since Supreme Commander. The campaign (isn’t mind-blowing anyway) has a great atmosphere, the feeling of being on an expedition in the middle of nowhere, with everything against you. That sense of rush while you're collecting resources for example, not knowing when an enemy patrol may appear through the dunes. Had a great narrative, a superb missions design, the video sequences have a magnificent design (like drawn with a brush, a speed painting between 2D and 3D), an incredible soundtrack... And an interesting plot.So why i cannot recommend it? Like the title said, is an indie game (sometimes even one on early access) overpriced. There's a important lack of content for the price its cost. You can beat the awesome campaign in less than 8 hours... and there's no more to do. There's not many units (and not very different aesthetically), only one campaign, the scenarios are incredible (but are similar, ok, a vast desert, you know), the HUD is an schematic and insipid 2D (you don't need to see how the pilots move inside their vehicle like on Starcraft 2 of course, but it makes it quite clear what kind of game it is), the units doesn't speak too much sometimes... Of course you got the skirmish and multiplayer (in fact you just need to look the achievements of the game to see it is the main feature), but only two factions, well, to be fair they're the same with different skins... less than 9 maps and of course only 4 game modes (almost identical)... and by the way, the online mode is dead.And well... now, they just released a DLC...6.99 to add 4 vehicles to the online mode... well 4 skins more or less. So... again a very overpriced stuff. This is not the correct way to make better the game, or even to bring back a game focused on the online mode. The game need new campaigns, offline campaign.The game is great, if you like the original Homeworld you will love this (the game is a mix between Supreme Comander and Ground Control with the Homeworld greatness), if you are a fan of real RTS you will love it too, I do. But the game is not worth that price (25-30 is recommended price, IMO), if you only can buy a game... look for another or wait for a discount (a big one), if you don't care about overpriced games, go for it.

												Hold onto your wallets, game has potential but is sullied by lack of content and very broken AI. It is a Homeworld game in the same sense that Supremem Commander and Supreme Commander 2 can be compared. Pros: Homeworld fans will enjoy the extra lore, Story is enjoyabe, looks and sounds great.Cons: AI dose not work sometimes, not much to do after the campaign is all done, leaves you wanting more. Would wait for a sale if you really want to get into this. I will reccomend this game in hopes that they will add more content to this game in the future that can warrent the full price.			"

												I really want to recommend this game. It's beautiful, has the feel of the original Homeworld but on a planets surface now. The mechanics are good, the units are brilliant. It's sadly just a bug ridden mess. ""Kill all enemy"" urmm there's not one on the map, I've spent the last 4 hours looking for them! Bring item back to ship, it did, it just doesn't update. Ok just roll back to a save but you can't due to the (what would be a fine for making you not screw up save system) but you can't roll back and redo something since it doesn't allow it. What could be an utterly fantastic game is sadly just maddening.			"

												I wanted to give this a good review, but the developers failed so entirely, that it just isn't justified.  At the core of it, this is your basic desert themed RTS.  The only features to set it apart from C&C or the ""Craft"" games, are persistent units across missions, and the fact that your base is mobile.  These two gimmicks are really all that sets this game apart from the herd, and, if executed well, they'd be enough.  The problem is, the developers have shown NO concern with fixing launch day issues.  I waited a year before writting this review, hoping they'd finally fix them, but there are still glitches, identifed within the first week after launch back in January of 2016, (search ""mission 4 sandskimmer bug"" in the forums,) that were acknowledged over a year ago by the developers, but were NEVER fixed.  Oh, sure, they'll spew out overpriced DLC that offers next to no content, but they won't fix game locking issues, issues that force entire mission restarts.  Do to the nature of this one bug in particular, if you're unlucky, you could end up restarting and playing through the same mission fifteen times, and hit the same snag every single time.  It makes the mission simply impossible to beat, since there is an enemy unit spawned that counts as an objective unit, but has no health bar, cannot be damaged and cannot be targeted.  You can park your entire army on top of it, you can force fire at the unit, doesn't matter, it's invincible.  Or, you could get lucky, and play the entire campaign without ever experiencing it.Now, again, by itself, thats just a bit of bad programming.  It happens.  The problem is, that they've known about this bug for OVER A YEAR, and done nothing to fix it.  Bugs are acceptable.  Refusing to FIX indentified bugs, after over a year, isn't.			"

												Unfortunately, I haven't ever played the original Homeworld, but I know what a gem it was.  I've been missing a good RTS ever since Westwood was gobbled up by EA and Command & Conquer started to decay.Deserts of Kharak is a breath of fresh air and gives me the same joy that I missed from the good ol' days.  For those who don't have any context on the game, it feels like Battlestar Galactica mixed with Dune.  Its fun, it's demanding and I can't stop playing it!  I would write a longer review, but I need to get back to the campain story (which is amazing) to see what happens!HIGHY recommended to any and all RTS fans!AFTER HAVING COMPLETED THE CAMPAIGN:Soooo, I think I got ahead of myself here.  I really loved the game, it was so much fun, but I don't think it has enough depth for me to keep coming back for skirmishes. The campaign was a bit short in my opinion (about 8 hours on normal difficulty), but I really enjoyed it. I think I would buy an expansion for this game and I would recommend, but I think I would suggest waiting until it goes on sale in a few months.			"

												I'm a fan of the Homeworld saga.Now it has been specified, and I can go on and say I had fun with this game for those reasons: I really enjoyed the storyline; the artwork, comprehensive of sounds, musics, and graphics, is totally immersive as usual.Cool, anyway, Thumbs down becouse I have to be objective (and not everyone have to be a fan of the saga).The gameplay is cheap: the few units available results in few tactics and strategies. Does enemy have anti-air guns? If no smash him with aircrafts, otherwise go with cruisers (and that's all). Scenarios are so empty. Yes, the game is about the desert, ok, but still feel like something is missing.After all, this could be a good game to spend some hour with (in single player, of course, multiplayer is deadly boring), but only at a lower price.Guys, 46,00€ for this is a robbery.I got it with a discount of -20%, but I suggest to consider buying this for at least a -60% discount.

												The story behind Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak’s development is a bit of a strange one. It started as a Homeworld-inspired project being developed by ex-devs of the original games, with the obvious difference of it being a ground-based RTS instead of a 4x space-strategy title. Yet events conspired to land the Homeworld license in Blackbird Interactive's hands, and instead of starting on a new project, they opted to retroactively fit their existing title into the universe as a prequel. What they have created feels surprisingly authentic, with gameplay mechanics and atmosphere that emulate the lonely, haunting, vaguely middle-eastern experience that characterizes the series.Continue Reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

												Meh. Deserts is to Homeworld as Supreme Commander 2 is to Supreme Commander. The game has been flattened - literally in the case of the battlefield - to the point of oversimplification. The campaign is great fun but insanely short - less than ten hours - and skirmish or multiplayer doesn't have any real opportunity for playing with strategy because there just aren't enough kinds of units to mix things up. I wouldn't be so annoyed if I'd paid twenty bucks, but fifty? Come on guys. Don't buy unless it's on serious sale.			"

I had a nostalgia hit me from the series.It felt like a Homeworld game and sounded like one with the superb voice acting, Excellent music and accompanied by beautiful cutscenes.

The game is fun and the multiplayer works however there is a shortage of good maps seen.

			I beaten it, was it worth it? Kinda it felt like homeworld in terms of storytelling but the game was just decent. I expect better and a sequel to homeworld in the future.		

 Pros + Great soundtrack as always from the Homeworld series along with top notch voice acting+ Battlechatters between units and acknowledgments as the battle wages between two factions the Coalition and the Galsien on the dying planet of Kharak.+ Graphics looks good and not too overly done, the game runs really well and feels optimized. Though the texture could use more work but overall the environment of the world of the dieing planet Kharak is full of sand, dunes, tornadoes, and sand storms adding the feeling of immersion.+ Units animations such as leaving sand dust when they speed up or blowing up leaving debris and black sand is enjoyable to watch when zoomed in or when units jump over giant dunes.+ Cutscenes are beautiful and top notch with cinematic watercoloring type of art along with in game cutscene that adds to the storytelling.+ Easy to understand unit counters accompanied by a great tutorial that explains how to play the game and use the camera+ Good ui and not overly cluttered along with easily understandable hotkeys.+ Multiplayer matches are fun and easy to understand in two modes, carrier destruction or capture the artifact. Cons  - Story was uninteresting and left new players left out on the lore without much proper explanation of the situation one has to be a fan to understand what exactly is going on.- Ai in campaign does not respond to your units engagement types and literally cannot counter you, They are also set on predetermined pathing so if you die a mission, you can reload and test yourself and see that they will always go in the same directions or send the same units for situation even on the hardest difficulty. Not entirely dumb but needs rework.- Hardest difficulty beaten in seven and a half hours. Without rushing and played by veterans.- Cannot bind your keys though will not be a problem for those familiar with strategy games and can learn, the issue will be for left handers and others who cannot put up with the control ( THIS IS A SITUATION THAT CAN BE PATCHED!)- No units formations like in the original Homeworld series. (ie no formations at all so your support units can end up in the front and or too far from range to heal your units which sucks. You'll have to manually set them up in position.- Multiplayer is very lacking only 5 maps total to fight against your friends/enemy. Hopefully more will be added or a map editor of sort so that we'll have more maps.- Lack of strategy depth for unitsIn conclusion for those of you who are Homeworld fans you'll like the game, it is good but its not great. I am awaiting a sequel and hopefully see more improvements to Homeworld itself. It is a fun casual game to play online as well as an enjoyable narrative game with a short campaign without overly complex units and strategies. At best it is up to the multiplayer if this game will continue on living but even then the lack of multiplayer modes and map is undesirable and only time will tell if the game will withstand the test of time. There aren't many strategy game these days but this definitely isn't the worst. Hopefully future patches will improve it. Wait for a price drop or get it if you are eager to just play something.			"

												Firstly you will note that I've chosen not to recommend this game so I will briefly summarise why that is the case.As a prequel for the Homeworld series this game does live up to its predecessor in relation to the campaign and overall presentation. The story flows well, the cut-scenes are well done, and the tasks in the missions offer some variety. The story itself, as you may no doubt have guessed, follows the progress of the 'Expedition' refrenced in the very first opening sequence of the original Homeworld game. This game wasn't developed by Relic but that certainly doesn't show, at least when it comes to the single player campaign polish.Other than the single player campaign, the rest of the game leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. The fact that the campaign is only 13 missions long, the first practically being another training mission, in-and-of-itself, doesn't help. Regarding the multiplayer side there are only 6 maps at present to play skirmish games on. When it comes to skirmishes against the computer, the AI in this game is very underwealming and not challenging at all. As for playing against other human opponents there doesn't appear to have been much uptake of this game from other players from a multiplayer perspective as I have searched for nearly an hour trying to find a ranked game, and public lobby games are few and far between.All in all, if you're a fan of the Homeworld series I wold recommend waiting until this game is on sale at at least half the price. As things stand its not worth the money for a single player campaign with barely any multiplayer support or community,			"

I guess this isn't really a con as such as there are all of the skirmish matches to explore now.A bug in one of the missions (the only one I encountered) caused some confusion, but a save and reload sorted that out.I would highly recommend this game, particularly to those of you who like the real time war strategies.

The campaign is short but very good.But...There is no multiplayer community at all.  Skirmishes lack some of the abilities and army size of the campaign game, plus the AI is terrible.  The DLC is extremely expensive for what is basically nothing but reskins of the factions already in game, and the 2 factions that are in game are basically the same faction with some minor ability changes and build orders.  What was done is masterful, fun and polished... and it's not that I don't want to play it, I really do.  There's just not enough of it.			"

												If you're a fan of the Homeworld series and don't care about multiplayer, get this game.   Granted the multiplayer exists; it is dead and I have never seen more than about 10 players online at a time.  Local skirmishes are decent.That said, this may be my favorite RTS single player campaign ever.  While the story is so-so, the voice acting, missions, graphics, and gameplay are outstanding.  You will catch yourself staring at your pack of LAVs bouncing over dunes just for how good it looks.  Little things like panicking chatter on the radio during a battle and the eerie music add to the experience.  It is very rock-paper-scissors as far as unit balance goes, but IMO anything much more complex balance-wise and you're into a StarCraft II RTS sort of game (which is very good in its own right).Some other reviews talk about a ""game-killing"" bug in the 4th mission, I have played through it three times and not had a problem.  Perhaps the devs fixed it.			"

												Don't usually do extensive reviews, but thought i would do one since i have a great feeling for this game. This will be short, but certainly will update as i progress more into the game. Thumbs down, Thumbs up or skip as you please after reading, no hard feelings here. First and foremost i personally think this game is amazing! I am having a blast with the campaign and the story is actually really fun & exciting. Even the 'cutscenes' are great to watch.. it's like a mini movie getting you pumped before the mission, feeding you with emotions so that you try your best to save 'X' people and do 'X' mission. I will not get to much into the graphics because im not fussy with them. - Graphically, the game is stunning..   i am playing  1920x1080 with all graphical settings set to Ultra, and i must say i am blown away with the amount of detail they have put into the maps, terrain, units and just everything! Even when you zoom down and you can see your units up close and personal, you notice the small details and just appreciate the work they have put into each and every object to make it look very realistic and sophisticated. Ahh.. The lighting and shadows are spot on! It gives you that extra 'real life' feeling to it, i can't explain it much more than that, but everythings looks great so far. My PC specifications for those wondering: 

Processor:-    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz
Video Card:-   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti
Memory:-       16 GB Ram
Resolution:-    1920 x 1080
Operating System:-   Microsoft Windows 10 (build 10240), 64-bitCampaign/Story - The story so far is actually exciting, and for me that's hard to find in a game. Truth be told, i don't tend to finish many campaings on any game i play.. Usually i just jump straight into Multiplayer and later on try the campaing, don't like it and just go back to playing the Multiplayer section, but 'Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak' has already gotten me hooked.. I for the first time in a long time have just enjoyed playing the campaign and not even thinking of joining an online game. Why? the story line.. like i have said, it's amazing and really fun with some awesome mission, some are simple and some are hard. Also i do suggest giving the tutorial a go for new players, if no you'll have a hard time adjusting to the game when either playing the campaign or multiplayer.Another thing for now that i shall mention, terrain. It's great to see an RTS game add realistic areas(I'm not saying other games have not done so in the past), for example.. If you are planning to attack a target, you can't just select your units and tell them to attack 'X' units.. Sometimes you have to put them on higher grounds because the terrain isn't always  flat.  Even the smallest hill will make your units just shoot into the sand and do nothing, thus why having to put them onto the perfect location so they can fire and hit their target and have an advantage, and at the same time getting a little cover. This really does give the maps/game the complexity that games like this need. Another thing i love, is with certain heavy tanks you can now 'smoke screen' an area to cut off long ranged attackers hitting your units, this means the enemy has to bring the heavy tanks closer and will make them vulnerable to attack, or make them wait out the smoke and that will mean they're useless for that short battle! Simple things like this make you think!  it's great. Like i said, ill keep updating this review.. but for now this is all i have. Hope this does help for anyone thinking of buying the game - This is more so the positives of the game, because i have not encountered any big negatives thus far.. so i suggest reading other reviews if this has not satisfied you. Some Gameplay of the first two missions, thought this would also help to choose if you like this sort of game style or not. Mission One:

												I don't usually write reviews, but this game disappointed me so much I couldn't help it.So let's get right to it.Campaign: The only thing positive I have to say about the campaign is that I liked the art style and feel of the cutscenes. They are a mix of the lineart Homeworld cutscenes and A Scanner Darkly. Very imaginative and unique.The rest of the campaign is trash. The voice acting is atrocious. Whoever voiced Rachel sounds bored, even when finding the most amazing technologies ever seen by man. The writing is just bad and gave me no feel for the characters or the mission itself. Actually, when the game ended, I wasn't even expecting it. It was a bland..""that's it?"". Not even Homeworld 2 was this bad.Music: Probably the best part of the game.Gameplay: Ohhh boy. This is not Homeworld guys. This is generic ground RTS. You have the standard rock paper scissors gameplay, your airstrikes, and some abilities. That's it. Unit variety is nonexistent. The game is about unit positioning and ""the high ground"" but everything moves so slow the battles are usually over before you manage a move command. Then there's the fact that there are no unit formations whatsoever. So, pray tell, what's the point? The entire mechanic seems half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and incompleted.And it's buggy. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it buggy. I had my carrier launched into the stratosphere because it couldn't fit a path not once, not twice, but thrice. To see a billion ton piece of metal flipping through the air is comical and rage inducing. Units that clip through the ground, never to be seen again, dunes that sometimes block shots but sometimes let them inexplicably through. What the hell is this?I didn't get to play the multiplayer part. I'm just to disappointed to try it. Forget it.			"

												Great game, especially for fans of the original 3 games. I strongly recommend it if you like RTS campaigns or mature sci-fi stories.+ Good story. Playing this after LotV reminded me that RTS campaigns don't actually have to have garbage plot and characters.+ Excellent music and audio, especially the dynamic unit chatter. Why can't all sci-fi strategy games do this?+ Excellent art design as one would expect from this series. Nice graphics overall, once I figured out I needed to manually tell NVIDIA to activate my video card (the game defaulted to integrated graphics)+ Comes with HW and HW2 remastered for free!+ Solid gameplay. Compared to HW2, elevation and line of sight partially make up for the loss of the z-axis. Heavy units aren't as overpowered as in HW2, while turrets and motherships are far more interesting.- Poor long-term value. I would have liked a longer campaign with more factions and the skirmish mode is bare bones with few options or maps. Devs have promised more content for free, we shall see.- No in-game pause, only pause to menu.- No official modding support as of yet.			"

												Wait... that was it?  It's over already?  8 hours of single player?  Blackbird, you should be embarassed.It was good a eight hours, but come on!  Even Call of Duty manages to do better than that and their single player campaigns are just interactive movies made to sell the multiplayer game.  I've played expansion packs with more content.Again, it was a good game, but it felt like half a game.  The campaign was too short, there were only a handful of units, and the tech tree felt shallow and rushed.  There were a lot of upgrades, but you blew through them so fast there wasn't time to apprecaite their effects.  Half a recommendation.  Get it, but wait for it to go on sale.			"

												I write this review mostly due to the lack of a viable MP, at least for me. I didn't play it long as I wasn't able to play MP due to some strange regionally issues that doesn't allow me to see games in other regions. Few people were on in my region and, thus, I rarely saw any MP games.The graphics are nice and gameplay is good but, with an easy campaign (even on the highest level) and this strange separation of MP by region, which seems to have destroyed the MP community, I'd say beware of it.If the regions are removed and MP is viable, then this may very well be a fun game.

												Have been playing through the campaign and also some little skirmishes. In my opinion the game is okay, but far from being good enough to be recommended at the current price.+ unique and nice setup+ some very good ideas for battle overview & unit handling- a lot of bugs/crahes- no key rebinding (really?)- tactical overview is cool but it is annoying to enter/leave it via a key, it would have benn better to automatically enter it when zooming out- You can zoom in way too close but not far enough out- really classic scissor-stone-paper principle for the units. This is okay so far if the other faction didnt just have other skins for the exact same unit type. A bit more variety would have been cool.- the campaign is pretty shallow. Especially the end is frustratingly short´- AI is crap "

												Good But...This is a great game to play and I love the Homeworld vibe in a desert setting, the aesthetic is perfect.Unfortunately I have encountered several game breaking bugs that are unacceptable in a $50 game.  This is not some early access indie title.Cut scenes cannot be paused, this is sheer lunacy.Save your money.  Even at $25 in the sale I do not think a half finished game is good value for money.  While I am writing this my game is stuck in the strategic view because of faulty dialogue.The resource management is also deeply unbalanced.  The enemy seems to spawn units at a constant rate whereas you must deal with a finite quantity of resources, that's not good enough.			"

												Refunded. Game has extremely good aesthetics, THAT IS ALL IT HAS. Gameplay is very shallow. The campaign people brag about is nothing more than infinite waves of enemies coming at you until you complete the objective. No strategy, just try to ball up your units and have them heal between the infinite waves of enemies while you do the mindlessly simple objectives. Terrain is done very slick and has meaning, sadly that meaning is lost in actual gameplay when someone just parks behind a dune and waits for you. This game is sort of like Homeworld in several ways, in others it's worse. It would be a long review to say how and why. At $22.50 this game is still a rip off. Deserts of Kharak is poorly done RTS with nice graphics. That's the low-down, that's all you need to know. Other bad reviews will go on about the myriad of other problems so no need to list them again here.			"

												Now then, let's begin. I've been a homeworld fan for a long time. This game is Homeworld. It feels like it, it paces like it, It sounds like it, need I go on? I've just completed the campaign, which imo is the only game mode that counts, and there has only been one bug, but was not game breaking as it fixed itself by the next mission. This is my second favourite game in the franchise, right after the original. The campaign is really hard, just like the original and the game doesn't hold your hand and treat you like a moron. If you screw up, you lose. Even on Normal dificulty. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in RTS or Scifi in general as it tells a good story and serves as a great introduction to the universe.			"

												Those that experienced the original Homeworld game back in 1999 were in for a real treat, with the epic story much like the modern Battlestar Galactica series. A slower paced RTS game with intriguing reverse difficulty and epic lengthy capital ship battles. Whatever you complete your mission with is what you start with in the next mission. And Homeworld was purely in space, and it had some control issues as it wasn't common to play an RTS game in pure 3D space.This new Homeworld prequel is a fantastic experience, but plays just like the original -- except everything is on land, thus 2D and easier to control. I recommend playing on hard, for the full experience. I would have to frequently reload an old save if I made a major tactical. But as a fellow game developer with a lot of RTS experience, BBI have done a most impressive job using the Unity engine and putting together the complete package. It performed well with max settings at 2560x1600 resolution.			"

												>this review may change in the future.>1/25/16This game is an absolute must for any RTS fans out there, especially ones that plays RTS for the single player.  The Gameplay is the typical homeworld style, only this time, its on the ground.  Unlike space where there is nothing to get in the way, the new enviroment this game is set on, offers a fun and great experience, especially since its homeworld.The campaign may be short in RTS standard.  but its the missions offers something great.  Keeping the same units you built since the beginning was fun, it always♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to see my high ranking units get destroyed (mostly because of poor decisions).  I reccomend playing it on classic mode (hardest difficulty) while the AI may not be great, the mission designs somehow finds a while to keep the challenge.  In short, the single player campaign is fun.Now for skirmish.  like I said before, AI is not great and there are only five maps.  Hopefully BBI or Gearbox will release free DLC maps very soon and allow modding for this (lots of potential for great mods too.  Mad max Mod anyone?)  You may have heard this before in the discussions of this game.  Bad AI, five maps.  In an RTS game that is a big nono.Multiplayer is, like usual, the best one.  Downside, region lock.  So far I have been only been able to find 1v1 matches 2v2 and 3v3 takes forever, that the only way to find larger matches is through the public server browser, but thanks to the region lock, you barely find anyone (usually juse one match/server is open)  I hope they fix this.The game has some weird optimizations, if you have a good computer, a great PC? You will get stuttering, no matter what option you set in the game.  hopefully in a patch they fix this.  Not really surprised that the game will have optimization problems, people did say, Unity Engine (which is what this game is using) has problems running smoothly.Would I recommend this game?  yes BUT, with the very few features it has (like usual, bad AI, short campaign, five maps) the price it has right now, is not worth it.IF YOU REALLY WANNA BUY THIS GAME.  you're better off waiting for a sale or looking to other retailers/sites that offers a lower price, like♥♥♥♥♥or something similar     If they fix all these issues, mainly the multiplayer region locking, AI, and the fact it has only five maps.  It would be great.+Great campaign+beautiful artstyle+Good gameplay+Good Story+Use of terrain/utilizes full 3d enviroments+Challenging single player (on classic)-Short campaign-poor optimization-five maps on release-bad AI-region locked multiplayer-Price of the game despite how very little features it has			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak takes the classic space RTS gameplay of the original Homeworld games and brings it down to the ground. Namely, the endless desert of Kharak. The result is a refreshing take on the RTS formula with superb art direction.I really love the way this game looks. The mix of the rugged industrial motifs of the ships traveling through the desert and the naval iconography of the aircraft carrier on wheels (which is an idea I just love!) works supremely well. I specifically really adore the fact that the UI is modeled to look exactly like what you would imagine the characters in the game would be looking at on their computer screens. Art and design on this game is top notch and make this game stand out from other RTSs, while still hearkening back to what made the art of the original Homeworld games special.I also very much like the combat. The two factions in the game are similar enough that you can pick up the other pretty quickly if you've learned one, but also different in very cool ways. The Coalition is great at defending particular locations; they can build turrets and must build stationary logistics modules to increase their fleet. The Gaalsien, in contrast, are all about mobility and covering the map. They can produce units from multiple locations simultaneously and their units generally are quicker and more mobile. They also do not need static logistics beacons because they upgrade their fleet capacity as research on the carrier.All of these factors and the ""Battlestar Galactica""-esque campaign make for a great complete package. I think this is going to be one of the strategy games we talk about for years.See more about the game and my opinions in this pre-release video:

The AI is not very smart but not to the point where it is frustrating, especially on classic difficutly it is not a big issue. I can't see this game going well in MP, at least not with the amount of possible unit compositions it has now (low), so buy it if you enjoy single player, and enjoy the MP when modders get their hands on it.

												An outstanding new chapter in the Homeworld universe. Superb detail, sounds, voice acting, and overall presentation. A highly atmospheric RTS along with lore to back it all up. Deserts of Kharak is far beyond something unique. The first time you see and take control of your Carrier from home base, is a moment in gaming you will not forget. I've played many an RTS game over the years. This one is very highly recommended Pros:-superb graphics; details of units, environmental effects, world design, physics-outstanding sound design to include voice acting-highly detailed story lore included in the digital companion ""guide""-seeing your Carrier launch a cruise missile for the first timeCons:-digital companion ""guide"" should be Free for all purchasers of the game-enemy a.i not the smartest of opponents.

Product received for free
												This review is spoiler free.  However, it is only a review of the campaign game.  The game wasn't interesting enough to explore the other factions after finishing the campaign and the multiplayer is dead.  I will disclose that I recieved this game as a gift.  I probably wouldn't pay more than $20 for it myself given the content.Overall Score:  5/10  average, or 6/10 slightly better than average for homeworld fansNutshell:Homeworld: DoK has interesting setup and lore, but is overall too short with an unsatsifying, rushed ending.  Its gameplay is fairly average and uninspired with only one or two unique features, playing like an offshoot of C&C that wants to be a Homeworld game.  Its not bad though, just average.Full:Overall, I got about 11 hours of gameplay in, and that was on medium difficulty with a few failed missions and sometimes really drawing out missions to get resources.  I'd say the actual campaign time was at most 8 hours.Campaign:Story is pretty entertaining, but many things are left unexplained.  It feels like the developers set up this rich world with rich culture, but we're never really able to explore it.  Regardless, the game ropes you in with the supposed promises of lore.  Entertaining that is, up until the second to last mission, where everything accelerates to light speed and things are over before you can even blink, leaving a LOT of unexplained lore.  A very rushed ending, but up until that point the game was pretty cool.Another irritating part of the campaign is that when all objectives are completed, the mission immediately ends, giving you no chance for fleet maintanence or post-objective resourcing (there is no autocollection like in Homeworld 2, thank goodness).  This was largely the most irritating part of the campaign.Lore wise, the Galsien where pretty cool, and I loved their deification of the antagonist of Homeworld; very neat lore trick.  Another neat thing is how they consider the sands so sacred that they never set foot on them.  All their units hover... hell their religious leader isn't even allowed to stand and constantly sits on a suspended hammock.  They're cool!I also loved the reflection of the Kushan in the unit design of the Coalition.  Very slick.The cinematic artstyle was also.. amazing.  I really wish there was more of it.  I really do... its a shame that the campaign cuts off so suddenly.Gameplay:Gameplay is kind of bland, feels like a clone of Command and Conquer with very similar units and system, but there are no buildings like in homeworld.  If you've played a C&C title or something like it, there isn't much different here.  From here on out, I outline specifics of the unit system.  On the whole, the gameplay feels lacking in many departments, because there really isn't much going on beyond the C&C copying and the sensors manager.I didn't like how weak the resource operations were, but thats a split off from homeworld 2.  There was also a distinct lack of fast hit and run units (only 1) and capital ships (only 3, 2 of which are super-specialized), which is unusual for a Homeworld title.  The rock paper scissors between units was... too simple.  Light swarm vehicle beats artillery, artillery beats vehicles, flak vehicles beat light swarm; aircraft beats everything, with some resistance from anti-air; everything on the ground kills anti-air.  You have a choice of either smaller heavy vehicles or capital ships for the flak and artillery roles.  There aren't a lot of ships, and they are all super specialized except for the hit and run cruiser, which is the most balanced unit in the game in terms of what it can do.  There are no units specialized in taking out carriers, which is again unusual for a homeworld game.  They are absurdly powerful, requiring entire armies pushing everything they have against the things, and given the mechanics the carriers are very powerful on offense and defense.  Another irritating mechanic is that unlike in previous Homeworld games you cannot store your troops in your carrier.However, I did like how you could customize the power systems of your carrier; that was a neat mechanic and fun to play around with.  Baserunners were also the coolest unit in the game, and it shows, but they're not distinctly ground breaking.Research was broken; without a tree to visualize what you are doing and with SO MANY THINGS to research, its very irritating to maintain.  There are like, 4 or 5 different research techs for every single unit.From what I can tell, Galsien faction (enemy) has stronger ground units and ground production facilities.  However, Coalition has much stronger aircraft and have access to baserunner abilities (probes, sensors, etc).  To give the game credit, they're actually more differentiated than the Kushan / Hiigaran and Taiidan / Vaygr in Homeworld 1 and 2.Sound:Soundtrack was varied and great, evocative of the Homeworld games.  Fit nicely, however none of the tracks really stood out to me.  Unit sounds are largely satisfying.  Unit chatter has a lot of depth and is fun to listen to, and I don't think I ever listened to all of the different chatter samples throughout the entire game.  They gave much needed depth to the lore and unit cohesion, but alas the game was still lacking in the lore.Bugs:The only major bug I came across is that occasionally when there are too many units on the screen the unit AI will completely stop working, requiring a load to a save.

												A true, modern Homeworld experience, BBI did a great job.The campaign, though only moderately lengthy, is fantastic. Great cutscenes, story and progression. The whole way through the singleplayer is a blast.The combat in Kharak is simplistic but well refined, and follows basic unit-counter mechanics alongside the strategic use of the terrain itself (line of sight and height advantages). It's also awesome to watch a clash of assorted dune-machines blast away at each other, presentation is top notch. The atmosphere this game has with its audio is also second-to-none in the RTS department.Unfortunately the multiplayer community took a large and rather devastating explosive warhead on launch when the game was tied to Steam region-based matchmaking servers. This region-locked the community, and alongside a few multiplayer connection bugs that prevented games starting in the first place the online playerbase plummeted, you couldn't reliably find and play a game. A shame this is, as Kharak's multiplayer is actually really good. It's a fast paced, skillful and sleek tactical RTS arena. Due to the (now fixed) initial multiplayer launch issues and resultant lack of players, if you want to have a multiplayer game you'll need to go hunting for people in the forums or on steam etc. I have accumulated a small bunch of Steam friends who I can play a game with on a regular basis, but you need to go hunting, trying to search solo will net negative results. Ultimately I would recommend Deserts of Kharak to any fan of the Homeworld series or RTS genre, although perhaps not at full price. A game you should pick up during a sale without hesitation.			"

												Well I played the original Homeworld back in 199something! I haven't played any others since, though I was most pleased that I decided to pre-order at the last minute before launch to pick up the Homeworld Remastered (plus originals). Kudos to Blackbird Interactive for following their hearts and kudos to Gearbox for picking up the whole franchise in the first place (I'm glad someone there saw the potential).I'll keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge RTS player, though I used to enjoy the C&C series (last one being C&C generals). This is Homeworld, without a doubt, The story is great, the camapign is well designed, the art style is spot on, the sound sfx and voice acting are solid. The music perfectly retains the music of Homeworld while placing you neatly into location - The Deserts of Kharak. Pro tip for campaign; play on classic and keep your fleet persistance!The Good:Campaign, story, cutscenes, everything about it screams Homeworld, I loved every minute of it!ArtSoundMusicGameplayLoreMultiplayer: Artifact mode is a nice twist, plenty of maps (11 so far), good skirmish options such as 1 vs 3 AI etc, Co-op vs AI.Subfaction DLC's are amazing worth buying.Game replays.Great development team behind the title very responsive to feedback!The bad: No mod tools or Steam Workshop as of yet (still early days)If you're a fan of the franchise and/or RTS genre in general, I don't think you'll be dissapointed.

												Take Homeworld's fleet management, combine it with Ground Control's tactical use of terrain and unit abilities, and you've got Deserts of Kharak. Set in the period of time leading up to the rediscovery of the Hyperspace Core, it acts as a prequel to the original Homeworld, and has all the atmosphere you'd expect from a Homeworld title.While the campaign is short (I finished in approximately 14 hours, in no particular hurry), the plot is enjoyable and did manage to spring a surprise on me, and the missions throw you the occasional curveball, such as commanding a team operating independently of the main body, with no production facilities. Overall the gameplay is fun and engaging, although I cannot comment on multiplayer as I'm terrible at RTS and just stomp computers while watching pretty explosions.Unit designs and animations are generally quite good: enemy units explode most satisfyingly, Light Attack Vehicles catch air off the tops of dunes when using speed boost, Baserunners open hatches to drop turrets and sensors, and the carrier launch and recovery sequences have an intricate detail that I just can't help but zoom in to watch. This does make the lack of resource harvesting animations a bit disappointing, however.Sound design is superb, especially the chatter. During a slow period in an early mission I heard the engineering crew of one vehicle have a friendly argument with their commander.My only real complaint is that the main camera doesn't let me zoom out as far as I'd like, so I spent much of the game in sensor view rather than enjoying the desert landscapes, but the developers appear to be taking an active interest in feedback and player suggestions, so there's a good chance this may be fixed.If you liked Homeworld and/or Ground Control, you should buy this game.

												This is what you might describe as a 'Mostly Postive' review with one caviat which you might like to think about before buying the game:Terrific game, satisfying game play and will be familiar to all those who have played Homeworld before. Not sure the game should be described as Story Rich but it fits well into the Lore of Homeworld.Caviat: Single Player content is lite. If you aren't going to play Skirmish mode, and don't intend to Multiplay then you might feel 13 single player missions which include a tutorial and initial tutorial mission is not much for the money. Otherwise terrific. Love the sound track.			"

												Homoworld: DoK is one of the best RTS' to come out in recent memory. It's incredibly atmospheric and has arguably the strongest sound design and art direction in the past 10 years.The campaign - while not as challenging as previous iterations of Homoworld - captures the feeling of the franchise and looks amazing.Multiplayer is a hoot & a half, with Paper-Scissor-Rock RTS gameplay mixed with the tactical maneuvering that comes with fleet combat. The MP player-base is small, but everyone is really friendly in providing tips and helping new players learn then came so they can hold their own in MP matches.If you're a fan of RTS games, like getting stuck in with an atmospheric game, or looking to try something different from your usual gamer tastes, Homoworld: Deserts of Kharak has what you're looking for. Add your boy Causal Male, Extra Large on steam and let's play some Multplayer friend!			"

												Homeworld series are my favorite games of all time, after waiting from 2003, It's finaly here.After first giving it thumbs up, i had to change my review after playing to mission 10. A.I in this game is absolutely horrible and ruins the whole thing. Also some game design choises are very tedious.(I'm playing the game on most challenging difficulty)Pros:* It's very cool to see those little buggies jump on the sand dunes* Game has the same Homeworld feel and the story is very good* Carrier is awesome, managing the power is fun for a while* Units are very detailed and look coolCons:* Enemy A.I is COMPLETE GARBAGE, units just sits there, waiting to be taken out by bomber* All the little details are missing, no interraction between units, like how workers used to dock after harvesting.* I'm very dissapointed you cant map the same hotkeys that Homeworld series has had.* Strike fighters seem pretty OP, this is bad thing because the game is about ground battles, not taking easy way and just using fighters to destroy everything* Fourth mission seems bugged, i searched whole area for hostiles but could not complete the mission.* Those long range missile barrage units are just annoying on both sides* Battles have way less units than in Homeworld* End of the campaign felt very rushed, suddenly you rush billion miles to the anomaly when first you are barely making any progress on the mapTotal:Story - 9Homeworld feel - 9Graphics - 9A.I - 4Gameplay - 5---Gearbox & Blackbird start working on Homeworld 3 (you know, that is actually in space)And Valve needs to release Half-Life 3...

Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is the latest installment in the Homeworld franchise, albeit a prequel to the story of Homeworld, and in my honest opinion it is indeed a game worthy of the title. The graphics are astonishing all thanks to the Unity Engine and, even though I'm not the biggest fan of Unity, in this title it really holds strong and you wouldn't notice at first that it's being used. The story is great with a couple of twists and turns but I wish the ending would be a little longer. Still, diving right into the first Homeworld after playing this one is recommended. Sound design is also a big plus mainly due to the original composer, Paul Ruskay, being back to record.A special acknowledgment goes to the cutscenes which fit in perfectly. Real live people and, what looks like, hand drawn pictures combined with 3D renders really give the game a certain natural feel.That being said the game is far from perfect and has quite a few bugs and issues and some experience them more than others.Even though no updates have been posted for months (though BBI have been teasing for something at the beginning of 2017, perhaps an expansion? ) this still feels great and as a fan of RTS I certainly had my fun.What I liked:- Great story - Amazing graphics (Unity is much greater than I though in the right hands)- Excellent sound design and music Neutral about it:- Campaign was not very long.- Ending felt a bit short, would love some sort of expansionWhat I disliked: - A few annoying bugs (here's hoping they get fixed in the next update, whenever that occurs)- Multiplayer issues- In some regards it feels unfinished and unpolished- Some performance issuesI'm really hopeful that this game won't be abandoned for good, because with a few updates (and maybe an expansion) this could become as great as the original Homeworld games.  Final Rating 8/10  "

												Deserts of Kharak is probably one of the best RTS games I've ever played. You woudn't think the Homeworld formula would survive the transition from space to land, but somehow BBI pulled it off. What's left is an ingenious mix of Homewords 1 and 2, Ground Control, and some SupCom. This is defintely a great Multiplayer RTS.Combat has some rock paper scisors elements, but empthasises micro. Almost every unit has a special ability, which if used correctly can greatly augment its ability to do damage, take it, or support other units. Managing your fleet over the course of an engagement is a rapid fire exercise in getting your positioning right to ensure your damage potential is maxed, managing said abilities, deciding which tech to pursue, and reacting to the enemy. Central to all this is your Carrier. IMHO the DOK Carriers are the best 'player' unit I've ever seen in a game. Not only do they manage research and production like the HW Mothership, they're also an extremely viable combat unit if upgraded throughout a match and paired with a good support fleet. They also act as a resource dropoff and the hangar for your air force, so positioning them is critical as well, in fact you'll probably roam your carrier quite a bit. It's always a sign of a fun and even DOK match when you can end with a carrier showdown. Or with careful placement of artillery and railguns you can snipe them from range, but this requires time and resources.Singleplayer is good. The story is well told and the cutscene art is beautiful, but it's short. If you're familiar with HW lore or at least the first game, you'll enjoy it. If not, then some of the impact of events can be confusing. The Expedition guide (sold as DLC) can expand on the lore greatly, but I'd only reccomend that for diehard fans who love the fluff. Other than that, there's skirmish with the AI. AI got patched recently so that it's not just a poor cheating system, so that can be a good introduction to gameplay. Skirmishing has questionable longevity though.Let's talk other content: The number of maps has gone up since launch, but there is still only 1 3v3 map. If you're playing MP, most of your matches will be on it. BBI is working on new maps and other content, but until that changes don't buy if you like map variety. I can live with it because I love the gameplay, but YMMV. There are 2 factions: Coalition and Gaalsien. Coalition are hard hitting, Gaalsien are fast and can build units quicker since they use crusiers for production. Both are fun to play, but most people play Coalition. Both have different versions of similar units, all with different abilities. There's also the Soban fleet pack now, which is based on the Coalition, and a potential future pack which could be  Gaalsien based. Finally, you can't rebind keys, which may be a deal breaker for some (theres talk about fixing that, however).Overall, I'd reccomend DOK to anyone looking for an RTS that differs from the usual formula. If you like Homeworld, you've probably already bought DOK. The community isn't large, but there are more than enough people who play regularly to get a full match going. I've had immense amounts of fun with the game as it is, more than enough to justify the purchase, and future patches and expansions will only make the game better! But if you're still worried about the amount of maps or any missing features (Spectating, Keybinding, Etc.), I'd reccomend keeping an eye on the game and holding off for a future sale. If you love RTS, you owe it to yourself to go carrier hunting sometime in your life!			"

												How Homeworld Deserts of Kharak Solved StarcraftIt's becoming more difficult to spot a really good game. Some studios have such sprawling resources and can afford to crank such incredible amounts of content into a game that it's easy to overlook quality in the absense of quantity. I think this is abundantly the case with Homeworld: Deserts, which seems to get a bad wrap for a short campaign and a comparably thin assortment of units. I can't say with any certainty that I would have given it a fair chance myself if not for the fact that Homeworld and I go way, way back. But I've enjoyed it immensely well after 100 hours in, and the best way I can think of to explain why is to compare the game with the analogue in RTS that I know the most about: Starcraft... or perhaps more specifically, Starcraft II.I've already harped on the thing that puts Deserts at a disadvantage to Starcraft - it simply doesn't have as much content. There are 4 factions in the game now, 2 of which are DLC, but besides that it is tough to in any way construe that there is more of anything in Deserts than there is in Starcraft. Of course, what I really want to focus on are the things that Deserts has done that more than make up for this. In order to do that I'm going to have to point out some of what I consider to be major weaknesses (or developer blindspots) of Starcraft II:1. ""The Death Ball""This term is probably ubiquitous among people who have played Starcraft II, and likely many others among the ground-based RTS genre. It's that tendency for your army to get hodge-podged into a non-descript blob of units all occupying the exact same point on the map. Starcraft has great capacity for micro-management, but anyone I've ever seen get into the late-game ends up with a blob... and ususally what decides the game is both players sending their blobs at each other and seeing whose comes out on top. Top-tier people may know how to avoid this, but admittedly that's not me. It's incredibly easy to get roped into Death Ball tactics in Starcraft for two reasons that I can see... first, that the collision meshes seem to be so supportive of it with many, many units, and secondly, that there really isn't much insentive to learn how to keep your units spread out. If anything the opposite is true... Starcraft units take up a lot of screenspace and the units in general don't have the attack range to make up for it, meaning that in order to get everything into weapons range, they almost have to be clustered, especially with all the RAMPS in the game. Now the flipside... Deserts. This game WILL teach you to array your forces in logical patterns rather than keeping them all so tightly pressed together that no one - not even you - are really all that sure what you're lobbing into the fray. Major reasons why: 1. SERIOUS AOE, 2. ranged units. As to the area-of-effect, sure there are some weapons like this in Starcraft, but they are slaps on the wrist in comparison to the ones in Deserts. If you had all of your things in tight formation and you come across an enemy gunship, artillery cruiser, or Honor Guard cruiser, it will in all likelyhood be too late for you to do anything but regret your decision, because their AOE damage is both devastating and wide enough to punch whole armies at a time. Starcraft AOE usually only punched widely enough to damage a couple of units unless the targets in question were extremely small, and few punched with the ferocity of Deserts AOE. Then you have your ranged units. Range is serious business in Deserts, with some units being able to reach considerably farther than the size of your screen in top-down view. But the premier ranged unit - Rail Guns - are so incredibly fragile that merely parking tanks in their midst is usually not enough to avoid taking losses. You want tanks or light attack vehicles out in front where they can sweep would-be counter attacks, and moreover, you NEED them there, because the sensors range of rail guns doesn't even begin to reveal the distance that they are able to shoot. Ranged units are only at their best when they have a line of forward units to spot for them. And because of the various iterations of AOE mentioned earlier (many are ranged attacks as well), you're even better advised to deploy your ranged units with a wide berth from each other. The result is intense micro and positional tactics, both of which are reinforced by several other game mechanics as well.2. ScaleStarcraft is sufficiently fun that it's easy to forgive their wildly impressionistic and cartoonish sense of scale. If they didn't have the incredible cutscenes to remind you of the real size of things you might never think of it. But the thing that's impressive by contrast about Deserts is that it proves there is no need to fudge size and physics to have a good strategy game. Your production vessels are actually capable of nesting the units they build and you get to see them come down exit ramps/landing strips and everything. This concrete sense of scale and adherence to physics (you will see great execution of physics in hit effects and pathing [watching a baserunner make a reverse two-point turn is a thing of beauty]) makes you feel like you're conducting real battles rather than just abstractions of them; you're assured that the cutscene world (which is actually the more impressionistic of the two) and the gameplay world are one and the same.3. Chokepoints and TerrainI mentioned SC ramps eariler. Choke points are one thing... SC's ramps keep you down to like 2 units astride. This is but another thing that causes the game to always gravitate toward a Death Ball (or in this case, kind of a Death Snake(?) I guess). And these ramps are everywhere. I can't even think of a map where your base is not on a raised platform or in a valley or in some spot reached only by ramp. This is getting stuck in your ways. Deserts started out with a very narrow assortment of maps, but it has grown into a wonderful selection, and each is a distinct experience in some way... they all manage to create their own challenges. Rather than always giving you the benefit of a chokepoint entry to your base, Deserts has all kinds of starting locations, including some that give substantial advantage to the attacker. Terrain is much more dynamic in general and their are gradations in topography rather than walls everywhere (there are walls too, but bear with me). These wispy hills are a major part of the gameplay, as height can afford an attacker greater DPS (""I have the high ground!""). More importantly, units behind hills lose line-of-sight and can't shoot units on the other side (unless they are artillery ships). This allows the game to create a seemingly endless array of challenges and experiences by simply playing with the shape of the map. Using the terrain to your advantage can be absolutely huge and is a considerably more gradated art of strategy than in SC.4. AtmosphereNo review of Deserts would be complete without mention of this aspect. The music, while not the best in the series, dynamically shifts based on what is happening at any given moment, becoming ambient in moments of respite and urgent during battles, and this happens seemlessly enough that you often don't notice... it's the best execution of dynamic game music that I've ever heard. The sound effects are great and filtered magnificently to reinforce the idea that you're viewing the battle from a considerable distance, as you often are. Of course if you have the camera in tight (and you are easily able to do this), sounds seem more clear and present as well. The designs of the craft are outstanding in general... they convey a sense of real-world utilitarianism and never get overly 'sci-fi-magicy'.  All these elements together are exceptionallycohesive.Out of typing space. But in conclusion: even in the long and rich tradition of Dune-Buggy-Prequels, this game is a standout!			"

												Deserts of Kharak is not as gorgeous and rich as Company of Heroes or even Starcraft, but still it's a charmingly looking one. Being a prequel to original Homeworld, the game tells a story of battle between two clans (Coalition and Gaalsien) that hunt some very old and powerful knowledge, hidden in a deadly desert. Not only a story connects these Homeworlds, Deserts of Kharak also descends a wonderful tribal music and stylish movies from origins. But as a game, the new Homeworld part is not about big skirmishes - it’s tidily made RTS that carefully combines different approaches and features from well-known strategy games of past. Imagine if you would play Ground Control 1 in a very lovely Dune-like desert, where Commander APC does unit production/research work and harvesters collect minerals. It's a tactical RTS with some unit heritage from original Homeworlds, where gameplay is about small armies and squads - and this will be a full description of DoK. If you are ok with it - play it immediately!P.S. Another Ground Control feature - Coalition looks like Crayven Corporation and uses wheel and crawler terradins, on the contrary while vicious red hoverdines of Gaalsien came directly from Order of the New Dawn.

												I've played alot of RTS games and this brings back good Homeworld meories. Is this as fast paced as Starcraft? No, but that is okay. I like the overall slower pace.As for the maps and AI concerns. Devs are already on it and coming out with a patch soon. The community is active in finding and squashing any bugs that slipped through. The Devs are VERY active and open on the discord channel which a link can be found on the homeworld reddit.Devs are involved and they want the game to go far.The single player is awesome. Vs AI is lacking but that will get patched. Multiplayer is new and exciting. Don't get frustrated if/when you lose. Learn and move on. Just like in any other RTS. You won't be a GOD at the game until you learn game by game how to be a proper Commander.			"

												The game is really pretty but that's where it ends. There are only 2 playable factions and 6 skirmish maps. The AI just swarms you, there isn't much more to it than that. The campaign is alright, but the game gets boring quickly.The game is deficient in nearly every way.			"

												Although this game falls short when it comes to multiplayer because of the lack of maps and factions to play, it still holds up against other RTS games. The storyline is great and the multiplayer can get pretty intense and is just as fun as Homeworld: Remastered. The battles can last a decent amount of time and the AI loves to keep rushing you with small attack groups.You have to pick this up if you're an RTS fan and also Homeworld: Remastered if you don't have it already.It started with two playable factions and they have just added another with a very affordable DLC. I would expect more to come really soon.			"

												Although I have to agree with some negative comments I've read in the reviews, I still have to give this game a huge thumbs up as the best RTS I've played in many, many years. Maybe it's because I grew up on StarCraft and developed an obsession for sci-fi RTS games, maybe it's because I was always curious about the backstory to Homeworld 1 and 2, but despite its flaws, this game was tons of fun. The only thing I'd say is wait until it's on sale, because if you're like me and really keen on the campaign, you may feel ripped off by the end of it.PROS:Great story, graphics, audio, UI, smooth and fun gameplay. Tons of fun!CONS:Normal difficulty is a cakewalk, campaign took me just under 9 hours, leaves you feeling like there should be more at the end.9/10 will play again			"

												I highly enjoyed Deserts of Kharak. I'm a big Homeworld fan, and while I'm still holding out for another space-paced 3D RTS from the good folks at BBI (which is comprised of original Homeworld devs), DoK provides an excellent story. It's a prequel game to Homeworld, and describes the events leading up to the discovery of the Khar-toba.The game was built in Unity, and it shows. Graphics are a little janky at times, but I can overlook that. The campaign, to me, was thoroughly enjoyable, as are multiplayer matches with my close buddies. This is a solid pick if you love RTS games. And if you're new to Homeworld, go buy Homeworld: Remastered Collection!			"

												A beautiful looker for an RTS with solid mechanics and balanced Rock-Paper-Scissor-mechanics. Some flaws remain though , which are a matter of personal preferences and taste. On the good side:Balanced factions, meaningful units, beautiful terrain (even though its mainly dessert), great explosions. Good for beginners and intermediates alike.On the bad side:Lackluster amount of maps, too much handholding in the campaign, minor bugs and unpleasentries.Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is actually a good game. However, it seems to lack in content where it really matters: The campaign and the multiplayer maps. There are only FIVE maps, which is unacceptable for any multiplayer focused game. The campaign can be busted through rather easily, at least on normal. Not very punishing, little room to tackle problems your way and, truth be told, missions are not long enough to do experimenting or exploration. Hard to get your moneys worth on singleplayer alone, at least in this state.			"

												A solid game!I was a pretty good high-master league starcraft player.What i like about the game so far?1. It punishes hard macro early in the game, you can straight up lose if your opponent does a push2. Knowing the army composition of your opponent is vital, just massing low tier units will get absolutly rekted against a few armored vehicles. This adds a great dynamic.3. The multiplayer is brutal and unforgiving, if you ♥♥♥♥ up, you lose.Its just really solid, i don't care if its not innovative, its a great competitive game with alot of depth. Artifact retrieval, which to me just sounded annoying at first is actually a great deal of fun. The game encourages players to be active all the time, just turtling to the lategame is not an option!I've seen some reviewers note that the game is not worth the money because of its lack of innovation, hell, i don't need flashy new weird gameplay mechanics, i just want a solid competitive game that is brutal and punishes mistakes, this one does it, i hope the competitive scene will keep expanding in the coming months.The only major negative point is, if one player has a bad connection, it will pause the game every few seconds without dropping him from the game. I really hope they solve this, some matches are unplayable because of it.			"

												OK. I've played through mission 5. No plot related spoilers ahead, but I like the game and the background story a lot so far.First, the desert environment is beautiful-- dangerous, also, since the enemy AI seems to like to have swarms of a half-dozen units each patrolling around. Recon in force works better than sending out smaller groups to scout.Rachel is in the game as a ""Baserunner"", which is an engineering unit, but hers can capture enemy units like salvage corvettes used to. The generic baserunners can also build turrets for ground and anti-air, as well as mines and sensors. Rachel can make sensors, but her mines can be manually triggered or used to demolish structures for salvage.There's LAVs, which are light scouts; there's tanks (AAVs-- armored assault vehicles?), there's long-range sniper units called railguns, there's support cruisers which repair others and act as the delivery point for resource collectors. There are likely to be bigger attack-oriented cruiser types coming, but I'm just now getting some air units.Combat is fun and reminds me a lot of Ground Control, which is a pretty good thing. I think I'd like a bit more variety of units, but I'm only a third of the way in. Micro matters a little-- not so much in big battles, since unit AI chooses reasonable targets by itself-- but if you have a railgun plinking away at you from max range, having your LAVs use their speed boost ability can end the threat more quickly.The camera is great and you can zoom way in if you like; focusing on a unit works better than in Homeworld-- perhaps the ground helps give a more familiar perspective when comparing tiny LAVs to the huge carrier. For that matter, the zoom out to tactical map showing the landscape in 3D with your units having a glowing blue sensor in taken directly from HW also (including the sound effects). Seems to work pretty OK.			"

												It is Homeworld but on a planet instead of in space, but better... if that makes any sense.The cutscenes boggle my mind. They look like live action, but heavily stylized to look hand drawn. But I'm not sure. Either way they are fantastic. They tried a couple times to get a ""tatooine sunset"" shots though... which was awkward with only one sun. But the effort was noted.The story hold similarities to Homeworld. Everything goes to hell, out in a hostile environment, isolated from back up, against impossible odds. Classic underdog story.Your units chatter back and forth about if whether or not ""the storm is interfering with the infrared dynamic sensors"" during lulls in the combat.Game looks and plays fantastic, I don't need to say anything else. Pretty much a classic right here.			"

												If you are going to buy this game already knowing you will not play MP, expect to be dissapointed, because even though overall story is great, gameplay itself is, as in almost any strategy, quite boring, and instead go play some other AAA sci-fi tactical strategy game... oh wait, there is none (excluding Star Craft, but there is a good chance you already played and finished this game).If you are going to buy this game and play it in MP, it will knock your socks off. You can also ignore about 90 percent of negative reviews, most of them criticize SP.It is on opposite end from most of current strategy games, and requires very little micro and feels overally epic, which is great change.I think there are quite a few things that needs fixing, for instance bombers not dropping their payload, sometimes units refuse firing (mostly when dealing with artillery, so it might be minimum range, in that case, please indicate), but all theese things can (and i hope will) be fixed, so in a few month this will not be viable complaint.

												I was a huge fan of the Homeworld games back in the day, it blew my mind. While I can't say this game blew my mind, it was great to play. The controls and gameplay were solid, and having played Homeworld and Homeworld 2, despite it being on a flat plan this go round, I eased right into these controls in a heartbeat. There were a few moments where I got frustrated that ships would venture off faster than their battle group, and thus wind up in situations where they were essentially screwed and I had to bite the loss, but it wasn't an issue often. It looks breathtaking, if such a word can be used for desert landscapes, but I feel in this instance it can. I ran the game full bore, and it was smooth, no noticable drops in FPS, and at lulls in battles or resource gathering, I found myself just panning around and moving the camera just to take in the landscape. It is a beautiful game. I think the only let down was the story, and only in it's length. I threw the difficulty up to the hardest, which in this game is labeled classic, and got through it in about 16 hours. Granted, I spent the extra time gathering resources, anticipating a potential nasty and gritty pitched battle later (experience early in the game taught me to be prepared), so that adds considerable time to my play, but it still felt short as campaigns go, despite some great missions. Of note was a mission where you have to defend an ally, and I was on the edge of my seat sending support flights over to attack enemy positions and repair ships to keep my allies in the fight. Plot wise though, it was exciting to play through the prequel to Homeworld, and feel the race-against-time tension that the story exhibits. It's entertaining and fun to see the Homeworld universe lore expand through this game, and I can see them adding DLC or another game playing out the political landscape of Kharak more. One thing of note: Multiplayer. I gave it a shot...but, and this could just be it's a Saturday night, no one was on. I mean no one. I could not find a game to save my life. I hope this is just a fluke, because it would be exciting to play online, but that was my experience. We'll see. "

												This game in it's current state I can not reccomend under any citcumstances for a price of 45€!Why? It does not meet the standards of modern RTS games in any way. Let me give you a list of missing features that make this game absolutely annoying:-- first and foremost, no remappable keys!! I gather from the forum these have been requested like 5 month ago and not implemented yet. This is MOST BASIC STANDARD as default controls are spread all across the keyboard and you ned like 3 hands to play the game properly.-- Not possible to skip the cutscenes. This becomes utterly annoying when you play at hard and have to replay missions...-- NO MINIMAP??? You have to toggle some sort of overview hitting space bar!-- AI is nonexistant, difference between hard/easy are just endless waves of enemies who obviously need no ressource managment.-- Also AI can pass impassable terrain. You set up a proper devensive position and then a scripted attack comes trough a Mountain behind you... just incredibly dumb!--Ingame menu is hidden on top left image, NOT on ESC button like on 99,999999% of all other games!! Who designed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI?!-- No updates ever, as far as I have seen??-- Missions are incredibly small maps, short and easy even on hard difficulty, due the the nonexistant AI. You just need to set up long range railgun devense with several of repair and none ever comes even remotely close to you.-- very small unit variety (like only 10 diff. units) and the other faction has exactly the same ones with different names... very uncreative!pros:+ Nice graphics when you put everthing to max+ Storyline seems ok+ persistant units from mossino to mission (makes it extremely easy tho!)All in all the gaps and missing features one would expect for a game of 2016 are way too big. So I really can not recommend this game even I a really would have loved too, since there ain't many good RTS games around anymore.I guess this is the first game I will send in for refund, since I'm still below 2hrs, and I don't suppose it's getting any better from what I read in the forums.*update:====== well seems you can only return games below 2hrs gameplay AND within 14 days and I'm above that. So I guess I have too keep it. Nevertheless I would not recommend to buy it unless it's like ~5€Having it played trough now I can say it's extremely short, easy, with small maps and super dumb endless scripted AI waves. They just stop once you reach the assigned goal. Bevore that wave after wave gets pured out of the enemy ships... and reked on my already elite devenders, since you take them with you from mission to mission.Graphic designers did a sweet job, programmers were lazy f*cks and completely failed in like anything... totally not worth carrying the brand ""Homeworld""They spent way too much time and effort into the 50 Steam achievements than in making a proper game for 2016.Also reading trough the comments I guess lots of them are nonsense and look like fake/bought ones to push the games status. Sadly only the negative ones really reflect the shallow and totally lacking gameplay...			"

												I had a great discussion with a good buddy of mine, a real proper journalist that writes about games for living. Can you imagine, a person like that managing to survive in Bosnia? We both do gaming reviews and he told me once I've might be suffering from something called ""honeymoon period"". I've googled it and discovered about specific type of behavior that happens in the first few days / weeks / months of owning something / being in relationship with someone and thinking that your new object of desire is perfect.Although I've tried to discredit his opinion and argument my way out of it, I've managed to notice real proper example of honeymooning while playing Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. For the first two hours, everything seemed perfect. Two hours later, I've noticed a few distinctive problems. By the end of the tenth hour, I was thinking to myself - how much love do I really feel for this game?Many, many moons ago, I've played Homeworld. It wasn't a religious devotion at any length, let me assure you, but I've enjoyed it because it gave me another, new and fresh perspective on strategy genre. Remastered collection appeared, but I was a bit too busy getting it (and a bit lazy, let's be honest). It was really exciting to find out about new Homeworld title, a prequel of sort that was in the works. Although they've grounded it to desert planet of Kharak, I didn't mind at all. Every race (and story) needs a planet to lift off from. The very first thing I thought to myself looking at all those screenshots: it smells like Spice. It is soooo Dunish.And yes it is. Homeworld: Desert of Kharak screams Dune in a particular way that could appear obvious only to fans of Herbert's epic masterpiece, although there are no sandworms around. Maybe it's just all this sand that gets into your eyes and laser rifles. Campaign mode is the heart of new Homeworld title. Main storyline is enjoyable, well thought out, segmented in nice chunks that keep your attention. It also respects the legacy of Homeworld titles, but doesn't provide player with any additional information (which is fine, google it or play other Homeworld games). The voice acting delivery helps boosting the atmosphere even higher, it's AAA quality and you can't really complain about anything in that domain. I've played the campaign on medium difficulty and it proved to be JUST RIGHT for someone like me. But does that mean it's good enough for RTS fans? Nope. Although I do love RTS games, I consider myself to be a complete newbie in the genre that I've been playing for more than two decades. That being said, it would probably be wise to say Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak AI will satisfy undemanding players, but if you know every single nook and cranny in RTS genre, you should seek revolutionary challenge somewhere else.Difference between Homeworld: DoK and most other RTS titles is the fact that there's no real base building. Your Kapisi base is what Mothership used to be in original Homeworld titles. It is a moving, shooting and self-repairing giant. The whole campaign mode, this traversing the desert reminded me of latest Mad Max movie. Although I like to basebuild my way to victory, traveling, always-on-the-move base Kapisi has its own purpose. The concept of 'base on wheels' has been delivered thoughtfully. You'll be running with Coalition and be able to pick antagonists Gaalsien in Skirmish and Multiplayer modes. Although two factions in the game don't differ two much from each other and number of units is not that big, all the units are useful and most of these have additional abilities that expand their usefulness. You will unlock units while playing campaign. This way, you'll learn your way through the game without a hitch. Some people consider number of units to be a bad thing. I don't have any problem with it. Beside campaign that's done really well, additional options are skirmish and multiplayer. As for multiplayer, I've played press review and just as other reviewers, I didn't get chance to play multiplayer. What all of us could see is that game offers unranked and ranked matches, but how many gamers will compete in DoK, remains to be seen. Skirmish could in a way represent what multiplayer will offer to players. You get a chance to pick your side (Coalition or Gaalsien), your team colors, pick a map and off you go. Now, few thoughts on a skirmish. Five maps available - unimpressive number that needs to grow as soon as possible if devs really want to kickstart the multiplayer. If BBI and Gearbox can't deliver, they should release the modding tool and let people take care of lack of maps via Steam workshop. AI isn't that good, but it isn't bad either. I could easily call it lukewarm. Just like in campaign, normal difficulty suits RTS beginners like me. I would call it an entry level AI that makes you think RTS. It makes you learn the genre in a way.How much strategy is there in a game? Well, it's hard to say. Maybe it was the space, but I feel original Homeworld titles had more freedom. Truth be told, DoK offers a relatively standards RTS experience. Elevated shooting and domination from above? Seen. Hiding behind the covers? Seen. Only two scavengers per resource? Horrible designing decision.""But it's all desert! What's impressive about that?"" - this could be a valid question about graphic quality of the game. Well, I do think that Homeworld: DoK delivers graphically in every single way. It's dirty, sandy, it makes you believe in desperation of your convoy trying to locate its salvation. Beside already mentioned voice acting, SFX and music are spot on.To thumb it up or down, that is the question. I'll say yes because of the story and overall Dune feeling that I felt while playing. Mind that you might not get it at all because Coalition and Gaalsien socio-political relations are not nearly as complicated as those of Dune's characters. This is a solid strategy game that managed to elevate itself in several important aspects to match the name it's proudly wearing on its digital sleeve. But getting it for full price just for the sake of campaign and ocassional skirmish and multiplayer is a bit over the top. Let's all be rational here and admit none of us will get hooked on Homeworld skirmish and multiplayer longtime. Don't let me tell you what you should spend your money on, but I personally think this price tag is currently attached to trademark, not the content. If it wasn't for word Homeworld in title, most people would just glance over it in the store, laugh the price off and pass. We've seen enough high quality indie games to dissaprove with almost 50€ price tag. When it goes at least 50% off, grab it. EDIT: The review has been edited to correct few severe grammar mistakes... no matter how many times I read it...***Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it?

												Totally brilliant, not perfect by any means, but very enjoyable. A good old fashioned homeworld story, great visuals and audio and a compelling narrative make it a lovely way to spend a day or two.If I was going to criticise I would say it's nuts and bolts are somewhat lacking, I wouldn't have complained if this was a couple of years after homeworld 2 came out, but it's not and all the bugs and not quite there yet features just aren't as acceptable. One notably annoying missing feature is the lack of formations and positioning that was in homeworld and would have made a big difference in a land based strategy game. And the UI while joyfully reminiscent of the original could have done with a bit more updating and making it really pop and could do with better group management tools to let palyers access abilities easier, that being said it doesn't really get in the way too much so that is a plus.The balance is ok, very homeworld 2 rather than 1, it would have been nicer to have a bit more nuance rather than the simplistic rock paper scissors that leave you mashing cruisers at the end. The best of the old homeworld mods that kept the game alive all added depth and complexity making even smaller units useful all the way through the game. It would have been nice for the devs to take some of that onboard with the new game.Overall its well worth a buy on it's own merit, better than any of the RTS games last year other than the homeworld remasters. I'm pretty happy with it as I would have bought it anyway just to increase the chances we get a third homeworld game, that it's actualy fun is a real plus.			"

												This game rocks! It's kinda like a mix of Dune, Homeworld and Ground Control. There is no 3D movement like in HW but everything else is there. Much like Ground Control terrain plays a major role and.... you don't know what I'm talking about, do you?Look if you like real time tactics and strategy buy Homeworld, buy Ground Control and buy this game. It may kill your marriage, your career and your social life but it will all be worth it. Trust me.			"

												I do not recommend this at all for the price of the game there is NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH content for the price. Cities skylines was like $30 and had $60 worth of content for this i would pay $30 no more. Now to give out the pros and the cons.Pros:1. They kept to the old ways of Homeworld story telling if not better in the animated art so kudos to that2. I like the concept of ground RTS different for homeworld Space 3d play3. Graphics about the same if not better than homeworld 2 remastered4. Great sound quality and music score for the desert enviroment not to mention a lot of voice chatter which makes it more lively.Cons:1. Styory is nice and all but still feels as though they are lacking depth to it even though if you have played the past homeworld you know the future outcome but there is not much telling of the history or about what goes on much.2. Content Biggest peice right here. Lack of unit types and use of said units. The coalition seems to have fewer units than the oposition and lack futher potential of other units. You notice if you get this the main units you will mainly use are armored assault units and rails mainly combined with air units and thats it. Railguns are really the most affective against everything except lack armor and affectivness against light combat units3. Campaign is short if played correctly seen people beat it less than the time it took me which was roughly 8 hrs. Won't spoil what happens but mainly just grinding through enemy forces.4. Higher ground includes Defense bonus too? higher ground grants damage bonus but should not in any way grant a armor bonus if anything should be less since you are a bigger target.5. Lack of multiplayer maps to 5? Really you launch the game that is a RTS with only 5 maps?6. Hud interface of Old homeworld to ground RTS bad match up why? the game controls and hud set-up is great for the space one and using arrows is good for that but would recommend WASD for scrolling on a ground rts. This makes the game a bit more difficult to play with this kind of interface for a ground rts not to mention having the right mouse button to pan the camera everywhere can get annoying when sometimes it gets stuck.7. Cannot skip a cutscene in game at all everytime i am in the mist of doing something cutscene happens and i lose units or have no control which is very frustrating in a campaign mission.8. Controling air-units is abysmal. Why? because you cannot have them all fly to one location to select them all because once they get there and there is no target they auto-return to land then you have to wait until they land and re-launch. This makes them rather difficult to control and grabing them while on the move can be hard sometimes exspecially if you don't want to grab other units while your at it.9. Gaalsien have a better tactical and more diverse units than the coalition hands down campaign and multiplayer which makes it unbalanced.Now don't get me wrong but the Concept of it is great and all but how this was excuteted is abysmal Wish i could get my refund but steams policy says over 2hrs play and no refund but if it was gamestop they would let you beat the game and bring it back and get full refund so thats a shock right there.I have played the past 3 homeworld games and yes there is 3 and this by far is the worst of them. If you really want this game i would suggest waiting until they drop the price because it is not worth $50. "

												I really want to like this game and it appears to have a lot of potential but it is just too difficult to get past the horrible camera.  It is extremely limited and will not let you get a decent view of your immediate area.  Perhaps some other RTS's have spoiled me but I find it irritating enough to not play the game for now.  Hopefully either a patch will change this or someone will mod the camera.  I would gladly sacrifice some visual quality for the ability to see what the hell is going on around me.  There is also no minimap to help you.  There is however a ""radar"" mode but it is more like playing an RTS on a with just a few lines and squiggles.  For now it is going to be uninstalled.			"

												Hello.After playing the game for a good bit I have come to the point where I have to admit that the game does not live up to to the huge expectations most people have from a homeworld game.It is a good game. A well made game.It has a very nice homeworld feeling, the devs really made an effort here. Why now a thumbs down?Like many people I find myself wishing for a neutral button right now but in the absence of one I have to choose thumbs down.The lack of real unit varity and the rather shallow tactics are my major negative points.The missing pause function is ( if you ask me) a really stupid design decision.The main problem is that the pure awesome feeling of drifting spcae hulks and massive explosions, flickering laser light and the depressing emptiness of space is missing. It is a nice rts, it makes many things right. But it misses epic by a good mile.			"

												My opinion of Deserts of Kharak as of 3/14/16 (subject to change).Pros:Engrossing story (particularly when placed into the context of the Homeworld mythos).Straight-forward 'rock-paper-scissors' gameplay with options for more advanced combined arms tactics.Cons:Price ($50 was a bit much for this title, might have given it a pass if I had acted early on and gotten it for the Homeworld: Remastered purchasers price).Length of the single-player campaign felt very short, hopefully multiplayer will make up for it.Addendum:  A solid addition to the Homeworld series and hopefully a sign of more to follow.

												Fills every expectation of a homeworld game. Great story, surprisingly pretty legos, and the best sound engineering available. Deserts of Kharak has the best audio by far, and the previous games were magnificent. A few hitches here and there (brand new title just needs optimizations) but no crashes, no problems, and runs great on my barely middle of the road PC specs.BBI hit a home run as far as I'm concerned and I'm already waiting for a sequel. And a space one. and a space sequel.Basically steam needs more homeworld.Make it happen gentlemen.			"

												I concur with many others:  This game was released buggy and unfinished, then abandoned.  The idea of a prequel that adds back-story to the world of Kharak is good, but the execution is lacking and the game has serious gameplay issues, as well as balance issues in the single-player game.  When an RTS game resorts to simply spawning wave after wave of enemy units out of nowhere, it just takes all the fun out of the game.  It's like playing cards against someone whom you KNOW is cheating but you're not allowed to call them out on it.			"

												Visually stunning (not so much graphically as art) and intense as the ""space"" Homeworld. You get immersed in the single player campaign in no time. You emerge scarred but victorious from it. You set to try you skill in multilayer and guess what. That's right! There's nobody online. 90% of the time I'm playing I'm the only one in the global chat. The game is superb, but other that campaign and skirmishes with AI there's nothing else to do. I will still recommend it, but given the circumstance I won't buy it unless on sale.			"

												Be forewarned, if you find sand to be coarse and rough and irritating and think it gets everywhere, this is not the game for you. There is sand, and more sand, and even more sand. sometimes the sand is broken up by an occasional crashed spaceship or a rock. I didn't know what to expect when I purchased H:DoK. I knew that the game started off under another name by the same people that made the original Homeworld games so that made me excited, however it also is a ground based game and not space.Overall though it FEELS like a Homeworld game throughout the camaign. It's difficulty is well done, I often felt pressed by the challenges in the campaign without becoming overwhelmed or feeling it was unfair, the story was engaging and because of it, I lost three days to beat the game because I kept coming back to it. The only thing that didn't feel like a Homeworld game to me was the manic pace the game plays at. I found myself operating three different task forces at times each needing my attention to activate abilities, optimize engagement range, and deciding whether or not I needed to drop the nuke hammer to save my forces or not.I was initially disapointed with the lack of unit variety, however the number of abilities and upgrades you can grant each unit more than makes up for it. between setting up mine fields and having a flotilla of support cruisers playing freeze tag with the enemy fleet I had a manic grin on my face the whole time. Well until I got cocky, and sent the Kapisi off by herself and she ran smack into two battlecruisers supported by repair cruisers. Imagine my surprise when the damage klaxon went off in my face and by time I scrolled over she was down to half health!Without giving away the plot or the ending, I was very happy to have purchased it. It's a must buy for any fan of the original game, and it's just fun to play.  Every unit has a counter and abilities to minimize how hard they get countered to make for a really good game of shifting tactics, much like the sands you play on.			"

												First of all I will preface this by saying I love all the Homeworld games and bought/played them when they first released all those many years ago.  I also own the remastered editions and enjoy those as well.  I also wish this review system allowed more than just a Up or Down ... but since it does I have to give it a Down because I WOULDN'T recommend this game for its full price.  So let's start off with the good.  The graphics are great.  They aren't taxing or mind-blowingly realistic, but for Homeworld they really fit.  The cinematics in the game fit well, and are a step up from the previous games.  They feature actual animation and fit in very well to the atmosphere of the game and the setting.  The music is very solid and has the normal Homeworld vibe to it.  The Rock/Paper/Scissor system used for the units is a bit standard but at the same time the units offer some more advanced options for abilities that allows greater strategic uses of unit.  Nothing crazy in-depth or complicated, but enough that you can do things like hit and run with some units.  The amount of units comes off as a bit limited at first but eventually you unlock a few more through gameplay, very similar to the other Homeworld games.  The carriers themselves are great additions to the game.  They're more than just your base of operations, they are slowly moving super units in and of themselves.  There's a system for changing up what you want your carrier to do by diverting limited power to weapons or repair systems, ect.  Still, it's a nice change from Homeworld where the mothership was little more than an anchor around your fleet's legs.  So why the ""No"" recommendation?  Sadly it comes down to the amount of playability I got out of it.  For $50 I kind of expected more than a 9 hour campaign.  Now I know you can play multiplayer but that's not really my thing.  I bought this game today and finished it by tonight.  I didn't rush through anything, either.  I'm fairly meticulous when it comes to the Homeworld games, to the point that I NEED to get every resource before I leave to the next level.  So my 9 hours could quite easily be closer to 7 for the non-OCD types.The game was great except for that.  I enjoyed the story, although I already knew the end (duh) and it was a bit predictable.  There just wasn't enough meat in this sandwich to garner the $50 tag.  TL;DR:  I recommend putting this on your wishlist for a sale.  I'd say a $25 to $30 price point is fair for this game.  I'll amend my review if it comes out with more content, but I really doubt that's going to happen.			"

												Surprisingly good.Didn't expect much after the last couple games published by gearbox, but I'm too much of a consumer ♥♥♥♥♥ to not buy something with the homeworld brand and art style. I didn't think the story would work well, given what we knew from the homeworld 1 manual, etc, and the plot retcons between 1 and 2, but they definately pulled it off.Gameplay-wise, it's a nice translation of the mechanics of the older homeworld games to a 2d plane. outside of some little turrets and sensor posts, there are no structures, everything is built, upgraded, lauched, etc. from a vehicle. Units now have toggleable abilities, which I'm not actively opposed to. It's more micromanagement, but clever use of them can  make a huge difference I'm sure.The art direction is rock solid. The Galsians, especially, look fantastic. The environments are as grand as you'd expect from a homeworld game, even if they're on the ground. The sound and music fit well too.It's kind of weird that they have cool mythical sounding place names for every dang mountain and valley and sand dune when they've never been there and probably only have known about them since they launched a satellite to map the planet.Anyway, it's bretty good, would buy again.

Seriously I have to finish this thing before I start, because you've done such an amazing job with the little details about Karak, and I LOVE that you show how they knew they were strangers on this planet. Classifying themselves and few other species as ""abnormal"" since they didn't fit into any of the planets natural biomes or fossil records.Making the planet old and dying is the perfect setup for Homeworld 1. Makes perfect sense why they would have so many people in the sky ready to go, and why the entire focus was on this massive mothership that could take millions of people across the galaxsy. The Taiidan threw us on random planet in the middle of nowhere, and they probably knew it was going to die soon! wowLoving the politics too! I just got through the Making Of content, and the first few sections of the guide.... as a huge fan of this series, proud owner of the recent collector’s edition I love it. You nailed it! I'm sure the actual game is pretty sweet too! "

												It was always going to be a tough act to follow the massively successful Homeworld franchise yet Deserts of Kharak copes admirably. Set on Kharak - the HW series planet of origin, the latest installment is an excellent prequel to the events of the homeworld series. Set on the harsh desert world of Kharak, the sands of said planet are in a very odd and unexpected way interchangable with the cold vacum of space from the original games; both are hostile environments inhospitable to man. This is why Deserts works so well, it retains the feel and massive scale of the homeworld universe, the art style, the lore and backstory but fleshes it out for ground combat. Would recommend for anyone who enjoyed the original HW games or to anyone who enjoyed Dune in its many multmedia guises, similarily if anyone was thinking about buying HW remastered start instead with Deserts of Kharak, then migrate into space - the RTS equivelant of doing ME 1, ME 2 and then ME 3 and keeping the same character throughout!

												Welcome to Kharak, maggots! Here you have sand, more sand, and even more sand. And luddite desert nomads trying to kill you in the name of their God.That out of the way...This game is a pretty interesting look at Kharak's past, and the events leading up to the chronicle of Homeworld as we know it. The RTS aspect is pretty good, though some may still feel it's a case of ""Been There, Done That"".Probably the nicest thing is that it goves some faces you can relate to. The Homeworld series is known for being pretty impersonal - not many unique characters to latch on to or to personify. This game does that by giving you quite an ensemble to relate to, and makes them, well, more human - closer to home.All in all, it's something Die-Hard fans of the Homeworld series shouldn't miss, and which newcomers to the series absolutely should play to give somebackground to the star spanning saga they will encounter.9/10 would recommend to everyone to give it a try.

												If you played and liked homeworld you will love this.If you Have not played homeworld this is the place to start. Most negative reviews seem to center around the price.Everyone has a different value for money so its hard to speak for everyone.Personally i think the game is well worth it. The production value of the campaign and the game as a whole is better then most AAA titles. IF they can charge 30 pounds for the remastered edition then surely 30 pound for a new game made from scratch is not too much to ask.The music, the speech, the graphics, and general theme of the game is outstanding.I really appreciate a game that is well polished and this is it, the little touches are what made me love homeworld and the same effort has been put into this.Just for an example the unit speech when you issue commands. Sounds like a small thing but when you are selecting and moving units constantly an annoying sounding unit can become grading. With homeworld: Deserts of Kharak you never get tired of hearing the units give out scan readings and comfirmations. Even while idle the units talk to each other, one will talk of a local reading and ask another to confirm it which they do. You will be told when enemy units are spotted when a unit dies, everything, but it doesnt feel like too much. It feels like a real warzone with alot of information being relayed.Things like that remind of command and conquer, dawn of war and some of the other best strategy games ive played.I was never one for multiplayer strategy games so i cannot speak for that. I prefer campaigns and this one is great. The cutscenes are not quite starcraft 2 but have their own charm. They create a sense of atmosphere that i have only encountered in homeworld itself. The idea of scale, discovering a large thing out in the desert and seeing one of your tiny light attack vehicle next to it. As for the actual gameplay, its smart. Homeworld had a unique style to it and this follows that path and i love it. You dont control a base as such, you dont build buildings. Instead you have a convoy. One main cruiser which produces your troops and handles research. Then other support vehicles can be built. All of your resources collected, units built, research carries over to the next mission. So you get this feeling that you are literally a convoy moving towards the main objective of the campaign, getting bigger along the way. The missions are fun, each one has a twist, starcraft 2 had a similar method which made me enjoy it so much. The mission is never just kill the enemy. You have to scan things, protect things and such. They add things like tornadoes to the mix to keep you on your toes.If you want multiplayer this might not be for you, ive heard theres not much going on with it. If you like campaigns then i would highly recommend. Its worth a try you will learn quickly if you like the style of gameplay. PLus if you enjoy it you have homeworld 1 and 2 to play.			"

												When I played Homeworld 2, I was peeved at the storyline and plotholes in it, compared to the first game, Cata, and my own developed headcanon.  I was also overwhelmed with so many things, so many options, but it still felt like a Homeworld game.Deserts of Kharak also feels like a Homeworld game, but as opposed to 2, I do not feel overwhelmed with options and the need to multitask so many things, and most importantly, I am enjoying the retcons and changes to the story. ""The Clans were United, and an Expedition was Sent"", from the original opening can gloss over so much. A few changes along the timeline to make the Northern/Southern war at the same time of the Expedition really is fine by me.The unit chatter is back and better than ever, I like how the game encourages you to conserve units, and having a Concordat Cycle that helps but does not fully hinder if you get it wrong is a bonus. Terrain for combat is starting to get interesting, although I feel this system and engine would be better served if licensed and adapted to another setting that has way more map and terrain variety.I have yet to complete this game, but it's become a very nice routine thus far to play a mission or two before getting ready and departing for work. Having no interest in playing multiplayer, the weak AI complaints fall upon deaf ears here.Of course, I'm playing on the lowest difficulty and getting my♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked at times. It's been a long while since I tried to play an RTS straight, having been over on Paradox games for the longest time. Tactical isn't my forte, Strategic is - yet Deserts of Kharak is fun and enjoyable, and unlike other games it feels like it's helping me learn how to properly use units and tactics. The missions might be getting harder, but I feel that I'm getting better as well.I don't think I've any complaints for this game at all.			"

												As a Homeworld fan I can tell you that this game is in line with the lore and gamplay it is a wonderfull adaptation from 3d of the space strategy to 2d.The storyline is something that a lot of RTS games would be jealous of with intrigue, deception and all out rivalry.For RTS fans this should a must have as the strategy in this game can go very far.There are some controle issue, as example your weaker units tend to go up front which means they get damaged very quick. This needs some micromanagment. As a folowup of that your support/repair vessel is all the way in the back so you have to command them closer.The origenal homeworld games had the possibility to assign groups of ships a certain setup ( Cap ships in front, Fighter screen, frigate line or cruiser line ) which can help a lot in soaking damage, next to that the setups would imrpove effeciency of the selected ship setup.This comes back to the controle issues as it would help a lot!Everything accounted for, I would still 100% recomend this as a buy, especially for an RTS fan.

												~Ground based version of the original Homeworld game.~Great graphics and overall performance at max settings.~One of the best Storys in an RTS I have seen in a long time, lots of attention to detail etc.~Great Gameplay  mechanics.~Fast learning curve, espesially for avid RTS playersThere are really only a few cons I can think of an they are pretty minor.~Game needs some Optimization in reguards to the graphics engine, slowdowns are frequent even on my FX-8370 and R9-390X with 8GB of ram all paired with a SSD.~Wished there were more missions, seemed a tad shorter then expected, none the less it was good.Other then those minor gripes I really didn't see much that bothered me while playing, they really did a fantastic job keeping the *Homeworld* feel with this game.

												Definitely a fun game and worth the price of admission, manages to bring a remarkable amount of Homeworldlyness to a land-based game which is definitely nice although it does seem a bit forced at times.Gameplay is solid, though a touch shallow in terms of depth, the tendency towards the 'big ships steamroller' is still present and could stand to be toned down a bit in terms of the ease of aquisition. Given the 'all deserts all the time' asthetic I would have liked to see some more environmental hazards, sand storms that take big chunks of the map and reduce visibility and do some damage, steeper dunes actually having a chance of collapsing on units, wind managing to shift dunes around a bit.Graphics and sound are both excellent, they did a good job of making the desert seem visually distinct. The sound design was a lovely return to form.The campain was fun, not so short that I have any complaints and I'm certainly left wanting more time in the deserts after that.			"

												It is a fantastic game but it only contains a few hours of game time in campaign mode.there are cons as well as pros. the camera can not be moved around as you please. some times it seems like you are stuck in a tiny bubble on the map as you cant zoom out as far as you please and your sphere of view are imo wery limited. they could learn alot from ground contol and the total war series when it comes to unit movement and pther things. like how can you see the range of your artillery? why cant you tell your aerial forrces how to behave? etc.im going to give it one more go in hard mode but if there are no dlc content for this soon then imo a waste of my money but im a huge fan of the original games that i have been playing continously since their release so i kinda had to have this one no mather what :)please devs. expand this game and expand it soon!

												Excellent RTS with a distinct Homeworld feel, and while the campaign only has 13 missions they are all very good and require different strategies, the story is excellent and has the distinct Homeworld mythos. Multiplayer is nice and the community is friendly and welcoming. If you enjoy Homeworld games this is worth getting for your collection, if you are into RTS but with a very detailed single player story line and beautiful visuals then this may peek your interests, if none of the above maybe check out when on sale, thumbs up!

												If you want more of Homeworld, get Deserts of Kharak.Those that are dissapointed likely expected Homeworld 3 instead of a spinoff, but apart from taking place on land Deserts of Kharak is a Homeworld game down to its very core. Same great atmosphere and music, same great vehicles, same slow persistant fleet RTS gameplay. It's so much a Homeworld game that if this game appeared in the remastered collection, I doubt many first time players could tell that it was released this year. If that sounds good to you, well you should probably buy it so we do get Homeworld 3.			"

												Finally, a new, good looking, good playing, deep sci-fi RTS!Some of the controls I wish I could change - my only gripe, but I can overlook that.Very much Homeworld meets Ground Control. Your units are expensive and robust and thus you want to protect them - requires to you play using your brain over mindless brawn. You cannot just spam endless units to win the day, instead tactics, strategy and efficient use of a maps resources are the name of the game. Each unit has interesting little abilities and/or deployables that really add the to strategic play.And let me say this - vehicle porn - lol, the units are gorgeous to watch.  Im not ashamed to admit I lost a few battles because I was too busy watching things move, wheels turn and turrets deploy =)There is the occassional silliness of an obviously very heavy vehicle flipping end over end when going over an obstacle, but aside from my making me chuckle it doesnt seem to effect gameplay, least it hasnt for me.Also - the unit chatter, the ambient chatter - Ive never experienced something such as this in an RTS game - it feels completely alive - you can really believe all those units you're moving around have living, breathing people working inside them.My short two hours in game took me to the 4th capaign mission if I recall - and its been a very cool experience all the way.If you liked Ground Control and Homeworld, if you like RTS games, if you like the idea of a sort of psuedo Supreme Commander 'lite' (ie: no base building, but large strategic maps and terrain control, similiar play style, rock/paper/scissors style to a large degree) - you cant go wrong here.It looks great, it sounds great, the units are interesting and fun and just plain old fun to watch - I cant wait to get further in =) "

												+Great art style in both cutscenes and graphics+Everything from the sound effects to the campaign plot screams Homeworld+Excellent RTS gameplay, can get really intense at times+Units have more chatter that reflects the action+Expedition guide is full of delicious fluff-Short campaign. A little too short, in fact, and is a little unsatisfying in the end-Only two factions, not ""two playable factions"" just TWO factions-Missing features from gameplay (that I feel are very important): No in-game pause and no proper way of determing how units position themselves-AI is dumb as balls, once you unlock higher-tier units you can basically steamroll enemies-Very little multiplayer mapsVerdict: Unless you're a Homeworld or RTS fan then I'd recommend staying away until they add stuff in updates or it goes on sale.

All the signs of a pile of unoptimized code rushed out the door.The game's nice visuals, audio and atmosphere is ruined by technical incompetence on every thinkable level.The latest patch wiped out my save games and persistent fleet data.

												Thin story. They do a decent job building tension with what they have. Poor ending. Music is strong as it is in all the Homeworld franchise. I spent most of my time directing my units in sensor mode, so rarely got to view the action. Probably could have been a more strategic game if they had built in the pause button that lets you view the map and issue orders like the previous titles.Not a ton of strategy - campaign is too easy. The last missions pose some challenge but you get weapons that make countering enemy assaults trivial. All in all, a missed opportunity. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game on anything but a heavy discount.			"

												Really loved the game a must have, however it lack modding support and there is one misstake that just annoy the hell out of me. It is like a slap in the face. Makes me wonder if the devs acctuly ""studied "" the story. Just find it annoying and strange to see the soban emblem on a starship when at that time kiith soban clearly didnt exist, they where created by Soban the red when his former kiith Sa allowed his ""village"" or settlement be wiped out by an other kiith during a war. Apperantelly he was embarrased and refused to follow the kiith sa that turned a blind eye to the death and crying of his fellow clan members. In the end he ripped off his former kiith colours and created his OWN kiith that ended up working as mecenaries (Kiith Soban). Unless im misstaken the Soban kiith emblem is a depicion of an skaal fa (the deadliest of predator that roams the desert of kharak) Essentially further proof that Soban didn´t exist at the when the Kushan arrived on kharak, and there is the emblem in the ending cutscene. How could they screw that detail up so badly?			"

												To make it short and simple.Either you will love this game and join its fanbase or you are gonna hate it because it goes against the current standards of RTS.It's a mix of the old homeworld and COH and Ground Control. IT IS NOT A SUPCOM COPY.The Pros:- The Single Player is breathtaking. The perfect prequel to Homeworld & Homeworld 2- The Units while not numerous are well done and play well in the rock-paper-scissor scheme of any RTS.- The theme and structure is awesome. Let me repeat... is awesome. Rarely will a game suck you in and especially an RTS game.- You feel that you are a commander in the field. Not like a base builder and then send your units and thats that. Resources are scarce and tactical descions are paramount to be succesful.- My experiance is mostly on the single player with a few multiplayer games thrown in against a couple of friends and I feel the multiplayer needs a couple of mods and/or ways to play.The Cons- The keybinding issue (You can't change them) and according to the Devs they are working on it.- Unit formations needs to be looked at.- Multi has only 5 maps which is sufficient to get through the time being while more are being worked on.- Needs a couple of multi player modes... Capture the hill and tower like defence against AI?Overall: 9/10P.S. For the new comers to Homeworld... The story continues on Homeworld and Homeworld 2 which are pretty darn good in their own way. DON'T MISS THEM.			"

												I got this game during the winter sale an loved it big homeworld fan.The things that sucked was the game bug.None of them were game breaking and were small non the less but it picks at you.Not able to rebind keys was ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.The Unit AI control is pretty stupid-units wont auto attack if in guard mode-units wont sync there movements ( so the faster units die 1st)-when launching multiple strike craft it seem they bug out and only 1 out of 3 will attack leaving the other 2 just to fly around your carrier.-Strike craft wont split fire they all attack one unit (unless you control them manually which is hard to do since they move so fast.)I just really didnt like the unit controls i felt they half A$$ed it, with no formations or defend this area no nothing just Attack or guard.. and since they dont attack when on guard seems kinda dumb.I didn't like the camera at all either it was so close to the ground it was hard to command. A game trying to give the feeling of big but having the camera is so close to the ground so your vision is limited and if you use strice craft you dont even see them half the time... Like they fly at 50 feet persay well your camera is at 60 feet so you see them just for a momment.I'm pretty sure this is just cause i picked the hardest mission but I have a problem with the enemy AI they always go after the Hero Base Runner missile attacks the EMP's I spend half the game trying to keep that B!tch alive.Online seems to be a ghost town. No modsNo comments from the devsI'm kinda let down on this one I feel like i was just told Santa isn't real for the 1st time.I sighed up for the beta long ago back when it was called ""Ship Breakers"" but then this game went dark. then it was brought back to life as this horrible Igor experiment.... All I can think of is ""Shame"" ding ding ""Shame"" Ding ding ""Shame"".			"

												One of the biggest surprises of the new year is Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, a prequel to the original Homeworld that has long remained an icon of PC-based strategy warfare titles.  DOK abandons the vast emptiness of outer space for the sand-choked deserts of the ill-fated planet Kharak, and tells the story of how the people came to locate the ancient anomaly that would give rise to their exodus towards their titular homeworld.  The switch to ground-based strategy gameplay is a definite change from the 3-dimensional tactics one could employ in space, but it's not without merit.  Here, Gearbox selects elements from Homeworld's pedigree and marries them to elevation tactics from other notable strategy games.  Thus, elevation becomes a driving force behind victory over enemy units.  It's a fanciful, albeit simplistic way of approaching combat, but it does come at a cost.  DOK's stripped down ""for everyone"" approach means that some important elements such as battle formations have been jettisoned, reducing the level of depth that Homeworld veterans may be accustomed too.  It's a bit jarring, and makes DOK feel more like a mini-episode in a much larger storyline.  The game focuses heavily on short and long-ranged units almost specifically, forcing players to mix up units in order to guard and attack.  Naturally, enemies can attack from all directions, and the relative shortage of resources (or should I say, compartmentalized resources) means that there isn't a lot of elbow room to establish bank-breaking fleets as seen in the original Homeworld games.  Researching new technologies is on a need-to-do basis, and therefore feels a tad linear.  The speed of the game has also changed as well.  Units build much faster, research takes far less than it used to, and enemies race in out of nowhere.  Is this an attempt to court players with less-than-stellar attention spans?  Perhaps!Ironically, it's a magnificent game despite the narrowed and more centralized gameplay mechanics.  I'm hoping that future chapters in the Homeworld saga won't go this route, but for a game set on the surface of a planet, instead of outer space, it's an admirable and enjoyable entry in the franchise.  Let's face it.  There's a criminal lack of Homeworld games for us to play, and this is the first true sequel in over a decade.  Who are we to complain?  DOK retains the signature Homeworld atmosphere, music and visual styles of previous games, and it's nice to see unit designs giving nods to what will eventually become spacefaring Kushan fighters, capital ships and destroyers.  It's like going back to the beginning to a world where little is left.  The dry sands of Kharak are a perfect backdrop for a pretty good (but not stellar) story, and a nice little glimpse into the richness of Homeworld's still mysterious storyline.RECOMMENDED!			"

												If you're in any way a fan of the Homeworld series, this game will carry with it almost all of the things you loved from previous games. It's not in a 3d space, but it carries over the art style, music, design and interface. Difficulty wasn't a cake walk, but I still managed to beat the game within 9 hours. Compared to say Homeworld which required you to accumulate large amounts of units and cheese the global supply limit by salvage, and say Homeworld 2 where you could very methodicly engage a portion of the map, mine, and rebuild before going to the next mission, HW:DoK fits somewhere inbetween and I find this to be refreshing, as I was always producing units and was never given the chance to simply max my fleet out before moving on. On that note unit production is different in that for one faction in the game all of your units are produced from your ""mothership"" with numerous production queue's. As far as I know, there is no limit to any one unit type but rather there is simply a global supply limit and you can work in any units you wish within this limit. Research seems to provide you with numerous options that exceede the amount of resources you can obtain, so researching feels more like a choice than in previous games within the series.I could describe a lot more to the game, but I find the differences to be refreshing while still feeling like a Homeworld game even without space and my beloved ion frigates. If you're a fan of Homeworld pick this up, and if you aren't but love RTS games, I'd give this game a shot. If you like this, try out the older Homeworld games and prepare to sit with the rest of us waiting for Homeworld 3.			"

Lots of familiar systems, stories, and even sound from the previous remastered HW games and the ground combat actually adds an entirely new dimension to the tactics and gameplay that I was not expecting. When I first saw the announcement of this game, I thought, ""it's not in space!?!"", but it turns out that I really appreciate this approach. Would be nice if it was a combination of the two, but maybe that is yet to come in the future with DLC and Mods. Or I'll just revisit the remastered Homeworld 1 and 2.			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a true continuation of Homeworld gameplay, even if the story takes place far before the events of Homeworld 1.Many Homeworld veterans might be concerned that battles take place on land instead of in space, however all the pieces are still there:The Mothership/Flagship is now replaced by a massive central crawler that serves the same functions. You produce ""capital"" crawlers in the same vein as capital ships in previous titles, and use a mix of light and medium units in the same vein as Fighters/Corvettes/Frigates.Positioning is still ""3D"" in the sense that using proper elevation can yield significant bonuses in combat, and epxanding your sensor net and keeping intel on the enemy, as in previous titles, is key. If anything, I find the gameplay more enjoyable than even Homeworld 2, as combat is accessible, properly paced, and still leaves ample room for tactics and positioning. Graphic and sound design is SUPERB. There are FEW RTS titles that capture the atmosphere quite like this game does. Lighting and specular design is amazing, the desert maps are incredibly detailed and somehow still offer plenty of visual variety. Units are highly detailed and the wreckage and scorched earth of an engagement are satisfying. The unit chatter and tiny details in audio design only add to the effect. This is a superb evolution of the homeworld series and the RTS genre. I cannot wait for Workshop support and see what else the developer does with this game. "

												""Homeworld: DoK is a good time"", that's the perfect description to grant it with. It doesn't really break any new grounds, it isn't a masterpiece by any means, it's a good time... And that's absolutely fine. I liked it mostly because I feel very nostalgic for the Dune series (Emperor especially, Tribute to Evil is like the best song ever \m/ David Arkenstone, I salute you!). Another reason for my positivity towards the game: the idea of having a mobile aircraft carrier base intrigues me. Let's face it: old school RTS games have always been a bit of a drag, building the base every single mission is a chore at best. Here however, you take your base with you. Genius! The story is engaging enough as well, full of drama and intrigue to keep one's interest stimulated at all times.Now for the bad parts. The game runs like a*s, even on my extremely powerful hardware. The AI is dumb as all f**k. It also takes you ages to get anywhere, the carrier especially, because pretty much all units run at a snail's pace. The latter is the reason that I have 17 hours on my counter for finishing the campaign alone, that and I'm also a greedy b***h that wanted to collect all the resources in her way, but that's how I roll. The graphics are extremely dated, but at least the locations are always varied and interesting despite the game being set on a desert planet.In conclusion: definitely worth it, especially on sale. I'll be playing the Homeworld remaster next, how in the world have I missed the games when they were first released? A forever mystery.			"

												Well, here it is, the prequel to Homeworld. This game didn't start out as a Kharak story; it started out as just a new RTS game by Blackbird Interactive which consisted largely of the original Homeworld team. When the Homeworld franchise was auctioned off (again) by Gearbox, Gearbox tracked down Blackbird Interactive and partnered up with them to get their RTS game reconstructed to be a Homeworld prequel. It took all of a year or two to rewrite the storyline and plot and apply narration (etc) assets for it.The good: Beautiful game matching the aesthetics overall of Homeworld. Brillliant artwork, graphics, music, sound, narriation/acting.Gameplay mechanics very similar to Homeworld.Fun mechanics, very playable and fun game.[Barely] satisfying campaign length. (Could be longer, feels rushed, but generally satisfying-ish.)The bad:No true 3D gameplay (but definitely 3D terrain if that matters, along the lines of Starcraft)Infuriating glitches such as aircraft needing to be double-clicked (while they're moving in flight, good luck) and ""reminded"" to land and rearm.Auto-save checkpoints immediately precede long cutscenes that can't be skipped; you must remember to save after every cutscene if you don't want to repeat them.Plot and game ending triggers block resource collection for building up for next mission.Massive narrative plothole at ending requires a complete understanding of the first level of Homeworld 1 before can it be understood to say nothing of being appreciated.Conclusion:I have mixed feelings about this game. Overall, it's a good game, generally satisfying for the Homeworld fan, as the essential gameplay elements that made Homeworld great (other than total 3D strategy) are here. If you're a Homeworld fan, there's not enough to hate here to avoid it. You'll like it.			"

												The aesthetic and design of Kharak is so interesting and so unique that I really find this a compelling RTS. The storyline is the best I've seen in an RTS in a very long time; this game is (or should be) all about the single player campaign. The multiplayer is fairly standard.The thing that keeps me so intrigued by this game is the ""land carrier"" concept. The way it's presented, the way they show the lives of the crew and the struggle they have to go through to keep things together, reminds me a lot of the new Battlestar Galactica in its concept. I've always been a fan of huge ships going on an epic journey, weathering direct fire and scrambling fighters; this game gives you the unique ground equivalent of BSG, more or less.For anyone who enjoyed Homeworld OR Battlestar Galactica and enjoys a heavily story-driven single-player campaign, with a small amount of fun to be had with multiplayer (maybe more than a little fun if you play it with friends), I can HIGHLY recommend this game. The mechanics are tight, there aren't any serious bugs, the music is awesome, the sound effects are satisfying, and the general concept of ""I'm commanding a massive land carrier that's a mobile city"" is just so... AWESOME... that I'm excited to recommend this game as one of the few games that has truly given me joy in the past few years.The team who created this game should also kindly shut up and take my money for Homeworld 3 and begin development right away (if they haven't already). This is exactly the team of artists, writers and developers -- the exact people who made this game -- that we sorely need to stick together to make the NEXT epic Homeworld game. Do it. Do it now.

												A worthy addition to the Homeworld universe, the game is both recognizeable enough to be familiar, and different enough to keep me interested.Pros:- The story of the search for the 'Primary Anomaly' is interesting and a nice look back into the past of the Homeworld universe.- Gameplay, while not groundbreaking, is solid and fun. The unit strengths and weaknesses are easy to understand, without getting over complicated.- Sound is, as always in a Homeworld game, excellent. The background unit chatter makes the forces at your command more than a collection of dots on a map.- Music deserves it's own entry, it fits the tone wonderfully, giving a sense of the open waste of desert, or the thrill of combat. I WILL be getting the OST.- Unit designs are cool, from the zippy Strike vehicles, to the lumbering Carrier. Not many games get me to want to own replicas, but dammit, I want a model of that Carrier on my desk!Cons:- Occasional oddities of units moving inside of each other, mostly noticable on the Salvagers while collecting resources. Not a big issue, but it would be nice to see it patched out.- VERY rarely I would notice enemy units jerking around, instead of smoothly moving. This has only happened once however, on one mission, one playthrough. I have yet to replicate it on any other mission, or on the same mission when I restarted it.-In engine cinematics. I love them, they're well done, add to the story, and look nice... BUT YOU CAN'T SKIP THEM. Seriously, non skippable cinematics in 2016? I am dissapoint. (Yes it's a minior gripe, I know)Overall, I definitely recommend this game, even to those who have not played any of the Homeworld games before.			"

												Homeworld Deserts of Kharak is the Prequel to Homeworld 1, you are put in command of the Coalitions Expedition Carrier the kapisi. The mission is to retrieve the source coming from the jaraci object laying deep within enemy territory. The enemy being the Gaalsien, a Nomadic kiithid that worship Sajuuk and believe everyone was placed on kharak becuase of a dreaded sin. the kahad Sajuuk believes that going into space will anger sajuuk and bring his wrath upon the world (If you've played HW1 you know what happens) The Campaign takes you across the the harsh deserts of Kharak to the Khar-toba wreck.________________________________________________________________________________~The Multiplayer~At the moment you only have 2 main factions plus the 2 DLC factions - Coalition- Gaalsien - Soban - Khaaneph and there is some unit synergy -LAV's/ skimmers counter rail guns -AVV's/ Assualt Ships counter LAV's -Rail Guns counter AVV's and Assualt ships Soban and Coalition are the only 2 factions who have access to GunShips, so Rushing bombers as Gaalsien/Khaaneph is suicide 9 times out of 10.

												I've been a HomeWorld fan for a long time, having played through the games when they first came out and more recently the beautiful remakes (such a shame they couldn't remaster Cataclysm as well). This is just superb! Having a lot more commitments than when I was younger- well I don't tend to play many games these days and even games I love I can only justify a couple of hours tops in a session, except this. I've just forced myself to put this game down after playing it all evening. Also despite all the reviews saying the game is broken at mission 4- well I've just completed that without a problem so it is possible!If you like HomeWorld or just RTS in general then I highly reccomend as an excellent single player campaign driven title. HomeWorld games have a unique system- your army being persistent between battles and are (comparatively) slow paced compared to more frantic rts titles. A few people have commented that the computer specs are quite high for this, which is suprising given the machine I've been playing on... So far been running this on an old first gen i5 laptop with an nVidia GT 420m gpu. Admitedly I'm on minimum settings yet game still looks nice and frame rates are acceptible. I think if you have a reasonably modern cpu and discrete gpu you should be able to run this. Some of the very latest iGPU's should probably just about manage it as well.			"

												Disclaimer: I never intended to play multiplayer in this game. This review is solely based on the single player campaign. Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is set on, you guessed it, the planet of Kharak, and is a prequel the the now classic Homeworld games. Instead of the sometimes too-complex-for-it's-own-good-3D-plane battlefields of Homeworld 1 and 2, Deserts of Kharak plays a lot more like a traditional kind of RTS, seeing as all the fighting takes place on the surface of the planet. Despite this pretty big change, it still manages to capture the essence of those great past games, with good looking animations and unit models. The story is actually pretty decent for an RTS. Centered around this lady scientist (Rachel something?) and her search for her brother in the midst of a war, it manages to hit a nice balance between a war story, and a personal narative. I really liked my time with the game, even if it was ""only"" the singleplayer. I got the game from a steam sale for around €16, which is a no brainer in my opinion.			"

												I liked it. And I'm biased because I am also loyal to the brand. I've played Homeworld 1&2 when they first came out (they are in my nostalgia wishlist of things to get). The controls felt natural. The command playstyle was very Homeworld 1&2. It's a place where I was comfortable.If you collect RTS this is one to add to your collection. It's a good, straightforward and solid RTS. However, If you're looking for something unique, this game isn't the place to get it.Things I noticed and gave nod to was the height map terrains giving defilade and enfilade (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfilade_and_defilade) actual meaning. The homeworld version of the mothership was upgradeable and not defensless.My biggest complaint is there isn't a lot of depth of gameplay. I completed the single player (distracted) in less than 8 hours. There aren't many ways to skin the cat (strategies that win the game) the story left me wanting more. I didn't feel challenged in the multiplayer and skirmish options. I've noticed that a lot from games recently, where they release a stable first product then pile on DLC's to increase the revenue. I get the sense this game will have more depth once the DLC's start rolling out.			"

I didn't get too far in the campaign, but it was mediocre, I could not bare to continue playing it and grabbed the steam refund while I still could. If you're new to the series, pick up Homeworld 1 & 2 remastered edition. Overall 6.5/10			"

												OK, let's put things clear. Yes, the graphics are pretty bad for a 2016 game, the campaign is a bit short and the animations could use some work. Still, this game is the most fun I had in a long time. The thing that the game does beautifullty is that you feel like a war commander (I know; it's the goal of the game). When you see the holographic world and you start you establish tactics concerning terrain hight, I assure you that everything sounds (and looks) awesome. Also, the game is pretty hard. I played it on normal and I struggled for some missions. I started again on hard mode. You NEED to make some military tactics while playing on the highest difficulty level. The ""build a bunch of dudes and rush at the enemy"" dosn't work anymore. All in all, the game is awesome.8/10			"

Posted: July 4, 2016
												If you loved the Homeworld series, Deserts of Kharak is totally worth it, and here's why:First of all, a little backstory: the Homeworld IP was tossed around various companies for almost a decade, before ending in a bid between Blackbird (ex Homeworld devs) and Gearbox, the latter winning the auction. This led to the Remastered edition, on which Blackbird helped Gearbox quite a bit, especially with assets. In the meanwhile, Blackbird was working on Hardware: Shipbreakers, an independent title, designed to be F2P. Gearbox eventually asked them if they'd want to rebrand it as Homeworld, and Blackbird agreed. Why did I waste one paragraph writing this? Because Deserts of Kharak is NOT a well-planned,  heavily-financed AAA game. It is a haphazardly put together welcome surprise package, somewhat as a replacement for Cataclysm Remastered, not driven by profit but passion. So, in my opinion, most of the shortcomings mentioned in the other reviews can be forgiven/overlooked.Deserts of Kharak faithfully reproduces MANY themes in the original saga, such as an expedition to explore the past (immediately followed by total disaster), that determines the future; fleet balancing (that some consider the rock-paper-scissor design, but pretty much all CCGs, MOBAs, Arena Shooters, etc. are identically balanced); stellar, beautiful music; emphasis on micromanagement and rewarding effort; and a gripping, tight back-story that segways neatly into the intro to Homeworld 1. There isn't much you can do with a fixed ending, and Deserts of Kharak sprinkles enough suspense, thrill, even drama, throughout the journey to keep you engaged. DoH brings terrain-based tactical combat to the table as new gameplay, and while it works, it's not as game-changing as you'd like it to be. If you used 3D space to lay out ambushes in Homeworld, you can totally use sand dunes to achieve the same effect in DoH. Like Catacylsm, you have one very mobile carrier instead of a big mothership, which is now upgradable and quite capable of holding its own in combat, provided you shunt power to the right drives. You do NOT automatically collect resources at the end of missions, which fits the ""nomads on the run"" motif, IMO. Besides, unlike HW, resources aren't scattered throughout the map, but concentrated inside shipwrecks that you find on the way: the process of shipbreaking and gathering resources is challenging, especially when under constant attack (an example of the ""reward effort"" mantra).The game is a bit buggy, camera controls could be improved, cutscenes could be skippable, and a myriad of other minor issues that, in my opinion, have negligible impact on player experience. My harshest criticism against the game would be its pricing: it might have had more success in the $25 range. Deserts of Kharak is a well executed modern RTS (in a world dominated by MOBAs) that you should definitely try.			"

												I reluctantly requested a refund on this one today, even though I very much liked the overall graphics, the gameplay, and pretty much everything about it.  Unfortunately, the one thing that I didn't like was the proverbial ""game killer"" for me.Here's the thing: You've got a good variety of units, all of them with very nice graphics, the combat effects are quite nice - great explosions and so on -- but you can't zoom out your view far enough to really see what's going on.  To do that - to zoom out to a range where you can get a large enough picture to let you make solid tactical decisions, to see where the enemy are, and intelligently direct your forces to properly respond to the attacks -- you have to switch from the nice graphics that make this so nice to the eye into a high altitude radar-like view where all the units are little colored dots or hollow triangles moving around on a flat 2D map.  Take a look at the FIVE video clips shown on the Steam store page. You can go through almost all of all five of them and what you see are almost exclusively shots of the good looking unit graphics, a few cut scenes, and more nice closeups of units showing how nice they look. BUT to see what you'll be looking at for at least 50% of the time, jump to the 21 second point of the fifth video and you'll see the dots and hollow triangles that are what you see  every time you pan out to get a larger tactical of the full strategic view.Yes, they make it easy to swich between close up and zoomed out - just touch the space bar - but they have to make it easy, 'cause you have to spend so much time in the zoomed out view, it has to be easy to access, right?Why, oh WHY, make a game with such pretty graphics for their units, and their buildings, and then make you constantly switch to the view that robs the game of all those loveingly crafted components?  *sighs heavily*So - when someone posts a mod that lets you zoom waaay out and still see the decent graphics (they can even be tiny little units!) instead of dots and hollow triangles - someone email me and I'll re-purchase this one. I really, really wanted to like it (played both of the Homeworld games for years) but...honestly if I wanted to watch little dots moving around on the screen, I could get something made back in the 1980s.Sorry, Devs - you made a very pretty game -- too bad you can't appreciate how nice the graphics are for over half the time you're playing.

												OK first up, if you are a diehard Homeworld fan like myself then yes, buy this game. Because it's a bit like meeting an old friend you haven't seen for many many years, and quite frankly feared had died. A friend that was a blast to hang out with in his old spaced out days, but now it seems he has become a well grounded individual (if you catch my drift). Does this make your old friend a bit dull now? Hell no. DoK looks, feels, sounds, and plays just as you would expect a Homeworld game to, irrespective of not being in space. But most importantly it's fun.If you like RTS games, or are new to them then I would suggest you check out reviews and game play videos on YouTube. As HW relies on a mobile fabrication and persistent fleet mechanic with limited resources that make spamming units a pretty much redundant and counter productive strategy. Which is not to everyone's liking. Make your own mind up, don't let me or anyone else tell you what's good or bad.      Also bear in mind this is not a AAA game, and as such I think some people had unrealistically high expectations, and/or no past experience of HW1, 2, and Cataclysm. The game looks great, runs fine on my medium rig with settings on ultra, and no crashes to report.However, there are some tweaking issues within the game at launch, which seems pretty much the norm (an additional month or two in production wouldn't have gone amiss), but can be fixed with patching. BBI have already stated they are going to support/patch and add DLC, so the game can only get better. Plus DoK opens up sooo many possible future game avenues for the Homeworld series to pursue, which has to be a good thing for the franchise, and fans alike. Thanks BBI and Gearbox for resuscitating the Homeworld universe. Any chance of HW 3? Please.			"

												Let me start by saying I loved the original homeworld series, and wish they could find a way to bring back the other Homeworld game(Homeworld Cataclysm I believe).    That said, this is a fun game, but I feel its lacking in a lot of the things that made the Homeworld series amazing.  Part of what I loved about the series was the details they put in, for instance how every ship could be seen actually undocking or docking, even the capital ships, and the resource collectors actually had to dock to drop off supplies.  In this game, most of the ships come out of the right spots on the carrier, but when you retire ships they just drive under the carrier, not into the ramp on the back, and the resource collectors just have to touch the carrier or supply ships, not actually dock with them.  They are all small things, but I feel they are a major part of what made the original games so good.  Also, some of the controls or commands for ships are either missing, or badly done.  For instance there is no patrol option, if you queue up too many build orders on base runners they often get messed up, especially if you don't keep that many resources on hand(when you give it the order to build something, it doesn't subtract the resources from your total until the base runner actually gets there).Overall, yes I would recommend this game if you are a fan of RTS and/or Homeworld, but I feel they could have done better on it by focusing on a few more details.

												14 hrs of game play feels like 140 hrs, it's just that great. The final boss fight was intense and it's worth every penny of the on sale price. I don't think it's worth the original price for me, but for the discounted price, it's worth it. The unit upgrade system is good too, I just wish that I get a chance to fully upgrade but that's the appeal of this game -- I want to fully upgrade but I have to tactically do it because the pressure is real. I have to specialized on one unit else I'm done for. The story is interesting but the ending seemed rushed -- it's like there should be 20 chapters but they have to cut it to 13. In the end, I got what I paid for and I'm satisfied.			"

												My review comes from a multiplayer perspective. The campaign has already been covered well  by other reviews.Its a bit rushed and rough around the edges, (no key binding, few maps, occasional animation glitches etc.) but the developer hasn't given up on it yet and are planning future updates to fix bugs, balance gameplay, and add new maps.The core game mechanics for online multiplayer are solid. Taking advantage of terrain and scouting are critical to success. Good tactics can and will beat high Actions Per Minute and larger armies in this game. Though there are fewer units available than in other homeworld titles almost every unit has multiple purposes. For example the Gaalsien missile ship is a standard AA unit but also has an EMP motar that can disable ground units.If you are looking for an RTS that is truly tactical you should give this one a try. If not now, at least when it goes on sale.			"

												Nearly 3 hours in, I must say that I am having a blast. The combat is fun, the story is cool, and the shipbreaking and salvaging is awesome. Really the shipbreaking is the coolest part of the game. I recommend the game to all Homeworld lovers and most RTS fans.8/10 - Could be a nine, but the camera controls are a little wonky and require improvement.			"

												This review is based on the opinion of someone who has played all of the Homeworld games, including Cataclysm. So yes, I love the story and the world setting. I have very fond memories of the vast universe created by Relic back in 1999, so my review will reflect that sometimes.To put it simply, if you like your RTS games coupled with a good story then you will be very satisfied. The 10-15 hours campaign is very well made, fun missions that focus on slick action and pacing, with a very interesting story to boot. The conflict between the Coalition forces (the player) and the religious Gaalsien is fascinating to watch as they are two very different factions, each with their own very original and very pleasing audio-visual cues. Story progression is done through in-game cutscenes and gorgeous, incredibly original, animated scenes that highlight the more important events in the game. Although the ending is a bit abrupt, the story on the whole is deeply satysfying, with frequent nods and references do the older games in the series, specially Homeworld 1.Speaking of which, the graphics in this game are gorgeous. They are simple, elegant, and don't tax your computer heavily. Watching the land-carriers and their fleets work and intereact with each other and the enemy is a joy to watch as their animations are very well made and detailed. I love the aircraft animations in particular, as they use somewhat realistic engineering with the launch catapults and all. The larger vehicles are downright imposing and menacing, and the smaller ones give a sense of intimacy and scale that really reflects part of the reason I play RTS games: To watch and play as large armies collide with one another.In terms of audio this game is way above the competition. The music is awe-inspiring, creating a sense of tension and wonder that is rarely matched by other games of the genre. The soundtrack is composed by arabian-indian inspired sounds and instruments, lending the game a very exotic and mythic feeling. Sound effects are also incredibly well made, form the hum of the Battle-carriers to the thumping of large-calliber weapons. Playing this with a headphone is highly reccomended.Gameplay is incredibly fun as well, as the huge battles reminded me of a sci-fi Mad Max, as dozens of vehicles duke it out in a fiery storm of explosions deep in the desert. The player's fleet is centered on the huge Land-Carrier, a giant transport that serves not only as the production center and home base, but also as a fearsome weapon when needed. This is, in my view, a very interesting twist on the Homeworld formula. In previous games, Motherships were incredibly innefective in battle, depending wholeheartedly on their fleet's support, whereas in this game the land-carrier is a lot more independent. You don't have to babysit it all the time. As the game progresses your arsenal of vehicles and weapons expands, and each unit serves a purpose. I believe the variety is just right, enough to be complex without overwhelming the player with vehicles you'll never use.Multiplayer is still in development and could certainly use more maps and a third faction. But as it is, it is very fun and well made. Skirmish matches are also offered, but the AI could use some tweaking. It is not bad, but it's not that bright either. I believe Blackbird will tune it up with future patches, making the game even more fun.To sum it up, this is a very well made and elegant game. It looks and sounds amazing, with a very distinct and pleasing aura around it. I have played 15-16 hours as I write this review and I loved every minute of it. It is not an RTS made for the competitive SC2 guys. Deserts of Kharak is made for those who like a grand, epic story, with a very distinct and original feel to it. Sci-fi fans will love it. The gameplay is very fun, very original, and the two distinct factions offer a lot of gameplay options. I haven't had this much fun in Skirmish mode since Company of Heroes 2! Al in all, I highly reccomend this game. It is a 10/10 for me, and that is rare. I seldom write reviews, but I feel like this gem of a game deserves it. Roll on HW3 or more expasions for this game!

												So far i had quite alot of fun with this game. In the beginning i feared that it wouldnt feel like homeworld at all but it sure does. Campaign as allways is well made and you take your units thru the missions. The cutscenes are beatiful. I think the multiplayer also is working great. The game still has several flaws for example there are not many maps yet but all in all i'm really exited for this game and really like it so far.			"

												Loving the transition to ground vehicular combat, very enjoyable. The campaign is surprisingly good with great little cutscenes connecting each mission, some great writing on the dialogue and the art style is fantastic, it's incredibly immersive and the radio chatter is amazing to listen to as it's so varied. Small niggles about the annoying camera controls, your viewpoint feels too close to the battlefield especially when hills and mountains come into view, it's missing vital features which every RTS cannot do without and several other things they need to tweak and fix, but judging by their official forum they're already hard at work on more maps and fixes and improvements.It's a good solid return to the brilliant setting of Homeworld and I hope BBI continue to add and improve upon it. It's a safe addition to the Homeworld series but I just wish BBI did more with the time they spent on this game, it's good but not as great as it could have been.So, basically. What's great is the story, voice acting, dialogue, music, gameplay, immersive both visually and through its audio and easily replayable either through mastering the harder difficulty of the campaign because the gameplay is so enjoyable or multiplayer to see how cunning other Homeworld fans can be!

												The game is great. At least the campaign is, I almost never play multiplayer in strategy games.Original Homeworld was one of the kind and this is a great prequel to its story. Almost everything is just like I wanted in the game about the expedition that eventually led to Homeworld. Story, dialogue, cutscenes are beatifully done. Graphics are nice - I couldn't believe it is a Unity based game.Gameplay was inspired by Ground Control series which is very good thing in my opinion.The only thing I didn't like that they made a tech guide (basically a lore thing telling about the game world) a paid DLC.I recommend the game to any Homeworld fan who is interested in what happened before the classic game and every strategist who likes Ground Control games.

When sh*t blows up, a small grin shows up on my face.3) The gameplay mechanics are polished, although there are some camera and unit glitches now and then but its really rare. With camera glitches I mean glitches where the camera is shaking uncontrolably because im right on top of a mountain or something and the big carrier sometimes glitches when there is an object underneeth it sending it flying sky high!4) Multiplayer is nice and all but it needs more gamemodes and maps!5) Overall the game is nice and definitely something you should pick up!

Multiplayer is pretty fun too, but skirmish AI needs work. I posted some of my first impressions on the official forums and the devs gave an actual written reply and seem anxious for detailed feedback to help them improve, which is a positive sign for the future development of this game.

												Yes, yes, and more yes. This what all ground RTS's need. Simplified sets of resources, tech-trees, and limited base-building. What real matters is unit posistion, composistion, and the use of the terrain and the characteristics of each category of unit to out-play, and out-gun your enemies. All I can say after all that? Is more units or factions.			"

												Overall, I give Homeworld: DoK a score of 8.5 out of 10.While it may not be a revolutionary RTS, there are some excellent tactical elements to this game that look like it will have some longevity.Before the launch of this game, a lot of people were complaining about the number of maps and units in the game. While it is true that there are not a lot of each, this game has done a good job with adding some depth to standard RTS elements to give what the Homeworld series was originally known for - tactical strategy.The individual units in the game can level up, increasing their power, armor, etc. Research also allows for various special abilities, so the base units in the game can really be customized and used in a variety of ways.The mobile carrier that is your main base is an interesting change to traditional RTS where you have to build stagnant bases. This is where you build your fleet and research, but you can also customize the abilities of the carrier to make it tougher, a repair hub and/or a strong defensive base.I'm only about 1.5 hours into playing the game so far but wanted to give my initial review. Personally, I'll be keeping this game. While it may not be worth a full $50, I got it with the remastered package, so all together they are well worth it.I do hope the game will expand with some additional content in the coming months - more map variety and maybe a few more units couldn't hurt. However, I'll still be happy with this game without it.Honestly, my biggest complaint about the game is the graphics. They're not horrible but they're not great either. They don't feel like an A+ title in 2016 (close-up shots during the cutscenes show gradients realy bad, for example). However, during normal gameplay, the graphics are decent and have a nice feel.Overall, if you enjoy RTS games (especially if you like on-the-go combat) and/or are a fan of the Homeworld series, I would recommend DoK.

Could Deserts of Kharak be any good?Yes.Yes it could be.I don't know about Multiplayer or Skirmish--I don't play Homeworld for that--but this is totally a Homeworld game. All the mechanics that really mattered are here, and, to be honest, they make creative, worthwhile use of the terrain in one of the most innovative ways a developer has ever done.

YouTube™ Video: Homeworld Deserts of Kharak Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 118		

			Homeworld:Deserts of Kharak is a Real time strategy game and the follow up to Homeworld: Remastered which debuted at PAX South in 2015. The game is set as the title suggests in the desert.		

Homeworld:Deserts of Kharak was developed by Blackbird Interactive and published by Gearbox Software. It was released for Steam on January 20th, 2016 for $49.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.Homeworld:Deserts of Kharak is a Real time strategy game and the follow up to Homeworld: Remastered which debuted at PAX South in 2015. The game is set as the title suggests in the desert. You are in control of what can only be described as a “giant aircraft carrier which can move on desert sand”. The campaign is relatively rich in story albeit militaristic and choppy in tone it does manage to capture your attention. The mechanics are somewhat simple and shallow for a full RTS but that adds a meta game element to the potential multiplayer battles.What I enjoyed:Keeping it simple – Deserts of Kharak doesn’t have a ridiculously deep unit type count nor a wide variety of ranges on those unit types. It has three, and each counters one of the others similar to rock, paper, scissors in that none of the three are overall superior. This was initially a bit of a let down but in the aspect of game design it’s a relatively solid strategy. This type of limitation encourages players to think critically without knowing a rich meta-game or end game strategy like other RTS games require.Dune tunes – The audio and music in the game are well done to a point I felt immersed in the desert once I really sunk into the game. The militaristic style of the game isn’t exactly my personal style, but it’s well done in that I was annoyed by the commanders barking orders at me genuinely. The weapon sounds are also well done and not overzealous like RTS games tend to be so ultimately the audio in the game was clearly part of the cohesive design strategy.Real time real issues – The premise of the game towards the beginning is that the desert and it’s storms are taking over a planet. This is a relatively topical theme weather is was intended or not since global climate is such a hot button issue. The other issues that come up in dialogue suggest that the environment is incredibly important and not to be taken for granted. It’s an interesting notion to think what would happen should a planet begin to slowly evolve into a desert.What I disliked:Sandy voices – The voice overs while convincing were speaking in choppy military speak which started to sound less than human. The dialogue really was a bit of an annoyance to me in terms of how it was written and delivered. The voice acting was likely directed in this course but I can’t help but feeling like it was a less than human performance. The multiple five word sentences and unnaturally bureaucratic tone repeating over and over was irritating.Sunburnt AI – The AI enemies in the game don’t tend to make very logical decisions nor seem to play well against humans. This is a complaint I’ve heard from other reviewers in discussions about the game and it leads to a bigger overall issue. The game with poor AI then relies on the player base to enrich it via multiplayer games. I have some issues with any game that can’t stand alone without an internet connection unless it’s design is purely meant to be human vs. human.Homeworld:Deserts of Kharak does have some great moments and fun aspects which are worth taking a look at eventually. I can’t encourage anyone to purchase a game at such a high price point without a better AI or certain multiplayer following. I’d like to think people will see the use of the three unit types as a good limitation of design but ultimately my thoughts are that they will stick with the bigger deeper RTS titles on the market. Relying on us to populate the multiplayer for replay value is a bold choice and forces the mode upon anyone looking to get their full value. I am simply not sure that the game will have enough of a following to garner that sort of multiplayer presence which is a major contributor to my score to wait until the next Steam sale for this one.Score: Wait for a Sale			"

HOMEWORLD: DESERTS OF KHARAK REVIEWAuthor: SHADOWFORKS 19-Jan-2016Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a prequel to Relic’s Homeworld series, developed by Blackbird Interactive.  After dejected in development hell for a good 6 years, the game is finally finished.  This new Homeworld game takes place nearly 100 years before the original.  In which a discovery of deviations in  Kharak, ensue an expedition through the southern deserts.The Homeworld games are scientific, yet grungy.  And it is all used as a behind-the-scenes approach to help tell the story.  Religious warfare is a habituated trait among the dusts of Kharak.  And while an acreage of this plot was interlaced with the original Homeworld’s instruction manual.  Preconceived plot devices have been replaced in favor of concentrated design.  Squabbling races, somber sacrifices, and titanic discoveries all move the plot into a coherent stream, eventually creating a dynamic and unforgettable plot. The animation and art-style are cel-shaded into an arenaceous aesthetic.  Vehicles look weathered and blemished.  And the physics are interlaced to the elevations of the deserts ridges.  Another description would be regarding the scale of your expedition through the secluse wild.  Units look impressive in scope when an abundance of them are present.  And the contrast from appliances, such as Salvagers when compared to the Kalisi, is well designed.The art-style perfectly conceives the atmosphere of the desert planet it’s trying to represent, with a great presence towards the desolation and emptiness of the Kharak landscape.  Seeing dune-buggy’s circle and bounce around their opposition is a satisfying use of physics, and the dust their wheels kick up is a wonderful example of the game’s attention to detail.  Overall this is a truly beautiful game, even on lower end computers.  The music in Deserts of Kharak is persistent in reminding you of the bleak pastels that you’re traversing.  Orchestrating and retaining the astrological concept of the original games, the soundtrack twists it into a symphony, chronicling an excursive crusade fully motivated by the desire to discover.  No longer are the airy drawls of the original homeworld, in it’s place are the searing sounds of low methodical beats.   Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is an RTS, a genre that has been seemingly dormant during recent years.  You can organize attack-squads, call in airstrikes, and control the hulking PC called the Kalisi, as you traverse the seemingly endless sand-dunes and opposing forces you encounter.  The micro-managing of resources and defense of incrusion, is an exercise in choices.  Should I allot development of better units, or should I create more of the same in order to fend off this attack?  Which resource should I harvest, and how many attack units should I leave with them in order to preserve them?  All of these questions contribute to how you will execute your gameplay experience when playing Deserts of Kharak.  It’s all very complicated, but intensely rewarding when you execute a perfect mission leaving no possibility unsecured in a timely manner.With a 15 hour campaign, Deserts of Kharat includes a decently meaty story.  And including a multiplayer mode that has a bevy of replayability value, the value for Deserts of Kharat is impressive.  The game is a worthy successor that takes a step back in all the right places, while including an impressive amount of innovation and character that was not yet seen in the originals.  Gearbox, amidst their incredible resume, helped make a descendant to the cult-classic series, a choice that I hope they will continue to go through with.  I was left wanting more by the end of Deserts of Kharak, not because of brevity, but because it was so satisfying to play.  Every second of the game was the perfect amount of difficulty that made me feeling hopeless one second, only to turn the mission around with one bold choice.  With a great world inhabited by great writing, Deserts of Kharak bares the Homeworld badge proudly.  The new perspective of ground combat is fresh and new, while the aesthetic and ambience increase an already quality RTS series worthiness.  Even if you are new to the series of Homeworld, and similarly unfamiliar with the RTS genre. Deserts of Kharak is a great game for veterans of the Homeworld series, and newcomers alike.  HOMEWORLD: DESERTS OF KHARAK DESERVES A 9/10

												This is a beautifully crafted game!Despite not being in space, it's still very much Homeworld. The sound, interface, the annoying way cutscenes interrupt you when you're busy sparing your fleet from death, the way you need to avoid the final mission objective until you've harvested all resources or you miss out.The desert approach is great, it makes a great atmosphere. The graphics are gorgeous. I got about 1/3rd of the way in on medium and decided it wasn't challenging enough so I restarted the game on hard (""classic"" - which actually was a good level of challenging) and I've spent circa 16 hours (no multiplayer/skirmish).

												Definate feel of the Original spacebound Homeworld games. Though lacking some of the depth in settings. No ability to modify Fleet size in game options... 125 units is one size fits all. Also with only a half dozen maps.... the views are limited. On the up side... the views are AMAZING. Absolutely beaufiful feel of the game and vehicle movements. All the tiny variations in elevations have an in game effect on lines of sight and the weapons that require it.The in game campaing and story line were nicely done and quite entertaining.Ideal patch/update would haveDeathmatchResouce Deposit adjustments (size and frequency)HUGE maps - what's the point of having spectacular landscapes if you can't enjoy themNight time mode or ability to pick time of day for games (one map is set in dusk - definately has room for more optionshere)A must have for Homeworld fans.

												DoK is a very Homeworld game, right down to its gameplay and experience. The only major element that comprises every homeworld game is the compelling storyline. As the storyline is good, I wouldn't say it is great compared  to HW1, HW:C and HW2 (I liked HW2 very much as compared to many people). Also, the feeling of lack of mysticism. Where the feeling of mystery existed in every Homeworld game before this, DoK has a profound lack of mystery surrounding the ancient ships buried in the sand and the artifacts that are collected. The artifacts are just passed off as Carrier Upgrades, and no further explanation or depth is given to them. Also, in HW1, there were many other different factions whom the Kushan encounter, and even mysterious ancient objects that pose a formidable obstacle to your journey. The ending itself feels really rushed and it seems like the devs quickly wrapped it up so it could ship fast instead of expanding the end a little more.I did not quite like the physics of the game as many a time I have seen the entire Kapisi standing with its head up when the immediate area was filled with units. Also, disappointing unit animations. As compared to the original HW, the ballistics can sometimes make no sense at all. I have seen a railgun not firing in the direction of an enemy yet the enemy gets damage. Gameplay itself was fun.A better game than HW1, HW2 or HW:C? Nope but still recommended as the first game for those who are interested in entering the HW universe.			"

												This is a beautifully crafted game!Despite not being in space, it's still very much Homeworld. The sound, interface, the annoying way cutscenes interrupt you when you're busy sparing your fleet from death, the way you need to avoid the final mission objective until you've harvested all resources or you miss out.The desert approach is great, it makes a great atmosphere. The graphics are gorgeous. I got about 1/3rd of the way in on medium and decided it wasn't challenging enough so I restarted the game on hard (""classic"" - which actually was a good level of challenging) and I've spent circa 16 hours (no multiplayer/skirmish).

												Gorgeous art direction, great voice work, and solid call backs to Homeworld. I wish it was longer, because I want so much more! The flexible power allocation for the carrier is an attractive feature and encourages doing more with the command ship than parking it far from the action. Each unit stands out in design and function, I found myself using scout drones, emp cover, artillery barrages and strike craft in coordination with ground assaults. As other have commented it can be annoying to position your units with the proper facing. I prefer a slower combat speed, sometimes whole armies seemed to evaporate in moments. I didn't run into any bugs during my play through. The whole game is a love letter to Homeworld, which is exactly what I was looking for!			"

												DoK is a very Homeworld game, right down to its gameplay and experience. The only major element that comprises every homeworld game is the compelling storyline. As the storyline is good, I wouldn't say it is great compared  to HW1, HW:C and HW2 (I liked HW2 very much as compared to many people). Also, the feeling of lack of mysticism. Where the feeling of mystery existed in every Homeworld game before this, DoK has a profound lack of mystery surrounding the ancient ships buried in the sand and the artifacts that are collected. The artifacts are just passed off as Carrier Upgrades, and no further explanation or depth is given to them. Also, in HW1, there were many other different factions whom the Kushan encounter, and even mysterious ancient objects that pose a formidable obstacle to your journey. The ending itself feels really rushed and it seems like the devs quickly wrapped it up so it could ship fast instead of expanding the end a little more.I did not quite like the physics of the game as many a time I have seen the entire Kapisi standing with its head up when the immediate area was filled with units.

												For what the single player game is, it's fairly good. I wasn't really surprised once I got into the swing of missions, but it did what it set out to be very well. The only major problem I had was in the end with deemphisis on air units that they brought up as a nice power multiplyer.The missions were a nice 30 minute length that ended up feeling like something got done with out feeling like they slogged on. In several missions I was able to snatch victory from near certain defeat by remembering what the mission goal was and pressing for it instead of turning turtle and building up a massive force.			"

												A game that came out of nowhere but that I somehow wanted very badly. H:DK is a little joy of a game, with outstanding visuals, excellent optimisation... And FINALLY a gameplay that doesn't demand an LSD-Red bull mix worth of APM skills.It's not exactly slow paced, but units don't die in two seconds, so you get time to adjust, control formations and positions, use what abilities there are (all straightforward and streamlined like speed boost for fast attack vehicles or smoke screens for tanks) as needed.Despite the apparent lack of variety in units (something I would personally object, as there are roughly 14 units per faction, there being two factions with subtle differences in their lineup), the gameplay has many layers, and the balance of resource gathering / unit construction-research / carrier usage (they're like the Motherships of old, only much more powerful) / artifact retrieval makes for a game where there is always something more to do, optimise or respond to.Finally, I grew up playing Homeworld 1. It was fantastic. This is its prequel, and from the audio design (guns, engines, UI, and especially the radio chatter), the music, the visuals, and the general narrative and atmosphere... I felt at home. It's more of a talented application of the meaning of this franchise onto a new game rather than fan service, and that means a great deal to me.10/10 would grow up playing.			"

												Great little game!I've got two negatives, one is probably something I'm quite alone in thinking, the other is a purely objective observation.Firstly, as a fan of the Homeworld franchise I very much dislike how this is so character focused, and how they made it a prequel. I'd much rather have had a stand alone salvage-huge-spaceship-wrecks-game in the Homeworld universe, keeping some of the original mysterious atmosphere etc. More along the lines of what this seemed to be slated as when it was still Hardware: Shipbreakers. Secondly, it's waaaay too easy, even on the hardest difficulty. I had to stop myself from soaking up all the RU/CUs on the maps because it would simply have made it all even worse. Not to mention if you dare to farm some enemies in one of the missions with endless waves (most of them) to gain XP. Or capture a few enemy cruisers. Just don't do it, else you can pretty much just attack move every mission thereafter to completion.Still, regardless of those points you can't help but enjoy the time it takes to complete the campaign. It feels very reminiscent of Homeworld with some Ground Control thrown in. The S'jet focus takes away from it sometimes, but it still feels pretty grand and special while it lasts. The cut scenes are great for the most part, the action is non-stop, the tech upgrades and units keep on rolling out and the maps are mostly well-designed.As for multiplayer in this one. Mjeeeh, not for me. If you're one to enjoy that aspect, I guess you'll get more hours out of it than me, and so might just get it at full price. Same if the mod scene takes off as that will no doubt add a lot of replay value.			"

												My recommendation?This has been one of the smoothest launching games that i have seen.I have a had a few issues while playing but i think the main cause of those may be in my hardware instead of the game.The graphics on the game are amazing with the detail they went through. Mind you its still thr classic solid cockpit or at least on my graphics settings, but the attention to detail is 10/10. Campaign is good, its 13 missions but it has so many areas you could lead into another campaign which i won't spoil for the potential player.The audio is off the charts, the battle chatter is great to listen to and hearing some of the units spool up as well as launching your LAVS off of a dune with the overdrive hearing that engine rev is great.While i havent gotten on multiplayer yet, the devs have confirmed that there will be more maps and they are also working on more.11/10 would kill genocidal maniacs kiths♥♥♥♥♥again			"

I am not a pro level player at rts games but find them fun and love building armies to fight someone with I have played this game currently to mission 5 and am loving the story the pacing and  tactical view is so cool. now I will say pros and cons  both for this game. + gameplay is amazing and audio and sound design is exceptional. + story and cutscenes are some of the best ive seen in an rts game even the mid mission cutscenes are very interesting. + controls and interface are pretty simple and standard for an rts game. - no rebindable hotkeys and hotkeys are not easy 2 learn for a new homeworld player such as my self.- this is a small gripe of mine but  salvigers do not auto collect near by resources  looking into this online it appears in the old classic homeworld games pressing h will set  them to auto collect this oversite seems like a small negative but its not a big deal.  and can be fixed in a patch. overall this game is amazing and should be played by any rts fan  ps people complaining about 5 maps honestly who cares about map amount in a rts its balance and skill that matters also if anyone wants 2 play some multiplayer for fun message me me on steam as ive yet to se the multiplayer content			"

												Pros:* Deserts of Kharak feels like a Homeworld game even with the y-axis removed from play. The gameplay is solid and the missions are varied.* The story elements lend themselves naturally to building up on origin story for Homeworld. Some people are incredibly over protective of the Homeworld story but this seems to build upon it nicely.Cons:* It's far too short. I think this is an excellently made game but I cannot recommend you pick it up at full price because the campaign is over and done with far too quickly. The missions themselves are diverse but the actual tactical options are a bit limited (although not especially different to homeworlds tactics).* Homeworld succeeded because although you were often facing the same enemy you occasionally had missions with other races and bad guys getting involved (for whom the usual strategies wouldn't work) - unfortunately this game doesn't really break out into new and unexpected opponents.In conclusion:If you are a die hard fan of Homeworld then pick this up but expect to smash through the campaign in about four decent length play sessions. The lack of diversity in your opponents means that you don't really end up changing your tactics which is disappointing compared to previous Homeworld games. If you can wait then I suggest picking this game up at about half its launch price. "

With campaign, haven't done any MP yet.  I like to get the story in before all that. Plays through very well letting you slowly get the handle of all your units and thier specialties.

Gameplay is interesting, a bit different from what we Homeworld fans are used to but that is only because it is a 2D RTs not a 3D but regardless it has a nice feel.Very few units and very limited strategy options due to the lack of options like stances or attack options. AI is rubish and not competitive at all. very liear strategy, predefined and very predictable. You ovewhelm the enemy with bombers while keeping you carrier protected with heavy unit and you win any battle. The AI is not able to change strategy or adapt to different situations.I will give it a positive vote because of the efforts, but the game does not deserve the 49.90 price.			"

That said, after playing the game for 14 hrs I think I may have glimpsed the beautiful graphics only a few times. The max zoom distance is so short it makes me feel clostrophobic when in the regular screen, so I played most of the game on the sensor screen. That is such a waste of good, detailed graphics. :( Couple other gripes... why can ""Esc"" never bring up the game menu in these games? lol Oh and the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! all over the left side every time something is built. I really don't care, I'd rather toggle that off.Lastly I broke the game by destroying everything on Tombs of the Ancients before collecting the artifact and then trying to wait for the boss to spawn to jump em... he never does.

												This is not your typical HomeWorld game. It follows the same ideas, but lacks real depth in terms of tactics. Straight forward game play with about half the game being resource managment and the other half being basic unit managment. Rather dull campaigne story, gameplay is generic after a few missions. Not to exciting or challenging (unless you suck at these kinda games). I felt there was a lack of units throughout the whole game, granted each unit has a specific role which it excells at, there wasnt much diversity. The game lacks the flare of the Homeworld titles, but is still something a fan of the series should play. Overall 7/10.			"

I would have liked to see more about the unity of the planet and building the first ships to get ready to launch into space.Other than that. I really don't have any other things to complain about.

												A ground-based prequel to the classic Homeworld strategy games, this one defies all of the bad reputations prequel games tend to receive. A fantastically detailed and stylized desert warfare game, the gameplay retains many of the Homeworld right-click and hold camera movement and unit tracking. Zooming in lets you see the spinning treads of your wonderful warmachines tearing through sandy dunes and valleys. The cinematics are like paintings rather than the moving sketch art traditionally used but you simply can't ignore the way it sets a beautiful tone. This one won't disappoint Homeworld fans and RTS veterans alike with its array of tactics and clever use of ground-based cover and strategy.			"

												Awesome strategy game with a huge influence taken from the original homeworld series.It keeps you on the edge, has a great story arc, fun unit types and a great design overall.It does, however, still fall short in comparison to the original games... some aspects that bugged me:- The campaign is shorter13 levels in total and a rather abrupt ending with little to no build-up for the final fight. It just sort of ... happens and the credits roll. To be fair though: It really is cinematic and moody, just not entirely on the same level as Homeworld's ""No one's left - Everything's gone - Kharak is burning"" feeling.- No formations | No adjusted movementSo back in Homeworld we could assign different kinds of ships to the same group and had them fly in a specific formation. This would lead to a certain synergy between unit types.In ""Deserts of Kharak"" formations are gone. Also, if you assign different unit types to the same group and order them to move, they each move at their own top speed resulting in your units arriving in battle at different times. That....was not such a good idea...- No real 3D movementDon't get me wrong here: 3D movement is not entirely out of the picture. Using the desert scenario height differences still matter in battle, probably even more than they did in the original games. Units that stand on higher ground are harder to hit and get a bonus on their fighting capabilities. Nice and dandy, I'd just prefer to have real 3D maneuvering where I can tell different fleets to move higher on the y-Axis and then attack down. That's a scenario-issue here though, can't really do that in the desert ;)- No more organized unit stealingRemember those small ships that could latch onto enemy ships and drag them away?Awesome stuff! And... they're gone. You can still convert enemy units as an ability of your main ""hero"" character but that means ""Steal one ship - 1 minute cooldown - Steal another ship - 1 minute cooldown"". It is alright and gets the job done, it just doesn't satisfy that itch of ""making your fleet my fleet"".- Less attention to detailRemember how in Homeworld every docking animation tried to be perfect? You stole a huge a** ship from your enemy and could watch it slowly being dragged to your mothership for docking? Every port opened picture perfect, every ship fitted juuuust through and every maneuver worked to a tee. Stuff like that has become scarce here. Units just drive through your main ship or each other without collision, more often than not they seem to dock by ramming through the hull and dissappear. It just kills the mood from time to time.- DLC. Yeah, we all know it. Let's just leave it at that- Some bugs and crashes I bought this game about a year after its release and I still had some minor issues.Fighter-jets wouldn't return to base, the game crashed during a mission and, my favorite, during the last mission the enemy base-ship as well as mine both exploded simultaneously resulting in a game-over for me with the end-cutscene still playing.It's nothing major but still a little annoying.That's about all the negative stuff I can find about this game.Just check for yourself if these details bug you or not, everything else just plays and feels awesome ;)(Still recommending the Remastered-Collection of the original games though)			"

												Before anything: this isn't a bad game. It's just... not good enough.I actually enjoyed playing through its campaign, but sadly I never really felt the homeworld feeling of the firts two chapters.Drawings are still cool. But that's it.To be more precise, two kind of player will play this game:- those who played Homeworld and/or Homeworld 2- those who didn'tClever, am I not?---------------Anyway, for the latter it's simple: it's not a RTS that you might like, played out of the blue, with no memories about the first two chapters. The few things the plot shows are just as empty as a wall paint plot evolution drying up, if you don't know what those things will become in the future (aka Homeworld 1).---------------For the former... eh.What made great Homeworld 1/2?Pathos, empathy, tactics, epicness. All in a strategic game in an era where only a coulpe of RTS could claim this much.Let's see some of the reasons, with their counterpart in DoK.---------------- That feeling of sad pride. The sacrifice of the Bentusi. That ""The Mothership must survive"" just before the hyperjump. ==> NOTHING relevant happens in DoK. It sould be a prequel. In fact is just as deep as ONE of the story drawings of HW1.- 3D battles, with absolute control over the fleet formation, the attack angles, flanking moves, scouting the void, hiding in nebulas, etc.==> Deserts of Kharak it's a 2D flat map. Some obstacles here and there. No tactical choices. Nearly fixed paths. Paradoxically, the 3D nearly empty maps of HW1/2 felt more elaborated and rich of opportunities.- Impressive number of ways to battle. Bait enemies. Or draw fire and go bomber.  Or Frigate rolling stone, protected by Fighters. Or battlecruisers blast and hyperjump off. Or kamikaze-probes =)==> Assault units vs Railgun, Armored vs Assault, Railgun vs Armored. Stop. Then you get battlecruisers. At that poin sell every small unit aside antiaerial and go battlecruisers: they can rush through the entire campaign by simple autoattack movement.- The option to destroy the subsystems of a capital ship to cripple it before finishing it was a master's touch in the creation of HW2.==> Removed. No subsystems. And I don't mean that ""you can't destroy them"". You cannot even build them. It's all just research. Mandatory research.- Hyperspace tactical jumps. No explainations needed.==> No Hyperspace jumps at all. No explainations needed. And it would be acceptable: I mean, the hyperpace jumps are not jet discovered. But at least some form of tactical movements. Air carriers for quick movement. Something...- An assorted fleet with a spot for every. single. unit. Even the simplest explorer or the Fighter had a solid role in the tactics.==> You get to build the battleships? You can forget of the small veicles. Only keep the ones for antiaerial defense. Go battleships and trample everything. - Capturing. This was one of the pillars of the whole game in Homeworld 1. Still great in Homeworld 2.==> Capturing is just a side effect if a skill that says ""immediately destroy one enemy unit"". Also bad AI that keeps firing to the captured unit, often blasting it apart, while it's being driven to the Carrier for conversion. - Speaking of losses you had to build an assorted fleed, manage it cleverly, and never, ever, let something bigger than a corvette be destroyed. You needed to deploy your best tactics most of the time.==> The final, big, decisive battle? Select your fleet and send it in autoattack in the approximative direction of the target. Done. Thanks. Goodbye. The previuos battles? Select your army and send it in the direction of the objective. You have plenty of resources to win the campaign with that, and plenty of army slots to trample everything with just marginal losses fully refillable.- The immense satisfaction of starting each mission with an undersized army if compared to the enemy, and win by raw tactics and strategy.==> I have NEVER seen more than 3-4 enemy cruisers in the same screen, in DoK. My fleet had 26 of them. And anything smaller got shredded by artillery way before getting in range.- Split your forces. Protect the collectors. Attack the objective. Send units to escort the ally. All while protecting the Mothership!==> Just move your entire fleet, Carrier included along the path, and harvest resources as you pass by them. Also no need to protect the Carrier: it can fend off any attack in normal difficulty with no help from anything. So use fleet to attack, and Carrier / Support Cruiser to harvest.- Research tree. Nothing new even in HW1/2, ok, but still gave the player the chance to define the fleet priorities.==> In DoK might as well remove it. Most upgrade are mandatory story driven. Those who aren't you have plenty of time and resources to research them. And half of them just unlocks in the last 2 missions. When you don't really need anything more to win (in my playthrough the enemy Carrier - the objective of the mission - drifted from its path lured by accident by a collector, got close to my cruisers, and got blasted while I was happily micromanaging the mine-laying-duty on the other side of the fleet).------------------------------Final verdict: I had great hopes. But if you really want to feel the Homeworld you love, just play HW1/2. And if you have never player HW before, play HW1/2. Non-remastered version. Remastered version is still story-beautiful, but the game itsel is somehow way easier.One ""could-have-been-good"" point: gathering artifacts for powering up the Carrier was a good idea, but largely underdeveloped, sadly.As a note: I played the whole campaign in normal difficulty. Some critics regarding ""how hard the game is not"" might not be valid in hard difficulty. This I do not know.Still, if I compare this normal difficulty to HW1/2 normal difficulty, the gap is huge. DoK is really, really too easy.			"

												If you are a Homeworld fan, go buy it. I read that many times as well before I actually bought it. It's indeed worth it. From space to deserts is a nice change and the devs have implemented a beautiful environment, again with a great soundtrack that combines with the desert setting perfectly. Add names such as Soban, Sajuuk and the longing for the Homeworld is re-ignited.I play the Mac port on a last-year-high end iMac. The graphical settings are at second top, but it brings my iMac to its knees. It is very beautiful and requires a lot of GPU power. I had some crashes in-game (all of a sudden I am on the desktop, app vanished), this might be due to the fact that I set graphical quality to high, instead of low as recommended - I will have to check that.The GUi is actually quite nice and feels more like the old HW2 one than that crappy new GUI in the remastered HW.

												as a guy who cries of joy when i play through the Homeworld series. I enjoyed the story of Kharak. And another piece of the puzzle in the homeworld universe is complete for me. Good written story, great voiceacting, great graphics. Only cons i have are the AI's lack of intelligence and some minor bugs wich makes your carrier fly sometimes. Always seem to land on its track though. :DFor me it lasted 7 hours. Gonna try some onlineplay tomorrow. :)			"

												At first, I wasn't going to pick this title up, I was thinking ""what kind of a Homeworld game would it be without space-ships?""Boy, I'm glad I did.  Does justice to the old Homeworld games to a T, Blackbird really nailed this one.  From the art style, to the twitchy fast paced combat, this is very fun.  It's actually faster-paced than the space based Homeworld originals, which I like.It's a solid 8-9/10 addition to the RTS genre, a genre that doesn't get nearly enough love.  My only real ""complaints"", which aren't actually complaints, is that there's no base building and the map panning commands are still the arrow keys instead of WASD (easily fixed, I know :P)If you're an RTS fan, this game is a no brainer			"

												Ok, so quick summary after a couple hours of multiplayer.The game is clearly homeworld. It plays like a proper sequel, and not a generic RTS with ""Homeworld"" tacked on.In true homeworld style, every unit is unique and satisfying. You feel every loss and celebrate every enemy you turn into a flaming wreck. The land based gameplay adds a refreshing layer of depth to the series, with physical obstacles being more of a consideration (IMHO) than the z-axis movement of the original games. Similarily, while the unit pool is perhaps a bit smaller, the option of having land or air based units gives players a bit more to consider when choosing a research and build path.Lastly, the artifact retrieval mode rules. The game has some minor setbacks, but nothing that wasn't present in the original games.			"

Two games on easy the first I win because after the first attack they never really came after me again.  The second game still on easy I get rushed in the first few minutes before I can even establish myself and after the first game I got a good feel for what to do... or so I thought.  It seems the AI could use some work and I waited and waited and it never happened.  And I wish Steams ranking system was a little better because it is.. was fun... but needs work.  So I am left with giving it a big 0 because I can't give it 100% and can't rank it somewhere inbetween.			"

												I played this game before.  It was fantastic, with a great story, interesting characters, amazing graphics and well executed unit design.  It was called ""Ground Control"". This is not that game.  This game is a poor imitator that rips off the unit design, factions and plot points from that game.  Then it tries to shoehorn in the plot of the original ""Homeworld"" game, and I mean literally the same exact story with plot points filled in from the stolen ""Ground Control"" story.  It plays like any old RTS game with nothing new or innovative.  It bears all the hallmarks of a game that ran out of funding, forcing the developers to scramble to salvage what they had into a marketable product.  The way they refer to units like their spacefaring counterparts seemed out of place and uninspired.  Even more of a slap in the face by the developers was the fact that the levels were exactly the same as ""Homeworld"" (with the difference being that they are on the ground instead of space).  We were all hoping for a third ""Homeworld"" game, but this is not that game and I doubt any of us would want to play it if this is the effort the developers are willing to put into it.			"

Should be able to build structures in Skirmish mode at least.- modding support, downloading through steam workshop.Otherwise a great game! I have recomended it. "

												Overall: a positive review. Some points that I would change if i were Blackbird Interactive but any game that wants to keep the Homeworld legend going gets a thumbs up from me.Positives:- The story is really good. You really feel like you are working towards the survival of your people and you do get emotionally invested when you lose your units.- Graphics look great and run well on my ultra HD monitor in max settings- It is Homeworld! Even the unit icons look the same- Controls are relatively easy- Cutscenes are superb. The artistic effects are top notch.- Story follows the Homeworld storyline perfectly and I love the references to things you learnt in Homeworld 1 and 2. Negatives- Dont buy the expedition guide. There is so little information in there that it is definitely not worth buying. In fact I cannot understand how it comes to 600MB. Perhaps I am missing a huge part or I am going blind but £5~ is a lot of money for something that would cost a couple of pennies as a piece of paper.- Units could have a lot more variety. Hopefully they will patch in more at a later date.- This is based in the Homeworld universe but isn't Homeworld. I miss having multiple carriers creating a fleet of ships. In this you have one command ship that makes things and that is it.- Fleet sizes are a fraction of the size of in Homeworld the original. I remember making fleets of hundreds or thousands of ships (yes the lag was awful) and then fighting the enemy, In this game the fleets are only tens or at max a hundred.OverallIt's Homeworld so buy it. The more people that buy it, the more chance of Homeworld 3.			"

Yes I was skeptical when they said Homeworld Ground base RTS - but after buying it, I'm pleasantly surprised with no regrets about my purchase. Yes, the campaign was a little short. But I'm looking forward to more story DLC if it's possible - I really hope they don't give up on this title. I would have brought this game earlier had I actually seen marketing for it before it was release. Didn't find this gem till a few days before release date.Multiplayer is a ghost town, absolutely no one :/ The Comm-chatter between units in the game is amazing. Graphics are Awesome, if you can run this on max settings - the unit destruction is pretty to look it. Overall I recommend this game for a good story ☺️			"

												The game is a good return to the homeworld franchise. Although with a faster pace than its predecessors, is a somewhat enjoyable experience. Having mentioned its length, it is a point that prevented this game scoring further success, the campaign ends at the point you are actually engaged in the storyline, should they added a couple more missions, the impression would have been much better.Some bugs also hinders the user experience, but not to the point of a dealbreaker.The good:A breath of fresh air into RTS genre, with very dynamic combat experienceAtmospheric soundtrack, it builds the tension and carries the thrill of battleOriginal art and design concepts, really brings you to another universeProfessionally written storylineThe bad:Randomness of some minor bugsCampaing is too short to actually enjoy the universe it is set uponSecondary objectives are rather repetitive			"

												Since I haven't played enough multiplayer to really comment on multiplayer balancing, this would mainly be a review for single player campaign.The campaign itself is wonderfully done with the right combination of story and visual story telling. Story is being told actively as you play the game, and the pace at which the game unfolds new features in the campaign allows the player to pick up what to do with different units very naturally. Story integrates itself well to the original Homeworld universe, and suble hints suggest that this conflict behind the Desert of Kharak campaign does not invole any clear ""villain"" or the ""good-guy"", but a society torn between progressivist and conservative at a time of hardship on a planet going through major climate change. If you require the story to be told in your face with everything blatantly obvious, you would probably not enjoy the story of Desert of Kharak. However, if you enjoy picking up subtle hints and plot pieces spread throughout the game's campaign, you'll enjoy playing through this game.As for the aesthetics and presentation of the game, it inherits a lot of the visual and atomospher of the original Homeworld series. The designs are very minimal yet cleanly done, and if you were a fan of the original series (or a fan of the more realistic Scifi design), it'll most likely please you. Voice acting is also done in a natural manner instead of the over-the-top method you would find in lot of the other games. However, this is not without it's cons. Although the game put heavy emphasis on terrain utilization, it's sometimes difficult to visually decipher which grounds offer to terrain advantage until your units are physically interacting with the terrain. Since the difficulty level of the campaign is not too high this is not a major set back, but I wonder if this issue would be addressed in the future patch.Overall, the game offer a lot of promise, and I'm sure a lot of the kinks would be worked out in the near future. I highly recommend this game to the fans of the original Homeworld series as well as fans of RTS. Those who enjoyed games like Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander would definitely enjoy this game.			"

												This game has the unique distinction of being the first RTS I've played (or any other game I can think of) that has your units continue to fight/be attacked during cutscenes while you can't control them. For a game that is so micro dependent I can't imagine how anyone thought it was a good idea.Overall the campaign story is good but there are some weird balance issues (enemy doesn't really do air defence unless it's part of the plot) and the cutscenes tend to be pretty jarring when you accidentally trigger them every few minutes, especially considering the combat keeps going.

Bringing the immersive gameplay just like I was there in the deserts of Kharak. And the Expedition Guide was definitely the best eBook I've ever read. The character intros, the storytellings, the 3D viewers, the galleries, the films, the dev logs, totally fantastic! I'm really glad the Homeworld title was brought back to the hands of its original creators. Every effort focusing on the details made the game so distinctive and so touching. I think it's a good start for Blackbird Interactive and I'm eagerly hoping they could bring more and more fascinating contents in the future.			"

												Short version:  It's a new Homeworld; if you liked the old ones or have been wanting to try a homeworld this is a good place to start.  If you're not a homeworld fan(or looking to get into homeworld), and you're just looking for a good RTS then your mileage may vary based on what you have previously liked in the RTS genre.  Long version:  Deserts of Kharak does well what every homeworld game has done before it - tell a story.  It's an exceedingly rare experience for an RTS to tell a story well, for you to care about what happens to the characters, for you to get emotionally invovled, and to be able to tell that story actively through the tiny units and voice-overs on the screen.  Gameplay is solid; each unit has a defined role that it excels in.  Exploiting unit's weaknesses and strengths is extremely satisfying when you're the one delivering, and appropraitely punshing if you're on the receiving end.  It's not so overpowered that you can simply overwhelm your oppoenent if they make a wrong move, but not so underpowered that it leaves you wondering if you actually have the upper hand.  Tactics (high ground, terrain blocking) and LOS make noticeable impact on gameplay as well, and this is a welcome addition.  It shakes up the standard rocks-paper-scissors gameplay enough to make every engagement interesting, and so that even a mismatched fight can be turned towards your favor. A side-note on gameplay; I've seen a lot of criticism of this game because it doesn't live up to standards set by games like starcraft.  I found this criticism generally unfair because the comparisions drawn I find unapplicable.  I think this game most resembles a cross between company of heroes and total annihiliation/ supreme commander.  Homeworld to Starcraft is like a BMW to a Ford.  They are both a car, they basically do the same thing, but that's about where the similarities end.  But I digress, moving on. . . AI and MP:  There's no nice way to put this but the AI is lacking in it's current state.  I played the campaign on the equivalent of medium, and at no point did I feel threatened or like I was going to lose.  MP is region locked which is stupid since there's a lobby system in place; it should have been simple to just add a ping and let players make their own decisions.  Also, there's only 5 maps to chose from when playing MP or skirmish.  These things are not a big deal to me (except the region lock), but that's probably because I played company of heroes competatively back in the day and there were only 5 maps I played on back then (1v1 automatch), and I only plan on playing Deserts competatively.  That being said, I still see these things as significant problems.  RTS's thrive on healthy skirmishs and a solid AI (or a solid competative community), and good maps help make both those things happen.  BBI has said, as of the writing of this review, that they are working on the AI and they plan on releasing more maps.  They have also said that maps will always be free and never DLC.  They have not commented on the region lock to my knowlege.  So is it worth $50?  As I said at the beginning, your mileage will vary based on what you like in your RTS genre.  If you're looking for a RTS you can play by yourself and be entertained with for a long time (e.g. AoE, RoN), I would say not in its current state.  Give it a patch or two; see if the skirmish state improves.  If you're looking for a good story with potentially competative MP, then I would say yes.   "

												This game is a gem, but it is not without it's flaws.The game is gorgeous and well thought out.  The landscapes and cut scenes are worthy of the homeworld franchise.  The game play is fast paced and brutal.  Tactics being your friend and hesitation your death.I beat this game it about a week of on and off play.  I played the first few missions on the hardest setting and the rest at ""classic"".  many other people think this game needs the ability to pause the game and perform orders.  The developers have put forth that they did not include this feature because it breaks immersion and takes away from the desperation the missions in Deserts of Kharak have you play through.Personally I think it's ridiculous the developers try to defend the idea of not having any sort of ""real"" pause feature auto-included in an RTS game (as anyone who has played previous titles in this franchise will know that such a feature is not only necessary; but really cool as you actually get time to enjoy the visuals which are a hall mark of Homeworld).  Currently the only way to ""pause"" the game is the main menu screen.  This does not breeak the game but is disappointing; and honestly will prevent me from playing thorugh the campaign again as half of what goes on is understandably simply ""missed"" by the player in the chaos.Still I would readily recommend this title to anyone who enjoys RTS game play, and cross your fingers that the devs atleast implement an honest pause feature (even if they do not allow you to give orders cretae CTRL gorups etc).

												HW: DOK is as I had expected. I really like many aspects of this game, including the persistence of units (so they follow you from map to map), unit experience, the ""sandbox"" mode (and with all that sand, it really is a sandbox!) Also the voice acting is fantastic. Try to notice the smalltalk that you can hear as a background ambient sound effect. Some of it is funny and really adds a nice touch to the game. I also like the ""realism"" since all units have a well defined purpose and a sense of unity binds all of your units together. The art direction is top-notch. So overall, it's a fantastic game and I would highly recommend it. I would've liked to have a pause mode, letting you pause the game and issue orders. Also there are little things that might be improved in future patches but again, overall, this is a must for RTS, sci-fi fans and makes for an engaging and beautiful, classic game of the genre! Bravo to BBI!			"

												Right, so gonna make this quick, yes I do love the homeworld series, and it does color my judgment somewhat, but none the less, I'll try to be as honest as possible. So here are my Pros, Cons and MiscPros:-Decent looking graphics-Has the homeworld feeling to it(Even though it is a 2D unit control)-Every unit feels useful(Yes some strategy games do have virtually usless units like in CoH)-Great sense of Scale-Interesting level of use of terrain for units-An okay campaign with a nice homeworld feel to it(The long trek feel)-Units gain promotions and utility so keep them alive-Not a twitch strategy game-Awesome soundtrack that feels it belongs here(Unlike some! *Stares down Act Of Aggression*)Cons:-AI is dumb(Really a shame because I see much potential here.)-AI in skirmish cheats but is still stupid...(Yeah so basically it's gonna be pumping ressources like a mofo and then not using them...)-Game breaking bugs in the campaign(Had none yet, but had a friend and a few people that I know that had some)-Only five MP maps(This kinda goes without saying WTF?! Only five?!)-Somewhat a limited unit selection(But atleast they're all useful)-No keybinds(Wtf? Seriously?)Misc:-Occasional funny graphical glitches (Rachel S'jet's baserunner bouncing around like a rubber ball, AAV rolling on its side  and LAV rolling on its roof... The list kind of goes on)-Has a mixed feeling between dune and Mad Max-IGN says not enough water-So much sand... OH LOOK A ROCK! More sand... OH LOOK A SHIP!-Rachel talks about studying the ships and everything then finally just blows the crap outta everything.-DON'T TOUCH ME YOU ZEALOT!-Minor Inconsistencies with the lore.Final word:I honestly recommend this game for those who enjoyed homeworld and for those who enjoy a slow paced RTS. Though I admit it's not going to get a Game of the Year award(Hardly any award actually), it is a breath of fresh air in this ocean full of games, though lacking in the RTS section recently... I hope that BBI and/or Gearbox addresses the issue for not bindable keys and the lack of maps. Because this game is honestly a beatiful but rough diamond in the sands of Kharak.			"

												Short version:  It's a new Homeworld; if you liked the old ones or have been wanting to try a homeworld this is a good place to start.  If you're not a homeworld fan(or looking to get into homeworld), and you're just looking for a good RTS then your mileage may vary based on what you have previously liked in the RTS genre.  Long version:  Deserts of Kharak does well what every homeworld game has done before it - tell a story.  It's an exceedingly rare experience for an RTS to tell a story well, for you to care about what happens to the characters, for you to get emotionally invovled, and to be able to tell that story actively through the tiny units and voice-overs on the screen.  Gameplay is solid; each unit has a defined role that it excels in.  Exploiting unit's weaknesses and strengths is extremely satisfying when you're the one delivering, and appropraitely punshing if you're on the receiving end.  It's not so overpowered that you can simply overwhelm your oppoenent if they make a wrong move, but not so underpowered that it leaves you wondering if you actually have the upper hand.  Tactics (high ground, terrain blocking) and LOS make noticeable impact on gameplay as well, and this is a welcome addition.

												At first I thought I would end up bored by what seemed like a paucity of units and a desert enviornment. I mean how exciting can it be to fight in a desert? After playing 4 missions in the campaign I'm happy to say I'm pleased and hours went by without me realising it. The campaign keeps you on your toes and at least for me didn't allow me to camp too long and build my forces up to an overwhelming level. How you use light and heavy units becomes important as they all have strengths and weak points. Example: a pack of ranged railguns annhilated my swarm of light attack craft from high ground before they reached effective range. I'd like to see more maps for skirmish and multiplayer and hopefully some new units if possible. I loved homeworld and it's sequels and this ties in nicely as a prequel. In my opinion it's worth the money.			"

												This game was very well done and I enjoyed every minute of it. Now with that being said, I am a Die Hard HW1/2 fan who has play this series from day one and wouldn't miss a thing, but I have the capability to determine a steaming pile of crap. This game was never meant to be an exact replica of 1 or 2 and I knew that they were trying a new form of play. The formula was not completely there unfortunately. I feel it lack some of the luster it should have had and feel that there should have been more in the way of ships and their design. It is a start to a new company and I feel there will be growing pains, but in due time everything will be set right. 8/10 Will Play Again. "

												It's very difficult for a modern game to be as innovative as the original homeworld.This game, I would say, isn't innovative at all. For fans of homeworld though, I would recommend this game. There are a few caveats, though.1. Controls are not rebindable.2. For a game that depends on terrain placement, one has to individually place each unit. With older homeworld games there was formation control, with this one, the controls are point and click. It's streamlined in a lot of ways, and this detracts from the overall experience.But the major successes are that this game lives and breathes the homeworld universe. They essentially took every bit of lore from the 1999 manual to the cataclysm game, and fleshed it out completely. The multiplayer maps are a bit thin at the moment, but they've promised that more maps are coming with future updates.Launch Day bugs are very minor. Occasionally an enemy won't attack your position as expected. It's trivial to just go get them, or hit them with airstrikes. Overall, as someone who loves the homeworld universe, I loved this game.If you like the homeworld universe, you'll love it too. You'll be slightly disappointed that it lacks some of the features of previous games, but you'll still have fun. So with a few caveats, I absolutely recommend this game, and hope for more and better from Gearbox in the future.			"

												I love his game, it has so much character, the sound design is awesome, from the soundtrack to the voice coms of your units, this is how a game should be done, it has a VERY Battlestar galactica (New Series) feel to it albiet sand based. UI is clean and uncluttered, unit control is simple and the tactical map is genius. The storyline is also really engaging although again feels like the writers were lending a little of the BSG vibe, it only actually lasts around 12 hours but it was a great play through.I'm playing it on max difficulty and at that level presents a decent challenge, to prevent it from being the cake walk some have suggested it to be, at least for my skill level. If the idea of a great looking, great sounding RTS game with a unique setting and superb story sounds good to you, and bonus if you're a BSG fan grab this game, especially when on sale. One of my favourite RTS.			"

I really like the format of the cinematics.Multiplayer is challenging, much in the same way that Homeworld I & II were (your command centre moves). This time your command centre's stats are changeable on-the-go, which makes it both harder to manage and harder to take down.This is truly the Homeworld sequel that any fan of the original was waiting for. Would reccommend for anyone who enjoyed the original or like challending RTS. Great at LAN parties too!			"

												The general mechanics at work here are really nice, and the campaign is a real blast to play. There's just about enough units to keep it interesting, and it's just about long enough as a campaign that I don't feel cheated at the sale price of £10.19. Visually it's nice but it stutters at a regular interval, which is weird considering I'm on a 1080 and have no such issues in any other game. Can't speak to the story as I've never played a Homeworld game before and it was of no interest, so I ignored it. The glimpses I caught didn't impress, mind.The CPU AI players in skirmish mode are either absolutely dreadful or cheat, so there's very little replayability there, and there's not much of an online community it seems. So at full price, this seems a very raw deal, as while the campaign is good, it's not £29.99 good, and is pretty much the only aspect worth paying for given the skirmish/multiplayer issues.Overall the campaign in and of itself *is* good fun so that's why I'm recommending it.

												A tried and true follow-up to the classic Homeworld series, HW:DoK is fun but doesn't entirely re-invent the RTS wheel. It plays like a mix of Supreme Commander and - dare I say it - C&C4 with the mobile bases (except you don't have to deploy every flipping time to release your units from the production buildings). The story is classic HW-style emotional and has a clear Middle Eastern / South Asian influence. The DLC's do little to add to the variety but that makes up for the variety of units. Overall, a must-buy for Homeworld fans.			"

												Great from a fluff standpoint with a 90's rts playstyle. Gameplay is tedious unfortunately and outplaying the ai is irrelevant because it will just spawn entire new units from thin air until the primary objective is met. Overall well worth buying however, especially on sale. The multiplayer ai is vastly more aggressive than the storyline ai strangely.  Musically and graphically its very well done aside from being forced to watch all the cutscenes with no way to bypass them, even on the 50th playthrough. If its on sale, buy it. If not, wait until it is and then buy it.			"

												Homeworld DofK is a masterpiece, it is everything homeworld is but on land, and quite honesly as much as I love the original I like this one so much more. My7 only complaint is that there needs to be more of it, its satisfying as a 30 buck game or on a steam sale, but after playing the campaign you just want more of it. This game would have earned perfect marks if it had a level editor where the community could create more multiplayer maps or new campaigns for the other factions.			"

												A faithful recreation for a new generation of Homeworld fans. Brings the same importance of 3d positioning without the hassle of 3Dspace. Gameplay feel's a lot like those old RTSs you don't see anymore: Red Alert, Dune, etc. Graphics are beautiful, and of course the Homeworld vibe is incredible.The story is well written and executed, mostly through cutscenes and animations.Multiplayer/Skirmish is fun, low map choices but Artifact Retrieval (Capture the Flag) is even challeging in skirmish mode if u dont want to go online.

												Great game in the Homeworld style. A little on the short side (also like the original games).It is a bit buggy though, in the campaign. There have been a few times where I have beaten the script to the punch and then I cannot trigger the next part of the script to start. Sometimes this can be fixed with a save and reload, but other times I have lost 40 minutes on a mission which has to be completely restarted. Nice graphics and presentation. Interesting, if formulaic (for this franchise) story.			"

												I'm big fan of Homeworld games so I have to play this one. It's prequel to first Homeworld (history of this game is mention in opening cutscenes of Homeworld 1). Graphics is amazing. Music is super (again). Gameplay well it's space tactic Homeworld transfer to the surface of desert planet. The only minus is lack of active pause (would be to easy with it?). That's why You can name it rts now but without base building. Game is standard long (like previous ones). I didn't play multiplayer only few skirmishes with AI so can't say anything about it. I played this game to finish single player campaign. I was really pleased. Just after this one I played again Homeworld 1 & 2 (Remastered version this time).			"

Managing formations of the groups for example is a nightmare, you can manually organise the units while on stop, but if you order an advance all becomes a huge mess by the different speeds. Another things that annoys me is the Skirmish standard ""build quickly and attack quickly"" strategy, I would expect a proper strategy game to do not reward this as when it works it flattens out the game, but that is recurrent in RTSs.

												Deserts of Kharak really brings me back to Homeworld -- the look, the sound/music, and the story are all great. There are a few points that are kind of iffy, though:- Playing it is a little bit of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The regular camera doesn't zoom out as much as you'd like, control groups are a little wacky, unit formations can be suicidal, and so on. - The story is pretty short. Eight or nine hours on normal difficulty. There's skirmish and multiplayer, but the skirmish AI is not very challenging and I'm not really interested in multiplayer. - There's really not a ton of variety in the way that missions play out. Sometimes you have to collect an artifact or place some turrets, but basically a couple big control groups attack-moving will carry you through the game.- No unit variety between factions that I could see. Obviously they look different, but each of the two factions share the few basic unit types. The DLC factions are really minimal reskins of the two standard factions -- don't bother.With that said, for $25 I feel like I got my money's worth, but at the regular price of $50 I'd feel kind of ripped off. In general, it's just how I like RTSes -- a little more sweeping and ""arty"" than StarCraft, not too much boring macro (Planetary Annhilation), and the great Homeworld feel. I just wish it had more and more varied missions.			"

How about explaining clearly before purchase that the SOBAN  DLC can only be used in skirmish or multiplayer ? Finding out after you purchase it just pisses people off...			"

												These thoughts are regarding the campaign.I get terribly stressed out playing RTS, and so I play them all on the easiest difficulty and mostly for the atmosphere and story. This game has both of it. The desert is looking gorgeous and the story is subtle and compelling. The campaign gives you a sense of discovery and adventure. You get to keep your units between missions and see them level up, gaining many times the power it had when it was a rookie. You get a feeling of responsibility towards the survival of said units, and I've reloaded a save game many times in order to save a unit from getting destroyed.Otherwise the mechanics of the game are pretty straight forward. It's a case of stone-rock-scissors, even up in the tiers of units. You gather resources and spend them on new units (up to a unit cap that increases during the campaign) and on research which is done from the carrier which acts as your mobile base.For the atmosphere and story I thoroughly recommend this game. I can't speak for the challenge, seeing that I played the game on easy.			"

												One of the only Games I ever pre-ordered. A solid entry for the Homeworld series.  You'll see a whole bunch of niggles by people in the reviews and comments, but by and large these are fairly minor issues. I myself would feel it desperately needs a ""pause and give orders option"" which was present in all the other games, However I wouldn't give it a negative review simply for that, (although it is pretty bad in my eyes).The biggest drawback is that its really been set-up as a multiplayer game, kinda like a tournament type, which when you consider the pedigree of Gearbox, isn't all that surprising. And you cant really blame Gearbox as MP seems to be where young gamers are these days and thus so is the money.  For me the emphasis has been on a thoughtful, singleplayer game you can take your time with. A result of this is that most of the sides are somewhat bland and homogeneous, (equal), and there is little differentiation between the opposing sides units.  Assymetric warfare, this is not. Practical Upshot:  If Multiplayer is your thing, you'll prob really enjoy this.  If you want a deep thoughtful RTS, you may want to think twice about this, unless its on sale.  It's not bad, but depth and ability to take your time, (away from a frantic MP pace), is not its strong point.  The Original HW games were far better at that.It is fun though, and definitely has all the flavour and feel of the original HW games.			"

And I expected that strategy game has the ""classical RTS"" concept, like the Command and Conquer.So far I have played four missions but I can see to my expectations are well met. This game is a combination of C&C and Ground Control. Tactical gameplay (not detailed to death, but enough to enjoy), fast-paced combat and unit building, atmospheric maps (Dune themed, but no sand worms here), and very stylish graphics and sound effects.Well done developers! If you want a good oldie gameplay style RTS, this is your game.			"

												While this is a prequel to the Homeworld games, I decided to play this first, and I was never lost or feeling left out. Even if this would be your first Homeworld game, go ahead and give it a shot!Deserts of Kharak is a game with very interesting pacing. Units turn and move quite slowly overall, and many ranged attacks take a while to land, but a combination of strong counters and powerful area of effect weapons means that once a battle starts it's often over very quickly, one way or another. The significant impact of terrain elevation on damage and your units' ability to see their targets is very easy to overlook, but beware: it really matters.Sometimes this all means one or two wrong choices will cripple your entire operation in seconds, but on the plus side you also have time to break off attacks, and your decisions really do matter - going into the same fight with a different mix of units and tactics can make a dramatic difference. The story is compelling if simple, and has a great mystical undertone that reminds me of Battlestar Galactica. The game is also beautiful - seriously, I don't think video game deserts have ever looked this good. Weapons fire satisfyingly, weather and sand effects are convincing, and the architectural and vehicle style is cohesive and immersive. The units are a bit visually indistinct at playable distances, but if you're managing hotkey groups actively it shouldn't be such a big deal.My main complaint with the game is the way it handles zooming and the visual (small-scale, pretty) versus tactical (large-scale, abstract) maps. Rather than smoothly transitioning between the two, there's a key transition, and moving from the tactical to the visual map often results in the camera ending up somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Double-clicking zooms you from the tactical map to a specific spot on the visual map, unless you’re double-clicking on a unit, but the camera angles often end up skewed away from whatever you had set it to before, and the camera is often zoomed too close to the ground as well.Oh, and couldn't the Escape key bring up the damned menu? You'd think.Aside from some interface frustrations, though, this is a great RTS game, suitably challenging and with great aesthetic and style. I highly recommend everyone interested try it out.			"

												This game turned out much better than I had expected.  The two factions feel very different and offer just enough variety to multiple play styles with both factions.  The story is a bit baffling for me, and also a bit frustrating (I want my Nabaal laser weapons!), but it remains compelling if one overlooks the retcons.  Oh, Sajuuk.  You need to be less places.

												I had a fun time playing the single player campaign!PROS:- Visuals and effects are nice.- Sound and radio chatter put you in the mood.- Great if you like RTS genre but is short of options lately. - Most missions have tense moments and major battles, but still you have plenty time to plan and to have fun with your armada.CONS:- Some pathfinding issues and stuff like that.- The campaign feels somewhat incomplete, but it`s OK as it is. - Some units feel unbalanced or useless (maybe it`s a matter of playing styles?).

												I am a huge fan of the original homeworld series, 1, 2 and Cataclysm. So when Homeworld remastered got released last year, I spent a huge amount of time working my way through the missions and the skirmish mode. When I found out that Shipbreakers wasn't far off I took the decision to stop playing and move onto something else , and a day after it was released as Deserts of Kharak I have already completed the games campaign in the easy mode. So what does this game have to offer?If you are a fan of the RTS games like C&C or Supreme Commander then this is a must for you, even if you didnt like the original homeworld games. The ground orientated combat is merged seemlessly with homeworlds ambiance and storytelling as you guide an expidition though the war torn banded desert on the hunt for an artifact that will save your race.Yup - you guessed it if you didnt already know, this is a prequel and you ultimatley find the Khar-Toba, which would lead onto the Guidestone, and onto Homeworld 1...What doesnt this game have?Well, I'd like to say a long story, its only 13 missions long which was a bit of a disapointment, i would have liked to have played a bit longer.Also the game seems to end each mission very quickly not allowing you to harvest the local resources and find artifacts that remain. Surely a mission like this, that would be a key focus. Similar to homeworld 1.Also there are only a handful of skirmish maps, so I am hoping the developers release some FREE DLC soon with added maps, maybe some of the missions converted into skirmish maps as each mission map was excellently crafted. All-in-all this for homeworld fans and other RTS fans alike, this game is a must. But remember if like me you have an older system to turn the graphics down before you launch into the campaign as its difficult to change the settings unless if you use the main menu options pannel. There is one mission in particular that is a graphics hog.So why did i metion that I stopped playing the remastered games? I had a feeling that the last scene in the last mission would get me wanting to play the other games again.And I wasnt dissapointed when I heard something familiar in the last cutscene. Im looking forward to playing homeworld 1 again after this. And I hope we see more new homeworld coming soon!			"

												If you liked Homeworld, you need to buy this. Note I said need, not should. You need oxygen, you need water, and trust me, you need this game. During the last scene in the campaign I literally had goosebumps as the antagonist verbally and oh-so assuringly pointed out the obvious. Which, dispite having come to the conclusion long before, really triggered a slew of emotions few games, if any, have evoked. You owe it to yourself to experience this.			"

												Not a perfect game by any means, but pretty enough looking and sounding to add a sort of aesthetic enjoyment in playing, and the strategy genre is few and far between nowadays. The music, artwork and scenery are genuinly enjoyable, and the story is passable enough to string it all together. The campaign is fairly short, but to be honest if you're like me and don't have too long to sink into a game its a decent enough length.Its hard to describe why I wouldn't call this game great, despite it having hints of greatness. The camera can be hard to get just right - its always close enough to work, but never quite comfortable. I often wanted to zoom out slightly more than allowed, meaning I spent half the game in the strategic overview map view, clicking on little icons when I really wanted to be seeing the action in all its visual glory. Theres no mini map, so you will often find yourself feeling slightly out of the loop.I haven't delved into the multiplayer too much yet, but after a couple of skirmishes the mechanics strike me as averagely good for online play - its the sort of thing I imagine playing with some friends a few times then dropping, as opposed to getting competitive like company of heroes or one of the other big strategy titles.  Overall - 7/10, pick up on sale and enjoy, and try to enjoy the atmosphere throughout the relatively short ride.			"

												The only issue I have with this game is that the campaign becomes much too easy once  the Kapisi gets power available for use. As soon as it becomes weapons capable, unlike other Homeworld games, the Mothership itself becomes the strongest weapon in the fleet (With the exception of possibly Homeworld Cataclysm).   Fleet composition and maintenance become less and less important as the massive amount of units sent at you must be dealt with greater and greater force which is why I did not find that aspect of the game satisfying.Other than that, the game mechanics are fairly straightforward and function well: the rock paper scissors style of combat with LAS, Armor and Rails make battle easy to learn, but harder to master once you can mix it up with cruisers and other support. A good game and worth what I paid for it.			"

												Homeworld:Deserts of Kharak, continues the tradition of what is not even contestable as being the first RTS environment. Homeworld and Homeworld 2 brought about an era of game play that has inspired hundreds of games such as Eve Online. A dedicated HW fan is able to see the connections.""Mothership.""Homeworld 2 : Eye of Aaran that cannot be traveled through.Eve Online : The Eve Gate collapsed trapping explorers in New Eden.Homeworld 2: Both S'jet and Maakan were isolate from the rest of the crew in vat tanks surrounded by embryonic fluid.Eve Online : Pilots are contained in ""Egg Shaped"" pods containing fluidHomeworld 2: There is a an ""Easter Egg"" that is part of the models but is never used.Homeworld 2: S'jet and Maakan are attached to each ship controlling its functions via implants.Eve Online : Pilots controll the ship functions surrounded by crew using implants. Homeworld : Deserts of Kharak : The Kushans begin to build great ships that will take them on a search for Hiigara using the Guidestone.Eve Online : Recently the Dev's of Eve Online has discussed introducing Exoplanet searches of finding something new that revolves around a lead female scientist being the instructor just like Rachel and Karan S'JetIt's obvious the comparissons are there and that the Homeworld series of RTS is the Hyperspace Core for Eve Online.

												Deserts of Kharak has most of the elements that make a great sci-fi RTS, but it comes together a bit clumsily in the end-- especially where UI and controls are concerned-- so that it's harder to play than it need be, and harder to recommend than it should be. As a long-time Homeworld fan I was pleasantly surprised at how well Deserts translates some of the aesthetic and design of previous games to a ground-based game. Deserts has great visuals and exciting sound worthy of the franchise. Unfortunately, the game is bogged down by a clunky hotkey system in comparison to previous Homeworld titles so that it can be hard to find and control units easily. Though the build menu allows you to create a queue, the research menu does not, and you can only access this by selecting the mothership (rather than just pressing 'r'). Altogether, there's a lot to like here, but it lacks the refinement that has given games like the original Homeworld its staying power as an RTS.			"

												If you're a Homeworld fan this is a decent entry into the series. The terrain looks awesome even though it's all desert, the gameplay is solid although not revolutionary, 'classic mode' lets you carry your forces and resources into the next mission (and is pretty difficult), and the missions are pretty fun.There are probably better RTSs out there, but this one is Homeworld and it's not a travesty. So I really enjoyed it.			"

												If you want to buy this for a good single player campaign and the odd bot skirmish then wait for a sale. It's a very interesting and engaging story from start to finish and feels right at home in the homeworld universe. However if you want to buy the game for Multiplayer I wouldn't bother the game is as good as dead i'm sorry to say. It's a shame really the gameplay is amazing and MP could have been pretty fun but oh well I got my fun out the story and fighting the bots I got my monies worth.			"

												Ignore every bad review. This game is great, the only problem that bothers me is that there's no ability to save in skirmishes, but it's fast paced, even more than the other Homeworlds, so it's not a problem. If you liked the other Homeworlds, you'll love this.			"

												Singleplayer delivers the homeworld feel pretty well. The feeling of isolation and limited resources is really nice. The persistent units and veterancy helps with giving you a sense of what is at stake.However it is short, and the AI isn't anything special but is challenging enough in the campaign as it can spawn tons of units and is heavily scripted.Skirmish isn't great, as there's too few maps and the AI cannot counter air units and in general isn't very good.Multiplayer isn't great either. The tech tree isn't entirely visible, so you'll have to memorize it while the gameplay is mostly focused on ""getting a bigger blob"" of units than your opponent. The game is not very focused on decisionmaking or strategy. There's little sense of ""outsmarting"" your opponent as it is you're ""outplaying"" him by keeping up your production constantly, getting the upgrades at the right times and expanding at the right time. You're not setting traps or making elaborate plans. You're just building units and trying to keep your economy intact while doing it.Some units have special abilities but they are not the focal point of the gameplay.TL;DR: The singleplayer campaign is interesting. Skirmish and multiplayer is not very interesting.			"

												I think the game is a little overpriced right now; I got it because on preorder it came with the old homeworld games. If you bought the remaster on the steam sale you automatically get 20% off this game so that's an equivalent deal.Game runs decently well, even on ultra settings (i5/970) but in MP you probably want to play at lower settings for FPS. I like how you can press ALT to toggle sensor range / fog of war area, just try it because I'm not great at explaining it.So far so good except that when you play the campaign the cutscenes are unskippable which is annoying. MP modes seem fun, some folks at the Homeworld discord are streaming their MP matches now (release day afternoon).The most annoying things about playing the campaign right now are:- Can't pause to issue commands (hard to coordinate multi-pronged tactics, but I guess that's like playnig a MP game)- no labels for control groups- unskippable cinematics (unlike in the old homeworld games)I'll update when I play some more campaign and MP matches.

												Just finished the camaign and absolutely loved the entire playthrough. Engaging storyline, fresh units, classic combat style and nice graphics backed by excellent voice acting, I couldn't stop playing the game until I had it seen it through to the end!Definitely recommended for both new & old players of homeworld, The game makes an effort to stay true to its homeworld roots while bringing something fresh to the table as a sequel.My only gripe: it ended too fast! 9 hours in, I've finished campaign with little effort (at normal difficulty). While I'll revisit the missions at classic difficulty now, it's unlikely to take me more than 24 hours of gameplay to finish it at this rate. Still, it's not a big con as the campaign is meant to get you comfortable with the game and it does that quite well. Now for the real challenge, I have to explore the multiplayer side of things where homeworld has always shined.Tips for players new to the game or genre:The AI in this game appears to have unlimited resources. It doesn't harvest anything so if you're hoping to just wait it out, it'll never stop sending squads your way. Yet instead of taking it as a negative aspect, use it! It's an excellent way to level your units up and raise their ranks if you position them correctly with a supporting cruiser backing them.Make extensive use of Rachael's hacking & emp ability. The enemies railgun cruiser is devestating in large enough numbers and can only be acquired through hacking (hacking requires upgrade for this but you will get it in due course of campaign)Units are precious as experience is hard to come by. Take care of your units. You may have a lot of resource at hand but new units cannot replace your veterans right out of factory. Make sure you keep them safe.			"

												This game is beautiful.It was well-crafted and designed with absolute attention to the littlest things that just gets you in the downtimes while moving from skirmish to skirmish to pitched battle on the dunes. Its campaign was not too long that it'd overstay its welcome and not too short that it skimps on details.For someone already working and completely burned out on shallow open-world trite, this was just perfect.Overall, I'm looking forward to the next installment if there is one.

Not quite worth the 50$ pricetag though since not many play the multiplayer, its all about the campaign. So as I've said, pick this game up on sale. The DLC for it is sadly only for multiplayer, no added units for the campaign. Would def buy a sequel or new Homeworld game if they offered it with a just as good if not better campaign!			"

												Single player was everything you could want out of a homeworld game. Unfortunately, the multiplayer lobby system was completely broken for me and a friend, and the lack of customization options (like being able to import badges) was tragic. I love HW for its story and design, and this game scratches both those itches and plays like a dream in single player, so it gets a recommend from me. However, if you're looking for a multiplayer RTS, this will likely not be a good purchase for you.			"

												Premium RTS experience from veterans who built some of the best offerings in the genre.Approachable game play and controls immerse you in this highly polished environment wrapped in an engrossing story with excellent art and audio. Being able to maneuver the camera to see all angles of a map puts you in the middle of the action when you want to see the bird's eye view, or follow a single unit as it attacks an enemy.Interface with its keybound counterparts lets you activate commands quickly and not get jammed up with deep layers of menus.Combat is loud, flashy and fun with different units having their own characteristics and purpose in a fight.Blend of fast paced action and well told story encouraged me to want to jump to the next map after each battle. Hoping the complete campaign is as fun as the missions I've already played, and the game remains playable when the mayhem from later missions unfolds.			"

												Story elements like any Homeworld game have been knocked out of the park, even with playing HW1 and 2 you still are invested, despite knowing the ending. They actually tried to flesh out the characters in this, which seems weird, you feel some connection to them, but they are relatively flat. Combat is interesting, though aligning your troops on a ridge is damn near impossible. Aircraft offers a good long range strike capability which is OP, unless they have some AA defenses, but still they can also be knocked out using aircraft. Despite the aircraft dominating land vehicles still are effective for holding ground so you can better position your aircraft. The little things are sadly underdone: docking, formations, tactics all seem to be gone which is saddening.Overall I recommend because it is relentlessly capturing, I could not put in down.			"

												Homeworld is still one of the best games I have ever played and I am a huge fan. Than being said I really enjoyed the new installment in the Homeworld franchise and you don’t even have needed to play the originals to enjoy this one. Any lover of RTS would love this game, and the fact that you have to manage your resources throughout the entire campaign makes it even more challenging at times. So some Pros:-Beautiful Graphics-Great Plot Line and story telling-Interesting gameplay-MP is intense and very funSome Cons:-The AI could use some tweaks at times-Kinda disappointed in the selection of units (Homeworld 1, 2 and Cataclysm had almost double if not more)-Sometimes I felt like I was just doing the same things over (In SP, MP is a completely different story)Overall not a game without some flaws but would I say buy it....

Like it was in the original so you can capture a massive fleet to steamroll the enemy and not worry about going over the unit limit if you are patience enough to steal the vehicles			"

			Views: 57		

			Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a Real Time Strategy game that has you leading a last ditch attempt at recovering a power artifact to assist in your peoples survival.		

Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak ditches the usual base building RTS mechanics in favour of a more manuevarable base carrier. The story is also very well entwined with the gameplay providing alot of different scenarios to play through rather then just going through the motions of building up a base some other RTS have become accustom to.

												As always you can rely on that a homeworld game will be fantastic. Once more we get to see a story within the universe of homeworld and I have to say that when I saw that it was going to play out down on the ground I got a bit worried. But as we can see today it has done what most other games never succed with, a change that actually works and makes the entire trilogy even better. I rate this game 9/10, the other homeworld games I give 10/10.I am recommending this game to any strategy fan or just someone that wants to experience a very well written story.			"

												I've not yet played all the way through the game, but have completed a little of the single player campaign. I'll write my thoughts now and update the review as I go through the game. This is my initial impressions.Graphics, gameplay and performanceAgain, graphically, the textures are of high detail for a RTS game and its a joy to zoom in and see the detail. Talking about the zoom, I like the tactical view, but, would love the ability to zoom out a little further, this game needs a supreme commander like tactical zoom. It can be tricky to navigate the battlefield when there is a lot going on.You can customise the look of you fleet, for each battle, away from the default JCB yellow and in skirmish/multiplayer, play as either of the two factions, the Coalition or the Gaalsien. The Gaalsien have production carriers, allowing them to create units anywhere on the map, where as the carrier does this job for the Coalition, so they have managed ti create two gameplay styles here.I played this on my Core i5 4670 with GTX 970 and it looked amazing, frame rate a costant 60fps, lovely to look and and play with such a smooth frame rate. All settings were set to maximum. The minimum requirments suggest a GT 440, which is less than half the power of the GTX 860m in my 3ghz core i5 4210h laptop. Initially I got an appauling framerate in 1080p, and wondered what it would be like on one of the older cards! Dropping to 1600x900 or 1280x720 resolution, settings can be upped to medium and a respectable 20 - 25 fps can be acheived. **Update** I investigated further to see the cause of the low framerate and it was a combination of things.Firstly a recent Windows 10 ""upgrade"" had reset many of my settings to default, so the nvidia GPU was on auto select and the game had chosen the onboard intel gpu to run it! Forcing the 860m to again be default gave me 60fps at ultra. :)The game seems stable and i've not experiences any crashing.Single PlayerLovely cut scenes and graphices, love the audio and it really adds to the atmosphere of the game. I played on normal and found the game very balanced and fun to play. The AI didnt overwhelm you, but put up a good fight. Early on you are led through the first misson propper, after the initial training mission.Skirmish mode.Oh dear, what happened here. I played this against and easy AI and it was impossible to get production off the ground, the AI relentlessly attacks from the off and you end up running out of resource collectoes before you have time to build any offensive units. Even when I did get some units, the AI player seemed to have overwhelming numbers very early on. The developers really need to fix this as the AI is stupidly hard to play against and skirmish mode is where the replay value is, co-op multiplayer vs the AI and so on.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is really good fun and when you introduce another player into the mix the AI responds diferently, is more cautious and doesnt bombard you with so many attacking units. Seems there are a fair number of people playing the game, so finding a multiplayer mach was relatively easy.Game modes are limited to Annialate everything, or just kill the carrier to win. You can turn artifacts on and off, these are kind of like capture the flag missions, get five to your extraction point and win the game.I'm not the best games player, so was easily beaten, but as i'm relatively new to this game I'm sure i'll get better.Overall, I'm enjoying the single player. Its just a shame about the low end perfomance at 1080p espically, and the insanly hard AI in skirmish mode on 1v1. I hope in the future there will be more in the way of units added, whether through dlc or free updates, as what you have on offer is limited.I paid 23.99 for the game and think it was money well spent. I'll do a final update when i've completed the campaign, so far I've found it very absorbing. The game reminds me very much of the origional homeworld games, and has a great look and feel to itI'll give the game a thumbs up for now, but will update the review as I go through the campeign :)			"

												Homeworld: Desert of Kharak is a great game a fantastic spin-off for the Homeworld franchise.Singleplayer campaign took me about 12 hours on the hardest difficulty setting, I got wrecked by the AI a few times and had to restart or reload from a save multiple times. The story is well written and executed, it is mostly fed to you through cutscenes and animatics. Even for fans of the original titles (who kinda know how the game is going to end, after all it`s a prequel) there are plenty of surprises!Multiplayer/Skirmish is fun but it suffers a bit from the low map choice (5 maps at release). At least in ""Artifact Retrieval"" mode (basically capture the flag) the AI can be very, very challenging actually, I can not confirm the experience of some reviewers here. Note that keys can not be rebound at the moment, though the standard layout of the quickbuttons is okay and usable. Performance was good on an i3 and a GTX 650 Ti, FPS did only drop in very, very, very intense situations (lots of units and boom). No major bugs encountered, except for an UI bug that caused returning from the options menu to be quite a wait (30 secs+). Only ever had a single crash so far, this occured right before loading a new mission. Although the title obviously still needs some work I am satisfied with this purchase and excited for upcoming new content (free maps have already been promised, further DLC are ""in the pipe""). 8/10 would recommend			"

												Who would have though 12 years after homeworld 2 we'd still be waiting on a sequel.  Well here we are, and how pleasantly suprising it is to find a prequel that fits in so well with the established universe.For the unitinitated, homeworld is a series that lives and dies based on atmosphere and imersion.  And holy smokes, does this game deliver.  The campaign cutscenes are epic, the desert landscapes are vivid, and the tension feels real.  And holy smokes do I sound like a shill.This game is worth it for the campaign alone.  Some of us have waited years for a game to continue the homeworld legacy, and while its certainly not homeworld 3, and you can see the edges where the budget didn't quite come together, this is proably the most imersive RTS I've ever played.Buy the game.  Drive a landcarrier.  Play homeworld 3 someday. (maybe)			"

												If you're a fan of the Homeworld series, this is a must-get.  If you're a fan of RTS, it's still a great game but due to the shorter than usual game length I'd probably wait for it to be on sale.  Beautiful graphics, immersive story, fantastic music.  Exploring the Deserts of Kharak years before the events of Homeworld brings a whole new level of epic for the original game.  The voice acting is top notch and deserves special mention.  The random yet relevant radio chatter is a welcomed addition and pays pure homage to the original Homeworld in that respect, something Homeworld 2 did poorly.This game has actual difficulty levels.  Easy, Normal, and Classic Mode--being more in line to Homeworld I and II's arguably frustrating difficulty.  9.4/10, absolutely love it.			"

												First off.. i really REALLY want to like this game and i do.. but i got bored.The art is great, music is great, storytelling is great..the units are small and impressive and the missions are kind of boring. While i like the connection to homeworld with the zoom out map - i would have rather had a radar and the ability to zoom out more. The controls sucks and can't be rebound. Also, the shipbreaking part is really dumb. yeah, look at this amazing 1000 year old tech... blow it up!Everything, other than the most important part - gameplay, is great. It was very empty.I'm very sad. Yes, i'm still recommending it, but is more for the love of the homeworld series than this game. Hopefully they will make another homeworld game with big huge ships and epic fights (hell, i spend a lot of time in Homeworld 1, cata and 2, zooming in to the capital ships shooting beam weapons. It was sooo cool.) This one is just little ants running around in the sand. :(			"

												As you can guess by the name Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a prequel to the first groundbreaking Homeworld game.Of course you’re not in space this time but on the world of Kharak fighting a ground and air war against your enemies. In typical Homeworld fashion your ship a massive is LANDCARRIER is forced to start it’s journey and fight battles before it was ready to. Unlike with the Motherships in the previous games, the Kapisi is not only a mobile production center but a warship able to destroy the enemy all by itself. Another change from the earlier games is you find out about the people who crew this ship. The most important of these characters is Rachel S’Jet. A science officer who plays a critical part in the story and has her personal reasons for being on this expedition. But you also find out about the captain, different officers and even your more experienced vehicle commandeers will have names given to them. The AI isn’t the best and Blackbird has promised to work at fixing this and more multiplayer maps are said to be on the way. The number of missions is huge, but they are fairly varied and things can go sideways at times and your original goals might go out the window. Despite it’s flaws it is a good game and I look forward to spending no small amount of time playing in the sand. sm			"

												This is a RTS with a new perspective of the Homeworld universe more of a prequel as it tells the story of an expidition force scowering the deserts of their planet for the salvation of their people. Your base is basically an aircraft carrier on treads called the Kapisi, you can reasearch, build and upgrade units from it and as you progress through the game it will also be one of your most powerful weapons (cue tomahawk missle). The bulk of your forces will consist of various attack vehicles of many roles and sizes but the best part is when you get aircraft. Nothing beats playing the song Dangerzone while launching fighters into enemy territory! The AI in the campaign is ok, but skirmish is where things are much to be desired. You'll be rushed quite a bit in the beginning with quite a few units, but as soon as you pick you balls up and build up a sizable the AI starts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ itself it just.... you win... basically, you walk your army to it's carrier and blow it to hell.The Good- the story is good for homeworld players- the unit designs are good- the art in general is amazing- the voice acting is good quality- combat is fluid - units have a reasonable rock-paper-scissor mechanicThe Bad- AI needs more work- Story feels a bit shortThe VerdictThis is a is good game but it's still kind of a diamond in the rough, it has the ability to be a top notch RTS game it just needs a couple more updates to skirmish to make solo play all the more enjoyable. I give it a 7/10, I can't lie it was hard putting down $50 but overall I don't regret it. "

												The good-Prequel to a classic. All pros of the space RTS carry over.-Solid RTS you expect from Homeworld.  There is a good reason to delay finishing a mission to harvest resources. Surviving untis carry over to the next mission and each has a purpose, abilities, and strenghs and weakness to consider. -Terrain elevation and line of sight really makes a difference. Terrain will show deformation and burnt chassis.-Each level bring a unique obstacle to overcome. -Some enemy units and tactics can feel cheap and spammy but preperation and good strategy will always win out. It helps to be patient and methodical and it feels tremendous when you overcome.-Tactical overlay is better than ever. -Strong narrative. A Focused origin story. Handles themes of systemic oppression and religious fervor quite well.  Its dramatic, somber, compelling, well paced and expressed with beautifully illustred animatics.-Visuals are pretty. The Desert is vibrant and varied. Explosions kick up big plums of sand. Wear and tear show up on selected vehicles and debris liters the sands.-The audio is nothing short of outstanding. The voice work is strong, the OST is recognizable and adds more of the Middle-eastern flair that's familiar to Homeworld and something that you would expect from being in a desert but the sound effects and Ambience is where this game really shines. Everything from vehicles driving on dunes, random radio chatter, gunfire, missile volleys, hits and ricochets, explosions, battle chatter, and aerial vehicles swooshing overhead is so atmospheric that it would be forgiven to overhear it and mistake it as real.  I'd go so far as to say that the tactical ambience is revolutionary for the RTS genre as a whole.The bad-The game can crash. Crashing after logging 30mins+ into a mission that's going well is irratating beyond emotes.-No keybindings! A PC game in 2016 (last i played) what a sacrilege.The ugly-My system more than meets the requirements but the game can get glitchy in long play sessons. Debris and burnt chassis can cause crashes if they keep getting strewn all over the battlefiled.-Clipping and units will sometimes phase through each other.-Units can freeze in place and spaz out from time to time. Despite the bugs if you're an RTS fan, Homeworld as a whole is definitely worth playing and worth the price of admission. Thank you Gearbox and Blackbird.			"

												I wanted to like Deserts of Kharak, I truly did. It represents the first truly new thing for the Homeworld franchise in over a decade. As a hardcore fan of the first two games who plasters the Hiigaran insignia over everything, real or virtual, and can recite all the cinematics from memory, I *really* wanted to like this game. But I can't.A mediocre RTS that manages to have more bugs and fewer features than its now-teenaged predecessors (no formations, no stances, shadows are a mess, etc.). Its very existence depends on a retcon of existing canon (the extensive historical and technical briefing book originally released with Homeworld 1 states categorically that no major conflicts occurred for centuries prior to Homeworld 1, the version of this book printed by Gearbox in the re-issue changes this fact to allow for Deserts of Kharak to exist) and it goes out of its way to twist that canon like a pretzel (spoiler warning: you'd think someone would've mentioned the giant orbital death ray left behind and been less surprised when the people who placed it showed up again). Furthermore, it couldn't even make its surprise twist surprising, and somehow manages to look worse than the Homeworld: Remastered games that came out *before* this did.For existing Homeworld fans: Look elsewhere, this is just a worse version of what we've already got that takes dumb liberties with the story.For those who've never played Homeworld: Look elsewhere (might I suggest Homeworld?), there are better RTS games out there (like Homeworld).

It offers a unique twist on RTS tropes, playing like a cross between Homeworld and Ground Control.While the game is to some measure let down by its weak AI, it's the lack of additional content that really hurts it.

Resources are scarce making it feel even more authentic like your really in a desert fighting to survive against an enemy that wants to honesty wipe you out, as for performance issues havnt had a single problem so far considering its day one and homeworld in 1999 blue screened half the day, so suck it up your a pc gamer get use to it if you dont like it buy and xbox and cod it up with 10 year olds.

												I am one of the 700 people who backed this game as a Prospector in 2013 when it was first announced, because I'm a Homeworld nerd and  loved the idea of the spiritual sucessor of Homeworld. I even tracked the progress of this game all the way to release because I believed so much in this project.Almost all the other reviewers here have ticked the typical checklist: the game is beautiful, the interactive manual is meaty and full of the lore goodness which has been missing from games, the campaign is great but...The multiplayer aspect doesn't work.The devs kept on talking up the MP aspect of the game and how amazingly competitive it's going to be, but it doesn't work. To make things worse, on the rare off-chance the MP works and you are able to wait out the 15-minute matchmaking timer, the players are horrid. I've had people banzai-charge their carriers into enemy lines, I've had roleplayers spamming chat with RP while doing nothing in the game but sending 4 LAVs to die. I won't mind the trouble of waiting for the multiplayer function to be fixed if the community is great, but it's worse than the ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and ""putang ina mo"" spammers in CS:GO and Dota2. But no, this game has no longevity as long as the MP function doesn't work, and the devs have not said a single peep on intending to fix it.And oh, it's not worth it to even play Skirmish with AI because the AI is pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.As much as I want to like this game, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to fellow gamers.tl;dr the game is cool but has no longevity because multiplayer does not work. Do not buy unless it's $15 on a future Steam sale.			"

												Awesome, awesome game, I loved every minute of it. Deserts of Kharak is like one of those games we all dream about but nobody every makes. I only wish the singleplayer campaign was longer, it ended too soon. The multiplayer is pretty meh. The battles are too short, by the time you finally have a good, fun sized fleet going the matches are already over.			"

												This is a game worthy to hold the name of Homeworld.The shift to land-based gameplay does not in any way inhibit the flow of the game. If anything, it makes it easier to figure out where things out without flipping the radar map this-way-and-that to see get a 3D view of a 2D display (i.e. your monitor).			"

												Beautiful, story and narrative driven RTS. This will be an ongoing, updated review, as I progress through the campaign.CAMPAIGNI've completed the first two missions and the tutorial so far. If you enjoy any of the following, I'd recommend the game based on my limited play: Hard-sci fi narrative in RTS A decent mix of tactics and strategy Big Damn TrucksThe gameplay is much like the Homeworld series, streamlined, with an even greater emphasis on narrative. The game is gorgeous, and as mentioned, it's all about Big Damn Trucks.This is a game that emphasizes strategy, not actions per minute. There's a nice combination of use of high ground, and unit special abilities to keep engagements fresh and allow specializations.BBI has been great about supporting the game. If you're a fan of their art style, the DLCs are well worth it. I've generally had a wonderful time with this, and definitely think this product is worthy of support. It will likely never be as big as Starcraft, but it's not trying to be that. ConsNo docking animations for resource harvesters.			"

												I like the way this game feels, I like the strategic overview, I like the general vibe.This does not make up for the fact that this game is bug-ridden and has some of the absolute worst unit pathing I have EVER encountered in an RTS. You can't change your hotkeys at all, the camera is obnoxious, music and cinematic sound are inexplicably linked. I had often wondered why so few of the people I know purchased this game, and now I absolutely know why. I can't even complete a mission because of a bizzare bug that has not been fixed since launch. What the hell?This feels like a game from 15 years ago with good effects quality. I'll likely complete it, and I definitely enjoy the story, but I can't possibly recommend a game with such poor quality of life, pretty much across the board. This was the opportunity to bring Homeworld back into the genre properly and it feels as though it's been wasted.			"

												Best RTS game I've played in a long time....Just finished the single player campaign and I was impressed with this game. A pleasant surprise in the RTS genre! I've never played the Homeworld series, but I'm looking forward to playing those next (especially since the remastered editions came free with this).Pros:- Good unit selection with useful upgrade options carefully spread across the campaign- Gameplay is challenging, but not overwhelming on 'normal difficulty'- Interesting story with a climactic campaign- Excellent graphics!- Persistent resources/units makes you consider options more carefully before spending resources (which pays off in later scenarios)- Good use of terrain/elevation - Strategic map works well, which is good since you use it alot!Cons:- UI graphics were almost cartoonish in nature- Aircraft AI needs some work (airplanes refuse to land and bombers can hover too long in target areas)- Short Campaign (13 missions)Also, desert missions looked great but would be nice to get away from the sand in any future DLC/expansions.Highly Recommended!

												I loaded up the game and decided to learn how to play in the manliest way possible - going into multiplayer blind.First match was a 2v2 against a Blackbird Interactive member and I got my poop pushed in. The game is gorgeous, the art style during the intro cinematic was fantastic, and it has non-stop action during Artifact Retrieval trying to win a constant tug of war whilst building units to counter the enemy, much like the original Homeworlds.Excellent game, I'll be racking up hours for sure.

												Few hours into the game I can say that this is a must have for any Homeworld/RTS fan.Graphics: 9/10 - I am not 100% happy with AA as it stands out with everything else being gorgeous.  Also occasional rapid turn animation of aircraft breaks the immersion.Storyline 10/10 - so far I am loving it and it is a mix of original Homeworld with some elements of Battlestar Galactica in the desert setting (not to give out anything else)Strategy 6/10 - at least early missions remind me of FF13 where you have pretty much one way with smallish side pockets.  Later on it opens up so gameplay is fun for an RTS.  Fairly limited resources and locations slightly limit your angles and the game doesn't feel as open as some of the other strategies out there but it is far away from being linear.Over all: SOLID and fun gameplay and most of all bug free on release!

												Having played +20 hours multiplayer I can say this is a lot of fun. One of my favorite multiplayer games I have played. reminds me a lot of world in conflict which I loved growing up but this game takes all the good about that game and leaves all the negetives behind. the los battle combined with high ground and such is so interesting and fun. battles feel more like a dance as players jockey for the best postions. if this where it it wouldnt be so fun since the game would turn into who has high ground wins game, but with the relics and having to take them to extraction zones your forced to not only defend your    own relics but attack the enemies as well. the way the units are done is also really good, they have a nice balance bettween the different types. the railgun for instance is a long range heavy damage unit but it is a glass cannon and to get use of it's full attack range you need lav's which are fast and have a short range but fast firing gun, which can easily swarm over a bunch of unsupported railguns. to blance this all out there is armored units whihc the lav's do basicly no damage to but the railguns tear up if at range, due to there slower speed. if you can get close to railguns using cover or smoke your amrored units will tear the railguns up. add in height advatanges and experince as well as limted resources and time and you have an interesting dynamic which forces you to be out on the map in an ever changing battle.

												[reviewed review ^^] Okay, so..one lazy♥♥♥♥♥point is that if you're looking for some story mode...man this is noooot the place...finished it in normal mode in about 10hours..i guess there is the hard mode but you know...doing the same story..nah..i wish i knew, would've gone straight for hard mode..Didn't try Multiplayer yet..we'll see. Although, since Prebought, the game gave me access to the ""old homeworld 1 and 2""..And they are quite fun to get used to.Okay so i'll make a reviewed reviewed review after my multiplayer session to tell you guys..Take care ladies !![1ST review]After 10 hours of gamaplay, i've got to say the game's got his own caractere. Which is good. The story is cool.Graphics are ok. As for the gameplay itself, i've got to say that it requires so habit, it's not so intuitive and a bit ""robotic"", sometimes the units just do stupid stuff, especially airplanes, but that's somehow a habit in strat games..I recommend it but for me some improvement has to be made. I guess that will come with time, the game came out 10 hours ago ^^ but again, not an early access or a beta so i hope it happens fast. The building system is a bit weird, needs some getting used to. You're almost always on edge with ressources, which requires you to move your base almost all the time. Good to have a huge carrier ^^.Anyway, i might review this edit after a while, to see if with experience i find it more fluid when i play, less ""struggling"" toget things done.Later cheeks !			"

												oh boy.... so, without skipping the cut scenes this game is unplayable. Every 5 seconds I'm cut over and unable to control my units and I have important units teleported accross the map near enemies that I must defend. Then if you screw up and get a resource collector killed you can't even continue. This is put simply a terrible RTS and I don't think anyone play tested it. Getting bugs that prevent you from continuing single player is also madening.			"

												*Review has been updated below with regards to the Expedition Guide DLC*At the time of writing this review, I have finished the Campaign on Normal difficulty and played a couple of skirmishes against Hard AI. Not tried Multiplayer yet or the Classic Campaign, may update review later if I try them. I played the Remastered Collection to completion and know the storyline of Cataclysm.Pros:Fantastic visual design and art. Cutscenes are beautiful, artwork is beautiful, maps are usually beautiful, but occassionally not to the same standards of Sup Com 2 and similar titles.Music is as good as the originals I'd say, definitely the same feel.A few nice gameplay mechanics - such as acquiring new resources and artifacts from destroying wreck bulkheads, Carrier power systems, etc.Meh:Unit design is nice far out, kinda flat when zoomed in. This is an RTS though, you get most of the pretty factor focused away from the very expendable, very numerous units. Unit combat has a few visual bugs such as firing angles being messed up, and units hit by heavy weaponry sometimes do somersaults. Aircraft that are shot down will bounce as though they are made of rubber sometimes, but look very cool at least.Couple of frame freezes in big battles but game ran smoothly for the most part.Cons:Story is a bit barebones. I know Homeworld is very much about saying a lot with very little, but it seems like they only managed the very little part here; it comes close to capturing the feel of the story but misses the mark a bit. There's quite a few points where something is mentioned and never expanded on too. I think I might need to access that Expedition Guide DLC and see if it has the missing pieces there, but it feels like a lot of the additional lore and background for this game is simply not present. I'm also not really satifised with many of the wrecks present in the game; a couple of them especially feel like retconns, well, nearly all of them are iirc besides the Khar-Toba. A couple in particular are very questionable additions in my view though, and the ending itself was a little underwhelming. There's little characterisation in the game and little exposition.Combat is very Rock, Paper, Scissors. A lot of the time it boils down to ""Does the Enemy have AA?"". If not, use air. If yes, use a Cruise Missile and ask the question again. If still yes, then send in the ground troops; otherwise, you'll be spending more money rebuilding troops than you spend on Cruise Missiles blowing everything to kingdom come. On Normal difficulty, I spent the majority of the game sitting on a surplus of least 40K CU and 4K RU, patiently waiting for a challenge to come that'd need me to rebuild. It never did, because Cruise Missile <-> Air ---> Ground Troops is the solution to everything.Enemy AI is braindead. The Enemy will never react to your actions smartly, if you use air often, it'll never build more AA than it otherwise is preordained to. This makes air the solution to every problem in Skirmish mode, and most of your problems in the Campaign too. In Campaign, it'll send cookie cutter attack waves that are easily predictable due to how sensors work and the complete lack of stealth mechanics. Normally they can be dealt with by air, sometimes you'll want a Cruise Missile instead. Sometimes you'll just bludgeon them to death with a souped up combat powered Carrier. The enemy never seems to use abilities, and difficulty is more of a setting of 'How much shall the AI cheat?' with regards to their resource collection. The Enemy will rarely retreat, if ever, even under overwhelming fire or fire it cannot fire back upon. It will either sit there and die or chase you blindly and die.Unit AI is a bit off at times. Nothing co-ordinates their attacks intelligently, such as splitting their fire if they know they will kill the enemy in a single attack. This leads to entire airstrikes being wasted on a single light attack vehicle when a cluster of assault vehicles are behind it, and artillery fire being massed on singlular points rather than covering an entire wave. So you are forced to micromanage your artillery and air, to prevent your most powerful assets being wasted on the weakest units. Everything aims for overkill, and everything targets the first thing in sight, not the most dangerous or most relevant to their preferred target class.Controls are strange and un-rebindable.The 3D aspect of the game doesn't see much facetime due to the skewed balance towards air. No high ground is higher than the sky. But besides that, a lot of the time it requires finicky micromanagement to make proper use of it due to the lack of a Company of Heroes style click and drag movement control. Trying to organise units into a formation facing in one way in this game is a nightmare. Formations in general in this game are nightmarish to manage, the default unit layout is abysmal and will lead only to defeat and despair. No targetable subsystems on larger vehicles or the Carrier itself, nor much unit variety beyond some simplistic balance where basically smaller direct combat unit is the counter to bigger indirect combat unit (if it survives long enough to reach it) which is counter to similar sized direct combat unit which is the counter to smaller sized direct combat unit. I.E. LAVs > Railguns > AAVs > LAVs and their cruiser cousins appear to follow the same pattern but ground combat is unneccessary against the AI by that point as you have air units. Abilities are generally uninteresting beyond the AAV smokescreen which is actually both useful and interesting. There are no units comparable to Destroyers or Dreadnoughts though. Just fighters, corvettes and frigates really.Conclusion:The game feels rushed. It feels like the purely multiplayer title (no computer AIs iirc) Hardware: Shipbreakers was instead rapidly transformed into a singleplayer game that wanted to be a Homeworld prequel, but didn't have the time or resources left to flesh out the story or build a worthwhile computer AI. As a result, we have neither the very promising Hardware: Shipbreakers, nor do we have the fully realised Homeworld prequel that either Gearbox or Blackbird ended up pushing for. What we have is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the two, a Homeworld story set in the Hardware: Shipbreakers game with plenty of crossed circuitry and not much of it functional.It comes very close to being a brilliant game, but the AI is woeful to the point of inexcusable, and the story did not satisfy me, hopefully the Expedition Guide changes that but I doubt it. Combat becomes quite boring once you figure out that Air is supreme, and unlock the Cruise Missile.To end with, I recommend this game if it is on sale for anything around 50% off - £15 or less. It feels like a half-baked standalone expansion pack, not a AAA RTS title. I'm dissappointed, and hope they can fix the AI issues soon so that Blackbird does not suffer too much for this muckup.Expedition Guide UpdateI've read most of the Expedition Guide now, it contains most of the setting and background I felt was missing from the Campaign itself, and contains hints towards either possible expansions/sequels, or ideas that were not realised in time to be implemented in this game. However, it does not make up for the Story itself in my eyes, nor does it negate the issues with combat in this game at all.			"

												Homeworld is back.The singleplayer is beautiful. The sounds as in background chatter and music are just right and much like the orignals. Throw in sand tornado's gigantic rolling sandstorms the GFX are beautiful. The missions are progressive and take the player through the learning steps of how to play the game. The end is well it makes this a standalone by its self much like cata. Overall very fun game.That said there is such a huge strategic side to this game. You want to keep you units alive because they level up. Each unit has a name and Xp. The more you keep them alive the stronger they get. So Blob tactics will get you killed quickly. Especially in multiplayer you need to work with your team to plan attacks and get out with the least losses.Each race has its good and bad points for multi. In the end I would say try it. The single player alone is worth it and Multiplayer is very hard if your looking for a good stratigic game. This is it.Knowing the modding community on this is huge. Expect a lot of fun mods for this. Already a few mods out for fun.			"

												Full disclosure:  I'm about 3 hours into it right now.   I'll update this after I finish the game.  So take this as a first impressions after getting a few missions under my belt.I played a lot of homeworld back in the day.  I really enjoyed it.   For me this has fell a bit flat.   I'll list out some pros and cons I've felt playing it.pros:+ homeworld kinda-feel+ carrier can behave as a unit that is very effective depending on how you distribute the power+ nostalgia around the control scheme+ unit persistence+ tech upgrades+ beautiful, although somewhat boring, terrain+ simplification of y axis movement (or maybe removed?)cons:- physics engine almost seems not to exist.   -  height advantage is nice in theory, but is a constant struggle as you fight the camera to figure out where high ground is relative to other units.-  constant fighting with control scheme and figuring out which units are which. - textures are inconsistent.   Some are decent, others are just horrible.  - missions seem to follow a formula that is as predictable as ever.   Do something non-combat related, prepare to trigger waves of enemies.- scale of stuff is really strange and disappointing.   Some of the cut scenes have the correct scale, but then you have a ship that fits a few people in it (like the science team unit) and the giant carrier not looking as big as it should outside of a cutscene.   I get it, a lot of RTS do this, but there's some weirdness in that sometimes scale is preserved and sometimes it isn't.  Plus, with the camera zooming functions you kinda expect reasonably to scale.- story seems to try to replicate the homeworld experience,  like with the launching of the carrier -- but it just doesn't feel as grand.   It feels like you're a petty raider.   Story not very well explained as to even what your character understand of the world. -  objectives seem very outward facing without the original story and characters backing up your fight for survival.  -  unit persistence can cause some problems at higher difficulty if you barely win a mission.  Mitigating this is the option to use a default set of units for the mission. -  knowing where you can move units based on height of terrain is difficult or impossible until you try to move.Right now my feeling is if you are a die hard homeworld fan like myself you will find this generally enjoyable.   For others I can't really recommend the game.  Will update after I finish. "

												campaign was good. played on my 55 inch samsung uhd 4k the whole campaign and it was stunning. took me about 12 hours to beat the campaign on normal difficulty, might have to revist at another time later on and play on hard. hopefully campaign dlc or some good mods come to this game love the way it was presented. i have not played the multiplayer yet but will update review when done so, otherwise this game is worth it for the campaign if you want something nice to play and don't mind paying 40-50 bucks . just pick it up on when it is on sale if you cant afford it now!

												Its a mixed bag that to me smells of publisher interference, I'll explain.- The core gameplay is there but it lacks the finesse of previous Homeworld games such that battles become more one of attrition than playing smart.- The look and feel is Homeworld even though its not in space, BBI have done a good job there and the story telling works well... Until the end where it stops far far too short? If you aren't into Homeworld you are going to struggle with the plot imho because the ending isn't explained well at all almost as if they didn't want to fully cross over into HW1 territory just yet.- Had a go at MP with a friend and soon discovered an OP early game strategy which basically blows MP out the water for now.In summary then the basic game is there and is solid but to me it feels like I'm playing 1/2 a game (and suspect the 2nd half is on its way in 1yr time). Its almost like Gearbox is testing the market to see if ""Homeworld 2016"" can work and opted for a shortened/summarised version.Would I recommend it? Yes I would, I wouldn't call it 9/10 material though it clearly had the potential if it was allowed to mature. Overall BBI did a good job and really their fault is in not releasing what I would call a complete and well-rounded game but what they have done they have done well. To draw an analogy a little like Elite Dangerous where what was done was good but there needs to be more for it to work properly for the player/User Experience.			"

												Deserts of Kharak, while good, is somewhat difficult to recommend at its current price. The campaign, while quite good for the most part, has a frustrating last mission/ending (although maybe they assume most who are playing have also played the first Homeworld game, which takes place soon afterward) and fewer missions than I would've liked. The art style is terrific, although certain things, like the textures, are a little muddy (it also drops a lot of frames in parts where I feel it shouldn't; I have a GTX 970 with an i7 3.5 Ghz CPU and 8 Gigs of DDR3). I have yet to try multiplayer, but there only appears to be 5 maps, which for an RTS in 2016 is too low. The game itself alot fun to play, with cool unit design, old school RTS gameplay and some pretty unique game mechanics. The vehicle physics are particularly impressive, with dune buggies jumping and tumbling all over the place. There are only two factions in the game, as has always been the case with the Homeworld franchise, which didn't bother me as much as it might others. There aren't a WHOLE lot of units, but there are tons of upgrades that offer them a great deal of flexibility. I am hoping that Black Bird Interactive will add more multiplayer maps soon, as I believe that interest in this game will die pretty quickly with only the 5 available (which would be a huge shame).  In short, if this game were even $10.00 cheaper I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, but at its current price I suggest you check out gameplay videos and get a feeling for it. If the asking price doesn't scare you away and you like supporting small, new and promising development studios (or just the Homeworld franchise), you'll get plenty of RTS bang out of your buck from DoK.

												If you enjoyed Homeworld this is a must.  If you enjoy RTS then you should highly consider this.  If you enjoy games of any kind it's worth looking at.  If you hate RTS it's not going to change your mind.  I found it wonderful in every way.  Loved every second of the campaign.  Looking forward to doing it again.			"

												I think whether you like Deserts of Kharak will depend on which parts of the previous Homeworld games you like. If you enjoy the story, art, sound, aesthetics, missions, and basic combat, then grab it on sale and you'll be quite satisfied.If you enjoy careful tactical choices, then you'll be a little disappointed. While there are some new  tactical tools in the dunes -- new to the Homeworld series, anyway --  your fleet will be simpler, and your ability to direct your units is cruder. I'm no RTS expert, but in the singleplayer campaign I often ended up resigned to controlling a ""big slow blob of death"", due to the difficulty of micromanaging and the lack of formations.The single-player campaign on Medium difficulty took about 10 hours, which to a certain extent may represent a less attrition-based pacing.Pro: * Has all the right Homeworld looks.* Has all the right Homeworld sounds.* Units have cover and indirect fire.* Height advantage when firing on lower enemies.* Smoke screens.* Centralized control of air units seems odd at first, but it works.* Powerful veterancy bonuses.Cons:* No more ability to pause and issue orders in solo campaign.* No formations: Difficult to prevent fast units from staying with slower ones without micromanagement or ordering them to ""guard"" the slowest unit.* Key-combinations are less expansive and cannot be re-bound.* No more unit engagement rules (chase vs guard).* No more unit tactics (trading speed for firepower).* Your land-carrier is your only production unit.  * Some unskippable mission cutscenes* Unit icons/portraits could be more distinctive from one-another.

												The majority of the flaws in this game as of right now can be fixed with patch and dlc, which are coming and free of charge, according to the developers on forum. This game will only get better and better!That said, this game has beautiful art, excellent sound and music, and an interesting campaign to bring all together. Homeworld series have always been about the single player experience, DoK continues the tradition. I can't wait see the future projects BBI and GB have for the Homeworld universe.			"

												Wish there was a middle ground for reviews other than a strict Y/N. As it stands right now, my answer would be only if you were a fan of RTS games. Keep in mind, I am new to Homeworld. I have the Remastered collection, but have less than an hour or two in it. Got it on sale and have barely touched it. Think that hols true for many of us on many games.Here is why I wish for a middle ground for reviews. In the last few missions, it got to be somewhat easy, even against the ""overwhelming"" enemy AI. I just spammed air units and cruise missiles and such while keeping my core forces around the Kapisi and my salvage crews.  I played the game on Medium (two stars) difficulty. Then again, I have had somewhat extensive experience playing RTS games in the past and have greatly enjoyed doing so myself. Then again, I did greatly enjoy the missions and it did eventually present a challenge, even if is was only when the friendly AI derped and Rachel was left hanging instead of following the main force around. I enjoyed the concept of the upgradeable and mobile base and units. The UI was refreshingly simple and easy. Use the carrier for production and research. You have deployable repair/collection units. The rest of your units are combat/combat support types. (Very broad categories here.) i have not really tried out skirmish and multiplayer, so can not write a review on those game modes at the moment.			"

												im recommending this game for a few reasons, namely because it's a ""prequel"" to the homeworld series which will open up more of the story and let you play through it, also because it does feel like homeworld.the game itself feels like homeworld. the units are different, but pretty much act and feel a lot like what you would see in the current landscape of war on our planet with some other high tech stuff mixed in, but not a lot. it's very realistic feeling, even for it being sci-fi. some of the things they have in this game are not far fetched in the scope of them being able to be used here on our planet, if we didn't have water that is. the planet is actually from what i can tell, a lot bigger than earth, which gives a lot of scope to the realism of having massive aircraft carriers that have wheels and rolling across huge seas of sand. the reason i say it feels like homeworld is the resource harvesting, the overlay, the ui, the maps, the radar screen, even some of the sounds when you have a unit selected. they start talking like they did in homeworld and it kind of freaked me out a little bit the first time i heard some of them talking about there being contacts nearby and what not. some of them would say some pretty cool stuff when there were no contacts nearby. the way you move units with attack move will show you the line of sight option as well as the elevation of the world. the unit cap increases as you go along and collect artifacts. you can capture units with your science officer, but be careful about going over unit cap as you can not capture planes to my knowledge (as in i havent tried it) and if you go over unit cap u will not be able to replace your planes. the planes (there are 3 types) are going to really make a difference in this game.for some tips:-use your aircraft carrier as a mobile gun/support craft with aa and move it closer to the fight as much as possible, if not even using it as a main target to draw fire at times repairing it with your support vehicles and letting your other units fight, this is especially helpful when you are out of cu's and they have a lot of aa and u cant get any more cu on the map.-support units are your friends but will not be able to autorepair themselves unless u find a module mid-late game, so use a couple support modules for your main group of fighting units-always keep cu available for your baserunners and the shipbreaking abilities from your salvagers/rachel-always keep as many planes as possible in your carrieri played this on classic difficulty, i restarted from a save at the beginning of one mission in the very early game because i kept screwing up. then only one mission did it make me restart mid-late game because i couldnt keep the objective, aced it and captured units after i did it the second time. 10/10 for massive air game and ground game10/10 for prequel to homeworld10/10 for quality productbuy this game so we can play on multiplayer please...

												I'm pretty disappointed with the mechanics and apparent simplicity of game depth- notably the fact that both playable factions have very few units and those units are basically identical to the other group's- but I love the story. DoK is a great prelude to Homeworld 1 and ties in nicely lore-wise. I hope there will be patches in the future to flesh it out further, however. Or possibly workshop support for mods.			"

												Feels quite a bit like Homeworld. Not completely, but that is to be expected of a game that doesn't take place in space. Overall, the soundtrack is very fitting and the story, so far, seems to be very canon with Homeworld. The graphics, mainly the textures, are a little disappointing and a massive step down from the Remastered Collection; though graphics aren't critical for an RTS. It would also be nice if the skirmish AI wasn't so poor.8/10Now please make Homeworld 3.			"

												Because i detest long text reviews myself, here i will keep as short as i possibly can. Also, i didnt touch multiplayer so keep that in mind. The credits rolled for me 10 mins prior to writing this.Veterans of the series who have played all the previous games quite a bit, will find even the hardest difficulties too easy. That isnt a fault of the game, but rather the fact that you know more than most, making the game not balanced for you. Veterans such as myself will adore this game and be sad when the relatively short (its long enough, but you kinda want more after the credits roll), the sounds, visuals, art style, cinematics and emotion are all amazing. The gameplay is 100% Homeworld. Only, set on a planet. At one point in the campaign, you will be annoyed at a plot twist, considering previous story elements. No spoilers. As for newbies, you only have to learn the basics of finite resources, two types of resources, the value of different vehicles and general functionality. Once you have gained that, it will become easy to master. If you manage to figure out the true objective of each mission (that is never made obvious) and end up making the latter half of the game effortless, you know you have discovered exactly how the original Homeworld games worked. :P			"

												I just finished the campaign and played a few skirmishes.The game rules aren't exactly the same in the campaign and in the multiplayer.Overall, the story and cutescenes are good, it is definitly an homeworld game. I still prefer HW2, but DOK is quite funny.Several physics bugs encountered (a few pathfinding problems, vehicles jumping in the air for no reason...).The real problem in this game is that units aren't ""smart"" like they were in HW2  : they aren't autonomous at all, sometime they'll have allies getting attacked a few millimeters outside their action range and they won't even come to help like they did in HW2. The ""aggressive, neutral and defensive"" behaviors are really lacking. They aren't any formations for your fleets either : those damn support cruiser will often walk over your lines of tanks and it looks ridiculous, and the cruiser exposes itself to enemy fire on the top of that. To have exactly what you want, you must micromanage every class of unit.The graphics are good, but expect a few crashes on certain missions. "

												I love it more than the previous Homeworlds. Desert environments are always cool to me and it does them beautifully. The units are great and more unique than spaceborn varieties. I loved the speed of strike fighters, the tanks with vulcan mini-guns for cannons, and most of all the gunships and how they strafe like high speed AC-130's.  Bombers loiter too much though before using their weapons and that often ends with them dying. 9/10, would rate it higher if it only had more factions!			"

I finished it with just 2 support cruisers, the science vehicle and my carrier, maxed out on range and 3 on weapons, when he gets closer, I switch it over and go in for the kill.Also, the one mission where you get to the first wreckage and you have to setup the 3 scanners and defend it from the enemies and avoid the tornadoes... that mission is a bit glitched.  When the scanning started, they destroyed 1 scanner and it kept on scanning... I technically just needed 1...Still a good game though			"

The gameplay starts off pretty simple but does gradually escelate in complexity as you add cruisers and railguns to the fray. I would say though don't play this as your first Homeworld game, you won't get as much out of the story and it is kind of reliant on you playing the original Homeworld and reading its manual. Of course you can go buy Homeworld remastered right now, play that and then come back to Deserts and you got yourself a nice RTS trilogy right there!			"

The flow of the game and the hooks into upcoming lore (if you've played HW1 at least) is very enjoyable. The environment is all desert but I've never seen a more accurate depiction of the environment, the cut scenes memorable and in keeping with the Homeworld style as are the units themselves.I haven't finished the campaign yet, but I'm enjoying every minute of it. If this was developed to gauge the appetite for a Homeworld 3 - I say bring it on!			"

												This was a great pre-quel to a Real Time Strategy game that revolutionized an industry. The dynamics of playing on land rather then space but still keeping the feel of the original game are observed.  The story campaign is short, sweet, and full of drama and a real plot unlike most stories.  The gameplay is quick, many units counter other units,  geography is key as height gives you an advantage when shooting down on your oppenent. The graphics are beauitul the gameplay is great. Its one of the better Real Time Strategy games out there. Iv'e played over a dozen hours on Multiplayer they are always fun experiences. The only badside is lack of maps but the developers are going to release more soon. A lot of the issues brought up by people are being observed by the Developeres and they are going to be releasing patches with updates, new Maps, Replay ability and more. I believe they wanted to test the waters and make a great gameplay and later on when they had the resources give the game the much needed polishing it needs to be an outstanding Real Time Strategy game.

												Fun RTS game at a time when there are virtually no new RTS games.What I played: the single-player campaign all the way to the last mission, a few scirmish games against the AI and human opponents.The good: the game feels like Homeworld. The music, art, unit design, UI all give the game that distinctive Homeworld look. Controlling units is a breeze and the UI is very clean and not very cluttered. Camera controls are also very smooth. There is a decent variety of units and you need to use most units effectively to achieve victory. There is no single massively over-powered unit that you can just build and win the game. Elevation and line of sight are done very well and are very important to winning each battle with minimal casualties. I found the story (a prequel to original Homeworld) to be a pretty good one, although anyone who has played the original Homeworld will know the story already. Although the entire game is set in a desert I loved it anyway because of how beautiful the game looks and there are still different desert types. It really made me think of Dune and how awesome it would be if Dune was remade using a modern engine.The bad: the campaign is short, it took me about 8 hours to get to the last mission and there is no replayability value in the single-player campaign. It's not like Starcraft 2 campaigns with some branchine choices and big diversity of units. The voice acting in the campaign is not stellar and I didn't care much about the characters (heck, I don't think I can remember more than two or three names of in-game characters). The AI is terrible, it's not much of a challenge even on hard and it cheats aggressively to offer even this meager challenge. The scirmish mode is fun but it needs more than just 5 maps and two different game types (destroy the carrier and artifact hunt). Furthermore, there are only two factions and although their tech trees and units are slightly different, they don't really have that big a difference in play styles and tactics. There is a bit of color customization but otherwise you can't customize the look of your units.Bottom line: this is a good RTS with a lot of potential, but at the moment there just isn't enough content in the game to warrant the price. I liked it a lot but I would recommend waiting until it's on sale.			"

												I'm in love with this game. While you can find it strange, I will try to explain why.I like this military drama story. Aside from that, I like how BBI used the Homeworld lore and added stuff to it. After a series of my recent disappointments like HotS (what they did to Kerrigan is abysmal if we take Brood Wars into account) and SW7 it is such a pleasure to watch the coherence with HW1&2 story.Scenery is not as diverse as I wanted but it is okay for a desert planet. Unit design is sometimes cubic but I have no problem since it looks organic and intended: we have a really advanced and exotic race focused on hid and run tactics and slow but sure utilitarian design race. Which leads you to gameplay which is insanely addictive, watching the battlefield from a close distance can consume me for hours, excellent soundtrack adds to it and multiplayer... It is insane how many tactics you can use and how many builds you can choose since both races similar but plays different. Balance needs some tweaks but the core looks very promising now. The only thing I want to complain about is spawned enemy forces in campaign on higher difficulty, looks a bit cheap but who cares? It just intensifies the campaign :)It has small bugs but nothing game breaking and almost all titles have them these days so I am used to it.If you want a clone of Starcraft or Supreme Commander then this game is definitely not for you. And I am completely unsure about the e-sport part (since I personally don't care about it) so no input here. But if you can live with some rough edges and ready to invest into learning of this game's mechanics then you can find it just as fun as I am.Crossing my fingers and hoping for a long after launch support.

												I love it more than the previous Homeworlds. Desert environments are always cool to me and it does them beautifully. The units are great and more unique than spaceborn varieties. I loved the speed of strike fighters, the tanks with vulcan mini-guns for cannons, and most of all the gunships and how they strafe like high speed AC-130's.  Bombers loiter too much though before using their weapons and that often ends with them dying. 9/10, would rate it higher if it only had more factions!			"

												A lot of really stunning RTS Visuals and Gameplay functions, though I do love the original Research Screen in HW1 & HW2, there is also a lack of vehicles, seems there aren't as many varieties that I was previously used to in a more of a Homeworld setting game. But all and all this game is a wondrous beautiful Campaign RTS with multiplayer functions that have a bit of a more complex difference then just destroy all enemies as with most Homeworld RTS Multiplayer. Pros:Beautiful Visuals, Runs Well very few bugs and glitches, AI is challanging, Upgradable Mothership/Carrier.Cons:AI Not dependant on resources as in previous games, AI Spawns in some areas, Research / Ships Limited.

												Hats off to the developers. It's true, I'm a die-hard Homeworld fan so I am certainly biased - but believe me when I say that this is a worthy successor to the Homeworld mantle. The flow of the game and the hooks into upcoming lore (if you've played HW1 at least) is very enjoyable. The environment is all desert but I've never seen a more accurate depiction of the environment, the cut scenes memorable and in keeping with the Homeworld style as are the units themselves.I haven't finished the campaign yet, but I'm enjoying every minute of it. If this was developed to gauge the appetite for a Homeworld 3 - I say bring it on!			"

												Definitely a Homeworld game and one for the fans!The atmosphere, music and battle chatter is Homeworld! The gameplay starts off pretty simple but does gradually escelate in complexity as you add cruisers and railguns to the fray. I would say though don't play this as your first Homeworld game, you won't get as much out of the story and it is kind of reliant on you playing the original Homeworld and reading its manual. Of course you can go buy Homeworld remastered right now, play that and then come back to Deserts and you got yourself a nice RTS trilogy right there!			"

												I think whether you like Deserts of Kharak will depend on which parts of the previous Homeworld games you like. If you enjoy the story, art, sound, aesthetics, missions, and basic combat, then grab it on sale and you'll be quite satisfied.If you enjoy careful tactical choices, then you'll be a little disappointed. While there are some new  tactical tools in the dunes -- new to the Homeworld series, anyway --  your fleet will be simpler, and your ability to direct your units is cruder. I'm no RTS expert, but in the singleplayer campaign I often ended up resigned to controlling a ""big slow blob of death"", due to the difficulty of micromanaging and the lack of formations.The single-player campaign on Medium difficulty took about 10 hours, which to a certain extent may represent a less attrition-based pacing.Pro: * Has all the right Homeworld looks.* Has all the right Homeworld sounds.* Units have cover and indirect fire.* Height advantage when firing on lower enemies.* Smoke screens.* Centralized control of air units seems odd at first, but it works.* Powerful veterancy bonuses.Cons:* No more ability to pause and issue orders in solo campaign.* No formations: Difficult to prevent fast units from staying with slower ones without micromanagement or ordering them to ""guard"" the slowest unit.* Key-combinations are less expansive and cannot be re-bound.* No more unit engagement rules (chase vs guard).* No more unit tactics (trading speed for firepower).* Your land-carrier is your only production unit.  * Some unskippable mission cutscenes* Unit icons/portraits could be more distinctive from one-another.

												As far as I remember I really liked Homeworld and I'm huge RTS fan in general. Deserts of Kharak is just meh. I played on normal level and it was point and click flat out trivial to beat including last mission. You just roll over your opponents. Campaign has quite interesting story at the beginning, but then at the end it gets boring too. When I finished it, I've found out that to get more details about the world, setting, technology, etc you have to buy special DLC. How about no. This is at most average game. Had some fun, but not worth even discounted price tag.			"

Support for two screens would be very nice, maybe have a map on one srceen and the close up battle on the other srceen. meaning no more zooming in and out.			"

												Atmospheric and fairly engaging, but don't expect strategic depth on the level of a Starcraft-tier RTS. Think more like Supreme Commander 2 but on a more tactical scale. Combat features generally small engagements with well under 100 units per side, and the campaign can be drawn out in terms of time (especially by completionists who make sure to mine every penny on a map before moving on), but it isn't very complicated or difficult. The UI can also be a little wonky at times (good luck figuring out weapon ranges, and just try getting units to form up facing a particular direction), and it would be nice if the main camera could zoom out a little more so we don't always have switch to the strategic view.Nonetheless, good voice acting, very good - and mature, thoguhtful - writing, nicely done cutscenes, and excellent music all combine with a beautiful aesthetic to make something very enjoyable. The levels may just all be rocks and sand, but they're memorable, and even though a couple of the units tend to blend into each other when amassed in great piles and viewed at a distance, a lot of thoughtful detail has been put into the audio-visual experience.It's soothing. It may not require tactical genius or bring very much new to the RTS genre, but it's a fun piece of art.			"

												This was my first experience with the Homeworld games, as such as I had no idea what the storyline was or how the game's dynamics function. With that being said, it took me 9 hours of play to make it through the campaign on 'normal' difficulty. The last mission took 3 attempts. I would definitely recommend this game for RTS fans, but be aware that the terrain directed fighting is mostly a joke. Line of sight should give you an advantage, having the high ground should give you an advantage... both of these things do, sometimes, but usually not. Enemies can sometimes fire through hills. But so can you, somtimes.All in all it was a fun 9 hours with a storyline that kept me engaged and the cutscenes... oh boy those cutscenes, absolutely gorgeous!			"

												I do recommend this game, but not at this $54.99 CDN price. The campaign, as you'd expect from a team responsible for the original Homeworld, Dawn of War, and Company of Heroes series, is amazing. Depending on difficulty, it's only about 10-15 hours though. Anyone who considers themselves a fan of RTS owes it to themselves to play it at some point, but not for this price. I'd suggest waiting for 50% off. The MP community is already fairly dead just a few weeks after release. The MP portion is pretty threadbare - not many maps, no replay system, matches last about 15-30 minutes. The depth of tactics and strategy is not comparable to the games mentioned above. It does have veterancy, unit abilities, and some nice terrain/line of site mechanics but would need a lot of work and expansions to give it more depth and lasting appeal. I suspect that won't happen though.			"

												There is no active tactical pause (it was featured in H1, H2). Game is fast and there is no way you will be able to make some smart decisions, focus on majestic explosions or even control the situation on more than 1 battlefields. This game looks like materialization of the ADHD (clik! clik! CLIK! screen slide! click! clik!...) and is unplayable for me. This feature might have been removed because RT in RTS stands for real time and pause stands in direct opposition to the real time but so does the save game feature and why didn't you decide to remove that as well? If some people are idealists in this matter they can decide to not use pause. Just go for it and do not throw out this useful feature for gamers who really appreciate other gaming style. After I said about this dealbreaker to my friend he responded: ""I will not pay for something that will frustrate me, exhaust me and♥♥♥♥♥♥me off! I can do those 3 things simultaneously in a real time [and in a real world]"". Well said Krzysztof, well said...			"

												The artwork is amazing. Even the gameplay is fun and tactical. With that said, the single player campaign felts very short.If you plan to play this game for solo use only, don't expect very much. Even with playing around and doing stupid stuff(and a mission bug), I've only clocked in 12hrs of game play. Minus at least an hour from doing a custom game.If you like fighting othe people online, this maybe your next RTS. Each unit is important so don't needlessly through your units out. Resources are limited though it should get you far enough to the top stuff. Winning can be done by the smallest so don't ignore possible threats for too long.Personally for me I wouldn't buy it, ONLY because I tend to solo stuff. HOWEVER, if you enjoy matching wits with other people online, I would suggest diving into this and just see how good or bad you can be.			"

												If you're more than 30 years old, you've played this game before.  It was called Earth 20_0 or Ground Control. The latter being a better example, and it is difficult to tease out the difference between the two. There's a mobile base, one sort of special 'champion' unit, and an enemy that tosses mobs after you from time to time, interrupting your resource gathering.  The easily-fooled scripted events make an appearance, too. Everything's here, from the terrible pathfinding and crushing unit limits.  Its place in the Homeworld history seems a little misplaced, too;  the novelty of a third dimension gets crushed down to just a sense of high-ground versus low-ground.To be fair, that aspect of the game -- line of fire and line of sight -- is very well done, and units will tell you with very clear graphics what is blocking their fire and what you could move to get around that.While I'm enjoying the game, the primary feeling I keep having is that I've seen this before. I've played this game before. Really, the only reason I have to recommend this game is that I cannot think of anything else like it that came out this decade.  It's not a great game, but it scratches and itch that's been ignored for a long, long time.  Despite the fact that there's nothing really new, here, there's nothing really wrong with the formula that needs help.  It is keeping me entertained, and that's pretty much what it is supposed to do.  There's no way this is a $60 game, but $30 seems about right.			"

It plays and feels like a Homeworld game, so thank you for bringing me and everyone else back into the Homeworld universe.  Please continue to expand on this IP.Next time though, please bring back unit formations and include a system that allows you to easily position units on top of sand dunes (if we're still going to be in the desert).In the last few years I've been itching for a *real* RTS game with an interesting storyline. Today I got one. Time to play through the campaign again.Oh, and one more thing.  To anyone out there saying that the main campaign is too short and not worth the full price of $60 - Deserts of Kharak was a very well paced game that wasn't dragged out too much.  I found it to be the perfect length. Not every game has to be 200 hours worth of play time and I'm glad this wasn't.			"

												This prequel installment of the homeworld series breaks from the roots of 3d space operatic RTS to create a strongly hard-counter based land RTS. Balance is slightly asymmetrical- not all options available to one faction are available to others. DLC factions are interesting takes and variations on the core ones and not merely cosmetic. Those familiar with previous homeworld titles will find the interface minimally adjusted with the exception of updates and elimination of 3d movement as this is a ground RTS with limited air units.Combats are quick, brutal, and and based on a mix of micromanagment and unit choice. Reacting to your opponent or opponents with the right units in the right place is critical to success. Spamming one unit type will get you defeated in a hurry, even against the AI. Campaign is good, builds tension, and feels right at home in the lore of homeworld. It might not be the game we asked for, or even realized we could want, but it manages some cool things on simple mechanics and sharp visuals. Ongoing support is hoped for, would like to see some full-scale expansion pack type stuff in addition to the optional but more than window trimming DLC's we've gotten thus far. Those not into dropping additional cash for DLC could likely hold out for the big box pack or a steam sale- game comes in at a fairly low base price to begin with, and on sale, well worth the price of admission.

												I like scale in the game, units fire distance is pretty big, more like in real life.Unit scale is algo great, carrier is huge while other units are much smaller.Aircraft flying tragectory is like in real life.Anti air units fire disance is also huge.I'm a fun of C&C like games and was looking for something similar.Really enjoyed playing this gaem.Little bit sad that different fractions has almost identical units.Also DLC Soban & Kaneeph are not much different also.

												I bought this game just to experience the single player campaign, as i'm a huge fan of the old Homeworld games. But i must say i am very disappointed with the length of the game. It took me 6½ hours to complete the main campaign on normal dificulty. I was disappointed when the last map ended and i got the credits screen instead of another mission. It just felt really short.The story itself is ok, the gameplay is awesome, the graphics are great, The music is amazing. But it is hard to recommend if you are only interested in the single player like me.			"

												There is no active tactical pause (it was featured in H1, H2). Game is fast and there is no way you will be able to make some smart decisions, focus on majestic explosions or even control the situation on more than 1 battlefields. This game looks like materialization of the ADHD (clik! clik! CLIK! screen slide! click! clik!...) and is unplayable for me. This feature might have been removed because RT in RTS stands for real time and pause stands in direct opposition to the real time but so does the save game feature and why didn't you decide to remove that as well? If some people are idealists in this matter they can decide to not use pause. Just go for it and do not throw out this useful feature for gamers who really appreciate other gaming style. After I said about this dealbreaker to my friend he responded: ""I will not pay for something that will frustrate me, exhaust me and♥♥♥♥♥♥me off! I can do those 3 things simultaneously in a real time [and in a real world]"". Well said Krzysztof, well said...			"

												The artwork is amazing. Even the gameplay is fun and tactical. With that said, the single player campaign felts very short.If you plan to play this game for solo use only, don't expect very much. Even with playing around and doing stupid stuff(and a mission bug), I've only clocked in 12hrs of game play. Minus at least an hour from doing a custom game.If you like fighting othe people online, this maybe your next RTS. Each unit is important so don't needlessly through your units out. Resources are limited though it should get you far enough to the top stuff. Winning can be done by the smallest so don't ignore possible threats for too long.Personally for me I wouldn't buy it, ONLY because I tend to solo stuff. HOWEVER, if you enjoy matching wits with other people online, I would suggest diving into this and just see how good or bad you can be.			"

												I finally got this game on sale, after reading the reviews I was very sceptical about it and was not really expecting much. After playing a few hours, this reminded me so much of Ground Control by. Massive. It just goes to show how advanced GC for its time. Anyway, the game is a solid RTS game, Homeworld on the ground. The only real gripe I have with this game is that you cannot do any custom key binds or squad formations, and it does not really offer anything different or new from any other RTS game out there. Its fun to play and lacking any real RTS games out there at the moment, this game makes for a pleasant experience. Out of 10 I would give this game a 7, just for a solid story line and gameplay.			"

												A worthy successor to the original space operas (themselves having arguably the best RTS campaigns ever made).The scale is obviously smaller, with interceptors and jump drives replaced with dune buggies and trundling from point to point in a hulking carrier on tank tracks, though it retains Homeworld's epic sweep and punchy story beats.You won't be building impenetrable fortresses among the dunes or building huge fleets to overwhelm your enemies - there's no structures and you'll be scraping by each mission with a handful of units (at least on higher difficulties). This makes for a more focused and frantic RTS experience where you'll be concentrating on positioning and using each unit's special abilities to give you the advantage - for example, activating your Light Armored Vehicle's speed boost to charge through an opponent's front lines to take out their hard-hitting railguns, or laying down smokescreens to allow weaker units to escape.The campaign doesn't outstay its welcome and there's surprising variety to be found in the maps given that they're essentially all vast sandpits. It would be fair to say it's pretty light on content, and it feels somewhat of a proof of concept for a more substantial entry in the franchise, but it's clear that the devs understand what makes a Homeworld game tick and I'm excited to see where they go from here. The way light vehicles swarm around bigger targets is very reminiscent of the balletic dogfights in the original two games and the soundtrack and hand-drawn cutscenes are on-point for the series.Great to see HW back and on form!

												So close, but some significant annoyances mean that I can't quite bring myself to recommend this.  For the sale price I paid (<£10), I don't regret my purchase, but I'd be upset if I’d paid full price.Starting with the positives, the visuals (units and landscapes), and particularly the sound design are fantastic.  The storyline is good, the missions are varied and well made.  What lets it down is the underlying game, the mechanics.No formations, very poor unit AI, the fact that a mixed group of units given a move order will proceed at their individual top speeds, spreading out and leaving themselves vulnerable.  The bizarre decision to put a cooldown on (for example) the salvagers demolition charge, which means that I can queue up four of them if I’m out of range of the target, but if I’m next to it I have to wait – why?  An Inelegant hack to allow hotkey modification I know is a limitation of the engine used (Unity), but still feels shoddy.  This is a slightly faster moving game than the first two, so the removal of the ability to issue orders while paused is deeply annoying.  I've been an RTS fan since the days off Dune II, Warcraft and TA and it’s enormously frustrating to see UI design that mostly ignores the lessons of the last 25 years.This game is currently the same price as the Homeworld remastered collection, which offers two superior games.  If you haven’t played a Homeworld game before, buy that.  If you’re already a fan, it might be worth picking this one up in a sale.			"

												Deserts of Kharak has good RTS mechanics, solid controls, good graphics, and an interesting Campaign mode… which is rare for an RTS. Overall it’s a very enjoyable game that I wish I could feel safe recommending. I’m giving this game a thumbs-up because I rate it to be above average, but not truly excellent. Unfortunately the game does have some caveats:-	Campaign is truncated and felt underdeveloped (13 missions)-	Voice acting, while passable, sounds phoned in at times-	Multiplayer has only 5 maps at time of launchIt’s a good game, but the lack of content makes it a concern whether the longevity will be there. Bear that in mind before you go making your purchase. You can see my full review here:

												I have been a fan of the Homeworld franchise since I picked up Homeworld 2 off the shelf.  These are great games, and Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak did not disappoint.  I will only cover three main points that really stood out to me.The first is RTS controls.  This game has very similar straight forward controls like the the previous games.  If you play RTSs this won't be difficult for you.  I recommend using mixed units when fighting the enemy.  The second thing I want to mention is unit detail.  I love realism, and Homeworld never fails.  I will say that I expected more out of this game.  It does look beautiful, but I was more impressed with Homeworld 2's level of detail than this game.  Explosions really disappointed me.  Still beautiful, but not as impressed as usual.The last thing I will mention is the campaign story.  Multiplayer doesn't really excite me unless I'm playing with a friend or two.  If you are looking for that same style of storyline as the previous games, you will find it here.  I really feel like this is an actual history of this race of people when I'm playing.  The seamless transtion from cinematics to gameplay is just like the old games.  I love playing through the story...which is challenging as usual.I recommend this games to Homeworld fans.  If you haven't played the others, I recommend you play the more recent Homeworld Remastered release.			"

												Homeworld: DOK is an amazing game. The idea with everything (almost) being mobile, is a nice take on the RTS genre, as is the giant carrier on wheels. Firefights kick up dirt, weapons feels punchy. The background radio chatter is astonishing. Graphics are great too. The game also sports a very nice interface/menu in-game.The best RTS since C&C Generals!I could use a little more zoom-out since many weapons shoot more than a screen length and I would like to do away with deploying logistic modules (which are used to be able to build more units), they are grounded which defeats some of the feel of a mobile army. The same goes for the ability to place fixed turrets. They should be replaced by vehicles.Also, more multiplayer/skirmish options are needed. I would like to be able to have matches without air force for example.Those are minor points, the game has blown me away.			"

												I've only played a few space - or futuristic - RTS games. Those being Earth 2160 and a bit of Starcraft II. Me being a huge Command and Conquer fan, I thought I'd add another space RTS to my collection, that being this game.I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed in the game since I thought you would be base building but you're not. It reminds me of Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight more than anything but that's alright. I love the concept of this game and I love the gameplay. The maps are absolutely beautiful at max (and my video card is a cheap 2GB one) and the game is challenging. So my disappointment in the lack of base building is irrelevant.I recommend this to anyone who likes RTS games and doesn't like micromanagement (base building) very much. In this game, you command a carrier which deploys units and where you research upgrades and units to build from your carrier. I've only played Skirmish so far so I can learn the systems and whatnot, but plan on trying the campaign very soon. I will update my review then.In the mean time, I recommend this game. From my experience, I don't recommend the two Fleet DLCs as they are basically two retextured fleets of the base ones. I played about 5-10 minutes as Soban and I don't think I noticed anything different from the Coalition. If someone can explain the DLC more in-depth to me, please do so. I will update my review.			"

												I would only recommend this game on a sale for its singleplayer experience as it has always been Homeworld's foremost strength, it can also be a refreshing RTS playstyle without static base building formula. There is much left to be desired, after completing the campaign and some skirmishes, and if you're not interested in multiplayer, there are no additional side scenarios / Theater of War like CoH2 / Co-op mission modes / Commander progression like in other RTS games. Lack of mod support or a map editor does not help either.Pros:+ Great art style and cutscenes, design of units are awesome.+ Realistic and detailed vehicle animations, you will feel the delay of heavier/slower units.+ Immersive music and absorbing unit battle chatter (configurable).+ Decent expedition story.+ Authentic Homeworld Tactical Map.+ Terrain line of sighting for cover and positioning.+ Unit veterancy and persistant fleet in the story campaign.+ Mobile Carrier (base) that can be upgraded like a powerful tank with offensive/defensive customization.+ Units can be customized, for example: longer range, or upgraded for special useable abilities.+ Carrier showdowns in multiplayer can be close/intense.+ Option to autosave Replays (but no spectator mode).Neutral: = 11 Skirmish maps.= Uninteresting Steam achievements.= Classic difficulty is recommended, it is moderately challenging on some missions but advantage can be taken of by stalling.= Story / characters barely fleshed out despite rich lore.= Fairly 'safe' RTS mechanics and unit differentiation, no stealth/capture units for example.= Carrier annhilation or Artifact Retrieval mode in multiplayer.Cons:- No ""Pause/Break"" key, nor is it possible to savegame for solo Skirmish against AI.- No unit collision, units should not be able to move/clip through each other. You also can't use your larger/armored units to block missles to shield fragile armor units.- No formations that improve combat efficiency, in Homeworld units of different movement speeds move at the speed of the slowest one, and there are different formations / stances. You can still use Guard to move units together though.- AI still needs work.- Not much progression if not interested in Multiplayer.As a Homeworld player, I feel that DoK as a prequel is a worthy addition to the series and stays authentic in visuals/atmosphere to its predecessor, perhaps a little too much, down to the menus UI. However, one would expect more complex mechanics than what we had in the first Homeworld.			"

												If you thought Homeworld could not remain true to the original if it wasn't set in space, you were thankfully mistaken.Having played the original Homeworlds years ago, like many I looked at them with rose tinted glasses. But In prearatin for Deserts of Kharak I started up homeworld one, and I have to say, it still holds up. It delivers an atmosphere and an experience of play oonly great games manage. And homeworld shipbreakers Manages both.The aeasthetics are not only sunningly beautiful, but they remain true to the original. Be warned though performance is lower than expected from such a game.The sound design, a known high point of the series also does not disappoint. Not only are the tunes perfectly in sinc with the action and visuals, but the constant unitchatter prowides an undeniable sense of presence. And I haven't heard a piece of repeated dialog for three hours into the game.Mechanically, this is a competent RTS. It brings no great innovation, but what it does it does well. The small number of units may initially seem a drawback, but I've never found myself looking for any functionality that wasn't present in some way. Pathing appears good, and units respond well to orders. The game is set on a series of hard-counters, andthey are mercylessly enforced. So if that's not your thing stay away from it.The multiplayer I didn't explore much, so I can't provide criticism.TL.DR.:Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a game true to it's predecessors. Stunning visuals and superb sound-design support a competent but non-innovative story driven RTS with prominent hard-counter mechanics.			"

												I Recommend this game but only in the fact that its fun and it has a great story! i liked the controls and combat and i think they nailed the setting.however its been less than a week since launch and i already completed this game! 13 missions total seems kinda lacking, i would like another campaign with another faction or something, however more games are coming out soon so i can focus on that. i think its more of a 25 dollar game than 50 but if you like homeworld you will enjoy this but be warned its about a 12 hour game.

YouTube™ Video: Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak - Hold The Line 

			Views: 58		

			Game releases on JANUARY 20th, no idea why I said Febuary! Sorry about that! Today we are Playing Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak from Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox Software.		

A key was provided to me early so I could check out the game before launch. Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak has the feeling of a great RTS. I'm someone who doesn't play as many as I used too but even I found the controls and information on the screen very simple and easy to use. It provides you with great and accurate information and gives you nice quick control over it. Mixed with the voice overs in the campaign the whole experience really did give me a commander feel. Over looking the battle. Terrain plays a big part of combat so I find myself pausing at the start of mission just to have a quick look round the battlefield for areas of higher terrain. Theres 3 terrain types low, medium and high. Any unit on a higher terrain will recieve a bonus over those on a lower terrain. Mix this with unit strengths such as the LAV being better against railgun units and you can really turn a few units into a dangerous force. Combat looks great in the game LAV's being probably the most fun to witness as they circle and swurve there way around each other and the enemy gunning down anything near them. The desert environment looks stunning and when you see a group of units moving with a cloud of dust behind them it gives a great atmosphere to the game. So far though I haven't been able to play it anywhere near as much as it deserves I would highly recommend checking this game out. It performs well even on my not so great system and it plays beautiful. A great RTS game in my opinion and one I'm looking forward to playing even more of.			"

												A decent rts game.I recommend playing the solo on hardest difficulty otherwise it's just boring.The game is very easy, what, you find it hard? Then stop playing the objectives and always think of getting the ressources first !!!Sadly the solo isn't as epic as before, no huge fights with tons of huge ships. Just small engagements where your air units and tanks with support cruiser does the job. That's all you need to win the game.Multiplayer looks fine but is kind of slow (to unlock units) and once again no huge fights. You have actually less supplies limit then the solo (125 whereas 200). And no more than 6 players.Also, barely any ressouces. On 1v1 you're not gonna get past the tank units.Some glitch here and there (units movements can become chaotic for a bit but it's entertaining)Black Bird give me EPPPICCCCCCCCC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Idc if it's in a 5$ dlc but this just feel empty for a war. I want destruction, pain, drama, real despair when you see the tide turning after a gruesome ambush.... Cause I just feel like I'm fighting with rocks and sticks at this point.			"

												I recommend it. There's definitely some bad to it, but it's very solid. 8/10I am a long time RTS player and as far as game mechanics go, this game is in my top 5. Visually/atmospherically: This game is number 1. The music, the art, the effects, the feel, all of it are amazing.Currently, the game loses a point for the multiplayer having too few maps. There are 13 story missions and I don't see how they couldn't reuse or rework story mission maps into skirmish maps. Perhaps that will happen later. Or even better, we will get player made ones.The game also loses a point for some of the vehicle balance. LAV's are worthless. There is no point in having them except maybe as cannon fodder. You can run around with 4-5 AAV's, 4-5Rail guns, and 3-4 Missile AAV's and never get touched with a support cruiser in tow. All in all, if this is what I can expect from BBI, I hope they continue the homeworld franchise. Very impressed. If you're a fan, you will love this.			"

												Deserts of Kharak is a better story than game.  It captures the Homeworld feel perfectly and the campaign evokes a fantastically desperate emotion.  Pros:  -Great use of the Homeworld universe.  It feels like it belongs.-Explosions are fun to watch-Audio is great across the board.-Multiplayer ""artifact recovery"" mode is fun.Cons:-No true fullscreen support.  Only 6:9 resolutions fit correctly.  (there are some workarounds to this)-units are very small when not zoomed in.  -very few multi-player maps.-only 2 factions.TL:DR  7/10    This game needs a little more content.  An expansion that adds a 3rd faction would make it feel right.			"

Story is strong and a good art stlye for cutscenes  and the skirmish is very fun. Definately worth buying.			"

												This game lives up to the Homeworld name. I re-played through Homeworld 2 Remastered before this game launched just to re-familiarise myself with the game. It was a big help. The UI design 10-15 years ago was so good that even now it beats many RTS. The story and narration are also top notch.Some bad points I have for the game are that the group numbers do not show on the selected units which is a little frustrating. The resources on each mission are also quite scarce. There are barely enough resources to build your units and hope not too many get killed, because there won't be enough resources to re-build.			"

It tells a beautiful prequel story with great art, excellent mission design and wonderful music. Its a classic resurrected, capable to live up to twelve years of expectations, even though it's set on a planet. The single player campaign is a bit short, but the game worth every minute.			"

												Story is fantastic, which is saying something since so many RTS campaigns fall flat. Art direction is very cool and cutscenes are done somewhat a la ""A Scanner Darkly"". I do have some replayability concerns as I devoured story mode on medium difficulty in a day and right now skirmish/multiplayer seem limited in maps/races, but I havent dabbled much there yet.I'd recommend DoK to anyone who enjoys the RTS genre; pleasant surprises in the era of Total War: Rome 2, Company of Heroes 2 and Civilization: Beyond Earth are harder and harder to come by.

												As a huge fan of all the Homeworld games, I'm seriously let down by Kharak.  It's so bad that I'd refund the game if I still could.  I doubt I'll ever play again after this last campaign mission.  This was definitely not worth the $50 price point.  At most, this is a $15-20 game.It's short, it's small (small maps and so few units), the camera is too darn close, and the story doesn't add much to the Homeworld lore.  It pretty much feels like a crappy Homeworld mod to me.Final verdict: pass or wait for a steep discount.  Really disappointing.			"

												It's the videogame equivalent of The Force Awakens. Apparently, the way to revive an old, beloved franchise is to stick close to the originals' plot, sometimes lifting stuff beat-for-beat, and to focus mainly on recapturing the atmosphere. DoK is engineered to make players draw parallels to Homeworld: it has a somber mood, slow pacing, a lone mothership and its crew, a long, harrowing journey over enemy territory, a desperate quest that will make or break an entire civilization, ominous mystical overtones, a fantastic middle-eastern soundtrack, units and resources carrying over from previous missions, rock-paper-scissors balancing that makes units useless most of the time and completely overpowered when used against the right targets at the right distance with the right support, etc. etc.It also has enough new stuff (elevation, air units, carrier upgrades and power-shunting) to not qualify as a retread, which is more than can be said of Homeworld 2 and Cataclysm. Honestly, as much as the desert setting is getting flack, I don't think a fourth Homeworld game set in space with the same old units would really have energized the franchise. And I'm happy we're getting a window into Kharakid society again, since Homeworld 1 had that wonderful Historical and Technical Briefing booklet that greatly expanded the lore of Kharak and its various kiithid... and then did away with the planet and its people in the first few minutes of the campaign.

												Pros- Great storytelling.  Cinematics are different, but have similar tone.  Consistent, engaging gameplay.  Challenging without being obnoxious.Cons- Pathing is a little sketchy.  Formation movement is underdeveloped.  Tutorial kinda throws you into the wind.I'm a huge fan of the Homeworld franchise.  This is similar, but not the same.  This plays much faster.  It is stressful; hectic, even.  Micromanagement is key.  Every unit fits a niche, and bulk production tactics simply don't work.  Homeworld 1 & 2 encouraged force management and tactics.  Deserts of Kharak mandates it.Another difference is resourcing- no large fields here.  You're starving for the first several hops of the campaign, and you're constantly struggling with defending your resourcing operations while accomplishing objectives through the rest of the game.A third difference is your carrier/mothership.  In 1 & 2, it was a large, slow liability until late game.  Here, it is equal parts battleship, aircraft carrier, and factory.  Power management means that often the most effective combat plan is the one that involves running your carrier, guns blazing, right into the middle of the enemy.  The game rewards risk, where my experience with 1 & 2 was that careful, conservative planning was best.Basically, if you love Homeworld lore?  Buy this game.  If you love high-speed, skirmish-style strategy games?  Buy this game.  If you played Command & Conquer 4, and have always wondered what that game would be like if it didn't suck?  Buy this game.If you want a slow, cinematic space opera?  Go play 1 remastered.			"

												Imagine dating the girl of your dreams 16 years ago. Breaking up with her, going out with Jennifer Aniston a year later and then two years after that, Jennifer Lopez. Then for 14 or so years you justifiably cannot fall in love with any other girl because of that.And then, comes Monica Bellucci. An elegant and exciting woman who despite her age, manages to charm you once again, with a mix of old and exotic things, but at the same time, reminding you of everything you had forgotten.This was my entire feels trip through Homeworld, Homeworld: Cataclysm, Homeworld 2. And now, Deserts of Kharak.			"

												It's largely faithful to Homeworld, and helps to tie things together just a bit more. It's all great. Land Carriers are great. Ship wrecks are great. Land Carriers with Tacitcal missiles and multi missile launchers are even greater.You can also watch the Kapisi do sick jumps off of sand dunes, nevermind that it's 500 meters long.			"

												Game is a gem. Devs did an excellent job making this feel and play like Homeworld. Excellent voice acting and a good story. Looking forward to playing multiplayer after I finish the campaign.*Update - about 10 hours into game now.I am pleasantly surprised with how much I'm enjoying this game. I am one of those people who play games pretty casually, if a story doesn't get my attention I usually stop playing. This has got me though. It's the perfect kind of game to sit down in an evening and put in a solid mission or two, enjoy the story, then set it down till another day.Very nice work.			"

												Pretty decent game, like the new concept, especially the way aircraft are used, cuts down the boring micro management.Having your base as a mobile aircraft carrier is awesome >.>Seems to have really small collection of maps, not sure if the are going to rely on modders for this, also lacks diversity in units.

												Fear not folks, this is a through and through Homeworld game without a doubt.  The feeling of going up against an unrelenting enemy or a lone journey through vast emptiness (only in a desert planet this time, duh) is still there. I love the art direction, the graphics, the sound design (radio chatter between your units is fantastic and very very reminiscent of the Homeworld games of the old). The game is beatifully well done.Apparently the campaign is not that long (albeit crafted masterfully) and the game is very thin on content. Also the AI is pretty much non-existent, and as a result the game is quite easy even on the hardest difficulty setting. Scripted campaign makes a very good job of hiding this and engrosses you completely but that seems like that is all there is for now. I don't think competitive multiplayer will be a thing and skirmish mode in its current state is not satisfying thanks to the AI. The campaign will not disappoint you but whether it is worth the price tag depends on the personal preference. I'd say it is worth the full price for a fan of the series.All in all, I'd recommend Deserts of Kharak to any Homeworld fan.			"

												Overall, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak serves as an incredible prequel to the franchise, delivers a captivating and satisfying story driven gameplay experience with stunning graphics to boot. The campaign itself is pretty long and comes in at around 15 hours or more depending on your playstyle and difficulty level chosen and is well worth the current asking price on Steam. The multiplayer and skirmish modes just round off the entire package will surely deliver countless hours of fun for those of you that want to sink time into this game. And dare I say, the Multiplayer might even spawn a competitive scene. Only time will tell if that happens though but I certainly would like it to. If there is any RTS game to be purchased and played immediately, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is right there at the top of the list.			"

												If you are a Homeworld fan then you will definetly not be left wanting.When I heard they were bringing out a prequel to the amazing homeworld series I was already expecting it to be subpar because Relic wasn't producing it. Thankfully this was the time that I was 1000000% wrong (yes I know 100% is max but bugger off)Now for those of you who are looking at this game and you love your strategy games believe me when I say this.BUY THIS GAME.The eye for detail in this game is amazing especially when it comes to line of sight, you can actually use sand dunes to block line of site and set up ambushes.One tip, always try to hold the highground it will make your like that much easier.Ok the cons, yes all games have them and so does Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.It has crashed on me a number of times while playing it, though an update to fix alot of the crashing problems was released the following day.The biggest con of all though is that there is an end to the game, I could play this game continuously but I just finished the campaign and I need more. When is the next one coming out.So overall for a game that was released yesterday, with one or two little problems which are being dealt with,BUY THIS GAME already.			"

												I just finished the game on the highest setting, Classic Difficulty (the name of which amuses me, due to the fact that the 'classic' game only had one difficulty...really freaking hard). The journey took me 12 hours of gameplay at this point. I loved the ambient music of the game, and am seriously considering buying the soundtrack. Now, to put it simply here are my views.Pros:Extremely thematic music.It's a desert, but they keep the terrain interesting.Each unit has its uses, and they keep the number small enough that you don't wonder why they put units in.I've always loved persistent fleets, and the veterancy makes it even better.Excellent story, and quite good voice-acting as well.The power shunt system for your carrier is amazing.Cons:It was too easy to beat on the main difficulty. Your best bet is to get as many resources as you can to build a fleet, and then alpha-strike the main objective in a single massive attack to finish things. Otherwise you just get killed by the death of a thousand cuts due to your opponent not needing resources to produce vehicles.The AI is less than stellar, but makes up for it due to campaign scripting.Leaves lots of questions unanswered. Admittedly, primarily because they were answered in the other Homeworld games, but still.Skirmish maps are lacking in number.Overall:I recommend the game to Homeworld enthusiasts. I recommend others wait for it to go on sale. Unless modding tools come out for it, at which point this is ripe for modders to turn it into something absolutely amazing.			"

												Would totally recommend it,if they would still offer Homeworld: Remastered edition (classic included) as a gift,if you buy this game. Game is not worth the current price tag,since there's nothing much to do in this game right now. When you've done with campaign,you'll proceed to multiplayer and you'll get bored by time,since there's only 5 maps. Game feels like early access,although developers are talking with us and they're saying,they're already working on updates. The real elephant in the room is the lack of content. As of writing this there are only two factions, five official multiplayer maps, barely any AI to speak of, and a campaign that can be polished off easily in under ten hours. Nothing scandalous but it's definitely sparse for the price tag. Doubtless more content is on the way, and once it drops I'll happily flip my recommendation to a yes. Until then you'll have to decide whether fifty dollars is too much for a shiny, flimsy toy like DoK.If you've played SC2 or Company of Heroes,than this game will feel really fresh. There's interesting concept,it just misses a lot of Original functions of Homeworld. At current game state = Not recommended. Get it for discount or with Homeworld remastered included,since this game alone is not worth the 45.99 EUR.			"

												Having played this new game up to the review date, i have to say that is almost perfect out the box. The graphics are really great and give a whole atmosphere to the game, and finally get to learn that city that was seen in the original homeworld cutscene. The audio is really good, the sountrack is top notch and the battles are really something, compared to a few reviews i have read up about the durability of units and the lack of, there are some units that have lasted to the last mission from the first mission and there are other units that can take on a fair sized force by themselves with a support cruiser running back up for healing and defense.The cons unfortunately are unit movements, in that when you click attack with a group of units, some of them do not respond on the first second or third attempt, they fire at the target if it's in range but they fail to move. You have to manually move them and then attack the target to get them to move.Minor sound breaking specifically when you got a number of units parked against a rock, it can actually impact the performance by reducing frame rate as well, even with v-sync on there are some signs of tearing (everything on full and max and i have the rated computer for max settings without issue).The final battle with the main enemy ""mothership"" if you like, this unit moves in such a strange way that it makes for long range bombardment hard to do. For example i was going to launch a cruise missile at the target and suddenly the target veered right sideways? I have also seen it move in reverse to the right and it had no angle to do that.I have yet to play multiplayer but early signs are positive.Edit: i have discovered the game is region locked, meaning world wide multiplayer is not possible, so for example, if you are in europe, you can only play european players. there is a way around it however which is the switch your region download to another location, but keep in mind you are switching from one region to another. with that stated, the multiplayer part of the game could degenerate quickly due to a varied lack of players from across the planet to play against.

												A prequel to the award-winning Homeworld series, Deserts of Kharak puts the player in charge of the Kapisi; a half kilometer-long landcarrier on a mission to retrieve a curious artifact deep in enemy territory.At your disposal is a small, albeit adaptable, range of vehicles capable of traversing the dunes with ease.While I'm not that deep into the Homeworld lore I still recommend this game as it is simply awesome; every single detail, from the realistic physics to the radio chatter, provides the dead desert environment with a surprising amount of life.Meanwhile the score builds up an incredible atmosphere as you travel deeper into uncharted areas.For a game set on a desert planet it is absolutely gorgeous visually as vehicles kick up dust, projectiles scorch the sand and as missiles cause realistic explosions.All in all this is definietly worth the buy, especially if you are fan of Homeworld. Good work BBI, I never doubted you for a second.			"

												I have to say I am very pleased with Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. With the story line moving into what we already know about the original Homeworld games it makes it complete. The graphics are well done and gameplay is smooth. I have no idea what people are doing on the boards saying they finished the game in 5-6 hours.  I have been playing for over 13-15 hours and haven't completed it yet. My opinion is those people are the same in most games where they simply blow through everything asap just to say they did it. So I would not take anything they say to heart about Deserts of Kharak. If you enjoyed Homeworld 1 and 2 you will love this game as well!!!			"

Coalition unit in this game are bad in art style or just in shadow of enemy ship's design.-It's personal.

												Homeworld, with all that flavor of space epicness. Add some beautiful Ground Control to make it just more terrain-related and season with Dune. Shake it well and the gorgeous result is Deserts of Kharak.The 10-hour campaign is fantastic. The musics, sound effects, voices, animations are top-notch.It's not a perfect game, but it's one of the best RTS out there. The game is faster than Homeworld 1 and 2 and units are definitely more fragile. During the campaign I missed that pause between skirmishes and battles that allows you to relax and appreciate each single unit deployed on the battlefield (the enemy keeps threading a lot and you have to focus on both strategy and micro management to keep your fleet alive).Anyway, RTS players and Sci-Fi fan: you must try this game. That's an order!WE DEFINITELY NEED HOMEWORLD 3. "

												This game bring back memories of the original Homeworld 1 from the opening scene.  The general feel of homeworld is here, with obivously a lot of care and love put into it.  You can see themes that would evolve into the Homeworld units.  It's a wonderful feeling to get a true Homeworld game again.			"

												Very good game so far with the single player campaign. Had some issues at first where the game would select my integrated CPU instead of my actual graphics card.

Product received for free
												**** For some reason Steam thinks I had a promo copy of the game - I did not ****It's a beautiful game, it FEELS like homeworld, it's every bit as hard. + Gorgeous graphics throughout+ Good use of realistic terrain advantages in combat+ Keeps you thinking at all times - boredom just doesn't happen- Multiplayer is built around rush tactics - don't expect to have a long match against AI or Players- No resource trading makes teamplay somewhat superficial- Defense oriented players are doomed - mobility is key to survival, you must always be on the attackI loved Homeworld; I once stonewalled a Vagyr invasion for an entire hour while my teammates built up for a win.  This game isn't suited to my playstyle alas. If you can grasp the hit-and-run nature and the constant balancing of resources you'll love this. If you're stuck (like me) in a traditional RTS mindset you'll struggle and rage-quit a lot.It's a great game and I wish I was better at it. Hopefully Blackbird will find a way to balance it so that the less adaptable amongst us can keep up, before too many leave the game behind as a flawed gem in the desert sand.			"

This is a very awesome game, it has all what you would expect from a Homeworld game, It's beautiful (like 100/10), the Gameplay is rather easy to learn and the story... well it should have an oscar, you really can see they putted a lot of work in this game, and if you want the complete experience play the other Homeworld, I'll give you a better understanding of this incredible world that is Homeworld!

												""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" The enemy has arranged a number of Rail Guns on a ridge, overlooking the approach as your AAV's barrel up to them, desperately trying to close the range. Your enemy puts his fist in his palm, and lays down ""Paper."" You look down at your own hands...""Rock."" Damn, that's right, AAV's suck vs. Rail Guns. But wait! You quickly order your LAV's to boost up the ridge, and the enemy Rail Guns just can't compete with their speed. ""Scissors,"" you smirk, as your enemy curses you. This more or less describes the micromanagement in the tactics of the game. The better you get with the controls, the quicker you will be able to command your forces, which will work in your favor. You'll want to practice this as well, taking advantage of hot keys, as ""Veterancy"" is awarded to units that survive brutal encounters, and this can make them significantly more powerful.But enough about all of that...the real gem in Deserts of Kharak is the Kapisi. You're introduced to this massive Carrier in the tutorial, a sand crawler/aircraft carrier that slowsly rolls across the sand, pounding enemies with salvos of missiles, cannon fire, strike craft, bombers...and all sorts of other goodies. You'll never be able to build anything as big as it, though the Cruisers you'll eventually construct can hold their own against anything but the Carriers. Even the Kapisi (or just an unnamed Carrier in your Skirmish/Multiplayer games) has micromanagement elements. You utilize a finite amount of Power, which can be upgraded through Research. This Power can be prioritized to Armor, Repair, Firepower and Range systems on the fly, presenting you with a dilemma. This ship, if lost, means your defeat. However, this ship is ridiculously powerful after undergoing some upgrades, so more often than not...you'll find yourself broadsiding enemies like it's ""The Black Pearl"" and having a blast with it.One last thing here before I sum this up: I had stated that Rail Guns had been aligned on top of a ridge in the opening lines of this. Elevation plays a role in determing advantages between units. This also affects the map design, which has many levels of terrain, cliffsides, rolling dunes, and many different landscaping elements. While one would think a desert would be rather bland, this one is riddled with downed starships, ready to be demolitioned and then harvested for precious resources, as well as various craters and abandoned ruins.In Conclusion: 9/10""What's missing? Where'd that 1 point go?"" This game sticks close to the original Homeworld formula. It takes a gamble with the desert terrain and having predominantly land battles, but I would have loved to have seen some kind of ""Home City"" element, similar to Age of Empires III's. In this case, I obviously wouldn't be talking about a city...I'd be talking about a starship, which would be able to provide orbital bombardment, radar scans, land reinforcements, etc. as you'd level it up. Similar to the ""Spirit of Fire"" from Halo Wars. If not this, then some element of base-building/base mechanics. The planet has been engulfed by sand, yet there's no ruined cities overcome by sand that you see. The lack of structures got to me a bit, and this makes the game play a bit more like a nomadic one, in which it's impossible to ""Turtle"" and your base moves across the map, exhausting resources as it goes.

												Well, it's another Homeworld game, and one deserving of the name.The gameplay is great, with hints of Supreme Commander in there and other influences while obviously maintaining that Homeworldy feel. The campaign does a good job (a couple bugs here and there, but nothing that can't be overcome or hopefully patched soon) of showing what the beginning of the Homeworld journey was like. Other game modes show the variety of tweaks and new gameplay features put in to make this game unique. It certainly isn't just Homeworld 1&2 compressed to 2D, but something quite interesting in itself.			"

												Homeworld: DOK is an amazing game. The idea with everything (almost) being mobile, is a nice take on the RTS genre, as is the giant carrier on wheels. Firefights kick up dirt, weapons feels punchy. The background radio chatter is astonishing. Graphics are great too. The game also sports a very nice interface/menu in-game.The best RTS since C&C Generals!I could use a little more zoom-out since many weapons shoot more than a screen length and I would like to do away with deploying logistic modules (which are used to be able to build more units), they are grounded which defeats some of the feel of a mobile army. The same goes for the ability to place fixed turrets. They should be replaced by vehicles.Also, more multiplayer/skirmish options are needed. I would like to be able to have matches without air force for example.Those are minor points, the game has blown me away.			"

												Deserts of Kharak is essentially Homeworld on a planet's surface.  That's the best description I can come up with.  Various vehicles act as near-direct counterparts to ships from the previous two space-side games.  You research to upgrade your units, build up your forces by sending out mining teams, and manage your forces to stay under the population cap, same as Homeworld. Terrain offers minor advantages or disadvantages compared to space, but overall the gameplay is more of the same.  The story plays out through movies with a painting-like aesthetic between missions or in-engine cutscenes during the missions.  Without spoilers, it's a decent story, if that sort of thing matters to you, not superior to original Homeworld but still very solid.In short, if you liked Homeworld, you'll probably dig DoK.  If you were looking for more than that, you'll probably be disappointed.  I myself liked it just fine.			"

												A very good game with a rock-paper-scissors combat system and the classic Homeworld UI that works surprisngly well for a land based RTS game. It focues on the backstory found the in Homeworld instruction manual and expands on it in rather interesting ways. The inclusion of cut-scenes during missions is fairly seamless and works quite well for the story.Unit costs are a bit excessive, I found. It makes you feel every loss as you go (not a bad thing) and that you don't have the option to harvest remaining resources at the end of a mission feels like they want you to drag out each mission as long as possible. The odds increase as you go on, of course, but the high unit prices usually means you're always going to feel like you're on the wrong end of an♥♥♥♥♥kicking in most engagements later on and retreating is a well used tactic.The ending (without spoilers) feels rather jarring and, knowing the Homeworld manual myself, really could have added a bit more onto it to tie it to the first Homeworld game. It reeks of deadline, to me, and expecting you to already know the story ahead of time. Key components of the story are flat out missing at the end.But minor gripes aside, a very entertaining game. Not tried the multiplayer yet.			"

												*EDIT* The game gets better the longer you play it and the multiplayer is very good despite being barebones. I have upped my non-preorder score. I utimately feel as though I rewarded for rolling the dice and buying a game without reading any reviews. After being burned hard by Gearbox for Aliens: Colonial Marines, the company has regained my loyalty. Thanks Gearbox and Blackbird Interactive.Homeworld​: Deserts of Kharak is the best RTS game since StarCraft 2. Although at $49.99 it's a tough value proposition. As an owner of the Homeworld: Remastered Collection I got 20% off and an interactive encyclopedia worth $5.99. I'm a little miffed that the soundtrack was not included, $7.99, and you need to have the game to download it (DLC model). But hey I like pre-order bonuses.The game is stripped down to a refined RTS core and the unit count represents that. Not quite MOBA simplified, but complex enough not to scare that crowd away. You've got a decent papers, rocks, scissors interplay going and a dedicated airstrike platform, your cruiser. If I compared the game to chess, the cruiser would be a queen/king combo. Lose it, you're dead. Yet properly upgraded it will wreck havoc and coordinated airstrikes with ground forces properly erases the opposition from the map, no matter how overwhelming. Cue me whooping like a falcon diving for the kill and a meal.I really like the cover system where elevation actively blocks direct fire and units firing from higher positions get a damage bonus which makes sense for a vehicle based RTS. Armored vehicles are weakest at their rear and turrets in true Company of Heroes fashion (if you like RTS play CoH). I play the game mostly from the satellite view since I like the interface and how informative it is. Relic and employees that used to work for that Canadian studio have the best audio guys in the business. Unit chatter is appropriately stoic with ironic wit (which I like), but most importantly provides valuable information. If a unit is being attacked instead of getting a ping saying ""Yo dude. Your dudes are under attack. Pay attention!""The intel officer or unit itself will simply say ""Strike craft taking effective fire."" Unit chatter can get layered, but the design is genius. It's almost like listening to sports on the radio and being able to picture the battle unfolding. If I had anything negative to say it'd probably be that the game feels too basic at times, sometimes too slow for its own good, and has inconsistent performance. I also encountered a game breaking bug. Not quite Total War Rome 2's caliber where I actually rage quitted in frustration, but the devs were responsive and helpful. The game uses a lot of scripted sequences so I tend to finish secondary objective out of fear of breaking the primary ones.All in all, a great purchase. 9/10 at $39.99 with pre-order bonus and discount. Wait for a steam sale and if you like RTS you'll fall in love with the game and plus the bugs will be ironed out.8.5/10 at $49.99 without expedition guide DLC. The game has quite the solid foundation and will post-release love it should get some wings and take flight. Like the Kushan people fleeing their dying planet where desert erosion slowly erases top soil. No top soil, no food. No food... well that's a terrible way to go if you have water and that's in short supply too.			"

												This is what command and qonquer should have been!Besides, the gameplay is much like the previous homeworld games, you go on a mission with your ""mothership"" ( or in this case a carrier, just like the military ones but than for land ) What i really like in the campaign is that you keep the units and upgrades and everything you had the previous missions!Which makes sense because you're travelling! ( other games are always like, you researched better gear in mission one, oh we have to research it again in mission two! xD makes no sense >.<  )Should you buy it? well if you're dissapointed wit c&c4 you should! If you love Homeworld, you should!Actually you should have preordered because you'd get the homeworld remastered with it as well.. man one hell of a deal!So, i be continuing my search for the artefacts!

												Would i recommend it? Yes! Story, Gameplay, Atmorsphere, it´s all really good. As good as Homeworld 1 or 2? No. But it´s good nonetheless.Buuuut:I have 9,1 hours on record, that includes replaying one of the longer missions just because i wanted to harvest more ressources. And I´m done. On hardest difficulty.This game is really, really easy. And it´s all because of the awful AI, which is, as many others have mentioned aswell, awful. Really really awful. And some of the scripted attacks and movements aren´t that great either. You can win most ""destroy that enemy carrier!"" Missions by sitting around in your comfy and well defended Base bacause the enemy takes the exact same route all the time and is therefore perfectly predictable, making him an easy target for missiles and bombers.I´ll go and play Homeworld 1 now, the remastered edition looks amazing, and is still better than this in any way, which just shows how good the original is.

												A very good game with a rock-paper-scissors combat system and the classic Homeworld UI that works surprisngly well for a land based RTS game. It focues on the backstory found the in Homeworld instruction manual and expands on it in rather interesting ways. The inclusion of cut-scenes during missions is fairly seamless and works quite well for the story.Unit costs are a bit excessive, I found. It makes you feel every loss as you go (not a bad thing) and that you don't have the option to harvest remaining resources at the end of a mission feels like they want you to drag out each mission as long as possible. The odds increase as you go on, of course, but the high unit prices usually means you're always going to feel like you're on the wrong end of an♥♥♥♥♥kicking in most engagements later on and retreating is a well used tactic.The ending (without spoilers) feels rather jarring and, knowing the Homeworld manual myself, really could have added a bit more onto it to tie it to the first Homeworld game. It reeks of deadline, to me, and expecting you to already know the story ahead of time. Key components of the story are flat out missing at the end.But minor gripes aside, a very entertaining game. Not tried the multiplayer yet.			"

												""Rock, Paper, Scissors"" The enemy has arranged a number of Rail Guns on a ridge, overlooking the approach as your AAV's barrel up to them, desperately trying to close the range. Your enemy puts his fist in his palm, and lays down ""Paper."" You look down at your own hands...""Rock."" Damn, that's right, AAV's suck vs. Rail Guns. But wait! You quickly order your LAV's to boost up the ridge, and the enemy Rail Guns just can't compete with their speed. ""Scissors,"" you smirk, as your enemy curses you. This more or less describes the micromanagement in the tactics of the game. The better you get with the controls, the quicker you will be able to command your forces, which will work in your favor. You'll want to practice this as well, taking advantage of hot keys, as ""Veterancy"" is awarded to units that survive brutal encounters, and this can make them significantly more powerful.But enough about all of that...the real gem in Deserts of Kharak is the Kapisi. You're introduced to this massive Carrier in the tutorial, a sand crawler/aircraft carrier that slowsly rolls across the sand, pounding enemies with salvos of missiles, cannon fire, strike craft, bombers...and all sorts of other goodies. You'll never be able to build anything as big as it, though the Cruisers you'll eventually construct can hold their own against anything but the Carriers. Even the Kapisi (or just an unnamed Carrier in your Skirmish/Multiplayer games) has micromanagement elements. You utilize a finite amount of Power, which can be upgraded through Research. This Power can be prioritized to Armor, Repair, Firepower and Range systems on the fly, presenting you with a dilemma. This ship, if lost, means your defeat. However, this ship is ridiculously powerful after undergoing some upgrades, so more often than not...you'll find yourself broadsiding enemies like it's ""The Black Pearl"" and having a blast with it.One last thing here before I sum this up: I had stated that Rail Guns had been aligned on top of a ridge in the opening lines of this. Elevation plays a role in determing advantages between units. This also affects the map design, which has many levels of terrain, cliffsides, rolling dunes, and many different landscaping elements. While one would think a desert would be rather bland, this one is riddled with downed starships, ready to be demolitioned and then harvested for precious resources, as well as various craters and abandoned ruins.In Conclusion: 9/10""What's missing? Where'd that 1 point go?"" This game sticks close to the original Homeworld formula. It takes a gamble with the desert terrain and having predominantly land battles, but I would have loved to have seen some kind of ""Home City"" element, similar to Age of Empires III's. In this case, I obviously wouldn't be talking about a city...I'd be talking about a starship, which would be able to provide orbital bombardment, radar scans, land reinforcements, etc. as you'd level it up. Similar to the ""Spirit of Fire"" from Halo Wars. If not this, then some element of base-building/base mechanics. The planet has been engulfed by sand, yet there's no ruined cities overcome by sand that you see. The lack of structures got to me a bit, and this makes the game play a bit more like a nomadic one, in which it's impossible to ""Turtle"" and your base moves across the map, exhausting resources as it goes.

												When I first installed the game, I was deeply concerned about the small size of it compared to other modern games. We get used to downloading games at 20gb onwards these days. This is a much smaller sized game which makes sense for it's simplicity - and yet the changing scenario storylines never unhook you for a single mission.+ Fully immersive storyline that leads up to it's predecessors (HM1/HM:C/HM2)+ Excellent unit voice acting including passive chatter+ Very unstressed playing atmosphere+ Very easy to use system+ Advanced waypoint management+ Great RTS research trees, unit upgrades, group management systems+ Units are good graphics (ground detail is oddly lacking)- Only 13 missions- Slightly anti-climatic ending			"

												Homeworld: Deserts Of Kharak is an RTS where the campaign is steeped in story and the missions are well-crafted with events and cut-scenes breaking up the action and providing new objectives as you go. There are 13 missions in the game, so it's not that long, but there's a lot to like here for RTS and Homeworld fans. My First Look at the game:

												I wish there was a different choice then Dont Recommend because the game is not bad but its not great either IMO.I feel like if it were 20 bucks i could recommend it.The camera doesnt zoom out far enough when your in non tactical mode, so you spend most of the game just looking at a blue screen with maneuvering green dots around on it.The gameplay is MEH, lets be honest here people there is not much for strategy here, the Strike Aircraft can own all, once you build a full fleet of them I was just sending them out to pretty much EVERYTHING, it was kinda pathetic really, no ground units were really needed other than harvesters.The graphics are nothing great, and the environments are bland, I get it I get it, its a desert but why couldnt there be some cool set pieces or some sort of atmosphere to liven things up.Im not trying to be pedantic I am enjoying the story but the actual game itself is so MEH, made me want to go play Homeworld Remasterd to be honest.  I dont feel like the ""homeworld feel"" really does well with ground combat.Id give the game a 5 out of 10 and id recommend playing Homeworld Remastered...			"

												Deserts of Kharak is a love letter to both Homeworld games that came before it.  A beautiful re-imagining of the original games, modernized similar to the HD re-releases Gearbox put out earlier this year.  From its unique art style, rousing music, to its masterful balance of your typical rock paper scissor mechanics found in most RTS games, its about as polished and well made as any RTS game released in the last decade.  The story, while a bit light, which is usual for games in this genre, still manages to hit the right notes and provide some great Sci Fi story telling.  It provides a thrilling backstory to the Homeworld universe, with unique a varied mission objectives.  I didn't mind the desert environments, each map feeling hand crafted.If I had any complaints, it was the length of the campaign.  Similar to the previous homeworlds, it only had 13 missions in total.  There were several late game units that I didn't feel I had time to learn how to use, or bring to bare in an exciting way against my enemies.  Aircraft can also feel like an ""I win"" button for several early mission, but are balanced later in the game when anti air vehicles become more prevalent.  The land carrier, which takes the place of the mother-ship from previous games, feels a bit too strong.  I did enjoy the overhead mechanics which had me switching between systems, but with a few repair vehicles near by I never felt it was at threat.Over all, one of the best RTS games I've played in years.  More grand strategy, then your typical Star Craft twitch / micromanagement play style.I'm really hoping they continue the Homeworld series.			"

												I'd have to say that after all of the hype about the Homeworld series, this game is just another example of how a company got a great idea to slap a legendary title on their game to sell more copies and then half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥making the game. In an RTS, the very core of the game is the factions/units/abilities of anything you can touch. This game has 2 very basic factions that arent that much different except for the way they look. I certainly expected more, Good job though you marketing jerks, you got my money again. I am very disappointed with this purchase.			"

Getting upgrades wasn't that noticable. And the new improvements were also blah. I'd of like to of seen more.			"

												Story wise, the game may have potential, at least I liked what I saw 6 hours in, but gameplay wise it's nothing but hard counters and micromanagement against endless waves of enemy designs, which I find digustingly dull. Add to that the inability to change unit formations from a staggered box, let alone formation direction which is quite important in a game that has both line of sight and terrain elevation bonuses, you get not only a boring game but a frustratingly incomplete game one at that.I can only hope that the original Homeworld's gameplay is radically different to it's successor, because I could only just barely consider this a real time strategy game.

												I really didn't know which thumb to put but i'm sorry, this game is not up to my expectation because of one (one!) critical feature.The game is fairly good,The voice acting is great, the story is nice and graphic is awesome.Units are varied and have all weak and strong spots.All should be good but since i can not stop and plan my steps, as there is no pause button that allow you to give commands.the moment I command a large army, the 10 groups i can assign are a drop in the ocean to help me manage my forces against 3 fronts.the game feels like it loses its fairness when it comes to large forces vs large forces as we were used to in homeworld.instead i spend too much time watching the scanner rather than the awesome graphic and too much time feeling like ""♥♥♥♥♥♥where these cruisers?! not the support! the assault ones! damn too late"".the cinematic parts are amazing but get annoying when I watch them for the 3rd time.it feels so stupid i can't skip.

												I must say, I was frustrated wit the developers on this one. Great product gone bad. Here is an outlook of the first 3 months of release...Initial impression, Engaging campaign, Gorgeous landscape and graphics, overall gameplay and physics pretty spot on.Then came the multiplayer/comp stomp experience... absolutely awful. I look to the maps available and at release I believe it was 4... yes, 4 maps. Games in the 1990's had a better selection of battlegrounds to wage war on (since then they've slowly added but every other game out there has more maps still) .Region locking issues, the worst AI i've ever encountered in a game. I've played starcraft, total annihilation, red alert, warcraft, dawn of war, company of heroes... yes.. this game blows with AI. Some AI units dont respond when being attacked, some games it's the same 5 scout units routinely attacking me in 5min intervals, some games you literally could win with 1 type of unit, the AI is not intelligent.Then came cash grab tactics.. Look at the release date, Jan 20th. In two months after release they release a PAID fleet pack. 2 months after the game came out!! Oh wait, they put another fleet pack out a month after that one too! If you can whip out two fleet packs but take two months to make one AI patch that had a minimal impact on AIIt's ridiculous on how developers are about cash grabs and taking advantage of the faithful like myself who preordered the game and have been a lifelong fan of homeworld.My suggestion, wait til the game comes on sale for about 20 bucks and you can enjoy some pretty visuals, a decent campaign, and lackluster AI.Recap: + Visuals, Gameplay mechanics, Campaign- Annoying Bugs, Unresponsive/Lackluster AI, Greedy Devs, Weak online community/multiplayer, limited map selection "

Posted: January 20, 2016
												I've clocked a little over an hour into the game and completed the first three (of what I believe is around 10-12 missions for the story) and have stopped for now to provide a review and feedback.My initial reaction to playing the game, is that there are some deep seeded homeworld aspects that are missing from the game, this was something I was expecting due to the limited press demo's provided prior to the games release.Homeworld as a series remains my all-time favourite, I am an owner of the Remastered Collectors Edition and have dumped quite a few hours into that now that I can play homeworld on a modern PC. The negative feedback I have is such:Map Texture quality Seems very low, I am running the game on maximum settings and the sand and scenery simply doesn't add the same atmosphere that you see in the pre-rendered footage.No Unit Interactions like Homeworld 1-2Unit interactions are a generation behind the original homeworld games. In Homeworld 1, when your resource harvester collected materials and returned to hand them in, you could actually watch it dock with your resource controller/mothership and transfer the resources back. The resource controller in DoK looks like it was going to have something similar, but they didn't finish implementing it, instead, when your resource collectors reach your collector, the mineral bar vanishes and they move off for their next collection.No DockingAnother cool and fun Sci-fi aspect of Homeworld was docking, the fact that after a run, you could dock your strike craft with your mothership or carriers for more efficient repairs (and in Catacylsm, retro-fitting), there is no docking in DoK, once your carrier spits out a new unit it outside for good, with the extremely shot repair range on the other vessels, repairing large groups of small craft is fiddly and annoying rather than engaging and fun.With your main 'mothership' in DoK being a Carrier, I was expecting the same mechanicCutscene RenderingSeveral of the cut-scenes seem a little poorly rendered, the art-style itself is fantastic, but again on a modern game on a very high-end PC, I expected more crisp visuals than how they are displaying on my PC.Zoom controls These seem way too limited, I find myself constantly wanting to zoom out more, the maximum limit feels very claustraphobic, resulting in an awful lot of scrolling around and quick-tabbing to the sensors manager just to view short distances, unlike again the original homeworld games where you could zoom out to a great degree for unit selection and controlsomfg, why is the main menu on F10 and not ESC like 99% of games?!?!I was taking part in a mission and needed to pause, to my surprise, ESC did nothing, I started spamming every key on the keyboard until suddenly one of them opened the game menu, I was then able to check the key-bindings (which, are fixed btw and cannot be remapped) and discover that mid-game, the main menu is accessed from F10 (whyyyyyyyyyyyyy).SummaryMaybe my expectations are too high, considering that Homeworld 1 + 2 are multi-award, ground breaking titles, but I at least, from my perspective was expecting more, not because it's a homeworld prequal, but but because it was made by the core guys that made the original HW games, I was expecting an evolution of mechanics, not a simplification that in many ways looks like a step-back to me, or, unfinished implementation due to a rushed development and launch.

The only few downsides to this game are the facts that it is shorter than I would like, and it's multiplayer doesn't give players much room to work with, with few maps, and no game modes whatsoever besides DM/TDM and Artifact Retrieval. The final downside is the lack of modding support, something that Homeworld Remastered Collection offers.			"

												First of all i LOVE Homeworld I and II , but this .. They could have done much more, but i think they missed their own target. Espacially ship wracking. It would have been so cool if you would cut out pieces of the ship an harvest the wrecks itself. No. just normal mineral harvesteing. Or putting c4 next to some wrecks, make them explode aaaand harvest minerals ... so sad. I would say if you dont play it you wont miss anything. If you really want to play it, wait a year for better price and maybe some better content, KI , etc.Pro:* Nice graphics, also ist always desert* Sound is nice, like we are used to in Homeworld. Much com talking makes great ambience* Story, its not really a pro but its okay. Nothing special, okay but not more.Con:* Difficulty, i play it first time on hardest lvl. Simply run throug in 7 hours ... really ?? I think way too less for this price.* KI, its just stupid and not reacting to anything.* Keys, arrow keys for map moving ! Why ? :( and you cant even change it. There is no way to move the map with awsd* Campaign bugs, if you dont do only what you are supposed to do, you can f*** up the scripts and you get stuck in a lvl. ( happend 2 times :( )* Units doesnt move together. Everyone who played Homeworld loves to have that big♥♥♥♥♥formations. Not in here. The small buddys go ahead and die alone if you dont pay attantion all the time.* Hotkey, for a Strategie game not enough to configurate.* Air units, if you use them right, they are just OP. But to use them you have to chose your carrier every time.. its a pain...* 2 Types of minerals, Why ? even on hard i never lacked even of one type. Nice try but totally worthlessSorry for my bad english ;)			"

												This is a portion of a larger review... if you want to read the whole thing, I put a link at the bottom.Deserts of Kharak’s strongest element is assuredly its campaign. The campaign is hauntingly atmospheric, full of starkly vast spaces and lonely stretches of desert, and challenging. I’ll touch on this more in my next section. The multiplayer, at least in the game’s launch state, falls short of the promise of the game’s mechanics.One of the strongest and most interesting elements of the game is the Carrier’s mobility. However, in both the campaign and the multiplayer, this seems oddly de-emphasized. It is as if the developers were being cautious, or were unsure of how to design around this unique feature. In the campaign, the Carrier is often left up on a plateau or stuck down in the dunes, while its armies swarm around the map completing objectives and fighting Gaalsien battlegroups. Similarly, in multiplayer, I seldom found myself moving the Carrier much, if at all, especially when playing Gaalsien.The layout of most multiplayer matches incorporates a somewhat traditional RTS setup, with roughly a third or so of each map sectioned off into a “base sector” or “home turf” for each player, and it is in these that most or all resources on the map are found. The central and contested map area tends to feature the mach objectives: 3 automatically respawning relics Artifacts that must be collected by a player’s Baserunner and deposited at their drop-off zone. The first player to retrieve 5 of these Artifacts (or who destroys their opponent’s Carrier) is the winner.In practice, this setup actually works fairly well for the most part, aside from the negligible mobility requirements for the Carrier (which to me are a crying shame). Conceptually, I have some deep issues with this setup.First of all, despite the attention to detail the rest of the game receives, drop-off areas are just an arbitrarily-placed ring of pylons on the map. There’s no real asset or logically-driven factor behind the placement of these zones: the only goal was apparently to have such a zone and to place it in an area of the map roughly equidistant to each player’s start location. In terms of map design, it’s functional but scarcely supportable. Any existing game asset: structures, dropships, some sort of supply cache etc, would make this design more sensible within the game’s context. I certainly hope that future map designs take into account the story they’re telling. What are they delivering their artifacts to?Also, the Artifacts themselves automatically self-extract at regular intervals. Sensible, to be sure, but again a bit uninspired. Perhaps such a design was tested and turned down, but I can’t help but want my Baserunner to have to manually extract each Artifact, and to defend it while the artifact is extracted, and then defend it (as is currently the case in multiplayer) en route to the drop-off zone. Such a system should seem to feel, to me, more satisfying mechanically as well as in the context of the story. Should they release modding tools for the game, I plan to test such a system myself.The pacing of multiplayer feels appropriate to me, with matches tending to last around 10 minutes if the players are matched well, the player constantly expanding their force and building new units, the choices the player is making being meaningful: tech to air, or focus on railguns, or power through to cruisers? Scouting is difficult, thanks to Carriers coming equipped with weapons of not inconsiderable firepower.Actually, I have found that Carriers are well situated within the context of the game. They’re able to take out small groups of units early on, but midgame armies give them pause, and can wear them down over time. Late-game units pose a serious threat, and if Carriers take them out, it would be with considerable damage to their hulls. So, the Carrier ends up being a powerful supporting unit without devolving into a MOBA-style hero (which would be a tragedy).With access to the full unit lists of both factions, I’ve become more-or-less at peace with the unit design in Deserts of Kharak. Unit abilities are a welcome addition, such as the Gaalsien Missle Cruiser’s ground-targeted area of effect attack, which damages friendly units as well as foes, and is a counter to enemy light attack vehicles only if it manages to hit them. Rail Guns still feel odd to me as an alternative to artillery weapons, but as I mention in my preview, they work well with the game’s line of sight system so I can appreciate the choice.Air units feel quite powerful, but I believe that a recent patch (released shortly before the publication of this article) implemented a balance fix to air units. Additionally, in opposition to my earlier statement, air units can, in fact, be individually controlled, though their default area attack command is a simple way to get some mileage out of them. They are best handled through the sensors manager, by the way.On the topic of air units, the game’s counter system escalates greatly with the addition of Air, and Cruisers, each of which require a deep commitment from the opposing player in order to properly counter. Cruisers have many times the hull integrity of smaller craft, making them require a significant anti-armor investment from opponents, and air units move fast and hit hard, requiring (again) significant preparation from opponents to properly counter.http://waywardstrategist.com/2016/02/02/in-the-dunes-the-carriers-deserts-of-kharak-non-review/ "

												Alright, I really wanted to like this game, but in the end everything came together to put a ""No"" on the review.HW:DoK aims to revitalize the Homeworld series, something the Remastered Collection has already done to be honest...and that did a far better job.In this game, space is obviously no longer an issue, so there are no movements in a three dimensional space. Instead there is elevation, and elevation is pretty dull. Not only is it difficult to position your units, the effects are also difficult to gauge, i.e. you have no clue if your units are now suddenly stronger or not. Units also level up. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t imho. This means more damage, more hp, more range, etc., which kills game balance and makes it even more desastrous if you lose one of your fragile units, since those are all you have for the majority of the campaign until you get actual cruisers 2/3rds in.The campaign itself is actually ok and has several interesting missions. Too bad that the presentation got stuck in the late 90s as well. Homeworld worked, because it was in space. If it had not been in space, I doubt people would have liked it much. It was mysterious, intriguing. Kharak is not. Everything is obviously yellow-tinged, because you are on a sand planet. This game would have more to it if it had different tile sets, but of course that is not possible, since we are playing on mo♥♥♥♥ing Kharak, a DESERT planet...you know another game that tried a desert only setting? Dune, repeatedly. Know why it worked every time? Because the factions were inherently different. In Kharak you have 2 main factions, which are pretty much identical. One uses tracked vehicles, the other hover vehicles (which should be far superior in a desert environment), yet they have exactly the same units with some very minor differences (i.e. railgun and assault railgun + heavy railgun for whatever reason). Baseline is: there is nothing for you to care about the world or the factions, since there is very little exposition. If you've played the HW games, good job, you know at least something.There IS a story guide, which they sell separately!!!!You know what they also sell separately? 2 new factions!!!! for 7 bucks each!!!!You know what these factions do differently than the existing ones? I don't. They are reskins with stat tweaks.That alone has prompted me to rate the game negatively. I don't see a point in skirmish, not with 2 or 4 factions. The differences are just too minor. Heck TOTAL ANNIHILATION had more unit variety between the two very similar factions.Then there's the engine. For whatever reason this game (a unity engine game for whatever reason) doesn't run well. I've tried everything I can think of, but since there is no official guide from the devs, or heck even performance patches, the game continues to ""stutter"" every few seconds, usually every time something blows up, but not every time. I have no idea why, is it the monitor? The graphics card? Sound? Does the game want me to unplug my second monitor even though it is disabled? Would that even help? Not worth the hassle to find out, because it shouldn't be, but I guess I can consider myself lucky, because at least I can somewhat play it at all, and not have frequent crashes or drops to 3 FPS. That's just unacceptable.Of course we also have ""bugs"" or ""features""? Dunno, which. For example, your strike craft (what counts as planes here, so fighters, bombers, etc.) are a hassle to use. You first have to select your carrier (Home button or a control group), then press a button for the appropriate type of craft, to then send them out to a fixed location. If the enemy moved you have to then SELECT those strike craft on the map (have fun) and order them to manually attack that target which is now out of range. Bombers just act weirdly in general and gunships are used for target practice by the enemy. I wish you could tell them to disengage when they get fired upon...naaaaaaah, just let em die *sigh*. When your craft are finally done with striking or dying the return to your carrier...and potentially hover there for 5 minutes before landing, even if you manually order them or press the button on the carrier (which seems to do nothing).Speaking of buttons that do nothing: There seem to be more like this in the game...Units wise the game is also severely lacking in general. There's harvesters obviously, your carrier, which is a weapons platform (actually a good thing), the aircraft, light attack vehicles that are useful only very early on in the game, since a group of them gets oneshot later one (bye bye hundreds of resources in an instant) and do virtually no more damage. The only reason to maybe have a squad would be to chase off railguns. Then there's tanks, which don't deserve the name, since they do almost no damage, are slow and weak against railguns and everything above. Speaking of railguns: these are just the better tanks in the game imho. They have massive range and damage and if you can spot the enemy, you can just dismantle them before they get too close. And when they do, you just retreat your railguns and let your cruisers take over. Cruisers are also weird, they're either low up high speed or the opposite. I wonder why I would ever build slow cruisers with limited range in a world where railguns exist that can kill these things before they even fire once if they have max range. Some cruisers are equipped with mortars. Great. Cool. Too bad when they kill your own units because they fire right into them. Oh ""deactivate auto fire then"" you say. Sure, but then they won't attack at all anymore.... I've tried. They just sit there. WTF? Meh. I forgot the base runner, which deploys turrets...and there's also AA vehicles. As you've guessed it, all factions have these units. Yay.For a 2015 or 2016 game Deserts of Kharak just doesn't offer enough originality and diversity. The campaign may entertain you a bit for a few hours, but ultimately Kharak annoyed me more than it gave me pleasure. Buy at your own risk. For Homeworld fans I'd say it's also not very important, since the general story of how they got into space is already documented in the HW manuals. If we at least got way more exposition with Rachel...instead she is degraded to heal your units and have a few voice lines in the (not really) animated cutscenes (they're half animated comics). These fit the theme, but in the end...meh. It would have been cooler if we had had 4 distinct factions from the get go, that all played a role in the campaign.			"

												No tactical pause to allow you a moment to think and make decisions or just to admire the look of the game.  No ability to change the speed so you can watch the enemy perish in slow mo.  Both very odd design decisions - a shame...  The look and feel of the game is great though.			"

												Fun for a while but very limited in scope and not all that many units to chose from and a very low unit limit  severly reduces its replayability compared to even old classic rts titles.This was just very dissapointing to play in skirmish mode. I tried the story but to be honest im not all that interested in game stories so i wasnt interested enough to continue.On the plus side it looks good and i like the whole mobile base carrier side of things.looked at the Dlc and it didnt seem to offer all that much of a difference for the price so yeah i didnt buy them.Definitily not worth £29.99 UK, i bought it on sale on £15 and with the content available i feel that was too steep. I really wanted this to be a fun game that i would play on skirmish for a long time  but its just lacking  too much variety for the price. Id suggest either old Command and Conquers or Total Annihilation(especially with the mods available that add so much to the game) over this anyday.			"

												I am astonished at how this game is rated so highly, especially when most of those buying/playing this game, I suspect, have played homeworld 1 + 2. The is some enjoyment to be found but its short lived and just not worth the price tag or time. The are a number of major issues I have with this game. 1) The game feels rushed and unfinished. For example, the appearance of some unit models doesn't fit with their final game-play implementation e.g. coalition support cruises, which function as armoured mobile resource drop of points for collectors and repair bays for all vehicles, have a large gaping whole in them where presumably collectors were supposed to dock and off-load their resources and/or where vehicles could dock for repairs. Instead resources just magically transfer from collectors to support cruises or the main carrier when the collector gets within a set range, this is similar to the coalition repairing mechanism; instead of docking, your vehicles are healed by magic beams when they are within a set range of a repair vehicle such as the support cruiser. I can understand why the developers might have changed the game-play mechanisms at a late stage; maybe they ran out of time, or it was too difficult to implement them properly, or they were causing problems/balance issues, but if so they should at least alter/re-designed the appearance of the units affected to fit with the new game-play mechanics, not doing so is just lazy. 	Interceptors/strike fighters for all intensive purposes play like bombers even though both factions also have dedicated bomber units as well. Each interceptor (Gaalsien) or strike fighter (Coalition) carries a single ""missile"" which it can only fire at ground targets so its essentially a small guided bomb, they do not have any other weapons and so can NOT attack other air units. I assume from their names ""interceptor"" and ""fighter"" they were originally intended to be primarily air to air fighters and likely a hard counter to bombers and gunships, instead they just work like bombers and are arguable better at bombing than the actual bombers themselves and neither faction has any aircraft capable of fighting other aircraft which just seems silly.	If you order a redundant unit to be decommissioned/recycled/retired and get back a fraction of the resources used to make it, instead of returning into the carrier through the entrance (in an opposite manner to if you had just made the unit), as you would expect, the unit just clips through to the centre of the carrier from any point on the surface of the carrier which just looks stupid and breaks any immersion.  2) Why can I not dock my units!? An integral and incredibly useful feature of the homeworld games was the ability to dock smaller ships with your capital ship(s). With Deserts of Kharak this feature is no more, not even the smallest of vehicles such as resource collectors can be docked. Why this feature was not included is beyond me, it would have been so useful to have been able to dock units like resource collectors and small light vehicles, to protect them during attacks such as air strikes, instead you have to micro babysit them to keep them alive, which becomes a chore and general pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ The only units that are capable of docking with the capital carrier are the aircraft, and this is only because of the way aircraft work in the game.3) The campaign is ridiculously easy (including the ""hardest"" setting) and showcases a very special A.I. You can quite easily burn through all the missions in quick succession on the ""hardest"" difficulty (classic) without a challenge; it is also relatively easy to get through the whole campaign, on classic, without loosing a single unit, albeit at a slower pace. One issue is that the computer players, both enemies and allies in the campaign, rely almost exclusively on scripted build routines, scripted patrols and scripted attacks; they have no need for resources and can see the whole map. To be fair the AI was similar in homeworld 1+2 but that is no excuse for not improving it.4) The game feels like a downgrade from Homeworld 1+2. I understand that Deserts of Kharak is suposed to be a different game, with different features and setting (on a planet/2D as opposed to in space/3D), but the developers have deliberately made the game-play extremely similar to the previous homeworld games (which is not a bad thing) so the is no logical reason not to keep in things like the ability to dock smaller vehicles which would have been an extremely useful feature as well as adding to immersion. In actual fact this game is identical gameplay wise to the original homeworld games but missing features and depth (literally); it adds nothing which is a huge shame because I feel that this game could of been very good.	The campaign is very short (as with other homeworld games) and the story is ok but not great and feels fairly bland, I also get the impression that the lead up to the ending was rushed. I've come to expect and accept very generic/bland story's from games in general but because of this games predecessors I expected a bit more.The majority of my issues with the game could have fairly easily of been remedied with patches after launch but the developers instead thought it would be a ""better"" idea to re-skin a faction and sell it as DLC ><Like I have mentioned the game is not bad as such and it does have some good points, which I will now list. It looks pretty, runs relatively smoothly with only a few bugs (that I have noticed), random radio chatter (good for immersion), units are reasonably scaled.In conclusion, currently I do not recommend this game. if you have not played homeworld 1+2, buy the remastered edition of them, it is cheaper, and you get 2 games, both of which are better than this one. If you have already played homeworld 1+2 and want to play this game, I would still not recommend it, its far better to replay homeworld 1+2 and just read the plot of Deserts of Kharak on-line if you want to know the story. If you just want to play a new RTS then keep looking, the have been a few good and a lot of rubbish RTS games released recently. Personally I found Act of Aggression to be surprisingly enjoyable but I know a lot of people do not like it.			"

												Pretense this here first, I think this is a good game, but it's not really up to the standards of todays games.We are in an era where we have a blurring number of games, and other forms of entertainment, so we have little time or money to spare on other things, and I really can't suggest Deserts of Kharak as a good option.You can feel the age of the games design in how closely it follows with Homeworld.  Very linear story, not a lot of change of scenary, relatively short campaign, no real closure at the end.Artistically it's an amazingly beautiful game.  The ship/structure designs are top notch, and the visuals and cut scenes are wonderous pieces of art, but it really feels more like an episode of a telltale game more than a fleshed out world.There is not a lot of replayability in the game despite multiplayer but few of my friends even got the game, so it heralds back to an age where massively multiplayer options were just not an option.  Lastly it feels like the difficulty ramps down slowly from the beginning then immediately near the end they dump more power than you'd ever be able to really need or want, so it steals any excitement near the crucial climax of the game.If you have nothing else you'd rather play, or spend your money on, the game is still very homeworld-esque.  Great music score, amazing visuals in mechanical design, and cut scenes, but ultimately it feels like an incomplete story, no denouement almost at all, and odd unveiling of tech progression that holds the best till last stealing a lot of the challenge from early game.

												I'm a diehard Homeworld fan. Playing the original on Windows 98 when I was 7 got me into gaming, and since then I've played hundreds of games, yet none have matched Homeworld's place in my heart. Naturally, expectations were high for this game, perhaps unfairly so.Needless to say I was super excited to hear another Homeworld game was being made, but was equally terrified when it was announced it wouldn't be in space. Here's the impressions I've gotten so far (Mission 7, about 6 hours in)Positives:The story is great, like Homeworld stories always are.Strong voice acting - it's nice to have several people to identify with rather than just Karan S'Jet.Compelling enigmatic enemy - knowing the lore of the subsequent games makes it a lot more fun to learn about the Gaalsien.Soundtrack is classic Homeworld - almost too similar - did they actually use the same sound files?Cinematics are much improved - I loved seeing the interiors of the ""ships"" and the character's faces.Improved chatter - background chatter when things are slow really helps to build the immersion.Artifacts - although it seems to break with the HW canon, shipbreaking and collecting artifacts to beef up your ships is fun.Alas, despite all that is done well here, there are some things that at least for now have made it tough to recommend this game.Negatives:Unless you have a BRAND NEW beast of a machine, this game won't look good. I have a 4th gen i7, 8GB of RAM, and a 2GB dedicated Nvidia 745m with Windows 10, and it BARELY runs on the lowest settings. As such, my framerate is horrific, and the textures are so bad it reminds me of the 98 version of HW1. This confuses me, as I have beautiful games like Ethan Carter and HW Remastered running at 60fps on ultra. With such a laggy framerate (I'm lucky if I hit 30), immersion is instantly broken. Guess it's time to save up for yet another rig?Space is Homeworld's secret ingredient:I liked the idea of a prequel on Kharak, but space is what Homeworld does best. Watching little trucks dance around each other shooting 50 cals isn't nearly as glorious or boner-inducing as gigantic spaceships blowing the crap out of each other with big lasers. I tried so hard to like the ground fight, but the next HW project REALLY needs to head back out to space! PLEASE!Units die INCREDIBLY fast. I get it - Homeworld is designed to be a challenge by forcing you to discern the correct strategy (that's what makes it fun.) But this game punishes you like other Homeworlds never did. Your fleet will be wiped out in less than 30 seconds if you make one mistake in building your fleet. As such, you have to save OFTEN and reload those checkpoints more than I'd like.No resourcesOn one hand, I like the sense of desperation having little to no resources gives. But when my fleets are being wiped out in an instant and there are no resources left, I'm SOL and have to start again. Worse still, the old HW's had a mechanic that automatically collected any RU's left over at the end of a mission. Not the case here! Your mission will suddenly complete and your mining will be left unfinished, leaving you with nothing to rebuild next mission. While you can use a ""default"" fleet, that just feels like a cheat to me.Under constant assaultSo far, with the exception of the first mission, I have been under constant attack on multiple fronts, meaning 90% of my time is spent in the map instead of absorbing the beautiful desert world Blackbird worked so hard on building. I have no problem with coming under attack, but let me smell the desert roses a little first!I love the Homeworld universe to death and want to support this game in hopes of a HW3, but be warned - you need a beast PC to run this - and going from 3 dimensions to 2.5 will feel like a step in the wrong direction.

												As a long time fan of the Homeworld franchise (I remember getting the original for Christmas when I was in high school) I am sadly wishing I could get a refund... but unfortunately I have spent 5 hours with the game and can no longer do that.The good:-Interesting story- just like the other Homeworld games.-Very strong art direction (looks and feels like Homeworld)-Good visuals (it can sometimes be hard to discern what units are what when not in overlay mode though)-Good UI and game mechanics feel solid.The bad:-Laughably weak AI for skirmish. The devs should be embarassed by how incompetent the Normal AI is. The only reason the Hard AI is ""hard"" is because it is given a resource advantage and just kind of throws units at you. -Only 5 skirmish maps (2 2-player maps, 2 4-player maps, and 1 6-player map)-Very condensed game space and very small fleet cap. The one place this game does not feel like Homeworld is in its scope- battles tend to be much smaller tactical affairs. Honestly, I don't even know if I will finish the campaign. I would almost rather just play HW: Remastered or Planetary Annihilation: Titans.Since I already had HW: Remastered the game was $40 instead of $50.			"

												campaign was quite nice and enjoyable but lets face it with games these days its all about the multiplayer so how does that go? well if you like games like starcraft and you can build up ultra fast resources and pump out units like nobodies business then your gonna love this. if however your like me and find starcraft a bit too spammy and in all honesty just too damned fast then prepare to love literally EVERY game as your lovely little workers slowly toil away and they get utterly wrecked by what seems to be 10 thousand units, and if you manage to fend them off dont relax because ine xactly 5 seconds an even bigger army is coming your way. The matchmaking completly sucks because of region locking so you wait ages (ive seen the queue timer hit 30 minutes then i gave up) and when you finally get a game you get stomped because the person your matched against is simply FAR better than you and its not even close to a contest. The only way to have fun online is public games but of course this means no rank gained etc. I wouldnt mind this but i feel im at very least a silver player but being matched against players who should be diamond rank is just insane. So for the campaign yes i liked it, kinda worth the money but now its going to sit in my steam library unplayed because the multiplayer is so unbalanced its unreal			"

												First off, for a DirectX 9c game, this is very impressive and runs on older hardware for how nice it actually looks.Sure I've noticed a few people complaining about nvidia cards not really working with the game, go add it to your control panel and turn off your extra gpus...The gameplay, if you Bull rush every objective, like any homeworld game series can be incredibly short.  Good luck calling yourself a true Homeworld player though, thats not how you play Homeworld games.Go out, learn the game and take your time in it, learn how to not take heavy losses in each mission and gather up resources for the next.  I refuse to give you any spoilers other then the Story is about how the Kushan from Homeworld 1 got the tech for their mothership.Sure the gameplay could be a little more, but its meant to keep a certain Homeworld feel to it, and for that I respect its changes and limits on the units.  Don't knock it before you try it you know.Lastly, if your not a Homeworld fan, well maybe you should go watch a youtube review about this first instead of read up on other peoples twisted views, including mine.-Edit: Will point out this, they really need to go about getting us some more skirmish maps.

I've seen some complaints about the AI, but it's certainly giving me a challenge on normal.			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is the prequel to one of the most highly acclaimed real-time strategy games of all time and it comes from some of the original developers and their new studio Blackbird Interactive. Although it started off its life as more of a spiritual successor, Gearbox acquired the developer, allowing Blackbird to use the Homeworld IP and it doesn't feel slapped on. Every part of the product, from the gameplay to the presentation, is oozing with original Homeworld flavor, with the exception, of course, of 3D movement.

												A lot of people say this is absolutely a Homeworld game... despite not being in space and set on a desert planet. Well, they're right. The music, the art, the story, the design of the units, the vast emptiness of the environments... it's all here. Do not be put off by the fact that it's set on the ground... because Blackbird Interactive definitely know what made the Homeworld games tick (and so they should - many of those guys worked on the originals) and they've served it up in spades.If you've never played a Homeworld game before, then imagine Supreme Commander set on a desert planet with Frank Herbert's Dune running on repeat in the background with your drunk mate mistaking it for Stargate every few minutes. It's that kind of scale - there are no human infantry here (your smallest unit - an attack buggy that is little more than a speck when zoomed out - is the size of a Monster Truck when considering scale to a person). This is all powered by the Unity 5 engine... and it looks spectacular. You'd think being set on a desert planet would make it look a bit samey but yikes, does this engine shine.The game itself is divided into a campaign, a skirmish, and multiplayer. The campaign is simply awesome. A prequel campaign set prior to (and covering) the discovery that kicked off the Mothership project in Homeworld 1, it's interesting to see the nods it makes to the future. I'd say it's closer to Homeworld 2 than 1, but has the same kind of themes in both - discovering the past of the Kushan, all the while fighting a war of seemingly insurmountable odds. Your 'Mothership' in this one is no colony vessel - the Kapisi is basically the USS Nimitz on tank treads and serves as a battleship, aircraft carrier, nuke platform, factory and research facility. Your fleet is persistent - units that survive one mission carry over into the next - and really makes it feel like you're running a fleet of craft just like the older Homeworld games - only you're exploring the vast desert instead of the stars. It's great.Skirmish is a bit more by the numbers. While the overall presentation and campaign is great, the actual factions are a bit dry - with only really the Gaalsien (imagine if ISIS and the Brotherhood of Nod had a lovechild and you're not far off) showing any real futuristic flair. The other base game faction - the Coalition - is about as bland as you can get (tanks, buggies, artillery, big tanks, big artillery and so on). This, mixed with patchy AI, make the skirmish a bit 'serviceable' rather than amazing. If you get the deluxe edition then you get a pair of DLC factions - Soban (Coalition who've kind of realised that they need to up their tech and use more railguns) and Kaaneph (Mad Max guys who nick their stuff from the Gaalsien). They're a bit better, but there is no deep tactical differences going on here. Everyone has rough variations of the same units.Multiplayer appears to be dead. Kaput. According to the forums there is still a small community out there, but tbh there are better RTSs if you want MP.The deluxe edition comes with the aforementioned DLC, an expedition guide (think Wikiapp with everything you ever wanted to know about Homeworld prior to the Homeworld 1) and the excellent soundtrack from the same guy who did the first two soundtracks. Personally, I got it in the Steam sale and I consider it easily worth that price... but at full price? You'd need to think about that.Regardless though... if you like sci-fi RTS, or you like Homeworld, you honestly can't go wrong here. The major complaint I've got with it is that it made me want to replay Homeworld 1 again, right when I was gearing up for an XCOM2 re-run. Damn it.EDIT: Updating this review to justify my nomination of this game for the  'I've got something in my eye' award. If you've played the campaign and seen the last few missions in particular.... yep.			"

												I could go on and on about what's awesome and what is just flat out wrong with this game for hours. I might even make a review about it on youtube, since there's a lot to discuss. In the end however, to do that here would end up in a TL:DR for most people. So I will simply say this:  when compared to Command and Conquer (C&C) 3, arguably the greatest land-based RTS game ever created (and from where I think this game got a lot of its inspiration from), this newest title of the beloved Homeworld franchise falls short of the RTS genre standard in its current state. In truth the game, without all of the bugs it has right now (and they are Legion, even causing my game to crash while in a skirmish here and there), comes off a lot more like C&C 4--what with the whole mobile base and hardly any fixed structures thing.Don't get me wrong. I like this game. I think it has massive potential. But the gameplay is restrictive, nothing on the villain's side I've played seems to work, In fact the Gaalsiens seem very rushed. And overall there seems to be an insufficient amount of asymmetrical gameplay between the two factions. It is there, but there could be more, WAY more. That all briefly said, I cannot recommend this game where it is now. Although, I do trust that there will be patches and definite DLC content added to this game. Being a student of business and the entrainment industry, I know what the developers have done with this title. It's a thing that's happening all over film, television, and gaming right now. It's this idea that ""less is more."" And in the case of Homeworld:  Deserts of Kharak, delivering LESS very much equals the fans wanting MORE. Gearbox, Blackbird, I WANT MORE! So they've done their jobs. What I'm asking for NOW is that this game receives the love, through patching, that it deserves. Get it working, place more unit variety in the game with more unique abilities, and it will be great! I just know it.*And for godsakes! Please remove the Gaalsien assualt cruiser as a coalition build option! It's utterly immersion breaking! And get a third faction in there! One with a flying carrier that's heavily reliant on support/assualt aircraft! As I said, MORE!Good job.			"

												Homeworld + Sand = funThere are enough overlapping mechanical and auditory elements to trigger a strong nostalgia; which translates into a less critical position towards the game than might otherwise be.  That said, this is a good RTS by any standard.  The campaign is solid, without being epic (my recollection of the first homeworld campaign).  I suspect that the real fun will begin once I dig into the multiplayer.  Bottom line: if you like RTS games, a good buy; if you also played original homeworld, a must have.			"

												The game has about 8 hours of story gameplay in it. Being an RTS thats usually not a big issue however there is so much wasted potential for story here. The whole game you're trying to find this PRIME ANOMOLY and when you finially do you realize its nothing but another ship crashed in the desert. All promise of salvation... out the window. Kharak is still ♥♥♥♥ed. The Final Fight against the SUPER CARRIER.. you blow it to bits by the time it even gets close to you. It saddens my heart to see such wasted potential.			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak definitely lives up to its lineage, and while it doesn't drastically improve on any single aspect, it definitely shows that the Homeworld formula still has a great deal of life in it.(Information based on a Preview Press Copy provided to press prior to release)Pros:- Continues the solid gameplay of the Homeworld Universe- Cinematics are an upgrade from the old game, taking on an almost painterly feel- Interfaces are much more streamlines, and almost every unit has a ""use"" in the journey- Story so far is quite compelling (I haven't completed it as of this review, but would avoid spoilers anyways)- Music maintains the Homeworld Atmosphere, as does the unit art style- The voice acting is greatly improved over previous gamesCons:- Retained the ""Units continue acting during in-mission cutscenes"" (which can result in loss of units you don't have control over)- The models are slightly less detailed than the Remastered version's models (they're not ugly, they're just not as intricate)- Price Point is a little high, though this game is still worth a solid $30-35 USD or your regional equivalent.- Movement is very similar to the old Homeworld Games, but on a 2D plane, ""good"" control, but still a little more awkward feeling than other RTS's (the amount of control is a bit higher, it just makes micro management a bit more difficult)Notes: I have not gotten to test the multiplayer aspect of this game, nor have I beaten the story - some aspects of this could change, but I am happy with the game so far.The game favors a strong micro-management game when it comes to combat, which works well with the nice mix of unit abilities and strengths/weaknesses - it's more than rock/paper/scissors since different units can take advantage of the battlefield in differing ways (no units directly outclass others)A video review demonstrating gameplay and movement can be found here:

												Before DoK, I knew nothing of the Homeworld franchise.  The only reason I bought this was because it reminded me of Dune II all those years ago.  The pre-order came with Homeworld 1 & 2 remastered editions.  Knowing nothing of Homeworld, I played through those campaigns before starting the DoK prequel.  Solid and fun campaigns, reminded me of Battlestar Galactica.  Open space combat kind of felt like a giant submarine battle.  Interesting twist on RTS.  Remastered multiplayer could be fun but I prefer the polished balance of SC2 for competitive play.  I feared DoK would be a C&C4 abomination with the mobile carrier/construction yard.  It was not an abomination, it was excellent, a modern Dune II without the spice.  DoK has been widely criticized for multiplayer balance issues, a general lack of content, and easy campaign upgrades.  The balance is fine, I can win with either faction on all difficulty settings on skirmish mode.  Content is solid, but I did get 3 games for the price of one.  If you think the campaign is too easy then raise the difficulty and you won't have the resources to upgrade everything until maybe the later missions if you managed to keep your persistent fleet alive.  I enjoyed fleet persistence between missions on all 3 games.  The stories amount to a short comic book per game with little character development, and that's ok, it's still on par with or superior to most offerings.  DoK multiplayer could use some more maps, but there's plenty to get started with.  Now that the campaigns are done I might keep DoK installed to challenge my brothers on multiplayer when the price comes down.  I used the Steam Controller for all 3 campaigns.  Community templates get you started, might take an hour or two to customize for yourself.  After this I think the Steam Controller might improve my SC2 APM's.  If anymore DoK DLC comes out I'll probably play it too.			"

												As a massive fan of the homeworld series, i loved every minute of it. A brilliant addidtion to the lore of the series, and really  feels like an authentic homeworld game despite it being ground based. As much as i loved it however, the game is not without a few drawbacks:The game is requiring some balance changes. Larger units/ air units absolutley stop all other types in the game. It is also missing any sort of formation option, which was in the original games and is sorely missed. Especially with how fast your smaller units move.Despite all this however, i would definetly buy this again.			"

												What can I say? The series that continued to inspire my childhood for years from homeworld to cataclysm to homeworld 2 is back in a really big way. It leaves you wanting more, which is something few games can do any more. These guys are still the masters of RTS and they make games because they love them. Rob Cunningham et al. are artists who deliver an experience that will leave its imprints on your mind for all time. Every homeworld game is a gem. Each time you perfect a mission a little more with your strategy is a feeling of great reward leaving you to come back again and again.			"

												First off I have always loved the homeworld series. Played them since they came out when i was a kid. And, i think this game and its background story as told in the expadition guide are incredible and i want more. There is a serious feel and connection to the old homeworld games that is distict. Ground Homeworld I feel is an AMAZING idea which needs to be repeated. That being said, there are many points about this game i like...Pros- Guard Command in this game is one of the most useful tools in this game. Allowing automatic battlegrounds that work really well.- The line of sight tool in this game works very well and that combined with the move command allows for simple and intresting game play- LAND CARRIERS HOW FREAKING COOL IS THAT!!!- Units look like they should work in real life and i havent noticed any clipping in the models themselves- The Battle Chatter is AMAZING!- Music is PERFECT. Its something thats many times over looked but it sets the scene and this games music does it well.- The Deserts themselves are very well done. The rolling dunes look real and the desert walls look so realistic.- Vehicles move very well as far as ive noticed.- waypoint setting is very intuitive- Once again if you read the expedition guide you find the story is SOOO rich its incredible. Very much worth touching on againThere are however a few big things that i dont likeCons - - TEXTURES ARE HORRIBLE and ill tell you why... if this where any other game id say what ever its an RTS. However this game is trying to focus on massive scales (not to mention being a series which always pushed the bounderies of graphics potential). As i play this game i find it very hard to realize the sence of scale because when i zoom as close as i can get to get a good scenic view the SAND LOOKS FUZZY AND UNDEFINED. This combined with the vehicles own textures being rather blurry results in making all the units look smaller. - SCALE COMPARISIONS are few and far between. with the sand and units hull detail lacking there is not much else to help you visualize the true scale being represented by the units under your command. Id like to see more human sized representations if not in some cases humans standing on the units walkways.- Terrain Shadows are not crisp even on Ultra which also separates me from the world immersion. - Weapons Fire seems very random. It would seem the units movement across the dunes means nothing. They could hit the target while on the move or miss by a mile while standing still. If your trying to sell the units as having future tech I don't see how you could miss by as much as some of these units do while they aren't moving.- Both teams units are basically the same exact things. As Ive heard it put so well, one teams units hover the other teams dont. Other then that they might as well be the same thing. Gotta switch it up. Every good RTS game ive ever played has done something to make the two teams really stand apart. Ground Control 2, all C&C games, War Craft and Star Craft are all examples of this. Also, all Total War games inately have this as well (because they seek to emulate real life)All and all dispite my gripes, I really like what this game is trying to do and its original concepts and story are fresh and inovative. I dont nessisarally think this game recaptures what i felt when i played homeworld & homeworld 2 for the first time as a kid. However, although i may not find it to be the best made Homeworld game its still a good game if your just looking to play a game. I think maybe if they kept up on this path and didnt abandon it this titles predesessors will be truely amazing. For that reason i have to vote this game up.			"

												If you like real time strategy - go for it!!!I've played the classics, and last year the remastered collection - loved them!Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is of the same quality (missions, presentation, storytelling etc.): great!It differs from the originals through less micromanagement and 'calmer' battles, and of course ""pseudo-3D"" space.And you can't give commands while paused.But what ultimately makes it an outstanding game is it's presentation:Great cinematics, best ingame sequences of any rts i've seen so far!!!And that radio chatter, being story relevant or not, it's just Wow!

												Upgraded Carrier to Power 5, rushed enemy carrier. Resulting explosions were gratifying. 10/10On a more serious note, I enjoy the games aesthetics and it's streamlined gameplay. Normally I'm a fan of RTS games such of the likes of Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 to call back to the days or the Total War games, but this is a great example of pairing down the RTS and still making it enjoyable. I'm able to be jump in and play a good game without having to invest several hours into it.Deserts of Kharak doesnt have to be a very big and complex title to be a good RTS. The AI needs work but over-all it was worth the money I put down on it. (Mind you it wasn't the full 60!) So I'm happy with it and would recommend it.			"

												This is a great RTS. It is shocking to see a reboot of an old series done so imaginatively and successfully. The gameplay is significantly improved compared to the old homeworld games, while the elements that made it good have been faithfully retained. Gameplay elements have been refined with no useless gimmicks added.It also attains the artistic beauty of the old games. The meditative, menacing soundtrack and initially slow pace that gradually builds to the frenzy of a chaotic battle. The people who made this deserve credit for being so skilled and yet restrained in improving this game while keeping what made the old games good. It makes me so happy to see this happen for once.Thank you!!! Now please do Master of Orion and Baldur's Gate!			"

												Blackbird Interactive have really come through with this game, their first release ! In short the game has:Great soundtrack.Excellent voice acting with detailed and interesting ""idle and background"" chatter betweewn the players units.Engaging and interesting story, that keeps you playing the campaign till the very end, just like in Homeworld 1 !Even cooler animated cutscenes than HW1 and HW2's but true to their style.Nice multiplayer options, including a ladder ranking stystem (somewhat simmilar to Starcraft2 matchmaking), and why better lobby and MP support than in HW:RE.The somwhat less good sides are:Very long load times, im guessing its an Unity engine issue, rather than the games programmers fault.Somewhat mediocre graphics for a 2016 game ""A"" game.Overall a must have for any RTS and Homeworld fan ! This game has a very good chance of winning RTS of the Year award, as its the best one in the genre that came out in the past few years. "

												I'm completely reminded of everything that made the original Homeworld awesome. The awe and magesty of the Kharak dessert, the incredible space... er... groundship porn. The music, the terrific cinematics... everything... it's all there. The control system is so similar as to be almost completely familiar and intuitive. Basically, this is a Homeworld game through and through. The storytelling so far is spot on.I thought being ""on the ground"" would be kinda... meh.... NOPE... AWESOME.If you liked Homeworld and Homeworld Catacylsm, you're going to love this.Don't think, just get out your money..... trust me!			"

												If you liked Homeworld & Homeworld 2 you will like Deserts of Kharak. It keeps up with it's predecessor and with the technology available today. Also, if you liked Command & Conquer games, this is one strategy game you should try out. With not much very good strategy games released in the recent years, this one was definitely worth the purchase and BB did not let the players and fans of the series down.			"

												This one was FUN, i really liked playing it. The story, the atmosphere, the AMBIANCE is brilliant and trys to find its equal.I recommend playing SP in hard mode (classic) due to the fact that the AI has its problems. (MUST BE PATCHED)As do the key bindings (unchangable at this moment) , that needs to be changed.Small BUGS (as in every game these days ""ppl pls bring back finished games"")If you are a FAN of Homeworld, or of any RTS, pick this up.For generic RTS, i would say this is the best one out at the moment.

												(Some spoilers for those who haven't played Homeworld)If you enjoyed the original Homeworld game, then you'll enjoy this sandy romp through the desert.You've got the familiar structure of units and strategy built around a central mobile base, you've got a heirarchy of units that each have that rock vs paper vs scissors tactical system at the low end, and a moving story about people fighting against the odds in the pursuit of truth + salvation in the face of tyranny.Everything a good Homeworld game needs.My only complaints are that the pacing of the game is forcibly fast, and the ending is a bit too succint in my opinion.(Spoilers for Deserts of Kharak, don't read on unless you don't mind the risk )Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all that is here, I just wish that the game wouldn't force certain conflicts that'll end the map, I can count 3~4 instances where a final battle on a map is forced because the enemy is rushing at me and I pretty much have little choice but to bring the hammer down.  I think this sort of tactic should be reserved for the classic difficulty, or add another mid boss type enemy that'll chase you down, but maybe save a final objective for when the player wishes to end it, for easy and / or normal difficulty anyhoo.Again my complaint is when the final objective that will end a map happens to be a boss type character that is chasing the Kapisi down, forcing an early end of a map, I don't mind if the enemy is throwing other groups of enemies or challenges at the kapisi, I just don't like having the map end so fast because the final objective is chasing the kapisi, this just shortens the game overall, I'm sure I would've gleefully enjoyed a few more hours recovering any and all artifacts and resources on each of the maps, and my overall playtime would've been closer to 15 ~ 20 hrs at least, and I would've been happier for it.The impatient players can always go force that final fight themselves, if they REALLY want to, what I liked about Homeworld was being able to strategize how I would win.As for the ending, yes all of us who played homeworld know what will be found deep in the great banded desert, BUT it would be nice to add more of that lore and story, I don't even remember seeing the galactic map etched on stone being found in 'Deserts of Kharak'.I mean sure, you see that in Homeworld proper in the intro, but that intro summarizes what happened after, told in the future.  I would have loved to see the S'jets exposition the discovery, maybe even discussion between the people who worked the expedition react, posit theory etc.  and then at least have a 5 minute + exposition about the next 100+ years:  The tribes again becoming the Kuushan, the world embracing unity and discovery, the design and building of the Great Mothership.Hopefully some decently priced DLC could cover this?  The greatest moving aspect of this franchise is the story, don't give it too short a shrift.  ;)Some other minor complaints I have include Rachel's Hack ability, why does it require RUs to use it? Why aren't hacked units special abilities researchable to add to your own units?Also why does Rachel habitually drive in front of the Kapisi if she is assigned to it?  shouldn't as a support unit naturally stay to the rear of the Kapisi?Why do direct fire units (like the railgun units) not get their shots eclipsed by terrain?  I'm pretty sure they shouldn't be able to shoot through hills / dunes accurately with ZERO line of sight.			"

												This game looks and feels like homeworld. Im not good with the lore of the series so I don't know how well of a prequel this is. There isn't much difference in units but it is enough to see different strategies between the factions. Multiplayer is a blast when you arent getting dsync.  I haven't seen any gamebreaking bugs. The only bug i have seen is the physics of unit animations bouncing around at times but it doesnt hurt the gameplay. Overall i really enjoy this game. If your an rts fan you'll love this game. I would write about the absolutely amazing unit feedback audio, but i think rock paper shotgun said it best:""The stand-out element, however, is the sound design. Over long years, we’ve miserably adjusted to the idea that all you can do with unit chatter is have each guy say something funny or militaryesque when you click on them, but Kharak casually rewrites the rules. Either by selecting units or by just hanging around and listening, you’ll hear the units talk amongst themselves. Select a unit and while sometimes they’ll just give an ‘acknowledged’, other times a more involved, context-sensitive reaction to whatever you’ve ordered them to do. An endangered unit might thank you for sending in air support. A ship which has spotted incoming enemies will tell you what type of craft they are. Idle units will chatter amongst themselves at length about faults and tactics. As well as successfully giving you a general sense of what’s going via audio alone, it sounds natural and responsive, rather than mechanical and repetitive – all adding to that sense that this is a large and well-oiled military machine, not just some cute little guys who popped out of a magic factory. Kharak might not otherwise be a landmark moment for the genre, but its unit audio does set new standards. It’s going to be so disappointing to play a strategy game filled with tinned quips after this.""

												I have always loved the Homeworld series when I first played it over 10 years ago.  Sadly I only played Homeworld 2 and didn't get to play the Homeworld 1 until the recent ""remastered"" edition came to steam.  With that said, I also enjoy playing games like Supreme Commander, Total War series, Distant World, etc.  A lot of 4x games and strategy games.  So when I saw this game about to be released five days ago (15 January 2016), I thought it would be interesting to get the game and follow the lore which I have enjoyed.  When I finally got to play the game, I was pleasantly surprised.Gameplay: 10/10As a standard RTS, there is resource gathering. but no base management.  Everything is mobile, just like Homeworld's motherships.  The UI is well structured and easy to navigate, those who say otherwise simply have not used control groups before.  With that said, Ctrl commands is something new to me.  It allows you to order selected units to target a selected enemy group through selection and pursue until all units of this selected group (designated by you) is destroyed, or you issue another order.  Depending on how you play, you might spend most of the match building up your force for a single and final confrontation, I will address this in detail at the combat section.Combat: 10/10(Unit Types)I will start with unit types.  The diversity in units between the two nations is moderately diverse, with one nation being more superior than the other on a few aspects.  However, the two nations generally have the same units that fulfill the same roles.  With that said, every single unit is different, since Gaalsian uses hover technology, while Coalition uses treads.  It was designed so that each nation will have more specialized units for a certain task.(Tactics/Strategy)With the limited number of units (10 + 3 air craft), it would be common for commanders to approach each other with similar forces.  However, because of this, there is not a single unit in the game that is useless.  Just because I can create battlecruisers, doesn't mean I will stop making the first unit.  Each unit fulfills its role adamantly.  The Carrier is also very combat efficient, so its not like a damsel in distress.  Terrain advantages and choke points can be utilized to maximum effectiveness.  If you are pressed, there is always a way out.  Enemy is harassing you with air?  Get missiles.  Raiding you with light vehicles?  Get armored vehicles to defend.  Their rails are destroying your armored vehicles?  Send your light vehicles in.(Aesthetics)This game is beautiful.  The battles are awesome to watch and very fluid.  The environment is very well crafted and actually plays a part in combat.  Sometimes it can actually be more important to secure a strategic position rather than resources.  Combat damages and wrecks remain for the remainder of the match as a ""trophy"" of the battlefield.  The explosions are gratifying, especially when you timed it perfectly to wreck havoc on the enemy.  Resulting a decisive victory. Sound/Music: 10/10The music is nice, and plays well as ambience.  The unit chatter is as needed and is not annoying.  The constant notifications received from these chatter is actually helpful and if you prefer listening to music rather than unit chatter then you might miss out on some vital information.  Every now and then, you will hear additional chatter between two radio lines and its interesting to listen on to their conversations.Replayability: 6/10Right now it only has 5 multiplayer maps.  However, the battles are always exhilirating.  The campaign is good, but also good for one play only.  So replayability right now is low for campaign, but moderate for multiplayer.  So please get this game and join the fun!Also, I have not encountered a single bug and plays very well at max.i7-4790 3.6 ghz Quad2x GTX 97016 GB ramSSD46/50 or 92% rating from me!  In some states, 92% is actually an A (talk about lowered standards).STEAM PLEASE FIX REVIEW SETTINGS!  I couldn't post this review until I only posted my first paragraph, then edited it to add the rest!			"

												Just beat the campaign on Normal setting. When I first heard of the concept of this game, I thought it was stupid, but the pre-release videos really sold me on it. The game definitely exudes that 'Homeworld Vibe' I've been missing since Homeworld 2 was released, and is a worthy purchase. If you are a Homeworld vet, as I am, you may find the 'normal' difficulty level to be a bit too easy. But perhaps hard is called 'Classic' for a reason... I thoroughly enjoyed the game and would recommend it wholeheartedly to any RTS fan in general, but especially to any Homeworld fans out there that may be holding back. If you feel like modern RTS's have gone the way of all twitch reflexes (and think that that kinda sucks), this game is defintely for you.			"

												Should you play this game?Well i just two minutes ago finished the story... 13.5hrs and its pushed me to write my first recommendation review.Many games pad it out and drop allot of fluff in you know, busy work. This was desperate cut throat gameplay, intense pressured missions.It has all the vibe of the HW1/2 the cutscenes are great the storyline was enjoyable but could have been expanded on a little (Id but any potential SP DLC for that allone)The units are few but the value of those units, especially when you carry them through each mission never using the default fleet mode. The pain of losing that honourguard at the end he was with me from so early on.Its risk vs reward especially in the later missions. I loved it im glad they put a fully working game out with an intense singleplayer campain instead of padding it out and ruining the pacing. I do hope for more DLC and for (fingers crossed) homeworld 3.I think if you are a fan of the series it is a must, if you are a casual gamer id be on the fence. IF its all multiplayer for you then i can comment as im only about to jump into a game now. But ill be jumping into Homeworld:1 HD as it feels like you can do so without sacraficing anything gameplay wise. 8/10 More SP missions DLC and some new units and ill be chuffed.			"

												I have a kind of a mixed feelings about this one. I'm a total fan of the series and it makes me more hyped up about this game and more critical at the same time.First of all - it has THE Homeworld vibe. So everyone who wants to immerse into this atmosphere once more - you're good to go. The gameplay feels pretty cool (and also looks fantastic).BUTThe story is just rip-off of Homeworld 2 and the AI is dumb as rock. Can't recommend, can't not-recommend either.If you intended to play a multiplayer than AI is not a problem. It is also worth it just for the sake of atmosphere.			"

												Honestly, I was totally excited when I saw Hardware: Shipbreakers, cause I knew right off the bat that it was a prequel to HW1.  Me and my bro used to play these games all the time even though I was too young to understand the story at the time, eventual re-runs solved that as I got older.  In my opinion, the story is the best part in the HW series, and is the overall contribution to the positive review.  There are some minor things that could have been improved on but I believe HW: DK holds true to the previous games as being story rich.  My only real disappointment was after the first mission when the stats of the fleet showed up and it showed the water and fuel levels.  I was really hoping for there to be some side missions where you had to re-supply and half-way hoping that the units in the game had a fuel meter that had to be managed or risk leaving a craft a sitting duck while waiting for fuel rats.  I know it kinda sounds like a pain but this would have had a moderate impact on how the game would have been played, as the last thing any sane person would have done was attack an excavation site running on fumes and it would have added a great deal to the desperate mood of the game.Now, I was reading through some of the other reviews and I have to admit, the graphics, camera controls, and unit diversity was a bit subpar.  Although I am more concerned about the camera controls than the graphics.  It was sometimes very difficult to get a good view of what was going on around you but popping into the strategy view helps with that at the loss of viewing the actual crafts.  I think that the ships could have been more detailed upon closer inspection and some of the in-mission cutscenes really pointed this out.  Finally the unit diversity, which was pretty small, but in my honest opinion, was a good choice to go with as the story line revolves around a fleet with limited supplies (again, not as stressed as I was hoping it to be) going from point A to point B fighting enemies along the way.  Having multipurpose crafts such as the Baserunner would have been the economical choice.  Also I can't think of any other way to diversify the fleet that wouldn't have to have been re-discovered in HW1, such as beam weapons and the like.  Would be kind of silly to have a beam weapon craft in HW: DK and then play HW1 and have to buy Beam Tech from the Bentusi in order to build one :SI have yet to play MP, but I looked at it briefly and noticed there are very few maps.  I fear that DLC will add more maps and content for the price of 30 dollars...			"

												This is a good take on an excellent classic. It's a RTS, but it's not in the same vein as the frenzied click-fest style of so many modern RTS's. For the most part, you have time to plan moves, co-ordinate attacks with ground and air assets, long range and repair craft all contributing towards a sucessful maneuver.There are times when it does turn into a panic, and you have to move fast and click even faster, but that's not the norm, and I think it only serves to add tension to an otherwise slower paced RTS.Significient tactical choices are few, but vital. For exmaple, some terrain will not allow the passage of your carrier, so do you leave it unguarded and send the rest of your units off, or split them, losing the punch?I haven't tried mlultiplayer yet, but I can imagine that is a bit more of a click-fest, but still not overwhelmingly so, due to the way the game works. I think that it will be played better on the tactical map for MP than in the close u p pretty view though, so you can keep an eye on what your opponent is up to.The game looks and sounds very good indeed, and although that's not why you buy a strategy game, it does add a lot towards the value of it.Overall, I'd recommend this game as rewarding and fun to play, but not a serious challange, at least in SP mode.

												I bought this game for the multiplayer and wasn't disappointed. 1v1 is a ton of fun, although the playerbase isn't nearly as big as it should be with how deep the multi is. A few minor unit balance problems, but that's to be expected for a two day old (at the time of this review) game. Would buy again.			"

Strategy is pretty much non-existant. The UI is clunky, largely because they tried to make it feel like Homeworld.... but Homeworld was in space. It doesn't all fit in this situation.

												If, like me, before you bought this game you'd heard that the game didn't match the standard of the other Homeworld games, that it didn't fit the ""Homeworld family"" and that put you off buying the game, let me tell you something. Whoever said that, they were wrong. I will spoil some plot points later, but I will warn in advanceHomeworld: Deserts of Kharak is very much a member of the Homeworld family, and not just a formal it exists way. It's story is strong, with surprise turn arounds and unexpected events, it still carries the ""lone fleet"" feeling of the Homeworld 1 and 2, in fact I'd say that feeling is stronger in this game than it is in Homeworld 2, the constant news of Coalition (the player faction) outposts under attack and Gaalsien force movements creates the feeling of isolation more so than any of HW2 plot. This is further reinforced by the fact that your sole ally in your journey isn't a member of Coalition forces, instead they are Sidiim, another faction on Kharak.One of the most powerful moments of this is the start of a mission, when to come to the aid of stranded fleet units the Carrier overloads it's engines to reach the mission site while they're still intact, the cutscene of the gigantic vessel bouncing over a dune was one of the most powerful moments of the campaign, giving strength to the feeling of the fleet being on it's own with no cavalry comming. This is what Homeworld really is about, the perservation of a single fleet through immense odds.I'll break away from the talk about how HW:DOK plot and story earn it it's rightful place in the Homeworld series to talk about gameplay. It's good, there's nothing quite as enjoyable as launching a cruise missile at the enemy, or ordering all of your fighter wings to bombard enemies that are giving your ground forces a hard time. The rank system where units gain eperience and gain promotions gives you a reason to preserve your units and to care when their destroyed, unlike in the original Homeworlds where the only thing you cared about losing was capital ships due to the extreme cost in replacing them. The rank system doesn't make units OP, for example you aren't going to be facing down a battlecruiser with a single high rank Light Attack Vehicle, but having high ranked units does give you the edge, and it's nice to see a reward for smart tactics than just ""You saved some RP!"".Spoilers from here!Back to the plot and story, again I feel it delivers better, and not in ways that can't be explained by better technology. The main adversary I can understand as to why he declared holy war, his faith felt real, mostly supported by the cutscene for his death, pleading for the players faction to request forgiveness from Sajuuk. The Sidiims betrayal came as a surprise, despite the captain of the Carrier expressing concerns about them in his personal log, but I expected my ally to push to far and get themselves killed in battle in a cutscene, so the shock of watching them blow the aircraft bringing my resupply out of the sky after I'd protected the rock being used as a landing strip for both of us was genuine. The voice acting, while my laptop was constantly garbling half of the spoken audio, what came out ungarbled was a level of quality higher than old homeworld games, not in a higher quality of sound way, but in terms of performance. Concern in the characters voices is common place, theres bitterness in the captains personal log after the Sidiim's betrayal, things that were again missing in the original homeworld games.Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak to me is very much a Homeworld game. It worked hard to get there, but it is one. It's plot powerful, like the old games, it has ways to jump the enemy and embrace power fantasy, similar to how jumping a battlecruiser into the enemy production fleet felt in HW2.Finally, it blends the high speed duels of light craft (LAVs and fighers) with the slow combat of the larger vessels in the Homeworld way, so that while there may be one battle going on, but in that battle there'll be multiple battles going on, each one affecting the overall outcome. At least until you steamroll everything with the OP artillery cruisers, similar to how being the first with battlecruisers in a HW2 match felt.It's pretty much all I can ask for in a Homeworld game.

												I don't recommend this game. At all. Bad. Like, Diablo 3 Jay Wilson bad. Or Command and Conquer 4. I cant decide which is worse. Dont get me wrong, this game is fun for the first couple hours or the duration of the campaign, but that's it. Low replayability, skirmish mode does not have many maps and quite frankly isnt in depth enough for me to repeating the experience over and over again. I wonder if I can get a refund.			"

												So I played all the way through, and i Want to reccomend it, but I just cant.I completed the game because, well, i'm persistent. Dont look at the hours and take anything from that, I spent a lot of time sitting defending while pillaging the maps resources. You will too, since beating a map does not reward you with the resources and you need to get them manually or lose them at mission end. Not my idea of a good time.Lets add to that some serisouly missing feature in any RTS of this style. There are no formations. So here I am with a bunch of mixed units that move at various speeds and literally the only way i can find to get them to move at the same speed is to have all the units guard one of the slowest units and tell that to move. This does not work out well on tight maps i can tell you, because the AI is beyond stupid when it comes to navigation. Aircraft: Enjoy launching your sorties and either A: Watching it blow something up and waiting forever for it to be available again and forgetting about it or B: watching it blow something up and immediately die from AA since it never prioritizes AA unless you tell it to. It is kind of fun to watch 12 fighters cricle the carrier wating to land though. A question: If they can land with VTOL, why dont they take off that way? And my favorite of the day: Cutscenes during the action that dont stop the action. If you're going to wrest control from my micromanaging hands in the middle of a battle, at least have the decency to pause the action. But alas, no dice. You will watch the a sinking heart as the border closes in and you lose unit control just as you needed to take some kind of action and sit through somethng either brutally obvious forced tactical view or a (admittedly nice) visual cutscene while your units are slaughtered and calling out for orders. Did i mention you can't seem to skip most of these? Pros: Its pretty. And the story is nice, if a bit predictable. They tried to do too many Homeworld things, and implemented them really poorly. Give it a pass unless its Really cheap. Then prepare for nail biting resource gathering unless you want to start missions with nothing.			"

												This game is great. If you were a fan of the franchises that came out before you love this. The desert feel is not as close as the ones in space, but it still gives that vibes of constant hopelessness and solitude you get from teh game. The game is relatively fluid, and but there are not enough varieties of units. Also the game is fast paced, it you jump right into the action.great game.			"

												If you enjoy Company of Heroes then you will find this a great new addition to your strategy collection. Unfortunately the multiplayer is dead but has serious promise, hopefully sales will introduce more players. In terms of the story this is a brilliant campaign that's a good length and provides a gripping introduction to the Homeworld universe. It can be played before or after the first two Homeworld games and their expansions. If only the Dune IP would receive an update akin to this! Fingers crossed Blackbird is working on another game in the series.			"

It's plot powerful, like the old games, it has ways to jump the enemy and embrace power fantasy, similar to how jumping a battlecruiser into the enemy production fleet felt in HW2.Finally, it blends the high speed duels of light craft (LAVs and fighers) with the slow combat of the larger vessels in the Homeworld way, so that while there may be one battle going on, but in that battle there'll be multiple battles going on, each one affecting the overall outcome. At least until you steamroll everything with the OP artillery cruisers, similar to how being the first with battlecruisers in a HW2 match felt.It's pretty much all I can ask for in a Homeworld game.

												It has nothing to do with the old homeworld games.None of the atmosphere,the cutscenes etc are banal boring feely woman researcher point of view.The story is weak,no developments,i thought the game was gonna really kick off when it ended instead.This was not so in homeworld.It is almost an intro for a story.I don't know what everybody is going on giving this positive reviews but it has a 8 hour sp campaign,nothing special about it.I guess people are supporting for old time's sake and another homeworld game.But it is plain old strategy game on par with old command and conquer games.Yeah the only difference is the base is moving.It's graphics are good,gameplay is not boring.It could have been better with a better story,But the elements incorporated are weak.The dev's should have seen it on the board that they were lacking,but alas.Honestly hire a few new graduates out of the school and let them go for it.It's a very bland story,it just doesn't work.Haven't tried multi yet,but I wouldn't buy it at sales prices,not suggested.

												This game is amazing let me get this out. It is worth you money, if you are a RTS fan.ok now for the pros and cons.Gameplay - The game is very simplistic, some options were left out of the game, like formations and troop behaviors. The units have a lot of special abilities that can alter the course of the fight if used by a skilled player.Multplayer - Non existent, It has a very solid a simple gameplay but the player base dont care much for online play.Graphics - Oh boy, that was a blast. All the effects the cinematics using the in game engine and small cut scenes using real actors but using a tecnique to turn the image cartoonish. The only problem, that is actually a big problem, the game is not optimized, it will have stuttering in a lot of high end machines, forcing you to low your graphic options. But still the visuals on long range dont change much.Voice acting is good, nothing fantastic, just good.The Plot is not bad either.Overall the game is really good It is worth to play, and you will get back toplay the campain once in a while.

												Pretty, polished, has a sense of good production value. It will provide nostalgia for Homeworld fans, and possibly even for fans of games like Emperor Battle for Dune. But the game doesn't really innovate, doesn't have any genre-shaking advancements... it simply oozes wasted potential. If you buy the game, understand you're buying only a single-player campaign... which is a few missions shorter than both HW and HW:C. Multiplayer died a while ago, skirmish is monotonous and features AI from yester-decade, and there doesn't appear to be any new content coming down the pipe... which is probably a good thing since the DLC we did get was apparently reskins. Impossible to recommend at anything above the used bargain bin prices.			"

												When on discount this game is great, it's worth a nice 20$. But I wouldn't pay 50$ or close to that. This game REALLY needed some custom map maker or anything along those lines. This game could had been a decent base builder with the terrain effects,etc, but for some reason the Devs didn't see reason enough to do it or the Publishers didn't see enough money to warrant production in it.Multiplayer is dead.3.5/5 but could be fix'd into a 4.5/10 if the Devs put more heart into it.

												Review will be updated as I go through it.Huge fan of Homeworld franchise and I am having a blast with Deserts of Kharak!Played only the campaign but it is amazing so far. The entire game feels like Homeworld. Amazing sound design, hearing the chatter of the nearby units is a truly immersive experience. Chatter is not active only durring battles, when units are idle there are a lot of talking going on. Amazing stuff. I didn't expect the UI design to be this good, the navigation is simple and no need to juggle between numerous screens. The only negative here is the rebinding. It is not possible to do it, it should be a standard when it comes to PC gaming. But the presets are very well done so not a huge issue for me there. But I agree that there is no excuse for leaving it out.Graphic quality is on par with the entire HW feel, someone might argue that the AA and shadow quality could have been better, but it is unnoticable when you are having a good time with the game. The entire feel, atmosphere, combat sounds, the movement and physics of the vehicles.....simply amazing. The detail on the units is uncanny, with a lot of personal touches, makes all those vehicle look believable and real. The game also runs very well on my system, I was a bit worried since I saw some people have issues with 980TI  ( I have i5 8gb RAM GTX 970). All on ULTRA, no  issues at all, even during huge battles.Gameplay is also top notch. I see a lot of people worried about the number of units and I have to ask you: What happened to quality over quantity? I agree, on paper it looks meager, but when you take the reins of the game it is obvious that each unit has it's purpose. Every unit has it's weakness and it's strength and they support each other marvelously. The feeling of sending your LAV's to charge the long range artilery, while your tanks provide smoke cover is simply amazing. You activate the boosts for LAV's while they fly over the dunes while firework spectacle around them begins to unravel....Air support kicks in just in time to help the assault.....You harass the enemy and start ""boosting"" your retreat to the nearest Support vehicle for repairs, dust coulds all around you.....Another succesfull attack....Simply AMAZING! More units =/= more tactical option. It is much more important (for me at least) to have units that have it's purpose. The situation reminds me of Shogun 2 and the backlash that it caused with the info that unit number will be small (compared to other TW) and factions will be very similar. It turned out great for TW, much better then adding a bunch of very similar units with no real purpose on the battlefield. As I said: Quality over Quantity.Now for some negatives: No formations...This hurts me the most it seems, the game really needs it. Ordering units to move or to attack is a nightmare if it is a mixed group, each unit moves at their own max speed. It is a tactical disaster, it can be bypased by micromanaging each unit group separately but it can be a pain.The game has some cliping issues. It is an RTS but it really looks ugly sometimes when Kapisi just rolls over S'jet, without S'jet moving an inch. There is also an issue when you group some units together. It can look ugly and it can ruin the immersion. But sometimes, when the collision works like it should, units can get stuck. My resource collectors got stuck in a loop and I didn't even notice, the lack of resources almost costed me a battle. It is not often but it can happen.AI has it's flaws. I haven't tried skirmish yet, but I have seen a lot of proof that it is not the best. I haven't noticed it too much during campaign, it was actually suprisingly good there (they are retreating heavy artillery and tanks if they don't have light unit support etc.) but you can see some signs of ""stupidity"" (rushing positions etc.)The above mentioned rebinding issue.Only 5 skirmish maps. This is a rather small number, HW never had an abundance of maps, but land RTS should have some more variety.All in all I am having a blast. Fun game, great campaign, just as I expected. Some might argue that the price is a bit high. For now, I am having my moneys worth, people are also forgetting that you could get 3 amazing games for that price or an discount as an owner of Remastered.  For the fun I am having, it is a fair price. Could have been better when it comes to MP content, but I am sure that we will have a lot of content down the road (BBI confirmed new maps, all for free with additional DLC/Expansion plans)Great game :)			"

												Do you love Homeworld ?Do you want more Homeworld ?If yes then this is more Homeworld...-The game feels like Homeworld, it sounds like Homeworld, looks ,feels ,everything you loved and enjoyed about Homeworld...-Instead of endless space in glorious 3d environment with nebulas,asteroids ect.-You now fight on an arid world with a more traditional 2d environment.(Still have anomalies like tornado's and sandstorms)-Controls are pretty much the same = you have your 10 designated group slots.-Attack move orders with multiple move orders holding shift just like any RTS and my personal favourite the ctrl drag box over enemy order (very handy when engaging weak units with your stronger units and their slow larger units with your more agile smaller units)-A new feature is the air units and how you command them.Instead of individuel units your carrier launches squadrons at a time at a designated target area, attacking enemy in the area. (Command & Conquer Generals style)-Another immersive aspect i noticed was a lot more chatter between units (when not engaged in combat) often calling in on the radio about sensor readings bugging out on their monitor or they forgot to change their vehicles filter ect.(A really nice touch)-Graphical fidelity on 4K ultra looks amazing. (Only noticed some shadow distortion)-Decent campaign and story as per Homeworld tradition (Im not going to talk about the AI,so many other reviews mention this)-Also i haven't played mutliplayer or skirmish yet.Great Homeworld game get it Most poeple rate this at 8/10 I think it deserves more 9/10 at least			"

So far really liking the ability to capture enemy units, wish they would have allowed me to capture cruisers early....  Like you could have with salvage units in homeworld 1...  I dont generally write reviews.  But I love this game.  If they can make more of this type, with a single player focus.... that would be the dawn of a new pc age.Update... Still amazing, but feels short, I would love more to do in this game!  I spent hours playing homeworld and the ability to keep expanding was awsome.  I think they need more dlc and more missions.

Pros:sand carriers - way better than silly stationary buildingunits - bring the right tools for the job or you will get wrektpace - the typical game doesnt end up being just make a death ball and move forward, it involves bait, flanks, support, all things a good rts should.cons:story was meh, i didnt care for it outside of what my objective was and how to go about accomblishing it. you and your nomad gang kill some from one dune to the next. and any units that survived the past battle you get to keep mission after mission including their rank. although i was never able to keep the light trucks alive long enough : Pgraphics arent extactly cutting edge - never really cared for the look of the land or unit details			"

												I love this game because it is a Homeworld game. As in that way that its feels like it was meant to fill out the Lore of the series. To that end I feel it as faithful to those intentions as they are to presenting the wastes of Kharak. There is still alot of potential for the game and a lot of things it needs to open to the steam gaming community if it is to be as wildly successful as the confidence the game exudes over itself which would be fine, if it did not feel unfinnished. perhaps released too early even. The multi player map selection is limited the game modes offered feel limited. This newer ""sequel prequel"" lacks features that the actual Homeworld 1 released back in 1999 had such as Tactical Pause. Granted it is a feature that is meant for single player really but its still a very basic feature and has been since the series introduction. The game also has no workshop support in its present form, this does not bode well to the long term sale of the game its self and says volumes about its sustainability over time. Would I recommend others buy this game? Yes I would. To be of Note** I think it needs our support and encouragement to reach its full potential but until it fixes the lack of workshop support and all that which implies therein I will say that its not going to be for everybody			"

												A high-quality modern RTS, but very short singleplayer campaign.The story takes a while to get going - they don't give you reason to be invested in this expedition until it's been going awhile, unlike the older Homeworlds, where the singular nature of the mothership provides immediate weight.  Here, it mostly feels like a plot designed purely to shove you into the combat in a way consistent with established lore - it's not until most of the way through the campaign that it starts to feel like more than a perfunctory/excuse plot and starts explaining its own internal logic.  By the end though, it does feel like a Homeworld game in tone, if not in length or depth.  The lore seems to mostly follow Homeworld 2, while the gameplay more draws from Homeworld 1.The campaign seems a bit on the easy side.  For much of the campaign, the unit mix is relatively modern (ie small set of rock-paper-scissors units) - the unit diversity only comes in rather late, which is unfortunate, since the late missions are often much *shorter* since you have such a strong, veteran force (and numerous tools & utilities) by then.  Air units are treated more like special attacks than units, and are incredibly powerful, seeming to negate much of the potential difficulty.  The brevity means much of compounding economic decisions Homeworld usually has you make are vastly milder here.  It's like the game is filled with Homeworld's great macro-mechanics, but the campaign fails to utilize them well.The brevity of the campaign is unfortunate, and makes it a questionable purchase at full launch price if that's your main interest.  But the quality means that if you can get over the lack of content by one means or another, Shipbreakers Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a solid offering.  Certainly the best RTS I've encountered in many years.			"

												Love this game and the whole Homeworld series.  Just wish they would have included cataclysm with the remastered edition.  That was a fun side story with great mechanics in the beast!  Highly recommend this game though, loved seeing some of the parallels and art stylings from the original series reproduced here in the cut scenes.			"

												I've never played any of the ""Homeworld"" games but have been a long-time RTS fan.  I just finished the campaign and while the story seemed full it was a bit short and at the end I didn't really feel any closure.  The unit makup was diverse enough to keep me interested as they were introduced.  My only frustration was that the carrier functionality proved so critical, yet it takes a decade for aircraft to re-arm/repair etc.  I felt like several hours of gameplay was basically waiting for my next round of fighters to be available. All that said, did I get $50 of enjoyment out of it?  Absolutely, I'm only this critical because I love RTS games in general.  I anticipate some DLC in the future to continue the story!			"

												I love this game because it is a Homeworld game. As in that way that its feels like it was meant to fill out the Lore of the series. To that end I feel it as faithful to those intentions as they are to presenting the wastes of Kharak. There is still alot of potential for the game and a lot of things it needs to open to the steam gaming community if it is to be as wildly successful as the confidence the game exudes over itself which would be fine, if it did not feel unfinnished. perhaps released too early even. The multi player map selection is limited the game modes offered feel limited. This newer ""sequel prequel"" lacks features that the actual Homeworld 1 released back in 1999 had such as Tactical Pause. Granted it is a feature that is meant for single player really but its still a very basic feature and has been since the series introduction. The game also has no workshop support in its present form, this does not bode well to the long term sale of the game its self and says volumes about its sustainability over time. Would I recommend others buy this game? Yes I would. To be of Note** I think it needs our support and encouragement to reach its full potential but until it fixes the lack of workshop support and all that which implies therein I will say that its not going to be for everybody			"

This is not to say the story isnt amazing and the graphics are awesome.  Sound design is great and atmosphere and immersion with the music is stunning.Just not a lot fo content :-/ also paid dlc factions.			"

												Fantastic.This is a Homeworld prequel story. Gameplay is tight and very much in the vein of previous HW games, with some nice new additions. The overarching fleet you bring mission to mission accross the campaign gains experience, and if you find yourself in a failure spiral midway through the campaign you have the option of either changing difficulty or gaining a default fleet for that stage in the game. The plot is great, and sheds some light on old mysteries and new ones which is very exciting for a long time HW fan. Strong recommendation for fans of HW and RTS in general.			"

There were times when I teared up, just knowing how things were going to end. For a game of fiction, it came off as so realistic and heartfelt in its struggle. 10/10			"

												Love all the Homeworld games.Wanted to love this.Didn't happen.Graphics - Great, top-notchSound - Also very nice. No complaints.UI - Mediochre. Needs work.Gameplay - Fail.So here's how every mission will go.The game will most likely drop you into a senario where you have about 5 seconds to react and setup your forces before you start getting pounded or have to go meet some timed objective. Oh and remember, there's NO PAUSE feature so forget about doing any planning or strategy. You will then proceed to move into a defensive formation around your carrier. That is pretty much the last you will move your ground forces for the remainder of mission (with the exception of maybe sending out scavs). They will just sit there turtled and defending.Why? Well a number of reasons.Computer has infinite resourses and units. You do not. sending out your units is pointless since even if they win a skirmish, the enemy will get new units in 5 seconds for free. Eventually you will lose all your units and will have accomplished little to nothing. Ground forces are just defensive turrets for your carrier.Also the game does not allow a high enough unit cound to field and offensive and a defensive team. If you use your units on offense, your carrier will be undefended.The only real offensive units are your aircraft. They will do ALL the work and they will do it better and more efficiently than any of your ground units.Another thing....your units in this game are WAY too fragile. It's absolutely stuipid how fast units die.Another downside to the game is mission design. Whoever was in charge of this, you really need to go back to flipping burgers.Almost every mission is exactly the same. They pretend to be different, but in the end I played almost every mission exactly the same, had the same triggers, had the same outcomes.Only variety to this was when the game would randomly take units away from you for ....reasons.My favorite occurance of this being when you carrier arrives to a misson BEFORE all you other units/crusiers/etc. Um ok, your carrier, which is basically the slowest, lumbering beast in your entire task force, by some miracle, managed to arrive at the combat site a full half day before all these other units which are faster.Sure makes perfect sense.Another gripe...Research.So for the first handful of missions you get to research a few things at a time. Than at one point in the game you suddenly get like 50 things to research (basically all of the tech left in the game). Even though you are really only about half way through the game.There's a veterancy system in the game but good luck with that. I acutally went through the trouble to farm units for a LONG time to build up veterancy in many of my forces. Only to have these forces instantly obliterated later by...oh any host of things. It doesn't matter. Your units pretty much die if anything larger than a gnat hits them.For a game that claims to be an RTS, it is by far the worst RTS I've played in a LONG time.But quite frankly, it's really not an RTS.So there's my rant. Sorry if it's a bit random but I tend to just spew thoughts.			"

												A high-quality modern RTS, but very short singleplayer campaign.The story takes a while to get going - they don't give you reason to be invested in this expedition until it's been going awhile, unlike the older Homeworlds, where the singular nature of the mothership provides immediate weight.  Here, it mostly feels like a plot designed purely to shove you into the combat in a way consistent with established lore - it's not until most of the way through the campaign that it starts to feel like more than a perfunctory/excuse plot and starts explaining its own internal logic.  By the end though, it does feel like a Homeworld game in tone, if not in length or depth.  The lore seems to mostly follow Homeworld 2, while the gameplay more draws from Homeworld 1.The campaign seems a bit on the easy side.  For much of the campaign, the unit mix is relatively modern (ie small set of rock-paper-scissors units) - the unit diversity only comes in rather late, which is unfortunate, since the late missions are often much *shorter* since you have such a strong, veteran force (and numerous tools & utilities) by then.  Air units are treated more like special attacks than units, and are incredibly powerful, seeming to negate much of the potential difficulty.  The brevity means much of compounding economic decisions Homeworld usually has you make are vastly milder here.  It's like the game is filled with Homeworld's great macro-mechanics, but the campaign fails to utilize them well.The brevity of the campaign is unfortunate, and makes it a questionable purchase at full launch price if that's your main interest.

												I went into this game thinking it would be more like a typical RTS.  While it does maintain those type of aspects, there is no base building.  You base is mobile, just like it was in Homeworld 1 and 2.  This game, however, brings about the unique idea of having technology that can be added to your carrier to increases its capabilities. You have to find the tech fast, because it can be lost!  I've only played for ~5 hours but I love the art and graphics in this game.  Even the story telling hooks you!  I would definitely recommend purchasing and beating this game!			"

												I sort of recommend this game. For the price, there's little content to keep you going long term (5 maps??), and the unit type and population cap limit the scope of the game. Much like Homeworld though, there's something a bit special about this game. The low unit cap and mix means that the game is a micromanager's dream come true. Launching a gunship is a real event, if only because you have access to so few, while that isolated handful of tanks on the perimiter becomes increasingly precious as damage is taken from waves of enemy units. It's a little like Dawn of War 2 in many ways, though no where near as developed.I've heard the game called a Beta, and I'd agree with this. The resource wrecks are all copy/paste efforts for the same model, for example. Work needs to be done on the skirmish AI, though it's not quite as bad as some say. Personally, I find the carrier base to be slightly ridiculous and far too derivitive of an actual aircraft carrier. The design feels lazy and uninspired. It's unfortunate that it's got Ashes of the Singularity's lovely capital ships to be compared to at the moment. All in all, this feels like a game that needed a few more months of design and polishing.Despite these negatives, the game is a lot fun. The effects and sound have real oomph to them, and combat is very rewarding.  There's still a lot of work to be done before the game justifies its high price tag, and I'd expect to see a lot of free content to go in before we start on paid DLC, but this is one of the better RTS games to come out recently.

												I am an old Homeworld fan, so this may influence my review somewhat.Having awaited for the next HW installment for a long time, I was positively surprised when I saw HW DoK up for pre-order a few days before release, and since I enjoyed the first games I decided to give it a go. Already having the remastered edition I got a discount on the buy. And since I pre-ordered I got the DoK Expedition Guide as well.HW DoK certainly brings you back into the franchise - there is no Mothership nor space 3D tactics, but HW DoK has the same feel to it as the other games had - same type of mission videos, well told story line, music. The game evolves much like the original games - steady upgrading of your Carrier (Mothership) and units with research, while scaveninging as much resources as you can out of every map. Basicly, for the same reasons I liked the original games so much I also like DoK.As others have mentioned the multiplayer maps are few - yet for me, this doesn't matter all that much, as I mostly stick to single player. Otherwise, the main drawback of HW DoK, for me, is like the other HW games - It's so enjoyable it simply isn't enough of it and you keep wishing for more. (Perhaps that is why we like the franchise so much ?)The Expedition guide adds a bit of history to Kharak and the Kushan people. Enjoyable read which expands a bit on the HW universe.			"

												While no means perfect, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is an amazing game.Having been a player of the Homeworld series since it first came out in 1999, Deserts of Kharak fills the Homeworld universe with more large scale battles set against epic vista's.The game has enough variety in the terrain for me that it doesn't get boring or repetitive. Vehicles are well detailed and it has different types to keep things interesting. I do have several things I disliked. The campaign I feel could have been a bit longer. While I am satisfied with what we got, I feel that a few more missions would have helped. I do feel the mission variety did help a bit though. Several other users have made comments of the low textures. I feel I must partialy agree. While zoomed out and moving around the map it really isnt that noticeable, when zoomed in, it does become apparent. All in all, I was happy with the game and the way it turned out. Hopefully BBI will improve upon this and work with Gearbox to create new space-based Homeworld games that we all have been dreaming for.			"

												This game is amazing. Really it is. As a strategy game, it has great tactical depth and forethought to make both the campaign and multiplayer delicious for years to come. The graphics are great, and units feel good. But that is not what makes this game so spectacular. No, its that it may be the best homeworld game since homeworld. This game BREATHES the aura of  sparsity, mystery, and holiness that homeworld evoked. This game blows homeworld 2 out of the water as true to the original and a great succeeding game, and makes me want to buy the remastered collection before I have even beaten the campaign or tried the multiplayer. If you like strategy games buy this game. If you like homeworld, prepare to immerse yourself in the best cutscenes and music since 1999...			"

												Initial thoughts with follow up below:This is a preliminary review, but I have to say, I'm addicted to this game. I've always been more of single player fan, avoiding multiplayer until I've finished the story. And Homeword: DoK has a great story. I'm a little further than halfway through and I'm enjoying it greatly. I'd highly recommend experienced strategy fans play it on the hardest difficulty as it gives the feeling of the original Homeworld. I'd even go so far as to say H:DoK is a better game than Homeworld 2. HW2 left a feeling of disappointment for me, as parts of the original that I loved were smoothed over, and the story was made slightly more basic. For instance, strike craft and corvettes were forced into squads, formations were dumbed down, and the brilliant ballistic model was replaced with a dumbed down RNG system.While some of these things are irrelevant in H:Dok, the story is much better than HW2, the missions are generally more interesting, the veterancy system is better, and the balancing is better.The inevitable comparison to HW1 comes into play however, and in that respect the game compares favorably, but isn't superior. The story of HW1 was amazing, the score was perfect, the (original, not the remastered RNG system) ballistic model was revolutionary. It didn't have much in terms of unit variety, which helped with balance, so H:Dok has an advantage there.The aircraft/ground craft model is great in H:Dok. It's something like a mix between Wargame: Airland Battle and Supreme Commander. I love the feeling of lethality that Airland Battle gave ground attack aircraft, and H:Dok has it. Lastly, I love the art design in this game. The cinematics are top notch Homeworld style, the unit and terrain design is beautiful as well.So, well done Blackbird. I'm officially a fan. You've made this old Homeworld fan very happy.Edit:Now that I've completed the campaign on ""Classic"" or hardest, I agree with others that it is a bit short, especially compared to HW1. I enjoyed the campaign and found that the difficulty ramped up quickly in the last 3 missions. Up to that point, it really wasn't that difficult unless you are trying to save every single unit.I ended the game with an absurd amount of resources that I'm never hope to spend. I suppose you aren't expected to gather them all?Anyway, I'm going to give the Skirmish mode a try to see how it stacks up. I'm sure it'll be fun. I'm not really a multiplayer fan, but I hear it's fast paced and has a loyal community.All in all, I don't think the game could possibly have the staying power of Homeworld, because HW was so modable. HW2 ended up in the same basket. By virtue of the land based engine, it'll likely remain niche, but still well worth playing for the single player alone.So after completing the game, I give it 4/5.

												A great game for Homeworld fans with some defects. About half of the cut scenes are not skippable (annoying). There are a lot of cutscenes in the campaign that interrupt the combat (bad).  Campaign combats are often foreshortened weirdly and badly by campaign events. The campaign is too short. The gameplay is good. Compared to Homeworld 1-2, the game seems designed to keep one in high 2d line drawing tactical view rather than running it in 3d view mode. Just can't zoom out far enough in 3d mode. Took me about 14 hours of play to complete the campaign on medium somewhat incompetently.I guess I'm hoping this gang produces another of these. This felt like about 2/3 of a game. Definitely get it on sale.			"

												so first of to the negative stuff...the first thing i realized where the campain videos .. they seem quite low quality some times ( like when the world map is shown in them, its hard to read the pixelated text) i really expected better quality here.i am not done with the campaing yet .. but it seems equaly long as the other homeworld game , though there are less units and so on in it .. it basicly feels like there could be more content and quality.And its not bug free...beside that i can actully recomend this game.. in the end the rest is done so well ( good unit balance and so on), Very good campaing story, and fun gameplay.Though hardcore homeworld fans might be in for a suprisse .. gameplay tactis and unite size are not even close to the other homeworld game ( or at least you dont feel like it) .. it has a different .. somewhat downgraded feeling to be on the ground and be unable to jump your ships arround .. but if you can overcome that after playing the other homeworld games then you will like it like me ...

												Что можно сказать про эту игру? Я знаком со вселенной Homeworld, которая мне очень нравится. Все игры этой серии были сделаны с большой любовью и вниманием и Deserts of Kharak не стал исключением. Здесь есть всё что нужно хорошей стратегии, отличный сюжет, хорошая графика и отличная атмосфера. Я уже давно не могу играть во многие современные игры, но Deserts of Kharak затянул. Игра держит атмосферой. Конечно мне как человеку знакомому с вселенной Homeworld основная сюжетная линия  Deserts of Kharak абсолютная известна, но всё равно играть и узнавать сюжет очень интересно.Ещё хотелось бы отметить отличый звук. Вообще звук и музыка в серии Homeworld я считаю эталоном для стратегии.Я заслужено ставлю 9 из 10.			"

												This game is amazing. Really it is. As a strategy game, it has great tactical depth and forethought to make both the campaign and multiplayer delicious for years to come. The graphics are great, and units feel good. But that is not what makes this game so spectacular. No, its that it may be the best homeworld game since homeworld. This game BREATHES the aura of  sparsity, mystery, and holiness that homeworld evoked. This game blows homeworld 2 out of the water as true to the original and a great succeeding game, and makes me want to buy the remastered collection before I have even beaten the campaign or tried the multiplayer. If you like strategy games buy this game. If you like homeworld, prepare to immerse yourself in the best cutscenes and music since 1999...			"

												Initial thoughts with follow up below:This is a preliminary review, but I have to say, I'm addicted to this game. I've always been more of single player fan, avoiding multiplayer until I've finished the story. And Homeword: DoK has a great story. I'm a little further than halfway through and I'm enjoying it greatly. I'd highly recommend experienced strategy fans play it on the hardest difficulty as it gives the feeling of the original Homeworld. I'd even go so far as to say H:DoK is a better game than Homeworld 2. HW2 left a feeling of disappointment for me, as parts of the original that I loved were smoothed over, and the story was made slightly more basic. For instance, strike craft and corvettes were forced into squads, formations were dumbed down, and the brilliant ballistic model was replaced with a dumbed down RNG system.While some of these things are irrelevant in H:Dok, the story is much better than HW2, the missions are generally more interesting, the veterancy system is better, and the balancing is better.The inevitable comparison to HW1 comes into play however, and in that respect the game compares favorably, but isn't superior. The story of HW1 was amazing, the score was perfect, the (original, not the remastered RNG system) ballistic model was revolutionary. It didn't have much in terms of unit variety, which helped with balance, so H:Dok has an advantage there.The aircraft/ground craft model is great in H:Dok. It's something like a mix between Wargame: Airland Battle and Supreme Commander. I love the feeling of lethality that Airland Battle gave ground attack aircraft, and H:Dok has it. Lastly, I love the art design in this game. The cinematics are top notch Homeworld style, the unit and terrain design is beautiful as well.So, well done Blackbird. I'm officially a fan. You've made this old Homeworld fan very happy.Edit:Now that I've completed the campaign on ""Classic"" or hardest, I agree with others that it is a bit short, especially compared to HW1. I enjoyed the campaign and found that the difficulty ramped up quickly in the last 3 missions. Up to that point, it really wasn't that difficult unless you are trying to save every single unit.I ended the game with an absurd amount of resources that I'm never hope to spend. I suppose you aren't expected to gather them all?Anyway, I'm going to give the Skirmish mode a try to see how it stacks up. I'm sure it'll be fun. I'm not really a multiplayer fan, but I hear it's fast paced and has a loyal community.All in all, I don't think the game could possibly have the staying power of Homeworld, because HW was so modable. HW2 ended up in the same basket. By virtue of the land based engine, it'll likely remain niche, but still well worth playing for the single player alone.So after completing the game, I give it 4/5.

												I sort of recommend this game. For the price, there's little content to keep you going long term (5 maps??), and the unit type and population cap limit the scope of the game. Much like Homeworld though, there's something a bit special about this game. The low unit cap and mix means that the game is a micromanager's dream come true. Launching a gunship is a real event, if only because you have access to so few, while that isolated handful of tanks on the perimiter becomes increasingly precious as damage is taken from waves of enemy units. It's a little like Dawn of War 2 in many ways, though no where near as developed.I've heard the game called a Beta, and I'd agree with this. The resource wrecks are all copy/paste efforts for the same model, for example. Work needs to be done on the skirmish AI, though it's not quite as bad as some say. Personally, I find the carrier base to be slightly ridiculous and far too derivitive of an actual aircraft carrier. The design feels lazy and uninspired. It's unfortunate that it's got Ashes of the Singularity's lovely capital ships to be compared to at the moment. All in all, this feels like a game that needed a few more months of design and polishing.Despite these negatives, the game is a lot fun. The effects and sound have real oomph to them, and combat is very rewarding.  There's still a lot of work to be done before the game justifies its high price tag, and I'd expect to see a lot of free content to go in before we start on paid DLC, but this is one of the better RTS games to come out recently.

												I am an old Homeworld fan, so this may influence my review somewhat.Having awaited for the next HW installment for a long time, I was positively surprised when I saw HW DoK up for pre-order a few days before release, and since I enjoyed the first games I decided to give it a go. Already having the remastered edition I got a discount on the buy. And since I pre-ordered I got the DoK Expedition Guide as well.HW DoK certainly brings you back into the franchise - there is no Mothership nor space 3D tactics, but HW DoK has the same feel to it as the other games had - same type of mission videos, well told story line, music. The game evolves much like the original games - steady upgrading of your Carrier (Mothership) and units with research, while scaveninging as much resources as you can out of every map. Basicly, for the same reasons I liked the original games so much I also like DoK.As others have mentioned the multiplayer maps are few - yet for me, this doesn't matter all that much, as I mostly stick to single player. Otherwise, the main drawback of HW DoK, for me, is like the other HW games - It's so enjoyable it simply isn't enough of it and you keep wishing for more. (Perhaps that is why we like the franchise so much ?)The Expedition guide adds a bit of history to Kharak and the Kushan people. Enjoyable read which expands a bit on the HW universe.			"

												While no means perfect, Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is an amazing game.Having been a player of the Homeworld series since it first came out in 1999, Deserts of Kharak fills the Homeworld universe with more large scale battles set against epic vista's.The game has enough variety in the terrain for me that it doesn't get boring or repetitive. Vehicles are well detailed and it has different types to keep things interesting. I do have several things I disliked. The campaign I feel could have been a bit longer. While I am satisfied with what we got, I feel that a few more missions would have helped. I do feel the mission variety did help a bit though. Several other users have made comments of the low textures. I feel I must partialy agree. While zoomed out and moving around the map it really isnt that noticeable, when zoomed in, it does become apparent. All in all, I was happy with the game and the way it turned out. Hopefully BBI will improve upon this and work with Gearbox to create new space-based Homeworld games that we all have been dreaming for.			"

Campaign is depressingly short and leaves a great deal of gaps in what was supposed to be a telling of the times between the clan infighting on Kharak to when the Kushan left their dead behind in search of Hiigara.Combat is oversimplified with basic rock, paper, scissors tactics and virtually all multiplayer matches are decided by the first  two minutes of gameplay (whether your workers survive the rush or not). Offense being king isn't a bad design choice in itself however it makes the learning curve that much steeper with no way to observe matches nor host custom maps. (basic features for most RTS fans)5/10 - Campaign was interesting enough to finish. Multiplayer is lackluster.			"

												I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game in its current state.It's not that it's boring or difficult, it's just dissapointing. As a Homeworld (1 and 2) player there is a certain level of polish that feels like it's missing. It's not even like it's big things either, but the little things add up to create a sense of a game that's been rushed out. Things like the tracks, on tracked vehicles, not even moving. And the suspensions on said tracks not moving. Some of the textures look very low resolution too. The UI feels quite clunky, even compared to Homeworld! Add to that, the game crashed to desktop during the third campaign mission and it seems like there's a way to go for this game to be recommendable. Perhaps the developers can put some more effort into polishing and improving on the little things...			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a decent Homeworld game. It's surprising how the general flavour of Homeworld is represented in this game, despite the move from a space-based setting to the surface of the desert world of Kharak. The various units are visually similar to the space ships of the earlier games. The cut scenes are made in the same style. The voice acting is as good as in the earlier games. A central mechanic in the game is line of sight. You won't be able to target enemy units that are hidden behind a sand dune, for example, until you actually crest the dune and bear down on them. This adds some interesting stuff to the action, where you can also hide from enemy units' fire by staying behind obstacles. Some minor micromanagement is added to the mobile base that forms the heart of your land-based fleet in that you have to allocate power to different systems. For the rest, though, the game plays essentially like the earlier Homeworld games: protect your mobile base, harvest resources, pump out new units, and purchase upgrades. The problem is that it hasn't manage to really grab me. I'm partway through the campaign and I don't really care about what's going on. The environment never dramatically changes: you're always in the desert, and you're essentially fighting the same enemy in every mission. There's a steady trickle of new friendly and enemy units, but they're essentially varieties of things you already have: another quick light vehicle, another type of tank. It looks good and it sounds fantastic, but in the end all it really makes me want to do is fire up Homeworld or Homeworld 2 again. The remastered versions of those are great, especially with the recent patches. Deserts of Kharak is certainly well made, even if I had quite a few crashes (especially after I finished a mission and am shown the menu again). Stylistically it's entirely in keeping with the other games in the franchise, but it simply hasn't gripped me in the same way. In Homeworld and its sequel, the campaign continually pushes you on and throws new things at you. Here, I just can't be bothered. I'll recommend the game anyway, but it's more 50/50 than anything, and don't buy it unless it's for sale. It's well made, but there's simply not much here. The skirmish mode and multiplayer are afterthoughts, which is not surprising: Homeworld is one of the few RTS games where you play basically for the campaign. So don't buy the (overpriced) DLC; it's multiplayer/skirmish only. Maybe at some point in the future I'll try the campaign again and I'll be gripped by it. You might be entertained by it from the get-go.			"

												Deserts of Kharak manages to ""get"" what made the first Homeworld and Homeworld: Catactlysm great and gives us another story in that universe. Even though it's grounded, it still gives the same excellent sound and visual design coupled with great voice acting that we haven't seen in a long time. Also the RTS structure has been moved away from the frantic clicking of Starcraft making a great modern RTS well worth playing.			"

												As a non homeworld fan and someone who hasnt played the originals, id have to say its a pretty decent game. Its a good RTS. I like campaign so far and the different gameplay from having a mobile base. But, its not worth 50 bucks. There are only 2 factions and each faction has only a few units. No rebindable keys for some strange reason. The camera is a little unintuative. Example: camera doesnt zoom where the mouse is pointed unlike in supcom, sins, ashes and many other RTS games. I do find the camera controls a bit weird to use but you can get used to them. Oh and dont expect to pan and zoom at the zoom time. You can only do one thing at a time. The 50 dollar price tag is super steep for the amount of content. However, this game is a good deal about the 35-40 dollar mark. So dont pay full price. Its not worth it. It is worth a sale price tho.			"

												I'd give it a 7/10.  It could be a 9/10 if there were more game here than a short, single-path, single-faction, single-environment campaign.  Homeworld could get away with this in 1999, but not in 2016. Good:-Writing and art combine with the atmospheric soundtrack and good voice-acting to deliver a well-crafted setting-Balanced units-Gameplay and Pacing-Controls-Style is very true to the franchise, scratching all the right itches for a die-hard fan like myselfBad:-Lack of content (short campaign, no variety in environments, small cast, no replayability)-Graphics (low res textures, jagged shadows, lack of polish)-Multiplayer feels tacked on-Simple enemy AI-Lacks useful features from previous games (pausing to issue orders, formations, docking, full distance zoom without using tactical overlay)-Carries over all the little bugs and quirks from the first games.  You'd think they'd try to fix some of this stuff.One can tell that H:DoK borrows heavily from the code in the first games.  It seems like they took the original code and just added new textures, maps, objects, and some terse dialogue with brief cut-scenes.			"

												It is an over all pretty good game. Not $50 good, but good. Development on it did not start with Gearbox, and it shows. Mostly in the controls and environments. The visuals are pretty dated looking.I bought it because it had Homeworld in the name, and it was part of a bundle. The music and story telling stay pretty true to the series, and the campaign is well done so far. I would not recommend this game until you can get it for $20 or less.			"

												A truly excellent RTS campaign - possibly the best I have played in the genre. However, there isn't much else. The skirmish AI isn't great and the multiplayer base is dwindling.So, think of it this way: are you willing to pay the current price of Deserts of Kharak for a fun, atmospheric, stylish 15-hour campaign? I was, and I strongly recommend the game based on what I've experienced.Do you not care about the campaign and instead want a strong multiplayer RTS with lots of match options? You won't find that here.			"

												Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a decent Homeworld game. It's surprising how the general flavour of Homeworld is represented in this game, despite the move from a space-based setting to the surface of the desert world of Kharak.

												I am a HW fan and I like this game. Before I started, I wondered whether the team can tranlate the core of the universe battle into fights on the ground. After about 100 minutes play, I am concieved they did. This is a game fabricated with sincerity, deep understanding to the old HW games and creative thinking, which I have found lost in so many old frachises. It is hularious to see it. Some games, bearing the same name of the series and doing good job of keeping superficial things all along, have lost their core on the way. In contrast, this game keeps the core of homeworld, what makes fan like it, while has been creatively done in a very different way. A smart and enjoyable piece of work for me.			"

												I must admit when I first heard about this game I thought:    ""how could you make a Homeworld game that is planet-based?""Well the answer simply is by how HW: DoK is designed and executed.  It's a ground-based RTS sure but unlike any you have played.The vehicles look gorgeous zipping along; zooming off sand dunes only to bounce on their bouncy-bouncy tires followed by hair-raising hand-brake turns so that they can get close to their prey to finish them off with their high caliber, high powered kinetic weapons.Obliterate your enemy form the air by dispatching an air squad or gunship (the equivalent to an AC-130); finally turning them to molten slag by raining death from your bombers.Feel envious of the enemy's shiny railgun capital ship floating in the air in the same way that bricks don't?  Well just appropriate it with Rachel's groovy ""obedience whip"" (well hacking ray anyway) and its all yours!  Arrr! That be pirates in this 'ere dunes now!Send out your salvagers to gather much needed resources; go defend your allies carrier; defend against incoming units.  Oh no incoming ordinance!  Potential information overload!  Thank goodness for the real-time tactical map (better than HW's) which is surely the best thing since pop-tarts.  With this map you can be sure you can remain in complete control even you can hear the lambs screaming.			"

												If you're fan of the Homeworld series, like I am, this game is a must buy. A rich, story focused RTS with stylish aesthetics and a deep lore, it is a simple joy ride to fight & claw your way to the victory, for the salvation of your race.Gameplay is pretty solid too, it's not very micro intensive, yet requires a bit of thinking minds for tactics. A little advice: high grounds & line of sight are the key! LOL!Of course, the game isn't perfect... as some other reviewers have put in detail in their reviews. Simply put, at the time of the game's release, there're few problems... among other things like: atrocious AI, great quality that's lacking in quantity for content (so few options for skirmish/multiplayer setting... why?), Options menu quite lacking in... actual options (ex: un-rebindable controls, anyone? Yikes), and etc. Hopefully the devs work hard to remedy these problems with patches soon.Nonetheless, if you can look past these flaws, the game will entertain & enchant you for hours on end. :]			"

												This is not a fun game.You're supposed to do real-time strategy with a persistent fleet, but your units die in seconds to enemies that pop out of nowhere to kill them. They lampshade this by saying your enemies have hover technology which makes all their units faster? That doesn't make it less frustrating.To have any situational awareness at all (including 'what is this unit I'm looking at') you have to spend the entire game in sensor mode which is blue + wireframe symbols, so any screenshots of a desert world with 3d models is a trick. You never see that. This also means you don't get some basic things like health bars on units, and the elevation is really hard to read in sensor mode so you're going to screw that up a lot too.Resources are very finite for you, but infinite for your enemies as far as I can tell. And there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to anything that happens. You'll spend an hour slogging methodically through the mission with everything mostly working out fine, and then BOOM. Suddenly all your units are dead and it's time to start over.#$%^ this game. "

												I really like RTS's as a genre, but this is a disappointment on many levels.- The graphics are bad. I play in 1920x1200, as I have for over a decade. Settings are on ultra. The video looks terrible, definitely low res up-sample. Ok, but who needs video, it's purely cosmetic. The UI is upsampled, this is unforgivable. The UI for an RTS needs to be 1:1, functional, efficient and utilitarian. It is the most important part of the game. The map itself is not very good looking, but now I'm just complaining. I can get over this.- There is no mini-map!?! There is no way to hop the camera around from part of the map to another. All you have is pan/scan which is too slow and inefficient. There is ""sensor mode"" which is not a good substitute.- The AI doesn't seem to be very smart at all, it simply seems to rely on scripts and overwhelming force. It appears hard the first play, but then you learn the script and you prepare a defense. Really not that insightful. - The controls aren't very good, I can spend some time remapping, but honestly I expect at least a little effort to properly utilize my left hand (KB) and my right hand (mouse) for the actions I am going to be taking most often. I have to do this myself, for a large majority of the controls. Worst I have to waste keys for pan/scan that i would ordinarily never use. - I can't seem to access settings from in game, I have to drop to the main menu.- The voice acting is kind of weak. Rachel S'Jet doesn't have the kind of voice that projects either ""strong soldier"" or ""savvy scientist"". She sounds kind of like that girl you sat next to in algebra that thought math was hard. And you remember 10 years layer sitting in linear algebra with the professor droning about eigenstuff and wondering ""Huh, I wonder what she'd think of this?""- The units have a lot of special abilities that seem very challenging to effectively use given the limitations of the UI. I expect I will spend 90% of my time with the arrow keys moving my camera around. I plan to return this game. I'm sorry, but either this was intended to be a dumbed down RTS for consoles, or it just was not well conceived by people who understand RTSs. Play one of the later Dunes, play Command & Conquer, play Warcraft or StarCraft (pre activision). Learn what an RTS should look and feel like first, then make it Homeworldized. Do not set us back to 1995.			"

												Edit:SPOILERS AHEAD!Completed the campaign, Skirmish has 5 maps on launch.I got feed up when i unlocked cruise missiles for my Carrier, the game got to easy. Come level 13 (last level) they gave me a ♥♥♥♥ing orbital ion cannon that killed the last boss in 5 hits (took me 4-5 minutes to kill him). Worst boss fight ever in a homeworld game, story was okay but the ending sucked (last move was about 20 seconds long), from playing homeworld 1 i already knew the story and knew BBI had a challenge infront of them, they had to create something that put the fans on edge. The biggest plot twist was when the sister carrier, Sakala turned on you in mission 11. Suprise suprise, did not see that coming at all *cough*. She only hanged around for half the game ofcourse it was bound that she would betray your cause.Ending credit says that they want to thank all homeworld fans, Diden't know they wanted to thank us by spitting us in the face with this halfassed title of a game. It is to short, it has zero replayability, the AI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke... But hey atleast the game looks pretty (and outdated).Original Review below.Was looking forward for this game, being such a Homeworld fan.The story is good, even if its predictable for people who played Homeworld 1 (first schematic of the game pretty much spoils this game).Being 13 mission long it's a bit on the short side, you can easily complete the game in 6-7 hours, and there isen't much of repliablity. Seing that most strategy games let you play the ""story"" from diffrent factions and this game only lets you play the game in the eyes of the ""good guys"", not like say Red Alert where you can play the campaign as both Allies and Soviets with diffrent missions.The unit roster dosen't bring much to the table, and uses the traditional rock, paper, scissor. Where late game cruisers (battle cruisers/assault cruisers) being all around.The game also feels unpolished, when i came to mission 8-9 the game unlocked like all research options at once, letting me research about 15 projects at once, in earlier missions you got like 1-2 research projects. So it felt kinda rushed, as soon as you get near end game, they unlock everything at once instead of having a progressive research tree.  Can't remember Homeworld ever did this. From what i can recall you get the Heavy Cruiser/Battle Cruiser research on the last 2 missions.Also they added ""nukes"" in the form of cruise missiles. They are OP as hell and cost like 500 CU (Construction Units) to build and thats it. I had near 25000 CU's on the eight missions, so i could easily stand on standoff ranges and nuke the oppenents carriers without any skills whatsoever. Fun stuff! Right? No?Game also crashed 5-6 times durning campaing, Being a new release i'd figure that much so can't complain to much.It looks great, sounds great, i love the detail, units contacting the carrier to get information as background noise, that immersion! Love it.However compared to Homeworld 1 and 2, this game falls short.I'd recommend it, barely if compared to Homeworld 1 and 2. As a standalone game without any comparison its short and overpriced, Fells like a DLC for any Command and conquer game of some sort.Edit: As of writing this, 57% of the people who rated my review like to play games that hold your hand and is way to easy. This isen't a strategy game people, its a tutorial for... i don't even know what to call it.Rest in peace Homeworld. I miss Homeworld 1 and Cataclysm so bad.			"

												I have played a few hours so far, and this is what I have been missing in a rts game. The amount of content though as far as races and units though is lacking. you get maybe 9-11 unit types and only 2 races to choose from. And thats it. So the gameplay and units are cool, but I wouldn't say it's worth 50 bucks. It isn't even worth 30. There is literally no unit variety and it kind of sucks. What happened to games like red alert 2 or ground control. This was supposed to be in the same vein but those games had depth and variety back in the early 2000's. This just seems like a cash in on a name.			"

												Homeworld: DoK has got to be the best RTS game I've played in a long time.... Just started getting into the single player campaign and I am already impressed with this game. What a pleasant surprise in the RTS genre! I've never played the Homeworld series, but let's just say this... Homeworld: DoK was a great place to start!			"

												Too much money, for a half finished product, with poor ai, no key binding, no ultrawidescreen support, good campaign, and homeworld nostalgiathe campaign is good, but full price for 10hrs of gameplay... and it is 10hrs... because in multiplayer the AI is in such a TRAGIC state, given how much processing power there is in modern computers, there is NO EXCUSE for the ai cheating on hard, and being utterly brain dead on normal(im not kidding its ridiculously stupid on normal), with only 5mp maps, 1 of which is 1v1...speaking as a fan and as a value conscious player, i CANNOT recommend this in current state and at its current price, this is a good game that released unfinished and without AI programmers apparantly, for 30-40$ i would recommend this... at its current price its a bit of a rip off, not enough work has went into this game to justify the current pricetagEDIT[i've played all the homeworld games, and repurchased the remastered version even got 10% off deserts of kharak because of owning the remaster... and its STILL not worth it imo... i criticize it BECAUSE i am a fan....because i love the story of homeworld, which btw there is arguably little of in this game... im just not a blind fan.]			"

												Beautiful garbage.Lack of pause button removes strategy from this game.  You can't analyze the battle, and figure out the right commands.  There's no time for that.  You can either flounder around, losing way too many vehicles, or you can play a mission enough times that you have the coreography memorized.  That's not RTS.  It's essentially no different than dance dance revolution.A good RTS gives you time to thihnk.  Sometimes that means a PAUSE feature, other times it means how the battle is paced.Time to think isn't facilitated by ape-ing the beginning levels of the OTHER 3 homewolrd games, where you're frantically escaping from something.  What makes it brainless apeing,  and not ""payiing homage""...?  In the other Homeworld games, running out of tme was a clever illusion you're meant to see through.   In Deserts of Kharak, you are ACTUALLY running out of time, ticking clock and all.  DEVS.  MISSED. THE.  POINT. "

												[     ] Buy now[ ✔ ] Wait for patches[ ✔ ] Wait for sale[     ] AvoidGeneral GameplayIn terms of performance and integrity, the game is rock solid. I've yet to encounter any bugs or crashes, a huge contrast from playing Fallout 4's infestation of (mostly non-breaking) bugs. The developers did well doing QA on this game.Response time is excellent and pathing is mostly fantastic. I've yet to witness any issues with units being stuck or causing unwanted collisions. With that said, all the maps are open deserts with minimal obstructions so not much can go wrong. There's only about a dozen units per faction and the other faction has a mirroring unit with minor differences. This is far from being comparable to Starcraft 2 nor Company of Heroes 2. You can dumb it down to being a two dimensional plane version of Homeworld but it's much more refreshing to play.Single Player CampaignOverall, I enjoyed the single player campaign experience but it was lucklustre. I just wish there was more going on, be it in the background or actively part of the campaign. There's no ""critters"" or random environment props and units disappear after being destroyed. To be fair, there were sand storms in one of the missions.I don't consider myself to be an RTS expert and I don't think my APM is high enough to brag about, but I managed to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty and was only defeated twice - once on two seperate missions. The campaign is also linear and you only get to play as one of the two factions in the game. I was actually hoping that I get to play another 13 missions as the opposing faction. However, the amount of detail and production to produce the cutscenes and dialogue was fantastic! There's no ingame mechanic to compel you to replay the campaign again, once you finish it on hardest mode, you get 3 out of a maximum of 3 stars. It'd be fantastic to see how well you did on different runs of the campaign, particularly stats that show how much resources/time/etc were made during that run. Would also be fun to see how you fare against your friends!Multiplayer / SkirmishThere's only 5 maps. No joke.The only challenge you find here is if you play multiplayer against real players, the AI, for the time being, is way too easy than it should be. There's two modes that you can choose to play, artefact retrieval and annihilation. Artefact retrieval is an interesting idea, artefacts are spawned based off a timer mechanic and the first player/team to meet the target amount wins.There is also a unit cap of 125 in multiplayer, which feels unusual and I suspect there is a reason to this other than fps performance or balance. Considering the abysmal amount of maps included, if they had additional multiplayer modes such as King of the Hill or Company of Heroes' Capture the Flag/Points, that would at least give players more options to play with.The developers have included skins/theme mechanic for players to customise their army colours but I wasn't able to pick a different theme other than the default. You can change the primary and secondary paint scheme though, so that's something I guess.Final ThoughtsWhile I appreciate the amount of work that has been put into this game, particularly the single player campaign, I simply cannot justify the price.I just finished a comp stomp in Company of Heroes 2 and I definately enjoyed that more than the skirmish experience in this game.Wishlist: An additional single player campaign. DLC for the Gaalsian? Additional faction to differentiate between the existing two Needs more units and/or secondary active abilities. (Carrier with docking capabilities?) Additional multiplayer modes and winning condition options Harder AI Reasons to replay the campaign  More multiplayer maps $15-$30 expansionUltimately, I think the game is great and the developers are incredibly talented. At this point of time I cannot recommend this game to others, despite my enjoyment. I am, however, extremely confident that any additional content, be it patch, DLC or expansion by this team will be well polished and content rich!			"

												No, I can't recommend this game until a significant patch comes out. Lots of crashing, lots of lag, do I not have enough playtime to judge? Well you can thank DoK for that.Seems to be lacking in content, and mostly sadly of all, character. All cutscenes I've seen feel about 10-20 seconds too short, everything seems very clipped and concise. Leaves a jarring feeling when an epic homeworld opera starts playing during a cutscene which then immediately ends, cutting the music off. No fade to silence or you know... appropriate music choices for a cutscene that they know is only about 5-10 seconds long, nooo, just let it cut right out in the middle of a crescendo, fine, whatever. There really just hasn't been enough exposition and cutscene usage in general so far, and don't point me to the expedition guide, because I didn't buy an interactive game to read an encyclopedia.When I can play the game, I'm flying through missions with 0 losses on classic difficulty, which makes me seriously concerned about the brief 13 missions I'll get for my money. Nothing has any sense of importance or grandeur, most mission briefings, what there are of them, tell me how difficult a slog it's to be to get to X and then the mission becomes ""well here we are at X, tally ho"". Yeah, well done BBI, a modern day epic. ""Oh hey, build this unit"" is the only description of a new unit I receive, along with two arbitrary upgrades, again with no introduction and just ""oh hey we can immediately make everything better whenever we decide you can build something"". Everything just feels rushed and sloppy. Some part of the desert visuals look nice, other parts look quite poor, not a great deal of consistency despite it being the one terrain they had to do. A single terrain and it doesn't even look that great lots of the time.Generally I'm just underwhelmed entirely by the level of attention to detail and storytelling ability displayed. There's no real interaction between units and where there is it's done in a very joyless fashion. Harvesters just bob back and forth between resources and resource controller, no docking and unloading, just ""boop"" and it's all unloaded and back to work once it gets close enough. No docking of your land units with your land carrier, only fighters can and they're really more of just an additional carrier special ability. There's none of the nice interactions of units like in Homeworld.Maybe I'm just tired and grouchy, sick of constant crashes. I'll revisit this review as and when there is a patch, though I doubt anything will be done to fix any of my main gripes so far. Don't worry though, I hear some paid DLC will be coming soon, woopdidoo, have some more nostalgia money.Edit: So two patches in and there have been minor balance changes... no bug fixes. Wonderful.And BBI seem to just be letting the Steam forums fester instead of maintaining or posting information in them. I feel this game is just going to fizzle out.Edit 2: I played through bugs and crashes and 13 missions for a 10 second outro? Are you kidding me? This game is worth about £10 at most. Terrible story telling and a waste of the franchise and the good ideas it used up pointlessly.			"

												Pros: expedition guide, cinematics/story, visualsCons: everything elseI really want to like this game, I kept giving it a chance, and I will probably continue to do so becasue im a sentimental idiot about homeworld 1 and 2. But there are too many little things keeping it from being good. As it is, it can be enjoyable at times, but it is no homeworld.The unit control is terrible. Airstrikes are easily wasted at no fault of the player - they almost made air units work in a cool way, but they didnt pull it off by what I can only assume is laziness. You can't even save groups for air units - once they dock to reload, any grouping is gone, so you either have to waste a lot of time whenever you launch something, or let the ai waste their single shot on whatever they see first. Units get stuck on each other. Units have to be babied or else they will get stuck behind hills, potentially not contributing to a fight at all. There is no way to control what formation your units take, and there is no way to move a formation to face the way you want it, meaning your guys will run in one at a time in a line rather than as a wall unless you take a ton of time to set them up manually every single time you want them to move together correctly. Also, if you have units of different speeds in a formation (so more than one type of unit at all), they dont match the slowest speed, but instead rush in one unit type at a time rather than as a full force. Combat often boils down to an ugly point blank mess within seconds regardless of what you do, usually resulting in the bigger force winning. There is a way to make it feel like combat is random and frantic and unpredictable, and I doubt that is what they were going for here but regardless it doesnt work.Also everything is extremely rock-paper-scissorsy, and not in a good subtle way like the previous homeworlds. The way damge is handled and how this-unit-ALWAYS-beats-that-unit feels more like starcraft or command and conquer, or some old 2d rts. That type of game may have its place, but I dont feel that place should be in the homeworld series.The camera sucks. You can't rotate or zoom at the same time, or rotate and move, etc. When you rotate, it doesnt keep your mouse position where you left it, so if you rotate ~45 degrees, youll be on the edge of the screen when you let off, making you pan, which gets really annoying really fast. Also, as far as im concerned, the camera doesnt zoom out far enough without going into the sensor overlay mode. The entire game feels too close nomatter what is happening. It feels like someone copy-pasted some crap code off a unity rts camera tutorial and said ""good enough"" becasue suckers like me would buy it, and paid youtube dumbasses would sell it to people who have never heard of homeworld.There is no mod support as far as I can tell, though I havent looked into it much. Considering how well Gearbox did with the remasted version of Homeworld 1 and 2 and implimented the steam workshop, its kind of lame they didnt do the same here. Multiplayer is extremely limited, and the AI is horrendous so dont even worry about skirmish.Unlike the rest of the game, the story and cinematics are very well done and are what you'd expect from a homeworld title. The visuals give a feeling remnicent of homeworld 1 and 2 despite being in a desert and on the ground, and were often the only reason I remembered I was playing a homeworld title at times. Also a big plus is the expedition guide, which goes into detail about the history of Kharak, and its really nicely set up. Despite all the problems, it can be fun at times, but it's the same enjoyment that can come from any generic game. There is way too much getting in the way of it living up to its title, which is a shame becasue the potential is there.			"

												UPDATE: Well, I have tried now several times unsucessfully to contact Steam regarding the possibility of a refund for this game. According to their (more than likely automated) response;""Requests are considered on a case by case basis and are not typically issued for purchases of released products that are more than 14 days old, or if the purchased product has more than 2 hours of playtime. For in-game items the refund period is 48 hours and the item must not have been consumed, modified, or transferred.""The reason given is that I've played more than 2 hours. I'm sorry, but a blanket 2 hour window to request a refund for a game will never cover the multitude of possible reasons someone might request a refund, and it is potentially a massive problem for games that don't even last 2 hours. I've made it clear in subsequent requests that I would like a non-automated response to my concerns as the spiel indicates can and should happen, and yet again, did not receive one.  Furthermore, there is no way to directly contact Customer Service (if in fact such a thing does even exist) about my issues. I don't even want a full refund. I want acknowledgement of my concerns and a real person to communicate with me. I have only ever requested a refund once before (for something that I've never even installed) and I wouldn't make such a request if I didn't feel strongly about this. I would be happy for Steam to keep their % of the sale and give me something back out of what's left. Something that I can use for a product that isn't advertised to be something that it's not. The game itself is not terrible, but it's certainly not worth the price of admission compared to any somewhat equivalent product. Final Verdict: AmbivalenceIf money is not an issue, and/or you love slightly slower paced multiplayer RTSs, and/or anything Homeworld is simply your ""jam"", get it, get it right now. If you're looking for something single player, well;  - For a number of reasons, the gameplay isn't the least bit challenging, even on ""hard"" difficulty. I finished the campaign on hard, barely losing a single unit, with enough spare resources to rebuild my fleet several times over. - It's ridiculously short. I think I've logged around 12 hours at this point, and that's including a few skirmish maps. Add to that the fact that if you spend time mining, it'll slow down your gameplay significantly, and that is something I did. - The scenarios desperately lack imagination. Researching and developing new units and abilities is interesting and all, but there was never any particular tactics or strategies necessary to succeed, and only a few story-related mechanics. I love Homeworld, and aesthetically and thematically, Deserts of Kharak does a grand number of things right. If that's all you need for a good time, grab it and look past it's faults. Just bear in mind that unless you're looking to blast your mates apart time and time again, there just won't be much to it. Gonna have to go with a Not Recommended for now.			"

												I can't recommend this game at full price - which is a HUGE shame. On discount (50%) it is much better value. My whole issue with this game is its depth; it just feels rushed.  Pros 	 Explosions look great and feel satisfying - the way lightning arcs through the plumes of black sandy smoke looks awsome. Carrier explosions are unfortunatly the other side of this coin and are pretty lackluster. The in mission atmosphere, generated by the ambient unit chatter ect, can feel amazing especially when combat gets going.  The game feels like a homeworld game which is nostalgic. The units that are there, are fun to use. I enjoyed the story, even if it does feel a bit rushed towards the end. The music fits will into the game and brings a lot of life to some of the duller missions.  The game runs pretty well on highest settings on 4k despite my rig ageing a bit.(2500k @ 4.5, 24GB ram, 290x 4GB, SSD, Win10) Cons The minor stuff (which could get fixed by patches) The game crashes. I had 4 .exe has stopped working on my 10 hours play through the campaign. Buggy unit targeting priority - rail guns which are basically incapable of hitting the sandskirmishers (lighter vehicles) but will consistently target them despite other targets being available. More buggy unit behavior - Bombers will often fly over their targets and simply not drop any bombs. Visual bugs - aircraft are often invisible until they have left the end of the carrier ramp and cruise missiles will clip through vehicles and terrain before hitting their target.  Unit clipping - light ground vehicles will drive through structures they are targeting.The major stuff which really hurts the game. Very poor unit diversity - Where are the dreadnoughts ect?! This feels like Homeworld 1/2 with everything above a destroyer removed.  The Galsean (or however you spell the name) feel really underbaked in Multiplayer - they even have less units than the  Coalition! I find it odd that the Coalition get a fast battleship style ship which hovers (when all the rest of their units are tracked) and the Galsean feel like they are missing just such a unit. Was the side swapped because of poor unit diversity in the campaign for the Coalition?  No more resource ships docking like in Homeworld :(. Had this game has more units and a couple more single player missions with more variety this would have been a huge thumbs up. In the state it's in, with crashes and abysmal unit diversity I have to say don't buy! Hopefully BBI can patch in some diversity and make this game what it could have been!			"

												I felt let down by this particular title. I have never played any of the Homeworld titles but this seemed to appeal to me being a ground based RTS. All I really had to go on was Gearbox's Borderlands and how I really enjoyed them so I figured, why not?, I will give it a shot. I cannot reccomend this game currently with the rough UI and lets face it, the pathing is a bit irritable. I know I am not the only one that feels this way so I don't care to go into detail. The Graphicks are good, story legit but everything else seems to fall short of my expectations. After 6 hours of gameplay, I am already deleting this title from my library because the gameplay already tastes stale like a soda gone warm and drunk the next day. "

												Firstly, the game itself feels great, it looks great and so far plays well. It's at once familiar and fresh and really invokes Homeworld effectively, the story so far is compelling.It's a great shame then, that I cannot progress through the story to experience it all as I've encountered a bug that many people are also encountering that halts progress at mission 4.Restarting the mission three times hasn't fixed it, the twenty other mystical solutions offered by equally frustrated players hasn't fixed it.I really want to give this game a positive review but the trend of Gearbox allowing glaring bugs through to retail release is inexcusable, their general inability or unwillingness to perform proper QA shows utter contempt for the people who buy their games. If the bug is fixed in a timely fashion I'll consider changing my review for the benefit of BBS and the hard work they've poured into this game.Even if I do alter my review rest assured I'll be continuing my general avoidance of Gearbox products - if it wasn't for my love of Homeworld I wouldn't have spent another penny at Gearbox - not that I'll be missing much, Battleborn looks like garbage and Broderlands has been milked drier than the deserts of Kharak harhar.

												I loved hw1 and hw2. Hw2 being one of my favourite games of all time if not number 1. This game is very rushed. Almost every mission looks like there were some mechanic or art ideas but they trashed them, unit AI is very bad, ships constalntly overlaping themselves, especially harvesters. Graphics are disappoining, music is kind of meh. Pace of the game is sometimes ok but most of the time way too fast. This game screams 'i want to be homeworld 2 but I dont know how'. Reviewers said something about twists, I didn't see anything surprising. Also controls are way worse than in h2, how is it possible? But art style is super nice, and some of the maps with crashed ships are very cool looking, but way too small. I regret buying...			"

I'm glad I got it cheaper having bought the remastered set in the past (and long before than the original two games....)I could see it coming, the pace at which you get given new units is fast. Many researches... it doesn't feel like long before you have everything.This said, it feels like Homeworld, the sounds, styles, most of the gameplay (obviously being on land changes things somewhat!) the unit icons indicating what class something is etcTL;DR> If you love Homeworld, you'll probably love this.

												This game gave me a bit of mixed feelings. It has good fastpaced RTS combat. I really do like the combat, the carrier actually feels a good platform for combat and is not only meant for production like in the other HW games. If you don't take HW Complex mods into account. Campaign and lore is up to the legacy of homeworld games.For this ""review"", I would give it a side thumb if I could. For now I will give it a thumbs down once they fix the issues below.Primary things that really made me do a refund:- Only a very few multiplayer maps. I mean it.- You cannot rebind hotkeys. Using arrow keys for map movement instead of WASD isn't optimal. In Wargame: Red Dragon WASD map movement is a must for me.- Region lock in multiplayer. This way you will kill the multiplayer.I will consider getting this game in the future, once it's at the 20 euro price tag and when they actually patch the game to the state where it should've been at the release. Gearbox Software doing the rushed releases as always.			"

I have only ever requested a refund once before (for something that I've never even installed) and I wouldn't make such a request if I didn't feel strongly about this. I would be happy for Steam to keep their % of the sale and give me something back out of what's left. Something that I can use for a product that isn't advertised to be something that it's not. The game itself is not terrible, but it's certainly not worth the price of admission compared to any somewhat equivalent product. Final Verdict: AmbivalenceIf money is not an issue, and/or you love slightly slower paced multiplayer RTSs, and/or anything Homeworld is simply your ""jam"", get it, get it right now. If you're looking for something single player, well;  - For a number of reasons, the gameplay isn't the least bit challenging, even on ""hard"" difficulty. I finished the campaign on hard, barely losing a single unit, with enough spare resources to rebuild my fleet several times over. - It's ridiculously short. I think I've logged around 12 hours at this point, and that's including a few skirmish maps. Add to that the fact that if you spend time mining, it'll slow down your gameplay significantly, and that is something I did. - The scenarios desperately lack imagination. Researching and developing new units and abilities is interesting and all, but there was never any particular tactics or strategies necessary to succeed, and only a few story-related mechanics. I love Homeworld, and aesthetically and thematically, Deserts of Kharak does a grand number of things right. If that's all you need for a good time, grab it and look past it's faults. Just bear in mind that unless you're looking to blast your mates apart time and time again, there just won't be much to it. Gonna have to go with a Not Recommended for now.			"

												I don't get the rave reviews, the game demostrates some really acient gameplay. The old lame no supplies but the enemy is incompetant and who with infinite supplies should kick your♥♥♥♥♥but they are so dumb, after playing through infinte, isufficient EUs, insufficient EUs, insufficient EUs, insufficient EUs, insufficient EUs (eventually you disble sound to avoid that endless rant), you eventually grind away through it's stupidity.When computer lacked capability this was acceptable but now, it's just really lame and annoying. Smart AI and more supplies, would make the game enjoyable rather than a lame unreccomended game, not sure I will make it through a play through, the grind and the endless whine isufficient EUs, insufficient EUs or for a change up insufficient RUs, means writing this review was more fun than playing the game.Forgot to mention, game blatantly cheats, plays exactly like it knows exactly where you are, fair enough, but then don't hide from the player, just really lame game play.

												This game gave me a bit of mixed feelings. It has good fastpaced RTS combat. I really do like the combat, the carrier actually feels a good platform for combat and is not only meant for production like in the other HW games. If you don't take HW Complex mods into account. Campaign and lore is up to the legacy of homeworld games.For this ""review"", I would give it a side thumb if I could. For now I will give it a thumbs down once they fix the issues below.Primary things that really made me do a refund:- Only a very few multiplayer maps. I mean it.- You cannot rebind hotkeys. Using arrow keys for map movement instead of WASD isn't optimal. In Wargame: Red Dragon WASD map movement is a must for me.- Region lock in multiplayer. This way you will kill the multiplayer.I will consider getting this game in the future, once it's at the 20 euro price tag and when they actually patch the game to the state where it should've been at the release. Gearbox Software doing the rushed releases as always.			"

												I have always been a fan of RTS/strategy games, but this one doesn't do it for me. I tried very hard to like it, and push past the boring/annoying bits, but I just can't bring myself to do it.The campaign feels like a chore, and varies wildly from being ridiculously easy to a seemingly invulnerable enemy force. The economy system, with its finite rescources, doesn't allow for big clashes of massive armies. This mean that most battles are limited to small packs of 10-20 units. Despite the small army size, there is little benefit in microing units. I would call this game a ""slow RTS"" as far as build-up time, but it lacks everything that makes the late-game fun in an RTS.			"

												This game seems like an over simplified version of the original homeworlds (which could have been good, but this is too simple). the orginal homeworlds had so much more diversity in the strategies you could do since there were so many different units and the factions were quite diferent. This game feels just like rock paper scissors mostly.also the interface needs some polish.. the way you navigate to your units to build is so annoying. and the fact you cant face a group of units in a direction, and cant keep them in formation is really annoying. the camera cant be zoomed out enough either, i just land up playing in the tactical map mode mostly, so dont even get to see the graphics most of the time. Also havent played multiplayer yet, but ive noticed in skirmish you cant save replays... in this day and age this is an attrocity.As a homeworld fan im a bit dissapointed with this one. try again with homeworld 3campaign was alright though, bit short			"

												As of 1/25/2016 the game constatly crashes. Unplayable. Many fixes and workarounds were attempted to no avail. Refunded. i7 6700kr9 280x16GB RAM Update : I repurchased the game from a key site for $25 sometime in march, and I am VERY glad I waited for it to go on sale. The crashing issue is nothing like it was before, although it did crash in the middle of a mission 2 times during my campaing play through causing me to restart. Beat the campaign with every objective on every mission compleated in less than 8 hours (on normal). I also hoarded resources, and ended the game with many left over... so if I hadn't have wasted so much time collecting un-needed resources, the campaign would have been over in less than 6 hours. Very disappointing. Allthough extremely short, the campaign was equipped with a very engaging and thrilling story. However, the AI didn't really have any intelligence what so ever. No strategies other than ""move a small number of units straight at you repeatedly"". I did play on normal, but I doubt the hard difficulty would add any AI stratigies other than increasing the number of mindless waves. Skirmish was rather boring... nothing about it made me want to play it again. Multiplayer is dead, couldn't even find a match.			"

The skirmish AI is WAY WAY WAY too hard, i dont even get 5 minutes into a game and im being attacked by the ""easy"" AI? I just played a team skirmish game (3v3) and all 3 enemy AIs attacked me first (remembering this is still on easy) i had 3 groups of LAVs on me in under 4 minutes. Its not fun playing a game this hard.... at least make them actually EASY when it says EASY DIFFICULTY?!?!?!?!?! "

												A satisfying RTS that feels situated within the Homeworld universe. I enjoyed being exposed to the fully-fleshed out world of Kharak as previously only found in the companion guide to the original Homeworld. The art, sound effects, and graphics are all excellent and very reminiscent of the original Homeworld; the campain is fast-paced, fluid, and fair; and the writing dovetails into the plot of the first Homeworld. There are several Easter Eggs for old-school Homeworld fans, which are great. Unfortunately, issues with the writing keep this from being a masterpiece: key plot points are glossed over, the characters aren't as absorbing as the writers intended, and the latter third of the campaign feels rushed and incomplete. Additionally, the DLC's so far have focused on introducing units for multiplayer, rather than fill in more plot for the single-player campaign. The Expedition Guide is nice, but a PDF version would be nicer, so that I wouldn't need to launch a standalone app to read its contents. Finally, a few bugs persist (such as camera zoom occasionaly getting stuck on a unit until the camera is panned), but I didn't encounter anything that distracted too much from the experience.Overall, this is a solid single-player experience - I would pass on the DLC's except the Expedition Guide - and hopefully the devs release a DLC that fills in more of the campaign. A sequel would also be great!			"

												Given that I haven't played much homeworld before, though I've played RTS games for decades. Graphics are a bit underwhelming. The levels look ok-ish, the units and FX just look bland. There's zero sense of theatrics, for the actual gameplay. Gameplay, I can see myself eventually getting used to the interface. I like the grand veiwpoint and the great sense of scale,  but the gameplay gives no sense of gratification. An enemy unit is there, you select your units, click on the enemy, wait a bit and it's gone. They should've taken a lesson from Company of Heroes 2, SC2 or Warhammer; destroying an enemy unit should have a sense of occasion, you see debris exploding into the sky.Audio, what a mess. Especially for someone new to Homeworld, nobody shuts up for a second.Conclussion, I'm tired and I haven't smiled or raised my eyebrows once, in the hour and a bit playing this game, which is a problem, especially for a game that's this expensive. I MIGHT give it another go, when it goes on sale, but there's no way I'm paying 50 bucks for something this 'meh'.			"

												This is basically a 6hr tutorial and campaign for a multiplayer game that only has 2 races and 5 maps at launch.I enjoyed it quite a bit, but not for full-price.There also isn't much room for expansion or sequels, so I don't hold a lot of hope for the future.			"

												So far the game is a mixed bag for me.  I find the story pretty interesting and like the look of it but I am already bored of the old-school RTS gameplay in the campaign.I had the same issue with Starcraft2.  After playing Supreme Commander FA for hundreds of games and the Warhammer RTSs I just don't find much fun in spamming units, ramming some health bars into some enemy health bars and waiting for my inevitable win.  I want more strategic and tactical depth.  There is a rock-paper-scissors thing but it's extremely obvious when to use what unit so the only real challenge is in putting up with a bit of tedium and moving quickly.Also, I DESPERATELY want to scroll the camera back more in non-sensor mode.  It feels super claustrophobic and I wrestle with the camera to get it pointed at the action in time to see anything.  Which makes me want to stay in sensor mode, which seems like a waste. SupCom solved this problem years ago, but in the name of old-school we gotta ignore that?And yes, even though I loved homeworld back in the day I had the same feeling of boredom when I replayed the recent remastered version.  That old school RTS thing was just played to death and does not entertain me anymore.I hate to thumbs it down because it does what it says on the tin.  But I am sad that I probably won't finish the interesting story because the gameplay is not very engaging.  I would only reccomend it to someone with a nostalgic love of retro or who is new to RTSs in general.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but its horribly unoptimized. No matter the settings it still has this bizarre microstutter. I think the game looks beautiful despite everyone saying otherwise, the art style just makes it work. Now if only it ran better. guess I'll go back to Howeworld remastered while waiting for future patches.			"

												This game reminds me of RTS in the 90s and early 2000s.Not in the good way.Unskippable cutscenes, that you're going to have to watch repeatedly because the game bugs out and you have to load earlier games.Missions designed around a ""special ability"" that is completely useless outside of that special ability.UI choices that make no sense (esc should always close open menus and the focus for the save file name should be the text entry).The game cynically cashes in on the name of the Homeworld franchise while producing little to none of the gameplay or feel that the original games had. In trying to do something different to the Homeworld franchise, they produced a game almost exactly like every other ground-based RTS in existence.At least it's pretty.			"

												-No editor of any kind, a big no for any rts title.-No workshop support.-Multiplayer maps are the smallest I've ever seen in a rts.-No developer presence on steam forums.-Faulty AI after 30 minutes.-DLC is a cash grab scheme that had immediate post production release.-Prepare to be shouted down by people when you critique this mess.            ^(Multiplayer)^-Amazing ambience, beautiful gfx, except many have optimization issues.-A rip from C&C 4, except done well.-Intelligent mission design, persistent fleets, easy interface.-Good voice acting.-Mechanical execution is sound.-Short but sweet campaign, comparable to original homeworlds.                ^(single player)^With a great campaign and horrible Multiplayer scene this game should only be bought when on sale. The way Multiplayer deviates from the spirit of the rest of the franchise is confusing and a major let down, and with the utter lack of content it is being cemented as a arbitrary addition to an amazing IP. 9 hour campaign if you try hard, but most walk away after according to the stats. Dying game with no community collaboration, so much lost potential.Tldr: wasted potential, buy on sale, play campaign and walk away. "

												I played it..... and wow the only way they saw to make it difficult was to spawn infinate enemies, restrict your rescources (where in the story it was recource rich!) and to give the enemy tuns of troops to start off with so ya, then there is the last level where you get a space cannon that dose like no dmg where you are fighting a enemy mega ship (btw another complant is the miss used termonaligy, they use the same termonaligy that they use in homeworld) that has infanite resources to beat it and win the game I had to go in circles so it wouldn't catch me and kill me while hitting it with the space cannon, it took forever and in the end when it was low enouph I charged it with my remaining troops and took it out.though it was interesting no doubt and if you want a challange.... not to mention I got Homeworld 1&2 so overall not bad..

												So disappointed, was really looking forward to this. This game was not ready for release and does not live up to its heritage. Have requested a refund.As other reviewers have said, and in no particular order:- shoddy animations- shoddy physics- selecting units can sometimes be difficult and behaves inconsistently- inconsistent texturing (though some of it is beautiful)- a carrier that doesn't carry anything- resource harvesters that don't actually visibly return resources, just pull up 100m away from the carrier, pause and then continue.- pathing management with large vehicles and somewhat enclosed spaces is clumsy- backstory isn't particularly well presented, more implicit than anything else- semi-adoption of Homeworld keyboard shortcuts, but pressing 'f' to focus doesn't really work, double tapping it does nothing- no alt-select for focus- camera controls don't seem intuitive- camera can not be zoomed out far enough, forced into the sensor view 90% of the time, even though the maps aren't that large- only a handful of skirmish maps- AI is lacking in the campaignThe biggest problem though is one of the games core mechanics, the effect that elevation has on combat:- an overlay is displayed with elevation hints when you are issuing move or attack-move commands but this info is unavailable if you're simply right clicking to issue move commands. A keyboard key to toggle the overlay would have been more useful.- positioning units, particularly large groups of units, to take advantage of elevation is virtually impossible as there are:- no formations for units- no way of specifying the orientation of units or groups of units- despite LOS being such an important mechanic, you will often find half your units have none, and there's little you can do about it.I love the concept and art design. The UI is fine. Music is spot on and the Story is OK, just under presented.I think most punters were surprised when this was announced. Almost seems like the release date was a little bit of a surprise for the developers - seems as if they were rushed into getting this out the door well before it was ready, otherwise I would be DEEPLY surprised if all these game dev vets who were supposedly working on the title would have been content shipping it.If development continues post release and some of the above gets fixed, I would gladly change my review. Would love to this title shine.			"

												TLDR: At $30usd I’d recommend this, $50 feels pretty steep. Add it to your list and wait for the price to drop a bit. I’m gonna go on the record and say I loved Homeworld. In fact, I even made a Babylon 5 themed mod years back for the original (Conflicts of Interest), so I was super excited for this game. Spoiler free review.Positives Art direction  - Continuing the unique homeworld aesthetic, it’s almost minimalist letting silhouette and contrast describe things rather than piling on armour plate after plate. Its visually a breath of fresh air especially today when a lot of sci-fi these days is just over blinged crap (I’m looking at you Halo, StarCraft). The endless dunes in conjunction with massive machines is genuinely cool. The cut scenes are also fantastic, it’s a sublime mixture of 2.5d animation with in game cinematics.  Homeworld feel  – The game is a prequel so naturally it’s going to borrow things but it really does recreate that feeling of the original. Unit icons, radio chatter, upgrading functionality of your fleet is all very reminiscent of the original. Music, sound and voice acting  – Everything again feels spot on. From explosions to the urgency of dialogue in the middle of a battle, it’s extremely well produced.NegativesThe game is really short for a $50 title. I know I got the remastered editions of HW1 and 2 with it, originally I thought this was a plus, but now I almost wish I didn’t, did the price get pumped up to justify this? The missions themselves offer very little in diversity compared to SC2. Many missed opportunities here. Factional mirror matchup. Well one has tracks and moves a bit slower and the other has hover engines and moves a bit faster. It’s cool visually but gameplay wise after 6ish hours it really just feels visual. Disappointing. Homeworld feel  – The original came out eons ago, and while it was mind blowing at the time, I can’t help but feel like some things should change by now. No minimap. Yes, there’s a sensor manager but I just feel it’s a holdover from when you needed a fully 3d map(for homeworld). It’s too much toggling. It feels unnatural these days to be toggling on a mode that is essentially an oversized minimap. You can’t appreciate the art of the game while doing this, and you can’t properly manage any large scale battle without resorting to looking at light blue on darker blue boxes to decide the outcome of things. It’s kind of like how pro StarCraft players turn the settings all way down but to the nth degree. It’s cool for a mission briefing but I’ve grown to despise it for in game usage. Some units are also criminally forgettable  and look the same at a distance. Resource collectors and light units. Gotta use that sensor manager to select resourcers properly. But then Cruisers, all of them just blend into each other. In the sensor manager, battlecruisers, artillery cruisers and support cruisers share the same damn icon. But as they have vastly different functions, you have to zoom in or listen to the radio feedback when selecting them. But then you can’t see what’s happening on to your other units because you aren’t using the sensor manager to look at things, ugh. It’s just annoying. I’m forced to look at stupid light blue on blue boxes to issue orders and have map awareness, but it just hurts the experience. I can’t appreciate the little firing animations or the little clouds of dust they kick up when moving. Stop taking me out of the experience While the story is cool it’s also a bit naff. What do I mean? Well it drops you right in the middle of things and sets you up for an epic ride, and it just doesn’t quite get there. The motivations of your foes are quite flimsy, it feels a bit rushed or cut short. It basically left me feeling a lot of why and what and then just ok whatever towards the end.   UI annoyances - Burying build units under icons. I found it rather irritating that building units you have to select your carrier, then select a box, an arrow shaped box, a diamond shaped box or a slightly askew box to then build light medium air or heavy units. The icon differences are just crap and it feels unnecessary given that there really aren’t that many units total to justify the categorization. The game focuses on quick decision making while managing your entire fleet and their abilities, this is something that takes away from your concentration in a big fight.  Basically the game definitely is a step back from the control and finesse system of SC2.I honestly did enjoy the game, and won’t be asking for a refund or anything but since steam only allows for positive or negative and not something in between, I’m going to have to go with negative mainly due to the current price. I was also kind of a superfan of homeworld, so for a newcomer I think at around $30(USD) would’ve been a good price (turn the recommendation to yes) for this title. I’ve been harsh on the game but only because of how I had such high hopes. My negatives really aren’t show stopping in any way, but I feel like the current price point the game just doesn’t offer enough to justify things. I both love the homeworld feel but also feel like BBI hamstrung themselves adhering to it so closely. They wanted genre defining but I feel like this will simply stand as a good game, not as the standout title that Homeworld was.			"

												This game could be described as a reskinning of homeworld. That would  be ok, but i find certain Mechanics and elements lacking making the overall gaming experiance a bit of a let down.For example....1. You cant skip certain  cut  scenes making replaying difficult missions a drag2. Game load time is slow, even on very fast dedicated games machine3. Game path is linear, certain events are triggered regardless of whats happening making the completion of objectives difficult.4. The controls are not as sophisticated as homeworld. For example you cant queue your build order when you dont have minerals.5. Not sure how intelligent the units ai is. In homeworld units would attack the appropriate units they were meant to counter.6. You dont have the option to restart the mission from the beginning until you fail the missionHavnt played multiplayer yet, Maybe after some updates or dlc releases the game will live upto the original, right now it dosent.

												i bought this game for the nostalgia factor after i played the original Homeworld and Homeworld2 in early 2000s.. since then, there has been a number of better RTS games than Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.. games such as Starcraft2 and the Red Alert series, that i would recommend over Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak ..without the nostalgia factor, i guess i would be more disappointed and more critical with Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak..the graphics is great and the zoom close-up during battles, is definitely impressive.. but the story is very very minimalistic following the style of the previous 2 games.. however, the previous 2 games came-out in a time when PC gaming was in its early infancy.. maybe early childhood.. the technology of the time did not allow Homeworld and Homeworld2 to have complicated game-play and top-notch cinematics.. so the style of the game had to be as minimal as possible to work in most computers in early 2000..but Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, came in a time when there is so much more that could have been done to the game..   just look at Starcraft2.. i dunno.. Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak just feels ""lazy"" to me, compared to what Starcraft and Command and Conquer had become.. and compared to the original Homeworld and Homeworld2..FURTHERMORE.. and this is a BIG one!.. the reason why i loved Homeworld and Homeworld2 so much, is because the battles took place in outer-space, where you had to navigate in a 3D space and you had to move your units along with x, y and z axis.. at the time (in early 2000) Homeworld and Homeworld2 were the best space RTS game in a truly 3D enviroment..no other game came close to what the original developers of Homeworld and Homeworld2 have achieved..Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, did not add anything new that felt groundbreaking.. so ok.. I AM A SCI-FI JUNKY.. AND I WANT TO SEE MORE SPACE BATTLES!! and i find my fix with Starwars, StarTrek, StarGate, BattleStar Galactica.. and the Expanse.. those sort of things..Homeworld and Homeworld2 gave me MY FIX.. furthermore, the workshop allows you to transform some of Homeworld units into BattleStar Galactica and StarWars units.. that is simply fantastic..but Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, it takes place on the surface of a planet, on the ground and in the desert.. YAWN!! this is a big let-down for me.. if i wanted a better game that has battles taking place in the desert, there are many many RTS games out there that provide better story-line and better gameplay..i give Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.. a 3/5.. or a B-..without the nostalgia factor.. maybe a 2/5 or a C-..by comparison, i give the original 'Homeworld' (remastered) and 'Homeworld2' (remastered) a 4 out of 5.. or a B+.. do check them out..

												Me only being at Mission 6 out of 13 right now, seems a bit early to write a review, but for me personally, its not. I've always been afraid of strategy games, they always seemed full of different systems and features, hard to understand. This game however, looked very easy to understand and so it is. Its great fun and it makes me finally like a strategy game for the first time in my 25 year old life. Rachel is great as your protagonist the story is the ""lets fight for resources"" standard in the genre, but they still tell the story very nicely with good movielike cutscenes before each mission, which draws me into the universe every time after putting it down for a while. The game has a great learning curve. When I fail, its because I did not understand the features of a unit from the get go, and not because the game failed to tell me but because I just am so fresh and new in the genre. I never liked a gearbox-published game, this is the first one that I fell in love with. Please let the studio do the franchise from now on, and don't make it as complicated as the competitors. For me this was an amazing experience already and I'm only almost half-way through. I can only speak of single player, since I dont dare to try face off against other people. Just wanna get the basics straight for now.Technically it seems very polished and clean, it has this ""plastic"" look that Portal invented. Some people call bad fps on this title, I never dropped below 60, but then again I only face off against AI in single player missions. Voice over work is also amazing. Please make Homeworld 3 now!

												While Deserts of Kharak certainly was inspired by the Homeworld series, and the touchstones fans are looking for are present, the execution of the game demonstrates a bewildering naïveté by the developers who never seemed to get their arms around what they were writing.First, let me say this game is beautiful.  The artists did a top-notch job, and the cinematics feel like a more evolved form of Homeworld's black-and-white, simply animated cut scenes.  The new characters, the models, and the interface all compare favorably with modern RTS's.The main problem I had with Deserts of Kharak actually had to do with the way the setting, the mission design, the visual design, and world never seem to meet, and indeed, actively clash in numerous places.Let's start with the visual design.  Deserts of Kharak, as the name suggests, takes place almost exclusively on enormous, tan dunes of sand.  There's very little visual distinction between terrain rises, falls, and textures.  If the game were in VR or otherwise provided steroscopic vision to the user, this might be less of a problem, but as it stands, just reading the terrain you're looking at can be surprisingly difficult.Secondly, there's the units.  They're the same color as the terrain they're sitting on.  While that would probably make sense for a desert fighting force, from a gameplay perspective, it makes interacting with your units from the main game view very tricky.  Even with the overlays that provide different shapes for different types of units, it can be a challenge even to see a unit, let along distinguish what kind of unit it is.The sensor manager from Homeworld is back, and provides the shape-based overlays for both friendly and enemy units.  Unlike Homeworld, though, terrain plays a major role in the micromanagement-heavy gameplay of Deserts, as does unit orientation.  Neither bit of information is clearly expressed in the sensor manager, and as a result attempting to control the battle from the sensor manager can be something of an exercise in surprise and frustration.The sensor manager also gives me an opportunity to segue into the issues with the mission design.  Especially early in the game, the missions introduce challenge by having enemy units attack simultaneously from multiple different directions.  In principle, that's fine, and it makes sense in the context of the story, but that type of mission is singularly poorly-suited to the interface of Deserts.  Because the game encourages, to the point of requiring, micromanagement of units, and because you can only get a view of the battle as a whole from the sensor manager (which is an entirely separate screen), it is very easy for a player to simply be unaware of a new attack force or front moving in from a different position.To put it in more technical terms, the other games in the Homeworld franchise could get away with their UI choices because the missions always made it clear there was a defined axis of attack.  Deserts of Kharak does away with that choice, and while it is unlikely to cause a player to fail a mission outright (although certainly possible), it feeds a feeling not that the enemy is outsmarting you, but that the interface you're using isn't up to the task you've been set to.Finally, the story is... strange.  It moves in fits and jerks, asks a lot of questions, and answers few.  Long-time fans of the Homeworld universe will undoubtedly be left scratching their heads at a number of the retcons that were introduced to support the new story.  The end of the campaign comes suddenly, and the few seconds we're spared of denounement do nothing to resolve any of the questions raised to that point, or hint at the fate of the characters between the end of this game and the beginning of Homeworld 1.Ultimately, and in spite of the Making Of content, this game feels like a game written about a science fiction desert society, that was crowbarred into the Homeworld franchise by adjusting the interface and story, but ignoring the game design lessons of its predecessors.  Deserts of Kharak would've been much better served to have simply remained Shipbreakers and stood on its own.  By becoming a Homeworld game, both the franchise and this product have been diminished.			"

												I have an i7, 16gb of RAM and a 970. Game wouldn't let me change my graphics settings above ""low"", saying it would cause system instability. Also, I could not change keybindings.Other than that, The game was rediculously underwhelming. I don't even know where to start. Actually, that's not true...I just don't care. This is the first and only game I've ever requested a refund for, and I own damn near every RTS since Red Alert.			"

												The game is heavily bugged and not worth anything above £10The main campaign crashed to desktop upon starting the first mission and it would not load not matter what i tried.Skirmish was buggy but was generally the only thing that worked. Didn't manage to test the multiplayer.Until they fix the game, don't pay for it.When they fix the game I will consider changing this review.			"

												Imagine your favorite movie. The opening scene comes, your hero comes into view and... you can't hear a word he/she's saying because the music is too loud! Why would anyone in any part of the gaming industry choose to have just one volume slider for both music and cinematics? There's also no key rebinding (can cause issues for anyone that has ever gotten used to other game's controls or for some other reason wants/needs to rebind the controls). I've had constant screen tearing no matter what settings I used.Usualy I'd like to talk about the story, but the initial issues I've had made it hard to focus on the story. The only thing I can say about the gameplay is it feels cramped and a bit outdated.If you're looking for a good AAA game, then keep looking, because this isn't it. If you're looking for a cheap indie game, then keep looking, because this isn't cheap.			"

												It ran terribly on my machine, which runs GTA V on Very High/Ultra. It also kept crashing. got an i7 with 16G Ram and 4G nvidea graphics card.But even when I did play a few games, it was just kind of boring, the multyplayer maps are just too small and there are hardly any maps. I thought Homeworld 2 was awesome, but obviously didn't have much expectation of the maps on that ha.Also I feel the units are a bit dull. I don't know what I expected really but my excitement was short lived when I actually bought the game. I've never left a bad review before, but I paid more for this than most games and enjoyed it a lot less.			"

												Having been a long time fan of the franchise and reading some of the inital reviews from ""professional"" reviewers I was excited and broke my rule of not buying full price games when they just come out. That feels like a bit of a mistake now. While I enjoyed the story and had fun playing the game I completed it on normal difficulty in under eight hours. That was taking my time too, I was a little too cautious on several missions which in hindsight I could have beat with a small force. Once you got a decent fleet put together you can own everything pretty easily.For $50 I just feel like there is not enough meat here to justify that cost. I would recommend this game at $20-$25 but it is not up to the standards of most of the other games you can get in this price range. For me to recommend it at $50 I would like to see a much more envolved campaign more, different more challenging missions. More of a flushed out story, while I enjoyed the general story line it feels like the cliff notes version and could do with having more details flushed out.  "

												The game itself was quite good. I played it whenever I had some free time. All in all, I managed to finish the game on the highest difficulty setting within ... 18 hrs. For a 49 EUR game it is a joke, really.Multiplayer is weak at the best, skirmish mode - I tried it, played a couple of matches, all of which I had won easily on the highest difficulty setting without any trouble.And I am not THAT good a player.Was the game worth buying at the current price? No. Definately not. Would I recommend buying it with at least a 50% discount? Yes. A price range of up to 25 EUR would be fine. As a 49 EUR title the game is much too short. Less than 20 hours of play for such money should not happen.My recommendation - wait until the game is much cheaper or on sale and then buy. Not before.			"

												I'm going to say no because a few basic controls were misisng and the controls that are there are more difficult to navigate then the previous homeworld games. One completely missing feature is the ability to set formations ie your slowest unit will determine how quickly a group will move. Considering some of the faster units are completly useless against certain enemies they get slaughtered while your slower units, more capable ones against those enemies, are way behind. Construciton and research menus don't make any sense in navigating not compared to before. Its just dumb in my opinion.			"

I run the game maxed out on my 980ti, the temps never get high and i dont see FPS drop.But a game shoudl not SHUT OFF my video card when crashing.			"

												Don't buy it, plain and simple.I've been playing the game for some time, and even to the day of this review. The game is still unoptimized. There is a reason to why they caped the unit counts to very low. Each unit in the game is being constantly checked by the CPU, so unless you have a 24+core CPU your game will hit in the mid 40-30fps on maxed unit counts. The game also skips and stutters even during in game movies. I've been playing DOOM2016 and I never seen it dip below 60fps. Even played SquareEnix Supreme Commander with hundreds of units on screen and again it never dip below 60fps. So unless it's free don't get this game.

The shipbreaking mechanic crosses past pointless into annoying, and nothing gameplay wise happens in the campaign.I Alt-F4ed the game just now in frustration because half my army got wiped out DURING THE CINEMATIC of a group of enemies appearing. The game feels exactly like an RTS made in 1999, and not in a good way. There is just so much more they could have done, and so many concepts they could have borrowed from games that came later.  I'd say the only good thing about it is the music.			"

They didn't finish the game, but they are selling DLC for it.It's not appropriate to list all of the little things that are not finished or polished. The game just wasn't done. There are minor bugs all over the place. Animations and cut scenes were hastily assembled. They just said, ""F it! Ship that s**t!""Controls are frustrating in the same way they were for Homeworld 2.You can't skip cut scenes.There is no mid-mission save.There is no pause.Press esc all you want, because nothing will happen.You can't even stop the mission without alt-F4ing the game, if for some reason you need to quit.Combat is goofy. I managed to beat the end level and the boss unit almost by accident. Now I really don't have any desire to play anymore. Uninstalled.If you must, wait until it's on sale for less than $5.			"

												I thought I would love this game but it is super boring. Literally all the same units with a few different maps and that is all, nothing inuitive nothing interesting.			"

												Initially a great game, the campaign was in line with the homeworld feel and a great story but it was short and very simple. I was expecting there would be another ark of story in the campaign with another race of enemy but sadly no.After that there was no point in playing anymore. The multiplayer/skirmish has no replayability after a couple of games because; the cap limit is 125, no mod support, barely any configuration of game settings/units etc, you cant capture enemy units anymore and the units have been changed for the worse over the campaign. Such an downward turn after the caimpaign it was very dissapointing.This is a good game and campaign for $15-20 but no more as all you really get is a good but short campaign. Not recommended unless it comes down a lot in price or gets mod support or updated significantly.			"

												I enjoyed this game, but if you are new to the series, I can't recommend given the price-to-content ratio.Definately captures the feel of Homeworld... The graphics, UI and cutscenes are true to HW. The game also makes good use of the 2D aspect. Introduces carrier-borne aircraft to add more dimension as well.Campaign is good and sizeable (10hrs?), although being a prequel you should know whats going to happen, and there really aren't any surprises. Even the 'big twist' is completely obvious if you've been paying any attention to the dialogue.Unfortunately has little content upon release... Only 5 maps. 2x2-player, 2x4-player and 1x6-player. Unit selection feels a little small, and even the heaviest non-carrier units die very quickly if properly countered.The game also has completely braindead AI that is only capable of throwing endless waves of units into your meatgrinder. It can't even build up a significant force, it just spams you with small groups of units.I hope they add more FREE content to this game. They have created a good base game here, but it has no longevity. If they are simply going to leave it to the modders to extend its lifespan, then the asking price should not be nearly so high.			"

												I requested a refund on it allready. It is very lacking in features and full of bugs. Only thing that felt complete is the campaign, and that alone is not worth the 40-50 dollar price. It really saddens me to see such a good series in the past do so poor now. The camera controls were buggy, units lacking, ai just dumb as bricks, and the amount of skirmish maps I can count on my hand is pathetic. Individual unit behavior is pretty bad too. The entire high ground feature is more of a gimmick and ends up hindering your units are they are too dumb to move half a foot to crest a hill to shoot enemies and instead stare at the small hill while the rest of the selected units get shot up. I don't know if they were rushed from gearbox or the ip transition was too difficult for a small team, or what happened, but this game is bad. 4/10 just for the good cut scenes and campaign. 2/10 for actual gameplay.

												I might change my review later on. Campain is pretty cool, good voice acting nice cinematics amd good enough story to keep you playing till the end. My problem is the little multiplayer content and at launch i wasent able to find any multiplayer games. Until they fix this issue for me and add more maps i cant say its worth its cost. Dont get me wrong the graphics is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome!! The game handles and operates easier than space Homeworld for me(less camera movement) but i just feel if they dont add content quick this game will become stale. Think there is 5 multiplayer map.... With 2 factions only. (I dont mind the factions) and 3 game modes... Public lobby dont have a refreshbutton.... Im sure my review will turn to a positive very soon! I have faith that future patches will make this game epic.			"

												I played the tutorial, watched the story and had a hard time with the controls. So I went to change them in the options.....only to find that you CAN'T REBIND KEYS.This is essential for players who can't adapt to controls, and who have a hard time with RTS games.The controls are largely clunky and unplayable. Utterly ridiculous. The game looks and feels pretty solid otherwise, but to get my like this MUST be fixed.			"

												Difficult to not recommend but....No tactical pause just spoils the experience for me, RTS's with enemies attacking at multiple points just means you lose a grip of what's going on. There is a menu pause but that is literally it, you can't scroll the battlefield from there, can't organise your forces, can't co-ordinate your attacks or defences. It's a really bad omission, real-time but no strategy.Great graphics, interesting story, nice mechanics all spoilt by having no time to savour the experience. Click, click, click...Group 1 under attack, group 6 under attack, carrier under attack...just relentless.Such a shame.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME...yet. Or maybe do. But read this first.There are some serious performance issues.I have a 3.6 quad, GTX 970, and 16 gb of ram and after hours of tweaks and ""fixes"" I am still getting 10 - 20 fps on lowest settings. My rig should be crushing this game.This issue only pops up when battles start getting larger. So if you buy this game and start playing the campaign, you won’t run into this until it is too late to return it.Alot of people are having this problem and the ""fixes"" are not working.I recommend waiting to see if these issues are resolved.ORBuying it, firing up a big skirmish right away to see if you are affected by the unplayable FPS issues plaguing some people. That way you can still return it and buy it again later if the issues are fixed.Seems like devs are starting to catch wise to this issue, hoping they come out with a fix.Before the game♥♥♥♥♥♥itself, its was pretty cool.

												Unity engine is the worst thing for playing something dynamic, like RTS. On my 2500k@4500Mhz + geforce 1070 +16Gb Ram it lags all the time.The game itself is atmospheric, but too shot. And has a very ugly method of using global map with very low camera position on tactic map. Time for loading the game on my config with SSD is too high, so, you need too play fair and forget for save-load tactic. Most of cutscenes cant be skiped, and when you replaying mission for 4-5 times, its very annoying.			"

												After playing 3 missions in campaign and also a skirmish mission, i must say i am very very disappointed. 1. Very little different troop types, i mean really about 14 units in game.2. Unit limit of 125 and then you have to build these stupid pods to give you more troops up to 125 which the enemy keeps on destroying. 3. You can only harvest with 2 harversters at a time on a harvest spot.4. 5 skirmish maps, reallly??? i mean come on and then the biggest one is 6 player and small at that as well.5. Not a lot of research and not even enough money on map to even research everything.6. Choppy graphics especially in the cutscenes, i mean really, i have a GTX970 G1 Gaming card and choppy. I play Witcher III on full graphics and not choppy.7. Controls are crap and when units close together it keeps on selecting just the one and you have to select all just to select the one you really wanted. Not good at all.8. Cannot even save in a skirmish, so if i must go after playing for hours in a skirmish, then i must either leave the pc on or just abandon the game. What a crap scaled down version from what Homeworld used to be.This is a scaled down version of what Homeworld was and then at $50 price tag as well. This is maybe worth $25.Go play Homeworld Remastered or buy something else.I am really not happy and was waiting for this game hoping to be as homeworld. This whole game feels scaled down with so few troop variety and unit limit. In Homeworld i did not really feel the unit limit because there was so many diffirent troop types and just felt bigger.Wait for a bargain.I feel like refunding this game.			"

												Having played a lot of Homeworld with its finelly tuned control scheme, H:DoK control scheme surely is not. Right clicking puts the mouse in view mode rather than interpreting it as a move order. Control-dragging often results in a selection rather than an attack box. The alt-click and alt-drag to focus from HW is sorely missed, instead click F to focus on selected unit(s) together with a hit-and-miss selection function (it is more difficult to select units than one should expect from an RTS.- Story is fine so far. - Graphics (except the lo-res stuttering cut scenes used sometimes instead of game engine cutscenes) is what I expected and wanted from the HW devs and art directors.- Sounds and music are as good as HW.- Controls are so irky, quirky and sub par, I don't want to ruin my experience by continuing until the game has been patched. I hope it's not a Unity engine issue but only an unfinished, untuned release.In the state the game is now and for the current asking price I unfortunately cannot recommend the game. I got everything I expected except from the control scheme that is neither up to HW nor RTS standards.Will come back after a patch or two though and promise to change my No to a Yes. I wan't to believe ;)			"
