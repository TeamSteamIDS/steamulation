												I'm the guy who checks New releases on Simulations and Strategy games daily looking for the diamonds in the rough. This Game puts you in the role of Air marshall In Charge of the Raf during the battle of britain. It has 3 different scenario, 10days 25 days and 50 days. It has a very good tutorial, I've played about 3 hours so far and am confident that I have the mechanics mostly down. You manage your budget, Decide what to build, (factories, airfields, radar, artillery) WHere to place it and of course you are in charge of your squadrons. WHen you actually enter combat, you can auto resolve and the let the computer do it or you can take charge yourself. The battles do occur in real time, but the pause feature is there when you want to update your orders due to changes in the battle. I've played about 3 1/2 hours and gotten about 4 days in our 50 days, so you are defintely going to get your monies worth. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys simulation/management/tactical combat games. Anyone who enjoys air combat in xenonaughts will love this game, anyone who enjoys the panzer general, panzer corps series will also love this game, I do hope this game does well for them, i would like to see some expanded features via pathces or dlc or even another game where we can play the german side. All in all well worth the money for the time and gameplay experience.			"

												A really fantastic game that reminds me a lot of Battle of Britian on my old commodore 64 many years ago. I have to say though with modern computing and gaming in general this a really whole new world. The AI is crafty and can wipe you out if you can't keep up. Interesting tactical map situations put you into real binds. Do I need a Radar? or do I place a AA gun and try to soften the German bombing groups en route and then strike? Oh and there is that little thing about lacking planes. maybe i need to build a factory. It reall is quite a puzzler. Also the battle map is super simplified yet very satisfying as you try your best to cause the maximum damage in a situation where you are ussually outnumbered, without losing pilots and machines. A great game that will have you suffering from missing time syndrome. If you tell yourself, okay 15 minutes then off to the movies, you may find that 15 minutes multiplying into hours. Good stuff!

												This game is so close to being good, but it falls short in a few ways that by themselves aren't a big deal, but together create a poor experience. Pros - A unique experience in PC gaming (for the most part).Interesting management aspectsCons -Poor and unresponsive UI and controls.There were 71 squadrons in the Battle of Britain. Of those, 2 were Polish. Yet in the 3 times I played the campaign, all my squadrons were polish, with polish names and voices. This is INCREDIBLY unimmersive. Oh and weird, the developers are Polish. I'm all for remembering their sacrifice and effort in the battle of britain, but not at the expense of the British.The game is not well explained to you. There's a short annoying tutorial, then some hints.The actual tactics of the game aren't that interesting, and can tend to be a little micromanagey. Overly so. The best tactics are all cheesey and gamey.It's repetitive. Fighting the same kind of enemies over and over.The sounds...mostly okay except the voices. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn them down in battle, so it's just listening to bad polish voice acting.I wanted to like this game, but ultimately I didn't. For a better Battle of Britain experience try the board game - RAF: The Battle of Britain 1940.			"

												As it stands I heavily advise AGAINST buying this game for several reasons.1 - You can lose all of the pilots in a squadron simply because they're too terminally stupid to make the decision to bail out themselves and it's often an impossible task to hit the bail out button the game gives you in the *tiny* window of time available to you to do so while the pilot's plane is under fire.2 - Withdrawing is not an option, say your pilots have stripped away the fighter cover for a flight of bombers but are in no shape to carry on the fight? Tough. It's very much the stalinist approach of victory or death, if you go back to the map you're left at the tender mercies of the auto-resolve system (which will happily let four bombers wipe out a squadron) or you're forced to fight on and risk losing all of your pilots to problem #1. (Yeah having to tell your guys to bail out is irritating.)3 - No big wings. The 'big wing' was a tactic in which several RAF squadrons would group together to engage enemy attacks together, it took time to set up but it helped even out the numbers against massive German formations. This game does not let you do that and instead expects you to fight off dozens of planes with just eight of your own which leaves you at the mercy of problem #2 wherein you cannot withdraw should carrying on the fight become foolish which is particularly infuriating if you have another squadron or two nearby that could take over.4 - The voiceacting is terrible, I had to turn off the audio for the tutorial guy just because I couldn't stand the sound of the mans voice.5 - If you accidentally create a squadron at your airfield when that airfields squadron is in the air, tough luck. Doesn't matter that this new ghost squadron has no planes, you can't delete it, move it or do anything with it and you now have as many as eight rather expensive flying machines in the air that can't land because the airfield 'is full'. Despite the ghost squadron again, having no planes.If you have your heart set on this game wait a few weeks or even a month or two for some patches to come in, otherwise you're setting yourself up for an absolute pain in the rear.

												I was rather surprised by the relatively high number of negative reviews for a game I find so fun, so I thought I'd add my two cents:This game is a rather unforgiving but fun look at the Battle of Britain. First I'll look at the pros and cons, and then I'll give some tips that I've found helpful to ease the pain in the beginning of the game, because if you screw up in the beginning it can make the game pretty much impossible going forward.Pros: -The strategic and tactical gameplay are both challenging, but fun. On the strategic level, you can manage war production, which includes buying airfields, AA guns, factories, radar towers, airplanes, and the pilots. The money you earn is enough to buy the necessities for defense, but not enough to make the game easy. You're always having to prioritize, which I find fun and rewarding when done right. Even when done wrong, defeat never feels cheap, and you always feel as if it was more of a learning experience than a punishment.-The tactical gameplay is mosty fun (the parts that weren't so fun will be in the cons), and, for me at least, I never get tired of downing Jerries. Call me odd, but it gives me a strange sense of satisfaction when I shoot down German bombers, as if I'm saving the lives of actual civilians.-The stats are set up in a helpful way, helping you to keep track of your most experienced squadrons and even most experienced single pilots. This can be crucial. After all, if a huge stack of fighters and bombers is approaching, do you want to send out your veterans or untried rookies? On the other hand, you can send rookie squadrons to take out small stacks of enemies, giving them relatively easy experience points.Cons:-Certain elements of tactical combat can be frustrating. In particular, a high amount of micromanaging is required. This is normally not so bad, since you only control 8 fighters at a time. But when your fighters are engaged in a sprawling dogfight with enemy fighters, your own fighters are often slow to react without your direct intervention. This can lead to several of your fighters being shot down in a row before you have time to react, which is incredibly frustrating. Also, when they're tangled up in a dogfight, your own fighters and the German fighters look very similar, which adds an unnecessary layer of difficulty to fights.-When your fighters get to a certain level of health, they're given the option to parachute. But the health requirement for this is very low, so low that you'll often have less than a second to react before the airplane is destroyed and the pilot killed. Fortunately, you have the option to pause the combat at any time, but given how fast the planes can be destroyed, you have to have some good reflexes on that pause button.-On the strategic level, if you are on the ropes and German airplanes are pouring over the countryside, you're pretty much done for, since the bombers will almost always target your airfields. This can be frustrating since the bombers can destroy your planes faster than you can get them in the air, which wastes a lot of money and is just plain not fun. Even strafing runs by fighters can take out most of your planes and pilots on the ground.Overall, even though this game isn't perfect, it's still a tense, rewarding, and very fun rendition of the Battle of Britain. For 8 dollars, I definitely recommend it.Tips:-Always make sure to have at least two squadrons, and have at least one of them on the ground while the others are in the air. You might feel inclined to get as many fighters as you can airborne to patrol, and in the very earliest stages you can usually get away with this. However, if all of your squadrons are in the air at one time, then this means that they'll all be refuelling at the same time as well. So if bombers suddenly come to your airfields while you're refuelling, you may not get your fighters airborne in time to prevent them from being destroyed on the ground. So always have at least one squadron on standby to respond to threats like this.-Your fighters' guns have a longer range than the rear gunners on bombers, so feel free to attack them from behind, as long as you turn away before you get in range of the rear gunners. This can get you some easy experience points for rookies, assuming you've dealt with the enemy fighters first.-Get enough radar stations to monitor the southern English coast, but not so many that they overlap. This will allow you to wait to launch your planes until the enemy is actually coming without costing you too much money. What else should you spend that money on, you ask? Well, I'll tell you:-Buy plenty of AA guns. These can weaken tough units, and enemies will also try to fly around AA guns if they can, making their movements more predictable. Also, AA guns can actualy shoot down whole stacks of enemy fighters, letting the game deal with one of the most frustrating enemies so you don't have to.I'm sure there are other things you'll learn along the way, but I think the tips above will help ease you into the game withouth too much frustration. But still, some things can't be taught and have to be experienced. Or maybe I'm just feeling too lazy to keep typing. In any case, I hope more people will give this game a chance, and if my review convinces someone on the fence to do just that, then I'll be content.God save the King!			"

												Thanks to its decent presentation, “The Few” looks at first like a beer and pretzels sort of strategy game... excepting you’d better bring a dozen beers and several pounds of snacks, because the pace is excruciating. You also better be quite drunk actually, as there is virtually zero strategy (or thinking for that matter) required.Basically what could have been the light tactical part of the game boils down to a mindless clicker, as there is next to nothing you can influence or need to figure out. You are just asked to keep paying attention, because otherwise, Britannia will fall, supposedly.Indeed, shan’t you intercept the bombers, you will experience their deadly German accuracy.The game annoyingly lacks attention to minor details, making the experience aggravating, especially in regard to drawing flight plans, or just the main time-acceleration mechanic.Now that I type this, and I think about the layout of the game, I am noticing that, under its WW2 coat, “The Few” unveils forms akin to those of an extremely barebone tower-defence game. That was not my thing.			"

												This is a really good and budding game.  It'll make you think strategically, tactially and has a brilliant campaign map/Real Time Combat feature.It is full of potential, and makes people nostalgic of older games .Some may recognise the combat mechanics from flash games, but with the money coming in might come shipping convoys, 113 day grand campaign and many details to be added.It is a game that rewards patience and practise and I highly, highly reccommend this addicting game!There is no auto-save feature, but I recommend saving each midnight rather than before each battle - take the casulties!

												The Few's gameplay is simple and can be divided into two parts. First, airplanes, factories, and airfields are built and organized. Then, enemies attack the player and combat mode commences. The goal is to defend the country for certain (It's maximum 50 I think, at least as I saw of achievements) days and survive the enemy raids. The animations, user-interface, and art style are nicely polished and the music fits the theme. The voice acting and monologue for the commander are really kind of great for this game! This is biggest part of the game for me :p atmophere is important for me at every games. The game is really easy to get into because of its simple game mechanics and built-in tutorial. But unfortunately, there's no hook.. The majority of the game involves waiting to be attacked, but this can be sped up or slowed down by changing the time-pace. Stopping and fast-forwarding through time is definitely a neat feature!! The designation of linear path movements for friendly planes is also part of the gameplay. The main character can also be customized, but it doesn't serve much use in the game. The pilots' names can be changed which is also nice touch to me.. Overall, the game has little variety still.. I don't play that much this kind of ""war"" games but if we would say graphics and perspective doesn't matter for me, it's a great 1940 game... Your job is to defend Great Britain by controlling the allied airmen of the Royal Air Force.. And as I can remember the games name exactly comin from here.. So I bought this for really some low money. Cents maybe, I don't remember. But I prefer to review this kind of games, rather H1Z1, Assassin's Creed or bla bla bla a lot of famous games..

												Well, at first I was not impressed by this game. It really looked stupid - top down view, graphics and so on. But I've decided to give a second change ... I did purchese it after all. There really are not graphics to get breathless about. But the more I played and got the hang of it, the more I enjoyed it. So much so that I decided to change my vote of No to YES. Jip, this small game has the potential to get really very, very addictive. It's the sort of game that says ""give me one more go ... just one"".Happy gaming.			"

												Really enjoying this game so far. Its a simple game to get into but the challenge it provides is what is going to keep me coming back. If you don't know what this game is about, here's a synopsis: You assume the command of the RAF during the Battle of Britain and are in charge of creating, maintaining, and deploying squadrons of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft to defend airfields, cities, and installations inside of England to halt the Luftwaffe from gaining air dominance.

												Im a great follower of the Battle of Britain and well i played this for a few hours to get a good feel for the game.Pros..Nice ideaGood musicGreat customisation tool for pilots. (change names etc) ConsQuickly gets boring and repetativeQuote ""Great customisation tool for pilots"" but they aint around long enough to enjoy it.Too hard at times (bombers are always 100% accurate) Not enough to do during game..No auto patrol feature (gets monotonous dragging mouse around screen then they take off on their own and will fall out sky if u leave them :/) Hardly any planes to choose (could have added Blenham bomber, Fairy battle and Paul Defiant might have made things a bit better)The first half hour i admit was fun,...getting used to the controls fight screen and map.... then after naming pilots then watching them all die in blink of an eye....things start to get tough.... nothing wrong with that... makes the game more challenging... but theres just not enough to do to make the challenge fun...you only have a max of 8 planes..u can use... and no matter how many squadrons you have ...in a fight you can only use 1 (max 8 planes) ... after first few fights its the same thing over and over.... repetative is an understatment and 2 different planes (Hurrican and Spitfire) that (in the game) fly exactly the same...just better shield on hurricane... but you hardly notice the difference.The map screen... well apart from biting your nails watching the £ meter rise painfully slowly there aint a lot to do... you can train your 8 pilots per squadron (takes a while to get a squadron and then train them fully) although you can fast forward time which helps. Then before you can buy a radar station bomber formation apear out of nowhere and bang your squadron gone... If that aint annoying enough... your airbase is probably gone too..(or seriously damaged and unoperational) ........dont get me wrong games should be challenging....but make it fun at the same time... lets face it the game aint historicaly accurate so who cares if you pull a few strings and make changes for the better. One more annoying thing is...when your base has been hit and nearly destroyed you might still have a few pilots there... i made the mistake of buying 6 planes for them,..thinking i would then spend money repairing base...... but then the squadron disbanded i lost the base the squadron and all the planes id just bought! costing over £50k which takes a long time to get!! The idea of the game was thought up well...and could have been a much more fun experience but as it stands ....i cant recommend this it not even for the low price of £5.50			"

												The Battle of Britain is a thrilling slice of history. An overworked and understaffed Royal Air Force trying desperately to resist the invading Germans and succeeding just, only just, thanks to bravery, stubbornness, and superior engineering. So it’s surprising that there aren’t more games about it. But here’s a new one from Black Moon Design: The Few.The Few's gameplay is simple and can be divided into two parts. First, airplanes, factories, and airfields are built and organized. Then, enemies attack the player and combat-mode commences. The goal is to defend the country for fifty days and survive the enemy raids. The animations, user-interface, and art style are nicely polished and the music fits the theme. The voice-acting and monologue for the commander are great!The Few is very easy to get into because of its simple game mechanics and built-in tutorial. Unfortunately, there's no hook. The majority of the game involves waiting to be attacked, but this can be sped up or slowed down by changing the time-pace.The difficulty curve is sharp and spikes after just a few in-game sessions. This makes “The Few” quite a suiting name, since several enemy airplanes easily decimate the player's much smaller squadron early in the game. Overall, the game has little variety.The Few may be of interest to history buffs, war veterans, and players interested in war simulations. However, the 1940s and World War II may not be themes of particular interest to young men in their twenties, so The Few's theme may end up being a bit of a miss. However, the effort of Blackmoondev does not go unnoticed. A bit more content and variety could really help to improve on the overall execution of The Few.			"

												I personally enjoyed The Few quite a lot, despite a few shortcomings the game has.Most complaints people have about the game is that its scope is somewhat limited: you command the RAF during the Battle of Britain and that means your main aim is to coordinate air defence. A lot of people would love to play as the Luftwaffe or to add later war RAF air raids against France and Germany, but quite frankly that doesn't take away from the game itself - it's more of a 'we would like this to continue!'.Another thing often heard is its lack of realism in many regards and that's obviously true. The optics are fairly clear but all done in a cartoon style, which I personally found charming, but that's down to taste. Also the mechanics aren't overly realistic - obviously the top-down 2D playing field imposes certain limits here, but on the other side also makes sure the game stays accessible and easy to enjoy for everyone.The AI in the game is a bit of a mixed bag, really. Of course it does have certain limitations eventually and once you play a longer campaign those become very apparent, like there are some tricks for which the Luftwaffe pilots always seem to fall, but quite frankly the same (and sometimes worse) holds true for many AAA titles. On the other hand I very much liked how the different levels of experience showed in the pilot AI: while rookies go straight for their targets, the more experienced flyers will engage in more advanced maneouvres on their own initiative, making use of blind spots and plane advantages.Another thing actually done well and worth mentioning is the voice acting, which comes in different languages depending on squadron (the Polish developers obviously made a point of not forgetting that plenty of foreign squadrons took part in the battle - I didn't find that annoying at all, but some early-version reviews claimed that to be overdone) and, while eventually limited, does a good job of being informative, immersive and still not breaking the cartoony feel of the game.So, in conclusion this is not a simulation, it's a strategy game more on the casual side. It's not perfect by all means, but it does a lot of things right and as none of the popular complaints really get in the way of enjoying the game, I don't see any reason not to recommend it to almost anybody.

												I actually looked for a game like this, but ... it's really extremely repetitive after only a few ingame days of play. That said, you can't even skip the repetitive part, because autoresolving battles will always inflict significantly higher losses on your squadrons compared to manual battles. Since you then need to rebuild planes, recruit more pilots etc, this would make you lose the game eventually, no matter how many planes and AA you build.Apart from a more sensible autobattle function, I'd like to be able to throw in more than just 8 planes. The AI can come up with like 36 per battle, why can't I when I do have the squadrons available?			"

												Fantatsic little strategy game for less than £6. Its a smart but simple take on the Battle of Britain where you take on the task of defending Britain from the Luftwaffe in 1940. The game is essentially in two parts, the strategic map where you purchase and place factories, AA, airstrips, order planes and recruit pilots. You also direct you squadrons on sorties on this map in pausable real time. But when a squadron meets an enemy squadron, the map swaps to a tactical view, where you can control planes by ""drawing "" their flight route. As pilot become more expirienced they are more accurate and need less micromanaging (actually performing better than I could if in direct control). You need to try and save your pilots as training takes time, and the loss of experince can be devistatinging to your war effort, so the bail out button should be at your fingertips - just dont bail out over the sea! If you do well, you get more cash to spend on replacing planes, and expanding your defences. If you let your cities get bombed your income drops. Love the ability to edit the pilot names, which makes it sadder when they go down in flames (or even sadder when they are bombed/strafed when still on the runway!) Any bugs that may have existed once have been resolved, as far as I could see, having just finished the short ""Blitz"" 10 day campaign. Ready to see if I can survive the 50 day one now.....			"

Take down an enemy squadron.But then, I feel there is still some balancing needed for the game.Quite a few times, the enemy will literally appear beside your expensive buildings, and BOOM! No more.They can wipe out your entire airfield AND your grounded squadron in a split second.I had thought, hey, maybe I need to build a anti air gun right beside my air field. BOOM! There goes my second air field.Maybe I can place an expensive radar beside my airfield and anti air gun. BOOM! There goes my radar and air field...OK...  Poof! There goes me leaving the game.			"

												I always welcome new strategy games based on the Battle of Britain or WW2 air combat in general. Unfortunately The Few is disappointing in the end.  I found myself craving more of a simulation than a casual game.  I really disliked the air to air combat portions of the game. It's real time, and without heavy micro-management of your aircraft, you'll often send your pilots in to be slaughtered mercilessly by the Luftwaffe's BF-109s.  Rookie pilots seem to vary in skill between Top Gun and Full Retard.  I've watched several times as pilots will fly around in circles chasing a 109, spraying bullets at empty sky until their guns go dry or you break the endless loop. You are also limited to only 8 aircraft of your own per air battle.  No Big Wings with multiple squadrons intercepting the German mass raids.  So good luck to you when the Luftwaffe sends 16+ twin engine bombers and 8+ fighters. The map screen is where the most interest for me is at.  I like the aspect of building and placing airfields, radar, AA guns etc.  However you only get to start with one factory, 1-2 airfields, and ZERO radar stations and AA guns.  I would have liked to have seen a little more inventory at the start of the game.  Playing a game about the Battle of Britain, where the RAF starts with no radar is a little silly.  One annoyance of the game is that squadrons won't land at an airfield if it is ""full"".  So let's say you have two squadrons based at 2 airfields.  One squadron was in combat and lost a few planes, with a pilot or two bailing out safely.  The remaining aircraft return to base. At the same time your second squadron is also airborne, and the pilots who bailed out from the OTHER squadron start returning to your SECOND squadron's airfield.  Now when squadron 2 returns to land, they CAN'T, because squadron 1's bailed out pilots have gone to squadron 2's base, and it is now too full to land at. That means you lose ALL of squadron 2's planes and pilots because they run out of fuel and crash.  It is flip the table frustrating.Overall I was disappointed with The Few.  A few little fixes or changes could improve the game, but not enough for me personally to want to spend more time with it.			"

												Those reviews that call this game addicting are right on the money. Those that state it is challenging are also right. I've played 7 campaigns so far and have lost all but 1. There are many, many frustrating elements to this game. It demands heavy micro-management of your aircraft. For a game whose central theme is air combat, air combat is pretty clumsy. Your pilots will be slaughtered mercilessly by the Luftwaffe's BF-109s.  In a one-on-one fight, your AI pilots will fly around in circles chasing a 109, spraying bullets at empty sky until their guns go dry or you break the endless loop. If you break the loop, your pilot will be immediately shot down. You can take the short route and auto-resolve air battles, but if you do so then 100% of your lost pilots will be KIA - that's right, they won't think to bail out unless you tell them. Managing your fighters in combat vs bombers and Ju-87s is usually doable, but against the nimble Bf-109s it's just impossible because the scale is too small and the means of control too clumsy. Against the 109s I will auto-resolve...but this usually results in the loss of 75% of that squadron's pilots due to the aforementioned inability to bail out. Historically, the RAF didn't do this badly vs German fighters.Speaking of those 109s again...the designers do not seem aware of the severe range restrictions on German fighters during this era. They had no drop tanks, and generally had only about 20 minutes loiter time around London. I am seeing Bf-109s roaming over Lincoln and northern Wales...unless they had an aircraft carrier (they didn't) all those 109s would crash before they made it home. You are also limited to only 8 aircraft of your own per air battle. No Big Wings with multiple squadrons intercepting the German mass raids - coordinated attacks are impossible. The Germans have no such limitations, so when the Luftwaffe sends 16+ twin engine bombers and 8+ fighters, you must attack them piecemeal with two or three of your (hopefully) 8 plane squadrons. Expect the first two squadrons to be wiped out due to fighting outnumbered, and because the German Bf-109s will kill 2 or 3 of your fighters for each that they lose. In fact, the numerical disparity gives the Germans such an advantage that an 8 Spitfire RAF squadron attacking 16 German Bombers escorted by 12 Bf-109s, is likely to be wiped out without killing a single German aircraft. This has happened repeatedly. You might even win against this raid, but it won't matter because another one is coming loooooong before you can train and rebuild the lost squadrons. If you avoid battle, then they will blast your airfield to bits and you'll lose the planes because they can't land anywhere. I like the strategic management aspect of building and placing airfields, radar, AA guns etc. However you only get to start with one factory, 1-2 airfields, and ZERO radar stations and AA guns. I would have liked to have seen a little more inventory at the start of the game. Playing a game about the Battle of Britain, where the RAF starts with no radar is a little silly. Radar was a cornerstone of the British air defense network. Southern England was laden with AA guns and barrage balloons, but you don't have them. New airfields, AA guns, and radar are crazy expensive, and your economy builds very slowly. You have the option to choose between Hurricanes and Spitfires in production, but I cannot discern any difference or advantage of one over the other. In this battle of attrition, the Germans will simply out-resource you in 4-5 days. Squadrons won't land at an airfield if it is ""full"". So let's say you have two squadrons based at 2 airfields. One squadron was in combat and lost a few planes, with a pilot or two bailing out safely. The remaining aircraft return to base. At the same time your second squadron is also airborne, and the pilots who bailed out from the OTHER squadron start returning to your SECOND squadron's airfield. Now when squadron 2 returns to land, they CAN'T, because squadron 1's bailed out pilots have gone to squadron 2's base, and it is now too full to land at. That means you lose ALL of squadron 2's planes and pilots because they run out of fuel and crash, because two or three pilots WITH NO PLANES are apparently occupying the entire runway!I fully realise that a simulation of the Battle of Britain should be nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat tense, and certainly not a ""milk run."" But this game goes a bit too far, to the point where it's almost mathematically impossible to win.The game menu, instructions, and all written material are rife with spelling and grammatical errors. For example, your daily commander's review may state ""We are loosing this battle."" ""Restart the campagin."" Due to the prevalence of Czech and Polish squadrons in the game, I assume that the game was developed in Poland or the Czech Republic by people who did not speak English as their native tongue. If not, WTH? Have someone proofread your material!  Despite all the above criticisms, I am giving the game a thumbs up, because it IS an addictive game that keeps me coming back. But it's also frustrating as hell, and I may not come back much longer. I definitely hope some updates and patches are coming...			"

												This game is something I looked for, for a long time. ""The Battle of Britain"" was not just about the brave pilots and fighthing in the air but several important factors were involved and decisive (experience of pilots, availability of planes, radar system and a few more)  and all these factors are present in the game.Nothing is perfect, so AA power is definitely overrated (the entirely squadrons are wiped out but AA fire in this game!) Also economy is extremely simplified and - if you know a bit a reality of BoB - you will be shocked by the hundreds of Germans shot down every day. Anyway, I am picking on this game - something definitely not deserved!  At present, it is definitely the best software game about ""The Battle of Britain"" I came across. Big credit and thanks to the creators! Be sure that I did enjoy it as well as my 7 years' old son.			"

												Fun game but left me wanting more. I played ""Their finest Hour"" campaign which was suppose to last 50 days to defeat the Luftwaffe. It only took 10 days (the length of time the ""Blitz"" campaign is suppose to last) or 5 hours of actual time to win the campaign. The start was challenging, as you start with nothing and have to build your factories, airfields, planes and defenses, recruit and train your pilots. But the game seems to get much easier as you build defenses  and you gain reputation and gain more taxes to build more the game kind of fizzed out as I easily destroyed the Lutwaffe and won. There doesn't seem to be any difficulty setting either. Still this was fun, I liked the the combination of rts and turn elements. Would like to see more maps in the future and more challenging settings.			"

												A game with great potential that is marred by design choices.It contains too many historical inaccuracies to support the developer's claim ""Take command over RAF during the WW2 history turning point, the Battle of Britain"". It is more akin to the ""Tower Defense"" type, where you have to annihilate the enemy waves coming at you until there are no more of them or your defences are crushed.And the game cheats on you - just check the forums to confirm this. Even if it was introduced for the balancing purposes, it just doesn't feel right in the strategy game (more so as there is no difficulty level selection). With no manual and barely adequate tutorial, you have no choice but to learn from your mistakes which is frustrating sometimes. "

												Where to begin. First off let me say that i had serious doubts about the few. Is the game optimized,are the devs responsive to complaints,does it have replay value? the answers are Yes,Yes and Yes. The few is that rare type of game the diamond in the rough of indie games. Instead of rambling on and on im just going to show the pros and cons of this game.Pros+Great Graphics and audio+Immense Replayability+Unique Ai the Germans launch different attacks every game with new tactics+Amazing Devs that really care about the game and the players and go out of their way to deliver much needed patches+many more features still to come based on player opinionCons-Lots of Micromanaging but goes away in the tactical phase after pilot gain xpSummaryThe Few is one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing and for $8 it is a steal. So do yourselves a favor and but this amazing game.			"

												I was a huge fan of the Lucasfilm Games' Their Finest Hour: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Their_Finest_Hour_(1989_video_game) While this game is not a simulator, it is great fun and a reminder of that terrific game.  It is also an excellent game in its own right.The game is msotly strategic, but contains a light tactical combat mode.  Combat is simple and just involves directing your planes to lead the enemy planes.  You will inevitably lose pilots, but you can mitigate some of those losses by focusing fire and avoiding getting caught with a Jerry on your tail.  The game is mostly strategic and you must balance your purchases for defense.  No radar towers and you'll have to put up CAPs.  Not enough squadrons and airfields and you will not be able to engage the enemy before they bomb the crap out of your installations and cities.A few wishes: I would love to play as the Germans.  I wish combat was a little more interesting: for instance, pilots that rank up could perform evasive maneuvers.			"

												I really like this game - but there are some flaws. Balancing of units is one - it is possible for you to build scant aircraft squadrons, but build squillions of AA guns, avoiding air combat altogether...and still beat the AI opposition.  Secondly the ability to 'bind' squadrons in a ""big wing"" as deployed by the RAF in 1940 needs to be an option as you go into a sortie , especially in the big battles. Going against 16x He111's plus a Bf109 escort of 8, is going to be stretch for one RAF squadron of 8 aircraft. Three squadron as used by 11 Group RAF is historically responsible as an option.Lastly, and I mean this in the nicest way - please get the english right. Spellchecking text in another language is easy with so many free tools like google translate, no excuse to check. W sumie, świetna sprawa Polscy producenci gry!			"

												This is a fun game, with some simple ideas and rules that make a surprising complex and rich playing experience.It has a lot of the good things from a real-time strategy game, but gameplay isn't as urgent since you can pause the action whenever, so you always have the time to think about what you want to do.It does have some cons, mostly the steep initial learning curve.  And the controls, although sufficient, are a bit hard to use even once you've mastered them!  But it's really fun, and even relaxing once you get the hang of it.  So fun, in fact, that it's always tempting to just play 'one more' battle!I really enjoyed playing it once I got past the initial hurdles of learning what was going on, and I'm still enjoying it.

												It's a fun little game. You spend half your time building radar installations, training new pilots, setting up patrol routes and so on. The other half of your time will be spent commanding your fighters in the air to air missions.Defending the British iles is pretty straightforward, you set your planes up to fly a little patrol flight around their airfield, build some new airfields, buy some more planes, and that's it really. There's not much to it and that's a bit of a shame, but it's fun enough.The air combat is just as simplistic as the command mode, you draw paths for individual planes to follow and attempt to shoot down the enemy. They really fall into two catagories as Fighter and Bomber, and while there are slight differences between the different types of fighters and bombers it's negligible when it comes to how to press the attack. There's only 10-or-so plane types in total of which you can command only 2. And while that's pretty realistic I would've enjoyed hunting submarines with floatplanes as a side gig.All in all, 2 bucks was a steal for this bundle of fun, and the developer is free to cash in another fiver whenever they make a sequal with more stuff to do.

Then you sit around waiting twiddling your thumbs till they attack, then you draw a line to them. Then in combat you draw a line to the enemies and the game fights for you. Unfortunately your computer AI is terrible and will just fly around in circles and die. I lost 8 people to 4 planes for some apparent reason. Apparently they were just super strong and auto-slaughtered me, but my teamates flying around chasing their own tails didn't help.

												The Few is a realt time stategy that deals with the Airwar of the Battle of BritainPRO'S-Fun indepth gameplay will have you growing emotional attachments to Pilots and Squadrons.- The contstentaly looking for german airraids brings a great deal of exitment to this game - the price is a steal - it is a very challenging  game that has the ability to suck you in for hours.CON'S- The do not  show the major cities on the the map of  Britain. It took away from the Experiance because protecting London and other Cities were a big part of the Battle of Britain.  - Was very hard to control your planes with actually in the battle view planes would fly out of the battle.  you Can not break off an attack once it has started without it autoresolving the battle for you which mean losing your entire squadron should be able to get in and get out if thats what you want to do.- the graphics where lacking  doesnt really take much away from the game but would make the game that much better.This last point isnt a con more a wish this game could be perfect if you could let get in the cockpit and fly a plane in the battles leaving my squad mates for AI players.  One last suggestion would be let the player make boming run into France And Germany as well Anyways was really suprised by this game at 7.99 I thought I would take a chance on this was pleasently suprised Great game.

												Ignore all positive reviews for this game. The devs have clearly given up with no patches coming out for 3 whole years.  The game resembles a WW2 strategy/management game, but has more in common with a tower defense game. Firstly, you get a factory to build either: A) Spitfires and Hurricanes, B) Airfields, C) RADAR, D) Other Factories, and E) AA Guns. Thats it. You place the building wherever you want, intercept German bombers with the fighters, get taxes from cities that haven't been bombed by the Germans to supply the factory(ies) to build more resources in a game that becomes bland and unfun in LESS THAN 2 HOURS. The combat is just awful. In real life, the Brits employed a tactic called 'The Big Wing' where a massive amount of British planes flew together to compensate for the overwealming German numbers. In this game, you get a max of 8 planes who can face up to 20 German bombers AND fighters. Bombers have this weird attack, going head-on with your fighters, which cripple your own, but the bomber comes out just fine, with it's one machine gun destroying your plane while your eight seem to have no effect. A dogfight in this game is just 2 fighters flying in a circle trying to shoot each-other. Thats it. Often, your pilots get shot down, and you need to babysit the 'Bail Out' button, because you have less than a second to bail one or more of your pilots out, or else they die. They simply cannot bail out themselves, for reasons unknown, so you need to stare intently on the list of pilots you have, waiting for that red button to appear. The game has no sense of actual skill involved, so you start using your precious planes like how the Russians did because that seems to be the only tactic to work, rushing them. Theres only one good thing to come out of the game, and it isnt even a part of the gameplay itself, its the awesome, rare background for your steam profile, which I use alot and will continue to do so because the artstyle rocks. But in conclusion, this game sucks, horrendously. It isn't even worth 3 bucks to be honest, and I can't understand why people preach of how good this game is. It's on the bottom of the steam store for a reason, and it should stay that way.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Nice idea. Like the simplicity of it, but without more fine control of the pilots in battle it just doesnt work			"

												The game moves at snail pace on a high end PC. It's unresponsive and doesn't even close properly without ending process through Windows Task Manager.I escaped after three minutes, but you need to play a game for five minutes before writing a review. I ran it again just so I could offer this warning. Maybe it's just poorly optimised, but I found it completely unplayable. I recommend having nothing to do with this so-called ""game"".1/10			"

												In practice flight I lost all my planes pretty fast because pilots are just braindead.Tutorial can't be done because I need to build 4 planes in factory, but aparently 4 is not actually 4.. building any number of planes (including 4, which may or may not actually be 4) has no effect, you get insulted by tutorial because you can't count..Get this game in some cheap bundle or something, get the card drops and try to forget this game exists.

												I have longed for such a game for many years. It has good elements, but ultimately, every combat is the same (a grind) and there is no real progression / levelling up of your pilots beyond lvl 3. The game replaces quantity (many of the same type of battles) for quality (interesting gameplay and progression). Also many bugs, though playable.			"

												I'm a big fan of air and stuff. Played a lot of sims. Why not to play an arcade.In a few words The Few is like Air Forte and well known ( I forgot dat name, but it's in steam) arcade with mouse and keyboard. No abilities, game pretending to be realstic. Two modes -- planning, building on the global map and battle.Battle is addictive but  the planning phase is bad old-timer Tower defence. Unbalanced and boring. For an example, I played 4 days well, lost couple of planes. Guarded my coast with guns and Radar, but  map so big and can't be protected with a such low money flow. Random bombers of germans appeared at my airport( few anti-air guns covered it but) and destroyed my ace's regiment with bombs. Rage out and I'm writting that rewiew. Don't but that game, play classic version for free and spend your money on something else.			"

Verdict: Not worth it, and it's a shame.Good:- Fantastic concept. I love air strategy games, and of course the Battle of Britain is iconic in the best sense of that word.- Art style. Appealing without distracting from the core of the game.Bad:- Difficulty. You can't have multiple squadrons team up, and sending in 8 fighters against 16 heavy bombers with 8 fighters escorting them will only result in sadness. - AI. You must micromanage your pilots for them to have any real chance. And given the difficulty already mentioned, this just leads to frustration.- Spelling. I know it seems like a small thing, but when even the simplest words are misspelled (and so frequently), it becomes very distracting. (Seriously, couldn't they import the localisation strings into a Google Doc and used spell check?)- Music. Just turn it off and listen to your own epic music mix.			"

												This is the stupidest game ever.  I can't get past the second step in the tutorial.  It says ""we need 8 planes, click the factory and order 8 planes built"" So I do and then it says ""Why are you building 8, We only need 4"". so I cancel it and tell it to build 4 planes and it says ""We need 8 planes, 4 is not enough""Seriously? Screw you!			"

												Pretty cool little game. I've always been fascinated by anything WW2 and this was new take on a tower defense type genre. Not sure if it's a glitch, but I only got attacked three times then nothing for four days now. I assume it's a bug, otherwise it just makes it too easy, I was able to build a large force in that time. Glitches are to be expected though, so still a good game IMO.			"

												So, I could not seem to figure out how to play this game, really, at all. I shot some stuff, got shot by a lot of stuff, clicked through screens and options, but I never had any idea what was going on. Based on that experience, I'd say that, at best, this game kinda sucks - at worst, it is completely horrible. I do like the steam card badge, though, and I'd say it is probably the best thing about it. [ 2 / 10 ]			"

												This is not a historically based game. It is arcadish. It is repetitive, and at times tedious. The AI has some gimmicky aspects to it. It is only worth buying if the price stays as low as it is now. For under $10 USD it will give you a few hours of game play but probably not more than that. I do not recommend this game.			"

												I've only played this game a few times, but I am planning on playing more. I've had it in my inventory for quite a while and finally got around to spending some time with it.It's really fun and definitely worth playing. Juggling fighters and thinking about the long-term keeps you coming back for more. I can't wait to play a bit more...			"

												suprisingly entertaining.  Little indie game that allows you to watch your helpless airmen get blasted out of the sky by overwhelming luftwaffe odds.  Would of been nice if they created a two player game or allowed you to play the part of the sausage eaters but for the price you can't complain.			"

												The Few:  Kill a goat, drench youself in blood and grab your ankels because it could go either way. (If you enjoy it or not)I'm really on the edge of how I truly feel.  At times I jump for joy as if I watched the actual birth of Baby Jesus in my presence.  Other times I could launch my whole computer out my living room window and convert to being a Pagan killing animals to appease the developers.  If your your a huge WWII buff / historian then watch some gameplay on youtube before you take the hit.   If your not big into WWII or don't have patience, skip out until this thing is on sale or gets some small patches for balancing.  Thinking of it, there is a web browser game that is similar only without the RTS element.  Last I knew it was on addictinggames or something of that nature.  Biggest problem I have encountered with 11 hours of game play. As days go by it gets harder which it should.  Meaning there is an increase in enemy flight activity and flight size.  I've faced 16 medium bombers and 8 fighters.   All the while your squadron size is stuck at 8 fighters.  Mind you, you can't attack with multiple squadrons of 8 at the same time.  The fight becomes an attrition much like the real Battle of Britian.  These huge air armadas of the Luftwaffe seem to come about every 4 - 7 flights into your airspace.  So not every flight will be this huge but it takes its toll.  This really KILLS the game for me. Radar Towers are really useless.  All you really need is some AA to worn you.  Even the AA, in great numbers, is great for taking out Fighters but not Bombers.  I have yet to build more then one factory.  You'll never be able to stack enough coin to do so or even need the industiral capacity to do so.  You'll be constantly building aircraft that were destroyed or airfields.  Would I buy again?  Maybe, but it would need to be one sale and some patches issued first if I did.  Great potential but just isn't there yet.   AI is a little rough, frame rate seems to work better when its not in Full screen mode.  Mouse tracking to draw airplane paths is off.  Put your money toward Gary Grisby's Eagle Day if your a big historian and WWII buff.     Sorry for spelling / grammar errors.			"

												penguin school of dogfighting  ""action"" game, the campaign bit can be tricksie and at times you will not know what to do with a huge aeroflot coming over the channel, it would have be  a lot of help to be able to build a ""big wing"" but i understand why this is not possible, a worthy game			"
