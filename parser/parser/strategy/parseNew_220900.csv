												A game like Jack Lumber was meant to be played on portable phones. Its gameplay is so shallow and its price so steep that I just can't recommend this to anyone, even if it is fun for sessions of 10 minutes. The graphics are clearly upscaled which results in the game occasionally having blurry graphics and the sounds are actually pathetic. The gameplay is all about cutting up trees, or pieces of lumber actually. You have to cut them up in a certain way and as fast as possible to gain enough points. At the end of a level is an animal that can be rescued by not cutting it up. Succesfully doing this will have the animal appear in your cabin. Unfortunately, it gives you no rewards and they're absolutely pointless.Play it on your iPhone and you'll have some fun, but playing this on your PC is a waste of money.[Rating: 60/100]			"

												Regrettably, I have to NOT recommend this game with one exception - those who have laptops with a touchscreen or a Microsoft Surface will likely have a significantly more enjoyable time with this Fruit Ninja clone than those who have to use a mouse.Being a Fruit Ninja variant, quick, precise swipes are necessary to maximize your score.  As a result, in the more difficult levels a mouse simply will not do. This leads to very frustrating misses and lower-than-expected scores. I can play this to a much better degree on my laptop's touchscreen, but touchscreen laptops are relatively new and not many people have them yet. I've given up playing this on my main PC and will only play it on my touchscreen laptop due to the significant frustration level when (trying to) play this with a mouse.The game itself is very cute with a cutout-style art design and some of the levels are very challenging even with a touchscreen. The game really is a lot of fun. I don't care if this is an iOS/Android port, and I really wish that people would stop complaining about that like it's a bad thing. (The game as I write this is only $5, for crying out loud!) But unfortunately this is one game where it is better experienced on a touchscreen device.			"

												This game deserved to be 15 levels shorter given the shallow depth of the game concept put forward.  The scoring system is almost always irrelevant, and is only rolled out in some of the later levels to stymie what should have been me bulldozing through the repetitive gameplay.  If you are someone's mother looking to submerge yourself in a throwaway tablet game PC port, then Jack Lumber is your man.			"

												I don't have a bad opinion about this game, but it's because I got it in an humble bundle, and I don't think it's worth its price, basically is a mobile game ported on PC.I've tried the mobile version (included in the bundle), and it's not bad.It's something like fruit ninja with slow motion, but it has an original concept, and design.Anyway, I just don't feel like reccomending it, unless you have a touchscreen PC (I suppose touchscreen funtionalities are supported on PC too, but I'm not sure).It feels like a mobile game, probably because it's meant to be played on a mobile phone.

Jack... Lumber? Are you Serious?! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I'll begin by saying this is an iOS port, so it was thought for touchscreens. By the way, it works good also with the mouse (not perfectly, but good)! :-)So... You are Jack Lumber, the lumberjack... Evil pines killed your granny... You'll go out with your mighty axe to seek revenge... exterminating all the logs you'll find... saving your little forest friends... and trying to solve the evil mystery that lies behind (??!)...It is a nice fruitninja-like game where you have to perpendiculary cut a lot of moving logs (helped by slow time) by moving your mouse cursor! But where the game really shines is in its humor, from the animals' sounds mimicked by mouth by the developers, to the granny that will send you stupid letters from his new ""home"" and from Illuminati to to a soul mate named Jill Lumber that seeks revenge, too...LOL!Best played with Mouse (or iOS)Recommended Buy Price < 2$Score 8/10 "

												A cheap ugly Fruit Ninja clone. Fruits reskinned as logs, all right. First of all, this kind of gameplay - slicing stuff by drawing a line - is brilliant on touch devices but very unfun with a mouse on PC. Second, graphics are crappy, blurry and jagged, they do not skale really well for high-res.I would not ever buy this, if it wasn't a part of an indie bundle. Totally UNrecommended.			"

Simple mechanics with increasing levels of difficulty, boosts that you can buy with in-game currency, and ""swipe-across-the-screen-in-intricate-patterns"" gameplay which is much more conducive to a touchscreen rather than mouse control.If you want a fun little time-killing game for your phone, I'd recommend this.

												I just try to finish the game once, and it's really not fun. The achievements are super demanding, the controls are just not good for a Fruit-Ninja like game as the mouse is so much harder to move than one's finger on a touchscreen, and the log's really bad hit detection doesn't help. Sometimes I'm slightly out of the log and it gets accepted, another time 1/3 through it's radius but I get a missed penalty because the spinning logs' hitbox has trouble syncing up with the graphics.

												♥ Silly story.I found it amusing, the story of the passing of his granny and need to be the best lumberjack, without finding it vulgar or overdone. It's silly, it's fun, and it ended up drawing me in! A very well done story, I appreciate the fact that it seems like it was crafted with care. ♥ Adorable graphics.I love being able to decorate my cabin, click the animals, and dress up Jack. The game is really cute without being filled with neon colors or over the top designs. I think it fits with the game well! ♥ It's a fun way to waste time.I'll frequently turn to play Jack Lumber when I'm waiting for a friend to arrive or when I want to play something for a little bit without getting too involved in a mission/level. ✘ I wish the in-game prices were cheaper.I found the beards and hats a bit expensive...especially when you calculate how much lumber you would need to earn each round. It's still cheaper than Team Fortress 2 though! x) ✘ I wish they would expand the story. I really enjoyed getting the letters from grandma, the secret admirer, etc. along with watching the cutscenes and following along the story. They did a wonderful job - it left me hungry for more! If they came out with a DLC, I'd get it. ✘ If you want to play Jack Lumber casually, be aware that each level progresses in difficulty. To get to the end of the game it can get quite hard, though personally I think it adds to the fun!Overall if you are looking for a game to pass cloudy days and slow passing mornings with, Jack Lumber is perfect for you.

												Jack Lumber is a touch based game. You should probably only bother if you have a some ablet/touch device capable of running steam.This game is based on a similar premise to fruit ninja, but with its own twists. The biggest being you only have one cut, rather than as many as you want per toss. It is for this reason that mouse based play is not exactly the best. It is playable like this, but not to its prime.The graphics are pretty nice, as are the music and sounds.There is a fair amount of playtime you can get from this, especially if you attempt to get all the achievements. And if you really want to test yourself, there is an option for infinite looping play until a missed cut.I would probably recommend getting this game on a mobile device or tablet first, but it is an ok game on computers as well.

												Jack Lumber is a great what I like to call ""morning coffee game"". It doesn't take itself seriously and the concept is very simple. A puzzle game where you accurately cut logs while avoiding cute critters. I personally thing paying full price is not worth it but if you can find it for a few bucks I highly suggest it.I do first look reviews for indie games and I did one for Jack Lumber so if you'd like to watch that the link is below.

												Fun, but ultimately monotonous. I would give it a ""mixed"" rating if it was an option.The good:+ Good production quality+ The basic gameplay is fun, but it works a lot better on touchscreens. (I have it on my phone too from Humble Bundle, and it's a more fun experience there, even with one's finger obscuring more of the objects than the mouse pointer.)Mixed:~ Unapologetically silly story~ The difficulty scaling is nice and gradual, but it also means that if someone doesn't have good reflexes and quick thinking, they are stuck playing only the lower levels of the game.The bad:- Even with the continuously introduced new gimmicks the gameplay itself is very shallow. The only difference the more advanced features mean is that you have to think a bit more while acting fast.-The accuracy of both the screen and phone version could be better. Many times the game marked a log as failed even though the line was really close to perfect. This was especially an issue with the ""right angle"" logs.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Jack Lumber was extremely fun...for my touchscreen computer. The other mouse controls are extremely loose and a little too difficult to maneuver. Also, it gets kinda old and very unrewarding. I had to CONSTANTLY replay different levels that I got really sick of in order to get to the next map. I know that some other video games I've played before use that kind of formula but the rating system in Jack Lumber (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars) makes it hard to get new levels that don't really give you much.Now, there's not only these negative parts of Jack Lumber but there's some good parts too. The story line that is added to the gameplay makes you want to keep playing and gives you a reason to. Also, you are accompanied with a little beaver that tells you funny things like humorous jokes about each of the stray animals you collect on your journey. Unfortunately, this does not precisely have to do with the actual gameplay.If you have a tablet or touchscreen computer, try it. If not, well...maybe not.			"

												This is Fruit Ninja in a slightly different skin.   The challenge in this game is generated from players needing to swipe in a specfic direction.  This is a small gimmic and one which does no favour to its entertainment value.  There is nothing noteworthy in this game.  It was made with tablets in mind which adds in a nice variety of poor collision detection.  The best that might be said is that it could entertain a 10 year old.  I would not suggest people spend money on this. "

												Easily one of the worst games I've ever played, and a terrible waste of bandwidth spent downloading it. The only reason I got this is because it came with a Humble Bundle. This is Fruit Ninja with wooden logs. Why the HELL would I play a tablet game on my PC? The developers should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this trash.			"

												The game is great on iOS, and although I found it to control better with a mouse than it does on a touch device (since your hand naturally blocks view of the screen when chopping logs), I can't really recommend the PC version if you already own an iOS device you can play it on. That said, definitely worth a buy if you don't have an iOS device and see it on sale at some point.			"

												Move over Fruit Ninja, because Jack Lumber is coming!  And he hopes that you left enough on the fifteen minute clock for him to get some!In this game you play as a cartoon character who witness another cartoon character be trampled on by a cartoon tree.  You then whip into a rage, which manifests itself as a ""click and drag mouse"" extravaganza!BUT WAITThere's more!  After every level you go back to the cabin to hear some squeaks and see the many animals you have collected!BUT WAITYou can buy them hats!!!Game of the Year 1998, 8.5/5 on the richtor scale.  Heartily recommended if you already own it and are wondering what it is.			"

This is quite obviously an iOS/Android game first & foremost, and quite obviously inspired by Fruit Ninja. Blocks of wood & other stuff get fired up onto the screen & you slash 'em to pieces; the twist is having to do certain pieces of wood in a certain direction & order etc.All in all, not exactly inspired gameplay, but the presentation & story (yes, story) keep it moving nicely & make it enjoyable. It's quite aware of how basic it is as a game, so the dumb Canadian woodsman presentation takes over to dominate what's basically a maze solving game.This gets a Woot.			"

Turn onto a wire rack to cool completely. Use a large serrated knife to cut the cake horizontally into 3 even layers.Step 2Drain the cherries, reserving 160ml (2/3 cup) of the juice. Reserve 10 cherries to decorate. Place the remaining cherries and the reserved juice in a saucepan with the sugar and cornflour. Stir over medium-low heat until the mixture boils and thickens.

												This game is... surprisingly fun, for a glorified mobile app game. The gameplay is fast-paced but gives you breathing room and can be as forgiving or unforgiving as you make it due to the item system. New elements are introduced at just the right pace to keep things from getting stale without overwhelming the player. The game doesn't overstay it's welcome so it doesn't feel drawn out. It won't let you complete it just for ""finishing"" levels either, so it's not painfully easy, though never too difficult either. I was legitimately surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. I wouldn't say it's worth its full retail price but if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle, I say go for it.			"

												This game is like Fruit Ninja with a twist. You play as Jack Lumber. A lumberjack who at a young age, witnessed his grandmother get killed by a rouge pine tree. He then gets revenge by cutting all of the trees in the world down. So at the start of each level, Jack grabs his ax and sends an electric shock through the forest. Sending every tree up into the air. As they fall down, you have to draw a line through the logs to slice them in half. It starts off with normal logs, but then L, U, and T shaped logs come into play as well as logs that need to be cut 2 or 3 times. At the end of each level, an animal appears inthe middle of a formation of logs. If you slice the animal, you fail, but if you dont, after each level, all of the animals you collect appear in your cabin. You can click them and they will bounce around. When my 8 year old sister watches me play this game, watching the animals jump around is her favorite part. Depending on how well you do, you get a one, teo, or three star rating,which is represented by a gold, silver, or bronze sash on the critter at the end of each level. Later in the game, you unlock different zones by having certain amounts of stars. This reminds me of Angry Birds or something.I got this game in one of the Humble Bundles. I like it, but I wouldn't pay the full steam price for it.  "

												I tried playing it a few years ago on my Android tablet but it was a frustrating experience. I ended up quitting in world 2. Thought it would be better with my 1337 g4m!ng mouse and, to an extent, it is. The graphics and audio are adequate and the beaver's horrible puns are actually funny.The game suffers from one critical design failure. If you want to 4-star all levels, you need consumables. A lot of consumables. They are very expensive. What's worse, you can fail the level you wanted to 4-star, waste your consumables and be forced to grind some other level to have money for syrups again. That is atrocious and unacceptable. You are not a triple-A game to warrant thinking of yourself so highly to imagine, that players will be willing to put themselves - and their time - through that. This was going to cause a negative review all by itself, but some lucky, last minute Googling delivered a solution. The truth is out there.Also, ""plaid"" as an onomatopoeia is mad cool.			"

												Got both andriod and PC versions through a cheap bundle. I couldn't justify spending $6 on this game alone.Jack Lumber is similar to Fruit Ninja and JetPack JoyRide in that you use your mouse to cut logs in specific patterns, whilst time is slowed down. The more logs you cut the more resources you gain. Use these resources to buy cosmetics and neat upgrades. Game is designed, more enjoyable on mobile devices, and should have stayed that way.			"

http://wwagas.blogspot.com.au/i actually quite liked this game, it just runs a little shallow.you play as the chop happy titular character, avenging his grandmother after a savage tree attack.you play through each level, a series of rounds as logs (and later, other items) are sprung into the air in front of you. Your job is to drag out a path that will chop each of the necessary items before the timer runs down.the art style, sounds and characters are fun, with each successful level letting another woodland friend return to your cabin, which in turn unlock various upgrades and powerups to use while playing.very straightforward, quite fun, a little bit more addictive that i expected.its very easy to play through just one more round. we all know how tempting it is to go back and 3 star a level if we missed out.the bulk of my experience was played through steam, because given an option i like all my stuff in one place AND i'm a sucker for cheeves. However, I also played it on my Samsung android tablet and its far superior. Touching and swiping is a much more natural motion than mousing around. i got jack lumber as part of a humble bundle, but i'd say its worth a gold coin for admission. just keep in mind the android version feels like the better experience.

												I didn't want to like this game - but I did. Played on a track-pad, running my cursor through the lines was rather tricky - but not impossoble. My 7 year old niece also joined in and got surprisingly good. It did start to get a little boring after a while though, and I couldn't help but think it was the sort of game I'd sooner have on my mobile phone for killing time, rather than powering up a console/PC to play. A curosory glance on Google Play store suggests that they already know this :)			"

												Basically, the logs go up in the air and time slows down while you quickly trace a path through them so you cut them from the ends. That is pretty much the game. The graphics are nice and there are humorous moments. I can see where this would make a good mobile game, but it just doesn't translate well for a PC. Once you've play the first level you have pretty much played the entire game.			"

												To be perfectly honest I see this more as a simulation game of how life would be like for an emotionally underdeveloped, mentally unstable, orphaned canadian living through the trauma of having his guardian (grandma) killed by a falling - sorry, evil - tree.In short: ""ooooooh, granneh!"" - the immortal wisdom of Jack Lumber, the lumberjack (I get it!),Pros:- Very charming graphics (and audio!).- Depending on your level of involvement and how much you're interested in putting into the game you can have a very hard time getting plaid sashes or a fairly alright time 'only' working up as many stars as you need just to unlock the final boss battle.- Smooth gameplay that you can regulate the difficulty of further by putting on different beards.- The entire game is pretty quirky and odd which again feeds into the charms of the game.- An appealingly bizzare storyline, although it is only very basic as this is, after all, only a fairly short game. - No animals are supposed to be harmed in this game (if you do, you fail the level). Only evil, evil plants. As a plant hating vegetarian i approve (Please do imagine me seething and foaming at the mouth as hacking and slashing up the disgusting wood logs while laughing manically). I kid. Of course. No. But seriously. Death to plants!- Canadian simulator.- The sassy beaver is sassy.Cons:- The intro to the level tends to get annoying over time with the whole cutscene that you just cannot skip no matter how much you bash your keyboard.- In order to purchase all items in the shops and try all the difficulties with different beards while having the comfort of being able to regulate the game difficulty with different syrups you have to play close to insane amounts of games to earn enough wood (currency),  Loses some appeal to me because of this as you need way too much wood to keep me motivated to earn it.- The noises of the animals tends to get annoying over time.- Somewhat replayable, but not really. I played it twice with a year between. Enough to forget the setup of each level. But the log tosses are always the same and if you replay it too shortly after last finishing (or have a photographic memory) you'll have memorized each log toss for each level.. if you're as anal about getting best possible ranking for each level as i am, anyway.Summary:A very good, charming game with a very calm demeanor to it. Although others may react differently as the tosses are timed I found it soothing rather than stressful and really rather funny. Keep in mind, though, that my humour is beyond ridiculous. For me it was well worth the full price of the game and i enjoyed it enough to wish to support the developers enough to buy cards enough to get a full tier badge. Would've gotten more of them if that didn't mean i'd have craptons of cards in my inventory i can't do anything with.			"

												I don't mind iOS ports too much, and while I admire the concept Jack Lumber presents (think Fruit Ninja crossed with connect the dots and bullet time), the core gameplay requires a lot of precision and not a lot of room for error, which is a bit of a problem when playing with a mouse.

Once the game starts introducing conditions to finish the challenge, such as cutting through misshapen logs or fast spinning ones, the game loses its charm quickly. The time window they give is very brief, and the more that is thrown at you, the less you can keep up.

												I have very mixed views on this game, the first thing that springs to mind is that it is a blatant clone of Fruit Ninja (one of my most used apps back when I had an iPhone) with a few added features like a story (I'll get onto that below) and different kinds of logs to chop in different ways (although I find this feature takes away from the game and since the time slows when you click it becomes somewhat easy).So, the story (I'll use spoiler tags but honestly there isn't much to spoil):You are a lumberjack named Jack Lumber, your grandma gets pulverised by a tree and you suddenly turn into a hardwood furniture store growing a hateful resentment for trees everywhere, you go chopping logs collecting a variety of animals (that you have undoubtedly destroyed the homes and families of). That's pretty much all I've gathered from my extensive game time.That's one of the things that makes me dislike this game, it's taken me less than 20 minutes and I feel like I've experienced everything the game has to offer, apart from maybe more than 6 logs being thrown up on screen at once later in the repetitive level system.This game I would say is actually worth the cost... if it weren't a Fruit Ninja clone.Use your money more wisely, I wholly advise you to get Fruit Ninja, it's more quirky, more original, and cheaper.I'd give this game:Creativity - 3/10Looks - 6/10Difficulty - 4/10 (Too easy)Replayability - 4/10 (Gets old fast)Total - 4.25/10			"

												An interesting way to kill some time. I did finish it, with a touch screen laptop no less, and it was all right. I did not feel any great urge to complete everything, though. It is that lack of a drive to invest that makes it nothing more than a moderately interesting time waster rather than one of my favorite games.If you want to play this game, I recommend a touch screen. Maybe a smart phone or tablet? It is much easier with that interface.This game has mediocre graphics, boring sound, and an uninteresting story. However, on the other hand the game's premise is kind of funny,  and that helps place it in the niche of time waster rather than waste of time. The former lets you spend time, but the latter....Buy it if you need more ways to waste time while you are out and about and waiting for something. Great on portable touch screen devices, kind of like bejeweled in that respect.(Overall 5/10, Story 3/10, Gameplay 7/10, Graphics 6/10, Sound 5/10, Replayability 5/10)			"

												I have very mixed views on this game, the first thing that springs to mind is that it is a blatant clone of Fruit Ninja (one of my most used apps back when I had an iPhone) with a few added features like a story (I'll get onto that below) and different kinds of logs to chop in different ways (although I find this feature takes away from the game and since the time slows when you click it becomes somewhat easy).So, the story (I'll use spoiler tags but honestly there isn't much to spoil):You are a lumberjack named Jack Lumber, your grandma gets pulverised by a tree and you suddenly turn into a hardwood furniture store growing a hateful resentment for trees everywhere, you go chopping logs collecting a variety of animals (that you have undoubtedly destroyed the homes and families of). That's pretty much all I've gathered from my extensive game time.That's one of the things that makes me dislike this game, it's taken me less than 20 minutes and I feel like I've experienced everything the game has to offer, apart from maybe more than 6 logs being thrown up on screen at once later in the repetitive level system.This game I would say is actually worth the cost... if it weren't a Fruit Ninja clone.Use your money more wisely, I wholly advise you to get Fruit Ninja, it's more quirky, more original, and cheaper.I'd give this game:Creativity - 3/10Looks - 6/10Difficulty - 4/10 (Too easy)Replayability - 4/10 (Gets old fast)Total - 4.25/10			"

												Jack Lumber is an okay game but it's just okay. It has the mildly fun but extremely repetitive gameplay of any typical mobile game.			"

												 I like the fact that this game has steam trading cards. I didn't enjoy playing the game, it even has that game center which is on mobile platforms.			"

												This is quite a simple game but it's good for mindless fun. It's simple but the graphics are cute and the gameplay is kind of addictive. I'm enjoying this so far and it's quite a puzzler as you need to think of which order to go about tasks in order to get 3 stars on each level. It can be quite hard to get 3 stars, but it would still be enjoyable for younger ages too.			"

												To be perfectly honest I see this more as a simulation game of how life would be like for an emotionally underdeveloped, mentally unstable, orphaned canadian living through the trauma of having his guardian (grandma) killed by a falling - sorry, evil - tree.In short: ""ooooooh, granneh!"" - the immortal wisdom of Jack Lumber, the lumberjack (I get it!),Pros:- Very charming graphics (and audio!).- Depending on your level of involvement and how much you're interested in putting into the game you can have a very hard time getting plaid sashes or a fairly alright time 'only' working up as many stars as you need just to unlock the final boss battle.- Smooth gameplay that you can regulate the difficulty of further by putting on different beards.- The entire game is pretty quirky and odd which again feeds into the charms of the game.- An appealingly bizzare storyline, although it is only very basic as this is, after all, only a fairly short game. - No animals are supposed to be harmed in this game (if you do, you fail the level). Only evil, evil plants. As a plant hating vegetarian i approve (Please do imagine me seething and foaming at the mouth as hacking and slashing up the disgusting wood logs while laughing manically). I kid. Of course. No. But seriously. Death to plants!- Canadian simulator.- The sassy beaver is sassy.Cons:- The intro to the level tends to get annoying over time with the whole cutscene that you just cannot skip no matter how much you bash your keyboard.- In order to purchase all items in the shops and try all the difficulties with different beards while having the comfort of being able to regulate the game difficulty with different syrups you have to play close to insane amounts of games to earn enough wood (currency),  Loses some appeal to me because of this as you need way too much wood to keep me motivated to earn it.- The noises of the animals tends to get annoying over time.- Somewhat replayable, but not really. I played it twice with a year between. Enough to forget the setup of each level. But the log tosses are always the same and if you replay it too shortly after last finishing (or have a photographic memory) you'll have memorized each log toss for each level.. if you're as anal about getting best possible ranking for each level as i am, anyway.Summary:A very good, charming game with a very calm demeanor to it. Although others may react differently as the tosses are timed I found it soothing rather than stressful and really rather funny. Keep in mind, though, that my humour is beyond ridiculous. For me it was well worth the full price of the game and i enjoyed it enough to wish to support the developers enough to buy cards enough to get a full tier badge. Would've gotten more of them if that didn't mean i'd have craptons of cards in my inventory i can't do anything with.			"

												A simple casual game that is enjoyable despite being designed for mobile. I beleive gameplay is actually improved by the mouse. PROS:-Clean controls-Nice animation-Simple mechanic that has its life extended through a variety of viable means (various log types, beards to make things harder)NEUTRAL:-Mobile game; usually this would be a negative, but this game plays very well with mouse controls. I think it probably plays even better than it would with touch-controls.			"

												Enjoyable game, that becomes a bit of a grind... Can be a challenge with a mouse... The beards make the game more challenging, and interesting as well as being needed for the tougher achievements and stars.			"

												It's a simple enough game to pass the time, but frankly it should have stayed on smartphones. It's not that it has any real issues, it's just better suited to a mobile device and a touch screen. On here, it's nothing special.			"

												This is essentially a mobile game that you would get for $1, or even for free, on Steam for $5. It's short, shallow, and is not very fun without a touch screen, which thankfully I have. Even with a touchscreen though, path detection is off and often both cut logs you should have definitely failed, or more frustratingly fail logs you should have successfully cut. For how shallot the game is, it has a charm that would be good for young children, but the innuendos spoken occasional in game prevent this for even being a game for then. Overall not worth buying.

												If I hadn't received this game as part of a Humble Bundle I probably wouldn't own it. It's very clearly a mobile game converted into a desktop game... and it's a decent passtime (for a whole five minutes of occasional play), but it's really unfulfilling.			"
