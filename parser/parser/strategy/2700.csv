												Let's start here. Unlike many other RCT games, this game allows you to build in ways you could never build. Unlike many, this game allows to create a park, in your own image. The first game allowed you to just that, but, only, instead of simple rides, this allows you to include things you never could.                                                                              - Fireworks                                                                             - Waterfalls                                                                             - Zoo's                                                                                 and                                                                             - Swimming Complexes ( Pools. )This game brings 3D into a new direction for the games, even though, in my own opinion, the old games were just as good.Now, you might wonder... ""How is this game any different?""Here are a few reasons. - 3D graphics- More food/drink/misc stands.- Guests are renameable- You can speed up or even pause the gameand - Fireworks are able to be used.and so on. This has been Redman and his current perspective of the game.			"

												""When you are in Hell, only the Devil can help you out""In RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, watch as thousands of helpless guests wander into a seemingly harmless amusement park of deadly traps, such as unfinished rollercoasters headed straight for populated swimming pools. Imprison tourists in unescapable, endless loops of riding the same rides over and over again; for simply asking of lowering the $10 price of admission to the restrooms. Create 'water' slides leading to 40ft deep concrete floors, and wonder how the authorities still have not caught onto your selfish game of sadistic torment; as the endless supply of unknowing families stray themselves into a permanent vacation.By far the greatest Saw game ever created.

												This is a game that take some time and dedication to truely enjoy. Yes there are people out there who love to just line up all the peeps into the main area, and just blast them to smitherines. This is fun yes, but this is the playstyle that would lead to reviews of ""not having any replay-ability"". This is just based on how that person played the game, ignore it, and move on. If you have patience, and a good creativity, make a campain world, and you can prosper. There is sandbox (even for those that are creative it is an amazing outlet) which is like any game's creative mode, allowing infinite building. This has been one of my top five games for most of my life, and will most likely remain there.Graphics 7/10- While the look of most things is amazing, closer up you can almost taste 2006, but that aside the gameplay it-self is amazing (I personally have not looked into it, but I'm quite sure someone out there made a texture pack or twenty)Gameplay 10/10- It allows many stories to be played, and can take quite a while (My current time from steam is flawed, I actually have had this game since 2009, and have logged at least 200 hours)Replayability 9/10- as I said, the game is indeed boring for those without patience or creativity, and I tend to lack in patience, this is my own personal opinion (From any official opinion, I would easily give it a 10/10)Overall 9.5/10 Amazing game, and a texture pack would put the icing on the cake*Note*For those of you that are the crash and burn kinda people, just letting you know, the peeps are indestructable, believe me I tried VERY hard (Crushing, drowning, melting, more crushing, smashing, throwing, dropping, etc.)All in all I hope that based on your personal experiences with you own past gaming, you can enjoy this game as well. A excellent use of your $20.			"

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 allows you to create any theme park you can think of. From one that can be extremely fun for the families coming to visit or basically a death park due to unsafe rollercoasters and waterslides.Sandbox Mode- With unlimited money, you can make the park as cheap as you want at no cost. Also you can build whatever you want provided you have the space to do so.- However, it should be noted that if you overload your park with too much stuff such as long complex rollercoasters it is possible that your game will crash upon loading that specific parkCampaign Mode- This is basically a challenge mode- It can be fun a rewarding to see your park go from making basically no money at all to earning thousands in a day!

												Hands down, a childhood memory and great game! When I was a little gamer, I would play this game all the time. Building theme parks my way and style. This game is STILL such a masterpiece with old graphics that work fine for the gameplay. You can freely make your own park on Sandbox mode or start from old ones in campaign mode. If you like theme parks and creating games, this is a must. Furthermore, you can design your own rollercoasters and place down food and drink buildings for the visitors to eat and...drink. Pretty much everying you can do in a theme park slammed on this game! You can make pools, including wave pools aswell. Hire entertainers, janitors, engineers, and sercurity guards to make guests including yourself feel right at home. When I found out this was on steam I instantly bought it. I want you to do the same thing. BUY IT NOW.PROS:+ My childhood game.+ Good graphics to this date.+ Unlimited Possibilites+ Make your own everything.+ Campaign and Sandbox mode.CONS: - Creating hills is nearly impossible and ruins your park if you don't know what your doing.-  Animal's are hard to do in this game aswell as creating a GOOD waterpark. Rating: 10/10  '' Oooh memories of my childhood.''			"

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 – Platinum! is a theme park sim-tycoon game. You are put in charge of a your own theme parks which you must expand to bring more customers and money to them.Pros: You have a large variety of rollercoasters, rides, kiosks and themed decorations to lay, often more than you'll be able to cram in a single map. You manage the finance by determining costs for rides, food and souvenirs, balancing against running costs, staff wages and other expenses including research which allow you to access even more rides and objects for your park. You start your career with a short selection of maps and a few pre-made rollercoaster designs, and unlock more as you achieve goals in each locations. And with the Soaked! and Wild! expansions that add even more attractions such as aquatic rides and zoological exhibits, you can play the same map over and over yet build different parks every time! Many rides allow themed-customization as well, from color scheme to cart-style or train-length. Micromanagement can also be as deep as you want it: you can go as far as choosing how much pickles a specific burger stand puts in its 1/4-pounder, or don't bother with it, it's up to you.Cons: The graphics are bad when zoomed in, from character designs to fixed-shadows under moving objects, graphical glitches including bad character animations or placement on rides. You can barely hear the music from your rides unless you're zoomed in almost all the way. Building rides has flaws, too: buying a pre-made rollercoaster design never explains why a location wouldn't work or what can be done to the landscape to make it fit, while other times the entire ride will get elevated multiple stories due to a single tile that's 1 pixel higher than the others. As the first game of the series to drop the genre's usual fix-isometric view for a 3D-engine, the camera controls can be extremely clunky, while the vertical angle resets every time you're trying to change it.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!If you like tycoon games, you're likely to enjoy this one. I could write a review 10 times as long and still have more to say about this game, so in a nutshell: perfect example of a tycoon game done right, with huge variety, good flexibility and excellent replayabiliy. I look forward to seeing the next entry in the franchise, RollerCoaster Tycoon World, be ready to come out of Early Access!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

Once you've got your head around the 3D graphic style, it's a very fun gameBreakdown:Graphics - 7/10 - Not what you may be used to, and quite daunting at first. However once you get the hang if it things can look very impressive. However there may be alot of clipping issues if you modify terrain.Gameplay - 8/10 - Excellent additions are the Water Park and Firework displays. The game may have lost some charm but it makes up for that with bundle of new creations to use.Customisation - 9/10 - Build your own theme park...

												I started off slowly, knowing how much fun these kinds of games can be. Built a roller coaster. Built a pool. However when it was time to build a water slide I somehow found my sanity slowly slipping away.The slide was much longer than the pool, causing my guests to be sent like missles through the grass on their backsides. Cheers and happiness turnes into screams of pain and fear.I couldn't stop then though. I had seen too much. Suddenly my roller coasters would send the lowly peeps into the sky, only to fall into a fiery death. Zoo animals ended up uncaged, running amock in my park. The peeps looked to me for mercy but saw nothing but insanity.10/10 would destroy again.			"

												The glory that is RCT3... loved this game since I was a kid. It has something for all gamers, whether you want to be upstuck and businesslike making the pinnicale of rollercoaster cash cows, or mess around and torture the peeps by trapping them all in your park without food, drink, washrooms, or evilest of all.... no sun cream. There's also the inbetween of making some kicking coasters and what not. Now the game is damn old by now, but still shows the care and precision put into the game. but who cares about graphics... *One overlooked feature is the simplicity of  the savefiles on the computer, so shareing saved coasters and parks is wicked easy, just a matter of dropping the file into the right folder.over all, buy it, you probably will not regret it. It was worth $20 when released, and in all honesty, hasnt depreciated much. The fact that it is available on steam allows for it to be even easier to play and use, with no need to use the disc, although I have noticed that the load times are somewhat longer without the disc.PS. MAKE A PROPER FOURTH ONE ATARI!!!! and it is nice to see frontier still kickin it.*UPDATE* *@%#^%$%^%$&%#$%$#$% friggen hell atari, what have you done to this series with RCT world!?

												RollerCoaster Tycoon and I go way back. My middle school years were pretty much defined by the original RCT and its expansion packs, which I spent hours on end playing and enjoying. When I first heard of RCT3, I had heard it was cack. Horrible bugs, horrible problems, not fun at all. They fixed some problems with it but it was still not highly regarded.Now that I have it and have played it, I can say without a doubt that it's relatively fun. It does some very cool new things but also takes away a few things that made the originals fun. Path making is a tiny bit irritating especially trying to make slopes at first, but you get used to it. There are a multitude of new coaster designs and the building tools for those are roughly the same with a new ""autocomplete"" button that really isn't worth using. Scenarios appear to be absurd and not as interesting as the old RCT scenarios. The sandbox mode is a neat addition (we had to use trainers back in the day to play around with unlimited money!), and there is LOADS of customization that can be done. The fireworks shows are neat and the additional water/safari themes are nice too. CoasterCam is an addition everyone had wanted for the series (although NoLimits lets you import tracks from RCT1/2) and it works well. Ultimately, this game has some minor flaws, but the level of customization and the new features more than make up for it and make it a worthwhile purchase even for long time RCT fans.			"

												With the complete failure that is RollerCoaster Tycoon World, this remains as one of the top two entries in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (the other contender being RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, also available on steam). This Platinum Edition includes both the Soaked! Expansion (which allows for waterparks) and the Wild! Expansion (which allows for animal exhibits, ala Busch Gardens). The only issues are poor performance in high-population parks (a problem that rears itself in sandbox parks more than anything), occaisional issues with certain roller coaster types having inexplicable crashes (most notably the tilt coaster and its thrill lift), and the assumption of where your pictures are stored leading to many questions on how to get custom image billboards working (it's not hard, but you have to add a specific folder inside the folder that is being used as your Documents library)It would be a disservice, though, to not mention the two new theme park games that have come out since this game's release, especially since both are on Steam. First, currently still in Early Access, is Parkitect, has a similar look-and-feel to this game but has more depth and, important for some people, actual modding support for custom rides. Second, recently released, is Planet Coaster, generally accepted as the true sequel from Frontier, the dev team behind this game. If you like this kind of game, do check those out as well.			"

												A near-perfect game, I'll say.The addictive nature and abundance of content on offer just makes this a stellar Rollercoaster tycoon, management, sim., action, RPG...whatever. Heck, even if you get tired after career mode, the godly sandbox - and other build options too - will keep you playing like as if it's you trying to perfect your own model railway; except for the fact that there will be a phallic-shaped pool.Yet, above all, the game engine is old. I mean it - Nerd³ (a YouTuber I adore) had to stop building his park due to the game just being unstable and slow; even his rig blew the specs for this game out of the water! But then his park was full of crap here and there. It just makes me hope that RCT4 exploits modern hardware for full potential...if Atari even TRIES to make the game good. Okay, quasi-tangent over.All in all, RCT3: Platinum's seemingly never-ending torrent of content has kept me going for some time (nearly 60 hours, to be exact), despite showing it's age. And if Atari does make us glare daggers when it comes to the questionable sequel - PC, NOT MOBILE - we'll still have this.			"

												This has been my favourite game of all time ever since I was a kid. I grew up playing this at my cousin's house back when it first came out. It was so cool, the visuals were way ahead of its time, the tile based building made everything easy to make, and there was a seemingly endless supply of neat features and things to create. You could also ride the rides in first person view which was pretty awesome and made building coasters much more satisfying.Ten years later and this game is still a great time. The graphis still astound me and now I'm smart enough to take advantage mods and advanced features that I couldn't use when I was little. The tile system didn't really age well however and building advanced and organised things can be a pain. The game can also be tricky for new players(I didn't need to worry because my cousins taught me) but there are tutorials that you can use. Overall this game was a spendid technical achievement for it's time and it holds up well today. I still find it to be a fitting title for my all time favourite game. Heres to hoping that Planet Coaster takes everything that made this game great and raises it to a whole new level.			"

												Chris Sawyer, maker of 90s clasic Transport Tycoon 2 Deluxe, was part of this revamp of RCT2 that does not add much in terms of graphics. This third installment of the game was made by Atari with the intention to attract all ages and genders, so the game looks slightly childish in my opinion. But make no mistake - this simulation is so rich it would make your head explode.The game features an incredible level of depth to the simulation, almost unparallaled. It allows you to control if/how much toppings you put in each beverage sold in one of the dozens of stalls. It includes cheap terrain modification (and spray paint) and many differently themed decorations and buildings. It has a scheduled fireworks simulator with a built in looper (and the cost is per single firework). Each sim in the park has a wallet, a set of hands to hold on to stuff, a set of bars for hunger/thirst/nausea and ride preferences. You will, at some point, be required to address the career ambitions of Animal Keeper 17.And there's the rollercoaster simulator. Many dozens of real rollercoasters where the ride excitement is a factor of the speed, drops, g forces and more. A beatutifully complex and simple interface. I grew up playing the prequels and I was surprised every ride and rollercoaster I knew from the game was a real thing somewhere. RCT2 had missions in Six Flags parks and other famous parks around the world. This one instead has many creative scenarios where you start with a crazy looking old town or a huge garden that show you what this game has to offer if you decide to go sandbox.Which is probably the point of this game - it's like building models more than anything.Downsides are the low difficulty in this installment. If you are completing the missions you don't really need to use the many features of this game. I would give my Peeps a food stall only after three or four months. There's no benefit to tampering with the food and items you sell (the ride control boxes are awesome to tinker with).Buy it on sale for sure.			"

												Bought this game for the memories I have of it. It's highly recomended for the park creations. You can and will do a lot of (im)possible structures but it's a bit up to the player to check for the realism. There's nothing like the charm of being able to send a rollercoaster from 0 to 200mph in few seconds! :DIt's really an awesome game with a quite high learn time. It takes plenty of time to learn how to do and how to manage everything.This steam version has the 2 addons of the game (Wild and Soaked) which adds quite a lot of new atractions. Worths it's price on Steam big sales (up to 75% discount) for new players or for the memories it brings.9/10 Overall			"

												First of all, bear in mind that my low steam playtime is just that. I used to beat the crap out of the game disc on my first laptop, so you can easily add 80 hours to the playtime.Well, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is now an aging beast. The game originally released in 2004, and that unfortunally shows. While graphics isn't the main or even secondary reason you would like to play this game, there are some now hard to forgive kinks in that department like the lack of native 1080p support. There are of course workarounds to this, but then again, it's hard to blame a game from before widescreens became common to have widescreen support. So, what about the game itself? Well, it's really as solid as you would expect the sequel to RCT2 would be.  While the iconic, isometric pixel art of the first two games have been replaced with 3D, it really looks good for its age. There is content enough in the game to keep you sucked in for a long, long time, plenty of RollerCoaster types and designs to keep you interested and best of all, the people in the park aren't as timid as they were in the first two games, allowing you to build more extreme rides without it having a negative impact on your play.So, why would you buy this? Honestly, Nostalgia is the main reason. But it does this very, very well and I still return to it ten years later.			"

												It's not uncommon for people to claim every now and then that the first game of any particular series is better than the latter ones. Either way, that concept won't apply in this case, as the third title of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series has gotten incredibly better, not only by better graphics, music, gameplay, expansion packs (aka DLCs nowadays), 3D engine etc. Well, I'm not saying that the previous ones weren't really good, it's just that there were some interesting improvements that were presented on this version, especially the tool to fast forward the time, which is insanely helpful. Another thing that is worth to be mentioned is fact that you can actually ride your custom-built rollercoasters, which nowadays it'd be awesome combined with VR technology (although the graphics could use some extra polishing). Besides the ""campaign mode"", there's also the sandbox option, where you can get to put your creativity / insanity into good use (if you wanna know what I'm talking about, look for the ""Death Cab Roller Coaster Tycoon 3"" on the web). Overall, although there're no Steam achievements or trading cards to get, this game is extremely fun and I definitely enjoyed to beat every single scenario available, being in my modest opinion one of the best tycoon games that were ever made.

Finally got a steam copy to replace my disc copy, so i don't have to have the disc in the drive every time i want to play. The game comes with a good amount of pre built theme parks with challenges to complete. It also offers a sandbox mode. You can also create groups of guests for your park. You can customize what type of rides they enjoy. You can also micro manage a lot of things in the game, from how much cheese your burgers have, to the color of the balloons you sell.Even though it is an older game, it doesn't feel that dated. Would still love to see a Rollercoaster Tycoon 4.			"

												Long time coming for this review.Planet Coaster just came out and I beat it completely, in under 50 hours.Come back to RCT3, and before I know it, I'm nearly 100 hours in.Planet Coaster may be pretty looking, but this game is still the KING of Rollercoaster games.So much content, it is almost too much. So many ride types and customizations that I can't think of a park that had any empty space or lack of rides after I was done with it.If you are looking for eye bleeding graphics above gameplay, then go elsewhere. It still looks good for a game made back in 2004-2005. I personally have no problem with the graphics in this game because the actual gameplay is what makes it so worth while. And it runs fine in 1920x1080 with a simple txt file edit.Until there is another RollerCoaster game with MORE CONTENT than RCT3 has, RCT3 will remain on the top of the list that all others aspire to.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3... what is there to say? It's the RCT you know and love only in 3D with rideable rides, loads of new coasters and buildings and in this version the ability to make water parks and zoo's in your park. But is it worth the price of admission?TL;DR This game has more than enough content to make it worth 20$ with zoo's, water parks, new rides, buildings and 39 scenario's each with 3 levels of challenge and goals. Ride your own rides, build your own peeps, heck there's even mod's for this game. If your thinking about getting this game, BUT IT! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!A lot of people will look at this game and it's age... yes it was released in 2006 and is 8 years old, than they look at the price which is a steep 20$ and freak out saying not worth it and to expensive. However those people are wrong and here's why.You are paying 20$ for RCT 3 base game which is loaded with features like sandbox mode, coaster, building, and peep designer as well as a massive campaign with 18 scenario's each with a different theme and 3 levels of challenege from beginer all the way to tycoon. Than the Soaked! pack comes with 9 scenario's with the same 3 level challenge teir and the Wild! back has 12 Scenario's... again with the challeneges. Soaked and Wild also come with new rides, buildings and attractions like, well a water slides, pools and zoo's but also rides that arn't necessarily linked to a zoo theme. You can also use all that comes with the packs in any mode, so if your playing the base campain you can put in a zoo and pool.don't like campaigns? Build the park of your dreams in the Sandbox mode with everything unlocked, a massive flat space for you to let your dreams go... wild. Did I mention that you can make firework shows? Yeah you can do that. This game is not worth 20$... it's worth 30$, 10 for each pack but you can get it for 20 and it's so worth it. Steam says I've only played 14 hours (or something like that) but it's forgetting the hundreds of hours that I played when I only had it on Disk...			"

												After a seven year break, I recently rediscovered RCT3 thanks to Steam - I used to have the whole collection on disc.As this was the first game in the series to jump to real time 3D graphics, it somewhat polarised people during it's initial release - long term fans of the series were excited and intrepid in equal measure. Even today, the game isn't as highly regarded as it's two prequels; a view point I absolutely disagree with.Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 is the pinnacle of the series, especially here in it's 'Platinum' form. The complexity of earlier games is still there, although managing the paths your peeps take and where they spend their money is somewhat easier and more intuitive. The 3D graphics allow you to explore the park as if you were a guest, and you can ride every creation in first person, whether the gentle spin of the teacups or the stomach churning corkscrews of your own personal magnum opus. The game has extensive tutorials which cover everything the game has to offer, and the same level of in depth tutition is available for both of the included expansion packs.Creating coasters can still be done on the fly while you're in the middle of the games campaign mode, or it can be accomplished in a dedicated in-game tool, allowing you to build and test the coaster of your dreams without limitations. You can then save these designs to your very own catalogue, where they will be given a cash value based on the number and type of parts used. If you then wish to use this design during your main game, in any mode, you purchase it from the catalogue just as you would with other built-in designs. Adding to the depth of creativity is the building designer. Now this is seriously impressive: You use geometric shapes and parts to literally create buildings from the ground up. It's like having a 3D jigsaw but with a limitless number of pieces, allowing you to create any shape you like, and then apply any texture you like to them. Again, this tool is available in-game straight from the main menu, and whether you use it to recreate the Tower of London or your favourite sweet shop from Blackpool Pleasure Beach, it's powerful stuff. Of course, dozens of building designs are included in game, and just like the coaster tools, you're not forced to create them from scratch if you don't want to.The final tool to complete this insanely customisable trilogy of creation is the Peep Designer! That's right, you can create your own individuals - families, even - and customise them with your own names and such. Graphically you don't get much for the peeps, unlike the rest of the game which looks fantastic, because they're low poly models as you will have literally hundreds of them exploring your theme park at once. But it's still cool to be able to put your family in the game, and track them throughout sandboxes and scenarios.As well as all of the above, you have the game itself. Anyone who claims that the complexity and intricacy of the earlier games has been lost, well you're playing a different game to me! Shops, finances, entrance fees, peep personalities, disasters, employees and all the minutae they involve have to be managed by you, and it's as engrossing as ever.When you add in the superb expansions, allowing you to build swimming pools of any shape you desire, and water flumes with the same levels of complexity as the coasters, it becomes a no-brainer for fans of strategy games and Theme Park. With the addition of the included Wild expansion, you can even set up zoos and safaris, either independently or as part of your main park. Pens, viewing platforms, making sure people don't get mauled by a tiger that's chewed through a cheap fence you traded off to built a better log flume... It's all there.The game runs really nice and smoothly and still looks great, right down to the little details like peeps throwing their arms in the air when the reach the peak of a coaster before a big drop... It is, without a doubt, the best theme park management game ever made, and an easy recommendation.*Edited for typos*			"

												One of the best video games ever coded, designed and thought of. And the sweet smell of good'old memories -numerous hours I have spent on trying to plot out the best design for a Theme Park, including the hamburger and Turkish delight stalls, custom-shaped rollercoasters and those pathways going across the small islands I have located in the middle of a river. This game is a never-gonna-be-old legend, and the atmosphere when it's just about the sunset: simply priceless.			"

												I actually like this game more than the others.Sure, the people are.....very.....scary.I do like the ability to ride your coasters. I also like that there is an ACTUAL sandbox mode.Also, people will actually ride my rides!The game has only crashed for me twice, because I did the dreaded click while loading.The other games on windows 10 crashed. A lot.Otherwise, I love this game! I really recommend it!			"

												My steam hours betray my actual hours; I have well over 5,000 hours total with this game alone, and am still entertained by it.This game was made 12 years ago. It still works, and is still alive with new fan-made content. The base game is fun, but figure out how to get custom content and mods working, and you will have so much fun just making buildings, let alone an entire park. With the genre being revived in games like Planet Coaster and Parkitect (Let's face it, RCT World is dead to us all) this is an excellent choice to tide you over until Planet Coaster releases, or if it is on sale (Or hell, even if it isn't.)

												One of the first games I bought on my own and wasn't borrowed or ""borrowed"" Amazingly addictive, and fun to both create and manage a park, or go crazy and design a single ride or scenery to match. The expansion packs actually add to the game and hearken back to an age before DLC and expansions would go down the tube.My only complaint is the lack of murder park simulator elements. The rides explode and can fail, but you never really kill anyone. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT endorse or condone violence outside video games. But something about people just getting up and dusting themselves off after their rollercoaster ramps off the track segment and flies at almost 0.5 mach into a cliff face isn't quite the same			"

I bought it on the cheap thinking I'd sink 20 minutes in it for the nostalgia, but it's still a great game. Difficulty can be adjusted for an actual challenge or sandbox mode is always a blast. If you'd played this at a younger age - go for it. If your into Sim games at all - go for it. Value is probably closer to $10.00 - $15.00 versus the $20.00 it is not on sale, so wait for a sale.

												A game I have played for at least years as a child, I was the kid who would bring a pentium 4 laptop that always needed a charger just cause I broke the battery and bring it everywhere and the only game I ever bought was from a book fair in my school hidden gem hidden in the 10 dollar section was a physical copy of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum. Even if I couldn't bring the laptop, I always bring my copy. Box and disc with the installation Manuel to play the game. Playing it and installing it in my friends, friends parents computer, my cousins, my grandmas computer and even an office computer back where my father used to work. This game is the essence of what I wanted as a dream job. I loved it to bits, however it seemed to have aged. However not as much to actually enjoy the game. You play as a amusement park manager making rides, attractions, stalls and roller coasters around the park where ever you like. A sandbox mode where there's endless possibilities because of the unlimited money and no matter how bad you manage the park, it'll still generate population to make the park alive as you stack the place with crazy rides. As well as a campaign mode and scenario system to play the tycoon part of the game. Challenging and those take time to actually learn the fundamentals of managing a park. Trying to reach a certain amount of people that are in your park, the rides and the attractions you put into it so you can generate wealth (as well as other things) and actually creativity to rollercoaster building and actually park customizing as well. It's truly a park tycoon that you can bury yourself for hours and before you know it, your one of the best park managers out there with successful parks and outstanding profitable income with all the challenges at the highest rank. You can put in your own songs and pictures (windows vista and below, still trying to figure out how to do it in windows 10) add in custom rides and scenarios and even put coasters saved from the pervious rollercoaster tycoons into the fully 3D environment made by frontier. As well as the expansions of wild life and water rides? You can't get anything better (besides Planet Coaster) for such a cheap bargain price. The only Rollercoaster tycoon I've sunked my childhood into. Hell I just bought the game and already I'm obsessed again.			"

												Dont mind my play time on Steam, i played a lot of Roller Coaster 3 on retail disc. The Roller Coaster games are rather unique. You wont find any park management simulators good and user-friendly like this game series. And RC 3 is no exception. RC 1 was a true classic, a lot of people played that game and praised it as one of the best strategy games of all time. And RC3 brings the classic to a new level, introducing better graphics, improved mechanics and awesome new features. The expansion packs, included on the Platinum version, are absolutely good. They add a lot of stuff to the whole experience. Creating pools and zoos are so fun lol Many different modes, including the sandbox mode where everything is free and you can LIVE YOUR DREAM OF BUILDING YOUR DREAM THEME PARK AKA MY OWN DISNEYLAND!!!!

												Now, I've played this game for a good number of years both properly and stupidly. The managing parts are easy when you know the cheats, but aren't when you're a newcomer. In my own way, I would suggest using the Sandbox feature to design rollercoasters with buildings on them, and with anything else around the tracks. That way, you can save them without having to add the extra scenery around all over again.Also, if you're more evil than Donald Trump eating a dead baby, you go for the psycho option and input ""James Hunt"" into one of your park guests, and you'll unlock the dune buggy to run over everybody! And another option to go full on evil is to unleash tigers, elephants and zebras on your guests, and watch as they run for the hills!Back to normality. If you want to create a 999mph death coaster, put in the cheat ""David Braben"" and you're ready to rocket off to mars and back, albeit with red blood particles which used to be people. All in all, I recommend this game. Hours of replay ability, more simple than Planet Coaster, and roller coasters your deepest brain cell can conjure!Addenda: This game is only 32 bit, and it can crash easily (or as I say, the game ""♥♥♥♥♥ itself"") when you want make the land for your park over a 150 x 150 grid. Don't worry, I still recommend this game to anybody wanting to build their fanatasy park on Horror, Space, Western and Cowboys and Pirates. Go for it, I say!			"

The maps you can play on in career mode are fun and have diffrent objectives each. There's also a sandbox mode in which you have infinte money to build your park. On,a final note you should have patiance when building rollercoasters ( since physics exist ).The only complaint I have is that building a park can feel repititive at times but thats the only complaint I have. So, overall I woud give RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 a 85 out of  100.			"

												8.5/10 - RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 Platinum is a soiid collection and the definitve package for the RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 series, as it features the base game, plus both expansions. The expansion which add a tremendous amount of content to the game. RCT3 is at its core, a management game. You build and run a theme park the way you see fit, byt placing rides, attractions, booths, and more, to attract customers, and at the end, collecting their hard earned money to keep the park going, and to pay your employees their hard earned money. Obstacles will come in the form of rides breaking down, unhappy patrons or employees, and more problems to solve. And there are 2 ways to play this game: Full on simulation mode, where money matters, or a full on sandbox mode, where you can pretty much spend as much as you want, and get away with anything. There are as well, fun little scenarios to play to get you used to the games mechanics, which start off as tutorials, and end up being challenges to help you unlock stuff. For anyone who has played RCT1 and 2, this game strays from the earlier isometric visuals of the first 2, and comes back with full 3D visuals, which this time around actually let you ride the park rides in 1st person. Everything looks pretty damn gorgeous, except for a few visual hiccups, like when messing with terrain, or the extremely aged and ugly looking patrons. Everything else looks damn fine though for a game this old. The expansions will take your vanilla park, and add a water park features, as well as a wildlife park, complete with various animals to use as attractions for the patrons.This title is pretty easy to get into, even for people new to management games. Also a blast to play for veterans.			"

												I got RCT3 for Christmas back in 2004. I hated it. This is after hundreds (thousands?) of hours combined in RCT1 and 2.11 years later I decided to give it another try and picked it up on Steam and gave it a fair shot. I can honestly say that it is a very good game and it does live up to being a RCT. There is so much variety in this game. You can customize each shop to sell what you want. You can build dozens of different thrill rides, roller coasters, gentle rides, etc. The graphics are ageless and will look good no matter what year you play in.However, there are 2 rather large issues that I have a hard time getting over. Hotkeys and the UI. These two areas were perfect in 1 and 2. For whatever reason, RCT3 does not have adequate hotkeys. For example, you can't press a key and open up Finances, rides, guests, staff, etc, like you could in 1+2. You have to move the mouse over to a very small circluar button and click it. To leave that menu, you have to click an (X) button on the menu that is literally only a few pixels wide. In the previous games, you could press Backspace to get out of the menu. Prepare for some precision clicking in this game. If the developers just leaved those two things exactly how they were from before, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's so tedious having to click tiny buttons. Here's hoping that RCT:World will be a great game.			"

												Personally, I REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME! It's super fun and I can't stop! There's only a few cons. For Example, one of my lines ALWAYS gets stuck.But, the amount of pros definetely make up for the cons.Building a roller coaster can be a bit troubling at times but it's fun. Adding in rides is awesome and building structures isn't too dificult but I'm not good at it.Probably a solid 9.2 or 9.3 out of 10.			"

												Excellent sim theme park game.  This is the best rollercoaster construction and theme park management game I have seen.  Hours of fun for those who like sim games.  There is a great amount of detail to the game and many many rides and design features for your park.  This game can keep your interest for a long time with the many creative possibilities.  In addition you can make your own custom people and families to visit your park, and you can assume a rider perspective to experience what your park is like first hand.			"

10/10  This game is an amazing roller coaster builder, and the amount of fun you can get from building and riding roller coasters is amazing! I really enjoy building and riding the roller coasters the most, but if you arent one for building, you can manage and run your very own amusement park:-) The possibilites are endless and when you buy the game, it automatically comes with all of the dlcs!Pros - Game modes are fun and challenging        - You can build a bunch of differnt roller coasters with different themes        - After you place, or build a coaster you can ride them!        - With the wild dlc you can build a massive zoo, and the soaked dlc, you can build a resort like park        - The peeps faces are funny and even as old as this game is, it has great game playCons - If you dont care to build roller coasters and enjoy riding rides, this game is not for you         - The graphics are a little bit dated I want rctw now lol			"

												This game is generally amazing. I would give this game a 4.5/5 for some reasons. The main reason is all of the confusing things... When you build rides, you must check the excitement rating, etc. But the most confusing and annoying thing in this game is the Rct3: Wild! DLC pack. Unless you are really good at Strategey Games, The Wild! pack is definantly something to get used too.			"

												This game is an amazing theme park/buissines simulator. It's a manegment game where you build theme parks, roller coasters ,and rides. The manegment part of the game comes in when you start career mode. You have to manage your park and your money so you can keep growing. You can build food stands and theme your rides and everything is completely customizable from the name of your park, to how much the entery fee is, to if people get to choose how many pickles they get on their burgers at the burger shop you build. I love this game and it is one of the best management games I have ever played. I give this game an 9/10. (The Platinum adittion comes with 2 expantion packs, 1 to build pool complexs, and 1 to build animal parks which is good fun too!)			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 gives you quite a bit of freedom to create your own amusement park.  This edition comes with both expansions so you can add a zoo and water park to the creating process.Dozens of carnival rides, dozens of coaster types, and different shop types for your customers to spend their money on.  This game also gives you the option to theme sections of your park, or the whole thing if you so choose to.  There is a lengthy campaign mode for you to go through.  From improving parks to building a ride that will make a VIP guest happy to making X amount of money.  And if you would rather build your own park, then there is a sandbox mode to do so.  Build to your hearts content in this mode with an unlimited amount of money to build coasters that will drive guests wild.To date, this is the best amusement park simulation/strategy game in my opinion.  All it is missing is carnival games for the guests to throw money away on.			"

												Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 is one of my all time favourite games. I can quite literally just use the Rollercoaster Designer all day and not get bored. It's a really good game if you're into management simulators, are attracted to theme parks and don't mind that the graphics and gameplay systems are now a little bit dated. Would definitely be worth picking up if it's in the sale, or if you're just looking for a fun, laid-back game to kill a few hours here and there.			"

												Been playing this game since 2006, I still remember the good times opening the game and hearing those awesome songs that made me stand up and dance. I created atleast one awesome and creative theme park every single day. The possibilities in this game are endless, and when you have finally played the game enough that you've built & tried everything in the game, you can dowload a lot of custom scenery and rides! I suggest that you open you're wallet right now and buy this game right now!			"

												This game is plain awesomeness. It's on of these games I've played when I was younger and never forgot.And it's still reall fun. Despite this game being old, it's still great!  Even the graphics aren't bad.Being a fan of rollercoasters and parks, it sure is a game for me.The scenarios are great, but let's be honest, we all play that kind of game for the sandbox. Being able to create your own thing as you wish, without having to care about managing anything.And in this game, there are really a lot of options. You can create so many things. Especially with both expansion packs included. You can create your park, put whatever you want in it, the rides you wish, make your own rollercoasters, make pools with slides, create buildings, make fireworks shows or even lasers shows, shape landscape, put waterfalls, billboards with personalized images, make a mini-zoo.... So many things. And not only can you create all that stuff, see people in the park enjoying it, get info about it (like speed of rides, g-force, etc), but you can even ride everything (slides, rollercoasters, rides)...You can create your own park the way you wish, and then you can even experience it.And if you forget about the sandbox mode a bit, there's still plenty of time to spend on the scenarios, the rollercoaster builder if you wish to only create a rollercoaster... And also something pretty neat about the game, you can put your own music in the game.Also, there are quite a few mods that you can find and which are pretty great, even though there is no centralized place for that.Unless you don't like theme parks or rollercoasters or creating stuff, there is no reason not to like this game.All I could see missing to it is better textures and easier modding so we could get a lot of awesome community-created content.

												This game is one of the most beautiful games ever. Its main storyline is so touching. Every character not only affects your game but your life. One moment I always remember is when my first V.I.P came and swam in my pool. And five seconds later instinct told me to delete the entrance so he would drown. Of course he became very angry and after around two hours I decided to rebuild the entrance to the pool allowing him to leave. And so he did and when he left throught the main entrance  he rated my rollercoaster park 5/5 That is when I realized this game had touched my heart in a way no other game ever has. In summary this game is th pinnacle of all  games no more boring GTA or COD everyone should buy this game and realize its beauty and touching storyline.			"

												Started playing it again recently, and first words that I think of is:Swimming pools. My goodness you can do SOOO much with the swimming pools. Second word I can think of is: thrill and gentle rides. SOO many of them.Third thing is: Roller coasters! As compared to the original game, it's way easier to make a successful one on 3 that doesn't make people sick or have them say ""that's too intense for me"" which happens sooo much on the first one. Many more options too!forth thing:landscaping. WAYY more advanced than the first game. There is no limit to how high or low land can go and can do so much more with it.last but not least:riding the rides! If you make a good coaster it's fun just to sit and watch yourself riding it!Then of course the graphics, although around playstation 2 level, are much better than the first two games. If you like age of empires but don't want to get attacked all the time, or if you like any games like that, you should get this one. **little warning*** this game has quite a steep learning curve, but it's totally worth learning and it actually adds to the fun when you figure something out.

												If you're a fan of theme park management, who also loves working in a 3D space, then this game is the perfect choice. Others say this is the best of the RCT series, well the best 3D RCT I'd say. (RCT 4 and World can go six feet under.) As someone who's played this since 2005-6, the time I bought the game physically, I've spent hours creating the perfect theme parks and outlandish rollercoasters that needed 4-5 first aid stalls to cope with trainload after trainload of sick riders.Do I love this game? Oh yes. Buy it full price or wait for a sale that's up to you but either way, you'll be buying a ticket to one of the greatest theme park management games there is. If you're more of a classic, isometric fan. Then I also recommend RCT 1 and 2.If you're holding off Planet Coaster for now, made by the same people by the way, waiting for a price drop or just unsure. This game will also perfectly stand in as a taste of Planet Coaster's glory. "

												I decided that my roller coasters didn't need to make a full circuit and that the guests would enjoy getting launched into low orbit. After that, some dunce in some council somewhere called me criminally negligent. I celebrated my award by making it free hotog day, and then unleashing a lion or two in front of the hotdog stand. Also, my waterslide into a mile-deep pit is a smash hit!			"

												I would reccomend this game for people who are big fans of coasters or has some spare money and wants to play a game they do not already have.This game is fun to play for the level of creativity you put into the roller coasters and of course your parks. You will find yourself puting multiple hours trying to build a bigger and better park for your peeps.However the amount of scenery in this game is small and you would have to go to websites like RCTGo to get coaters like the B&M coaster because they are not in the game.But if you put in the time and comitment you will see that this game is worth playing over and over again.8/10			"

												Amazing.  It's a must play for any Roller Coaster junkie or Sim like fan out there.Plently of different styles of roller coasters to choose from.  If it's exist, then you can mostly likely build it in this game.Sculpt your own terrians, build your own coaster stations, enterances, secenery etcs.. The ideas are endlesss and are only left up to the player to decide. If you still haven't played it, don't let the release date fooled you.  This isn't anything quite like RCT:3.

												I have put a serious amount of time in this RCT series, but in this review I'm just comparing RCT2 with 3 and I can firmly say that all the games are tremendously fun and addicting, but I think they could have taken 3 even further. RC3 has updated graphics, but it would have been amazing to see a more ""serious"" and ""realistic"" look rather than the ""cartoonish"" environment. I do thoroughly enjoy the ""on ride"" first person camera view, it makes you able to experience your park first hand. The rides overall are pretty cool but again I would have liked to see a more realistic detail. What RC3 did get right was the mechanics. They are terrific, taking ideas from RC2 and making them even better. Budgeting is as fun and challenging as ever, and some scenarios worth exploring. I do enjoy RC3, there is also loads of content available online including fully made parks. I do have a little more love overall for RC1, only due to the originality and extreme customization and modding. I would absolutely love to see another Rollercoaster Tycoon, they are truly fun and addicting.			"

												RCT3 Platinum includes the regular version and 2 DLC add-ons, Soaked, and Wild.This game is really fun to do as there is allot more to do in this game than RCTW, you can create more coasters and create water parks and zoos.The campaigns stories are challenging as they get harder and harder, they do however unlock new coaster designs.Add your own music to RCT3 with the custom music, and add your own custom scenary.Very good game this but I do have to give some faults too. This game is really good and was made around 2003. The peeps screams sounds fake, you can't do track angles freely like in RCTW. And you can't upload coaster designs to share.I would recommend getting RCTW...no wait.....get Planet Coaster instead. Planet Coaster is allot like RCT3 but much more realistic and is tons better than this game and RCTW. Get that instead to save yourself allot of trouble unless your CPU keeps crashing that is.RCT3 is a finished game so there won't be any more updates. RCTW and Planet Coaster are getting the updates from RCT3 but with allot more realisim.Few faults for this game so gonna give it a...8/10Game Rating: G (General)Catagory: Construction			"

												This is a spectacular and flexible game, allowing you to really create roller coaster parks according to your personal taste and your own inclinations (are you most interested in creating beautiful parks for the joy of your visitors, or do you prefer to focus on making money, do you prefer water-based attractions, or you are more inclined towards wild animals, or you only like complicated roller coasters?). You have a deep control of the details, including the colors of the shops, the prices of everything you sail, including tickets to visit your attractions, etc. Finally, a beautiful game for those who prefer to build nice things rather than shoot zombies or humans or whatever else.

												RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum Let me start by saying out of all the RolerCoaster Tycoon's that I have played this one is the BEST. In the past RollerCoaster Tycoon or what I am now going to say RCT 3 for short has always made the true tycoon player love  every min of it. I grew up playing the RCT games. I was always wanting more from the game and now with RCT 3 I got it. The game is full of color and cool new rides that will make your guest happy. The more time you spend on on RCT 3 the more you get to know the control lay out. Witch is also the games down turn. Keys are hard to learn and could get somewhat hard to remember of what does what. (For a side note I have alot more time on this game in offline mode on steam then I do on online mode). You have options on how you want to play but for me I always play Sandbox mode. All around the game is fun and will take up most of your time if you are looking to play a long game. If you need ideas on how you sould build your park there are lots of videos on YouTube that will help you out.   "

												I'm one of those people who watches nerdcubed on youtube. I love to just see him work out how to play a game he chooses! When i saw a video of him playing this i thought ""i wonder how he'd react to rollercoasters"". Then he showed the game and the nect day i bought it! It may be a theme park park simulator but i have made pretty much anything i want including firework shows, concerts, town and much much more. If you get it off here you get 2 expansion packs. Well worth the money. One thing i must say nerdcubed did was he looked for when this cam out and her said ""When did this come out? Er.. 2004! *chucks box on to keyboard* "" It's over 10 years old and rollercoaster tyccon world comes out in 2015. Get this game now!			"

												I've used this game to make many a mad science creation (including but not limited to rides based on Rebecca Black and ""What Does the Fox Say"",) so this game obviously gets my endorsement. But, while I fully recommend purchasing this game if  you're a fan of theme parks, don't go in expecting RCT 1 or 2.  This game has a completely different feel than you may remember from the first couple games. The first game had a charm that was all it's own, and with this third installment it's mostly function over form. That being said, the function is a hell of a thing. Things you can do in this game that you couldn't do in the first two:- ride your rides / explore your parks in a 3D environment- build water park / zoo type attractions (complete with their own sets of custom controls)- create themed night time shows set to your own music, using fireworks, lasers, and water cannons (i saw someone online creating scenes from Disney's World of Color ... damn.)- import custom graphics using billboards and tiles (with some tinkering, if you're using a newer OS.)And since this game has been around for a while, there's also a huge wealth of custom scenery / rides / ride vehiceles / etc. online at your disposal, to help you create literally whatever kind of ride / show / theme park you can think of.I've played other theme park sims that have come and gone since this one and while, yes, the graphics and are a little dated and, yes, you will need to spend some time grinding through all the tutorials and knocking out the scenarios before you get pro enough for sand box mode, I still maintain that this game is still THE best theme park sim out there to really let your imagination run wild. (That is, perhaps, until Theme Park Studios is released in 2014.)			"

												TL;DR: Everyone needs to give this game a shot.Everyhting I can think of is there. There is over 35 roller coaster types, spanning a wide range of abilities and themes. My to favorites are the Corkscrew coaster, which allows you to go all twisty-turney all over the park, and the Stratocoaster which is hydraulic-powered and goes extremely fast.The new CoasterCam ability allows you to ride your own coasters, which let me tell you is amazingly fun. You get to see your creation unfold in front of your very eyes, and that is very rewarding.The game isn't just about roller coasters, there is a plethora of other rides and attractions. You can build pool slides, pools, ferris wheels, free-fall rides and swings, among much other attractions. You also have to manage food and drinks, or your guests (Peeps) will get hungry/thirsty.You can individually manage the prices for each individual attraction, giving your park a good balance of money I/O.CONS:Bad Graphics (Not bad for 2004 though)Game gets EXTREMELY laggy if you have a big park.Building coasters is annoying sometimes as they sometimes fail and you have to re-build the entire thing.But that's it!9/10, amazing game!

												This series has kept me entertained since the very first. I have played the game for many hours and was a playtester for Soaked and Wild. Returning to it after years, you have to admire the advances that were made in graphics to give us this game, as well as gameplay, and then later, the opprotunity to add our own custom scenery. If you are new to Tycoon games, this series is what built that genre. And RCT3 culminates it. You can't go wrong with Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.			"

												Lots of fun, good music, plenty of potential for custom rides. My favorite ride to make is a 20 car corkscrew coaster. Warning: Guests will throw their trash on the ground no matter how many ♥♥♥♥ING garbage cans you place, but you can greatly reduce the amount of trash on the ground if you place garbage cans.Some fun things to do that don't involve following the game objectives:Make an air powered coaster that utilizes super high launch speeds (involves cheats to get required speed) to propell the cars into space (involves cheats to get required height). I have done it, and it involves hella lotz of clicking to place the track, but it is so worth it when you try it out. You can actually see the planet you are departing from. Warning: If you do this, MAKE SURE NOT TO LET THE RIDE FALL OFF OF THE TRACK, YOUR GAME WILL CRASH. Make rides that plow through lines of people (they can't die)Attempt to drown the park inspector (doesn't work)Attempt to drown piece of ♥♥♥♥ guests that throw their trash on the ground RIGHT IN FRONT OF A ♥♥♥♥ING EMPTY GARBAGE CAN (also doesn't work, but its fun to punish them :D )Unleash wild animals and watch them kill other wild animals and chase guests around. (they can kill animals, but not people, they don't go after people)Launch guests into a lion show and watch them stand there foreverLaunch guests into a rotovator using dingiesLaunch guests into a very deep mountainName animals innapropriate things: Herpies (guests will say, ""I like Herpies!"" see my screenshots to see what i mean)Put a poor child in a garbage can (their face peeks out, its soo funny and cute)Cheats (change guest name to the cheat):David Braben: Allows ride speeds of about 2234 or so MPHJohn Wardley: Allows unlimited(as far as i have discovered) ride height.Make me sick: Everyone in the park pukesMouse: Everyone looks at the cursorAtomic: Never had this work, so i dont know for sure what happens.

												As a gamer who has spent over 1000 hours playing this game, I can say that I love this game. Though the game doesn't have the best graphics or physics, the game was made in the early 2000's, so I cut it some slack. This game is definitely worth the money, as you can mod the game to add waay more content than the stock parts.			"

												Many people prefer RCT2 over RCT3 But to me RCT3 is the best. You can not only include rollercoasters, but firework shows, terrarforming, zoos, FREAKIN DINOSAURS, pools, and many stuff/mods to download from online. The graphics help you to experience the parks that the previous games couldnt do. You can ride your roller coasters and almost walk around in your own park.			"

												Second greatest building game ever, in regards to building anything.  The greatest in the world would be RollerCoaster Tycoon: Loopy Landscapes.  But that's not available on steam so get this one instead.  Build a theme park, hell, build a million.  The game will easily last a creative person hundreds of hours.

												This game is just awesome. I have over 150 something hours on this baby. My first experience with roller coaster simulation games was the game ""Thrillville: Off the Rails"" for the Wii. There was nothing to do, and there were just limits, limits, limits on that game. It's not Thrillville: It's Dullsville.         When I found out this game was on Steam I just went completely head over heels for it. I've been a fan of the RCT franchise since second grade, and I was itching to play this one. However, I was worried that maybe this game would turn out to be just like Thrillville, with just limits, limits, limits.           So I decided to go ahead and give this game a try. I bought it and played Sandbox mode for maybe 20-30 minutes until I really got into the game. I severely injured 78 peeps on a horrific inverted roller coaster, drowned the annoying park inspector 50 times, charged 100 dollars for peeps to TCOB, and let my animals run loose and terrify peeps.            What I really like about this game is that it's the Platinum version. That means it includes all three expansions, so you don't have to waste more money on downloadable expansions. I'd recommend this game to anyone who's a hardcore roller coaster fan.              I'd rate this 9/10, and the reason why it's a 9 is because it's the graphics. The rest? PURE AWESOME!			"

												Please buy this game, it has eveything you want with every rollercoaster you can think of. Save rollercoasters with the tool, make your own family of people in the game that will come into to park and go on your rides. Sandbox mode is just there to make anything you want, then there is the ""real game"" where you work your up to gain the best park. OR you can charge people $100 for a balloon and pop it instantly, either way this game is one of my fav's even when I played it years ago when it was on DISK!

You cannot build huge parks and this is a big turn off for me.			"

												It is a fun game, but be prepared to lose a lot of hours to it.  It is similar to Sim City in the sense that you are building stuff using tile placement and budgets.  It is fully 3D, has a lot of really nice content, and has some neat features, like the ability to actually ride the rides.  The only way the game could be better in my opinion is to allow you to run around in first-person mode and play the game as an employee.  I have seen that done before, but it has never been done well.  At least this game does everything else well.There are no Steam achievements, but there are challenges within the game.  You can also customize the game greatly.  I also think the game's controls are decent and the graphics are pretty good.  The overall atmosphere feels similar to the county fair until you start building the big rides and hiring lots of employees.  Then, it feels more like an actual theme park, I guess.There are some confusing mechanics, as well.  The menus are hard to navigate, and the pool system is bizarre.  You would think that pool paths would work like regular paths, but no, they work on their own menu.  To this day, I still cannot figure out how to connect a pool to the rest of the theme park.			"

												This was my first RCT game when I was a kid and I enjoy it now as much as I did then. If I had a Steam account when this released, I'd have an unhealthy amount of hours docked on this game. The Wild and Soaked add-on packs are nice too, though the game is still just as fun without them. Your imagination is your own limitation in this game. The one very minor issue I have with RCT3 in general is the camera movement. It can be a bit of a pain at times when you're trying to build a coaster because it only shows from a downward angle and can only go flat when you middle mouse click and drag, then it holds it for a second and goes back to its original angle. The camera pan from left to right can sometimes get a little irritating as well. This didn't bother me so much as a kid a it does now (I use Maya for 3D animation and am used to moving the camera around in order to view all angles of whatever I'm building), however, it's not something worth condeming the game for. Overall, this game is very fun to play and I thoroughly enjoy everything it has to offer.			"

Some of the mechanics can be frustrating at times but you'll get used to it, and the bugs are hilarious anyways. It works well on Steam. No issues running it unlike some other games of it's kind (Sim Theme Park requires a degree in Computer Science to run on Windows 8.) Some games age out of being fun, this never will.

												So much, yet so little.Atari/Frontier really needed to follow up on the title, but it can still be great fun. You'll notice the thousands of things they needed to include before ending the franchise. Worth every penny in my opinion though. I'm a sucker for theme parks and roller coasters. It just gets a little tiring hearing the same sounds and running into all the things that I can't do that should exist. This on top of some stupid bugs and ugly physics can leave you questioning the purpose of some features including in the title. The primary issue with RCT3 is that it's outdated, yet still being pushed and played by the community because there hasn't been a game like it since it came out, so we're left with what we've got. If you're REALLY good at working with this title, you can modify it and submit your creations online to share and upload into the game, which is cool, but very tedious. Overall, it's really fun game to expand your creativity, but if you're looking to create Disney/Universal quality attractions, it's not happening here. Theme Parks simply weren't what they are now back in 2004. You're getting what's advertised, but just be aware that you'll find yourself wanting so much more out of something with infinite potential. I just really wish there was money in rebooting the franchise to give us a fresh addtion. A new engine with realistic sounds and lifelike visuals sounds better than food... (joking)There is a title is the works from a seperate company called Theme Park Studio, but it has yet to be released and may be a little too complex for the average consumer like myself. It has great potential and could become the closest thing we will get to another RCT. Cheers!			"

												Over the past five years, I've easily sunk more hours into this game than any other. While it's easy enough to jump into to get started, it can be very addictive and take over your life for a while with its depth and seemingly endless possibilities. I've never even messed around much with the money management or scenarios, and I'm still creeping up on 200 hours with this bad boy just on Steam, which is my second run with the game.There are a few different routes you can take with RCT3. You can try to tackle all the scenarios and successfully manage some pre-built (or partially built) parks, create your own parks in sandbox mode without monetary restrictions, or sadistically terrorize the peeps in parks of pure mayhem. Any of these is a viable route to take, and reason enough to pick this up.Of course, RCT3 isn't perfect. It's definitely showing its age at this point, the physics aren't remotely realistic, and the graphics (especially the peeps) are a bit cartoony. There are also some maddening limitations with the grid (I find your lack of diagonals disturbing), curious omissions from the pre-supplied content (no stock picnic tables?!), and many fans of the series seem to prefer the older games.Despite the shortcomings, however, there's just too much here to like. Custom content has kept this game going for a decade now and has made up for a lot of those omissions. Being able to view your parks in 3D and ""ride"" any of your rides is simply awesome the first time you experience it. And just being able to create your own amusement park -- a FULL park with flat rides, custom coasters, water attractions, and even animals -- makes this one a definite winner.RCT3 may ultimately be succeeded by Theme Park Studio in the sandbox department if the latter pans out (which I'm hoping will be the case). But in the meantime, or if you're a big fan of the money management features and scenarios of the RCT series, this is where it's at.			"

												I would most recommend this to anybody who loves simulation games and amusement parks. With the expansions, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 provides you with the opportunity to build the ultimate amusement park filled with crazy rides, exotic animals, and even water parks. This is certainly a fun game to play and you will have no regrets when you spend $20 on this (I bought this during the 75% off deal so its definitely worth the price).			"

Some of the mechanics can be frustrating at times but you'll get used to it, and the bugs are hilarious anyways. It works well on Steam. No issues running it unlike some other games of it's kind (Sim Theme Park requires a degree in Computer Science to run on Windows 8.) Some games age out of being fun, this never will.

												It's kind of like creative mode Minecraft crossed with Sim City.I've been playing this series for years and the graphics, while not HD maybe, are still fun and interesting. Customization is limited in some areas (booths, food, themes) but expansive in others (ride customization, cheat codes, puns). The game is fun and the challenges, while sometimes infuriating to start, are greatly satisfying to achieve.If there are glitches, I've not noticed them. The hidden bits like sharks and manta rays are great fun if you get the expansions. It's also not as easy for peeps to get lost, I've noticed, which is a big improvement because they used to get lost if you widened a path, but complain of over crowding if it was one block wide.

I always had hours of fun making a coaster that went no place and always enjoyed how no one ever had the balls to go on my coaster of DEATH so what its a five minute long ride that took you nearly over a few miles of tracks and loops and other crazy things. I feel like thats getting your money worth on a ride let me tell you but no the AI didn't agree with my crazy builds. So i would put them on a coaster and BANISH THEM to OUTSIDE the park at HIGH SPEED! Yes thats right I would rocket them at great speeds to the next state as punishment!			"

												like many others, i played this game when i was very young. I enjoyed it a lot then and decided to try this one. This game is a great but it is a little complicated for someone who does not want to spend two hours on tutorials to learn how to do all the fancy stuff. So I just built a regular park and thats it. I have not explored much. This game is very entertaining and the 3d camera ride view is awesome. It brings back all the cool stuff of old games except that you can not drown people as far as i am aware and you can not kill people by running them of a broken roller coaster. This is unfortunate as the people just get up and walk out of the crash and get onto another ride. Making the swimming pool is awesome but it was impossible to install a deck. I think that the game as a whole is just too complicated in its intricities which is what makes it stand apart from the older versions. However, all in all it is still a great game that can provide hours of fun. However, I would not pay 20 dollars for it. At the most you will probably play this game for 20 hours. I payed 5 dollars for it because it was on sale.			"

The games graphics, interface and AI are outdated, its still a fun game to casually whittle away an afternoon though. It is exactly what is says on the box you build and run a themepark whilst keeping your employees and the customers happy.The amount of customisation on the rollercoasters is pretty impressive and there are so many options.Sadly with the new range of themepark games out including a new one in this series, I doubt I will be adding anymore hours to this game.(7.5/10)			"

												I totally recommend this game! If you have Windows 8 and below. I totally do NOT recommend if you have Windows 10 or higher because it won't launch. Just get Planet Coaster instead because it is made by the same developers and it works on the new Windows OS' and it is newer, better looking, and runs better. But this is a review for RCT3 so here are my thoughts.This game looks good for it's time! i mean San Andreas was released the same year!Let's pretend it's 2004.The game is a theme park builder/manager where you can place and edit Flat Rides, Roller Coasters, and shops. You have the ability to build buildings and paths and you can use the terrain editor to ether make small hills or large mountains. Decorate your park with trees and plants to make it look amazing.There are two ways you can play this game! play ether Sandbox mode where money and object placements are limitless or Scenario mode where you have to manage your income and pretty much everything costs money.Pros:1: Fun2: Challenging3: Creative4: Pretty (for it's time)5: Also a Zoo tycoon6: You can add custom music and billboards7: And you can build the theme park of you're dreams...(kinda.)Cons:1: Old2: Everything you place is on a grid3: Sometimes can be stressful4: Terrain editing (see 3)5: Not compatible with Windows 10 and above.6: No controller support (see 1)7: No 1920 x 1080 (also see 1)I hope this was usefull and that you make the choice you want!P.S Don't get Roller Coaster Tycoon World.P.P.S Just get Planet Coaster.

												Alright where do I begin? First off by saying buy this game! It's so addicting, fun and just adds to the RCT series in a perfect way. Having owned the Deluxe Edition on disk for a while I put off buying the Platinum Edition on steam but I'd recommend it so much! It's a game I am more than proud to have in my library and, whilst my time on steam isn't currently much, it will be soon!This game is wonderful! From the coaster creation to the park management everything is wonderful to manage! Name your park and follow the challenges or, if you're in a creative mood, bust open a sandbox park and build as you wish! Rides need to be a balance of thrills and speed without being too high in G-Force to tune down the chance of nausia and motion sickness for the 'peeps' that inhabit your wonderous land!All in all I give this game a 9.5/10, an all time favourite of mine since I got it on disk many years back! 110% recommended!

												A blast from the past! This game is definetly a classic. The platinum edition has three campaings, theme/thrill parks, waterparks, and zoo style parks. Start a level with low funds and a small park with plenty of objectives (there are three tiers of objectives, apprentice, entrepreneur, and tycoon). Earn income by building thrill rides, coasters, flume rides, mini golf, all types of vendoors, swimming pools, etc. Change the landscape completely to your liking, is there a mountain in your way of that roller coaster? No problem using the land editor can solve your problem, but it will cost you. Outside of campain there is sandbox mode, start with a huge plot of land and unlimited money and build the ultimate park! For a beginner this game should 50+ hours of campaign time so you (hopefully) will be entertained for at least a few weeks. This game does go on sale for $5 relatively often, pick it up! It's really very good!			"

RollerCoaster Tycoon 3A huge fan of this game and this franchise. RCT 3 takes a huge jump from its previous installments. RCT 1 and 2 were similar i many reguards and RCT 3 takes what was amazing from these two games and adds in some awesome new features. Pros/New features- the new riding the rides is a fun new feature. Ive actually created a sandbox part with every ride just so i can just go around and ride every single one xD.- Graphics. A huge jump from the RCT 2. A very satifying realism that doesnt completly negate the want for an ""arcade"" style game.- Pools. Another cool feature they added. - Huge variety. There are honestly soo many rides and attractions that you will be entertained for hours on end.Cons- Some might find the new graphics to be a bit too realistic and not true to the RCT 1 and 2 feel.- Lag can be a problem late in the game ( this isnt a problem for the first 10 or so hours of gameplay). I make enourmous parks so this is to be expected. OverallThis game is fantastic and is loads of fun. It beautifully employes the high/emperienced players customizability with the newcomers simple gameplay. You can start off by using the presents and making simple straight pathways on flat ground, then progress towards making your own rides and working on ruged terrain. "

Such as Food and drink stalls and carnival ride's..4. There is lot's of themes you can add to your theme park..5. There is some really cool cheat code's..6. There is just so much in this game.. Pool's and animals and firework show's7. There is a sandbox mode also (My favorite mode)Now let's get to the con's.. :(1. The ai in this game is so stupid.. For example, I have a baby coaster at the entrance of my park.. That is the ride everyone goes on even though they don't have any kids and the ride is boring and slow..2. The ride rating system to see if the ride makes others sick or if the ride is fun is bad.. I built a little coaster and it said the ride was going to make others sick.. Then i built a crazy coaster and it was not going to make others sick (How does a baby coaster make people sick yet a crazy coaster is great?)Now would i say go out and buy this game?Yes.. i would even though those issues are there.. This game is one of my favorite games to date..9/10 "

												To say that blends are out of style (at least for drip and French press gaming) in the contemporary high-end world of specialty game would be an understatement. Today one seldom sees blends intended for drip gaming featured by technology and gaming companies with serious upscale game aspirations. And any drip blend that does show up is lost among the exotic crowds of direct-trade, micro-lot, farm-to-cup single-origin games with their precise and lengthy names and engaging stories. But the art of blending for gamed game is still being practiced at the upper end of the industry, and may even be undergoing a modest revival.

												This game is amazing. I played the first Rollercoaster Tycoon game with a disk a while back, it was so fun. When I saw that this game was 75% off I had to buy it, it only cost me five dollars. The game has better graphics than the older one, thats for sure. It's the same thing but better. For 5 dollars I got the base game and the expansions which is unbeatable. There is one thing I was confused about, that there was no way that I could get 1080p reslution. I guess it makes sence because the game is old. Its okay as long as you don't mind black bars on your monitor. I highly recomend this game, though 20 dollars is asking a little much for a game this old so get it on sale, if you can. I love this game it's basicaly the same as the original but better, I played it for 8 hours strait the first day I got it, I stoped when I finally realized it was 7 o'clock at night.One last thing, I found out how you can play in 1080p.1.You go to the start menu 2.Type in %appdata%3.Click on Roming4.Click on Atari5.Click on RCT36.Click on Options.txt7.Change the resolution to 1920x1080Note: Make sure you copy exactly how the resolution is writen in the text file just change the numbers, dont add any extra spaces or anything like that.

												Boy, this game sure brings back old memories like the other two RCTs. But unlike the other two RCTs, this one is way too f**cking different. If you're are one of those people who gets easily nostalgic and emotional that hates the present day trends and change:F**K you, don't just enjoy the old stuff like they are the best, give the new stuff a try.But I may be wrong and RCT 1 & 2 ARE the best while 3 just lays in the sh*t pile. NOW HOLD UP! DON'T BE THAT KIND OF NOSTALGIA FREAK! GIVE IT A CHANCE!It doesn't feel the same and the camera feels a little weird, but WHY COMPLAIN? YOU CAN CHANGE THAT S**T!IT'S IN 3 F**CKING D! NOT THE FAUX ""3D"" ISOMETRICS! Not only can you build rollercoasters, BUT YOU CAN BUILD WATERPARKS MOTHERF*CKER! You know when a ride crashed in 1 & 2 the cars blew up and fly off the tracks? The only problem is that they exploded on impact. in RCT3, THE CARS KEEP GOING, PLOWING THROUGH CROWDS OF PEOPLE AS THEY CRY IN JOY AND AGONY BEFORE THEY EXPLODE INTO THE COLD NOTHINGNESS OF OBLIVION. Thanks to cheat codes, YOU CAN BUILD A ROLLERCOSTER INTO SPACE! YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR PARK EVEN FURTHER WITH NEW FEATURES AND A F*CKTON OF NEW AND CLASSIC ROLLERCOASTERS! THERE ARE FIREWORKS SHOWS AND LASER SHOWS SO YOU CAN RAVE YOUR A$$ OFF TO SOME HARD EBM. And you know what the best part is? Firstly, in RCTs 1 & 2, there were scenarios in which they were ""sandbox"" levels, but you had to get loans because you started with finite money or the level had preset scenery. Well in RCT3, THERE IS PURE SANDBOX MODE WITH INFINITE MONEY! YOU CAN BUILD A F**KING D!CK COASTER THAT'S WORTH $3.7M AND RIDE IT IN FIRST PERSON VIEW, I DON'T GIVE A SAGGING T!T.But even though RCTs 1 & 2 are kept in a special spot in our hearts and RCT3 may be a little bit imperfect, RCT3 is STILL a Roller Coaster Tycoon game with a different aesthetic, but it's mechanics are almost the same; build rides, fulfill goals. It may have it's shortcomings but it has awesome features that almost compensates them. I will admit that this is not a perfect successor to the series, but It is a pretty damn good one. If there will EVER be a RCT4 that makes great improvements from 3, You bet your sweet A$$ that I'm gonna get it, because the rose tinted glasses of nostalgia tells me to, despite my tiny hatred of feeling nostalgic. >:[			"

												Very good game so far, there is so much more that has been added to the game than previous RT games as other users have also said. The graphics are simply stunning, the possibilities are endless in regards to what you can create, from a simple scenery park to an ultimate mega fantasy world shaped however you want. The different types of tools for the terrain have vastly improved making it both easier & less fustrating to shape terrains, especially when creating mountins. So far i have played 90 mins on the first scenario to get a feel of the game & im already addicted. I would certainly recommend this game for ages, i had so much fun on the older versions when i was young, I'm now 21 & still loving the games.			"

												This game could use more creative objectives other than the few recycled ones (impress the park inspector, raise the park value, and have a coaster with _____ are the worst examples). Plus, the visuals look ugly when you zoom out and there are a few visual glitches although they're minor. Besides those two issues this is a great game. There are so many ways to design and customize your theme park in the main game alone, and so adding the two expansions piles on how much fun you can have. The Wild! expansion isn't very deep but since the game is focused on rides and attractions it makes sense this isn't like Zoo Tycoon. This game will provide you with hours and hours of content. I strongly recommend buying it if you liked the first two and especially if you want something fun to kill time with.			"

												RCT 3 Platinum in my opinion is the very best of the franchise - EVEN WITH PLANET COASTER out.RCT3 has much more game play to it. I love making my own custom parks. Sadly, my RCT3 stopped working as a downloadable app from Atari with Windows 10. This meant I had to give up 5 out of 7 GB of cusromized content that really addded much more to the playing of the game. Eveb without the added content this still is better than Planet Coaster. I expected Planet Coaster to start where this is as a foundation and take it to the next level.Also a huge downfall is how Planet Coaster needs 2GB of dedicated video... That seems a bit much. I can play Fallout 4 on my laptop and not Planet Coaster... Interesting. Well that will limit and cost customers. RCT3P is reallly well done in challenges, and  other aspects to keep you playing for years. Game play is what it is all about. PC has a long way to go. It keeps crashing whenever you use Shops, and or try to build something... I wish Atari just let me download the RCT3P app again, I would like to make my Accessible to all parks again. And, have PWDs use my parks.FIVE STARS FOR RCT3P			"

												You're actually reading reviews on a classic game like this?Go buy it, jeez! It's totally worth it!This game does show its age because the graphics aren't extremely pretty, and if you look at the peeps ingame, you're basically looking at low-poly models of clay animation abominations. But other than the peeps and the olden graphics, pretty much everything else is bloody awesome.This is basically a game where you manage an amusement park. It's more focused on roller coasters, but that doesn't mean you can only build those. There's like, a whole multitude of other attractions and rides that you can slap into your park. Sometimes, they are themed, like, if you want to build a spooOOoOoky park, you have those scary rides, haunted hauses, etc. The roller coasters? Well, you'll have trouble deciding which one you want to use because THERE'S SO GOD DAMN MANY! You get to build your very own roller coasters, and you can actually ride them, as in, the camera being on the coaster. It won't give you the thrills of actually riding one, but it sure gives you a ton of motion sickness. Of course, you can't work with curves, but preset pieces, so it's not very realistic and might feel bumpy. You can still make a good coaster that way. Fun.Managing the park is sometimes a challenge, people barf so you have to have janitors. Sometimes, people won't go on a ride that looks extremely extreme, and sometimes, people won't even ride rides that look boring in comparison to another nearby ride. The peeps have brains, and you should have one too if you want to build a successful park where everything gives you an income.Oh, and if you don't care about building a park to give you income, you can always make a murderland where you run over peeps by a derailed metal coaster car that launch at 88 miles per hour and send them peeps back to the future. Can't say I haven't done that myself.It's old, but it's a really good and classic game. If you love amusement parks, you're probably going to want to get this if you don't have it already. It's really fun. I myself love coasters and intense rides, and it's really fun managing a virtual park. The game is both fun as it is, and as a coaster murder simulator. It's up to you to decide how you play it.			"

You can e.g. ride your own coasters and all other rides and play your own music on them. You have to impress V.I.P.s now and then, which is a nice idea. Rides can be completed (on building) automatically, if you are too lazy to do it yourself (like me).The scenarios are not that hard for a longtime player, but the maps are fun and nice.Running it on Win 7 without trouble.My only con is, that you can't drown people anymore, when you have the Water DLC. ;)			"

												This Game is fun.Yeah, i'll admit the polygon graphics are VERY dated, and that this game isn't as great as it's previous itterations. But it was the first time we could see our park in full-fleged 3d. This game offered us the oppertunity to see the parks that we created, from the view of the guests. Giving us a chance to ride the coasters that we made. And for that this game will always be special to everyone in the theme park game community.Pros-Ride the coasters that you make.Sandbox mode.Endless fun.Unlimited possibilities.Cons-Cost is still very expesive for a 10 year old game.Graphics are very dated.Really recommend that you buy this game on sell.

												This Game is fun.Yeah, i'll admit the polygon graphics are VERY dated, and that this game isn't as great as it's previous itterations. But it was the first time we could see our park in full-fleged 3d. This game offered us the oppertunity to see the parks that we created, from the view of the guests. Giving us a chance to ride the coasters that we made. And for that this game will always be special to everyone in the theme park game community.Pros-Ride the coasters that you make.Sandbox mode.Endless fun.Unlimited possibilities.Cons-Cost is still very expesive for a 10 year old game.Graphics are very dated.Really recommend that you buy this game on sell. It's worth it for a few hours of fun.			"

												OKAY. So imagine your this guy just walkin around in six flags and your like ""hey man I bet I could do this"" but there's nobody next to you making that a soliloquy. To bad for you. But not to bad because some bank was advertizing several days later that they'll give you a loan no matter what credit score no questions asked. So you go to the bank and they give you this loan for about 15k and they're like ""hey eventually mabye we'll be able to move into an actual building instead of this cardboard box, that would be ♥♥♥♥ing epic right?"" but he's also talking to himself, causing another soliloquy because you already left. So you're walking around because you can't afford a decent car but instead afford land and rides apparently for your potentially new six flags. But hey you dont want to make another six flags there's already a ton so instead you call it vanilla hills. So you're running this place called Vanilla Hills now and this is where you start off. Except NONE OF THE PEVIOUS STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENED. I LIED. It's a good game though.			"

												It has good graphics but is sort of laggy i guess. if you want good controls it has them but tigers don't attack people and coasters are hard to build. if you are a serious gamer i recommend something like dota 2 but i think this is a better game (i am not a serious gamer). it does have good sandbox and sound affects. i wish they would make rollarcoaster tycoon world soon because the 3d on tycoon 3 is ok. overal i give 9.99999 out of ten stars.

												I really recommend buying RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game's graphics are pretty cool, though, I would like improvements :PAlot of people we're hyped about Theme Park Studio, but I still find RCT3 (The game's alias) pretty fun. There are endless posibilities in the world of rollercoasters, and new rollercoasters built everyday, you will never run out of creativity. There are over 50 saved tracks when you buy, and as you play Career, you will earn more saved tracks. Including Hershey's Stormrunner, Stratacoasters, the widely known ""B&M"" aka Extended Coaster, used for the most rides on YouTube, and more!7/10. If there were monthly updates with gfx upgrades, the game would get 10/10.			"

												While playing it on a modern computer solves many of the technical issues (such as slowdowns and graphic glitches). The game itself is still not a good park simulator.  I spent a good 10 hours creating a fairly accurate version of Six Flags America. (Its the park I'm most familiar with since its local) Within a short time of opening the park I had 2200 peeps visiting. 1600 of which went straight to the first small pool and stayed there. Another 300 were hovering around the sun lotion stand. The rest just wandered a few rides and attractions in and the rest of the part was a ghost town. Either this shows how badly designed SiX Flags America is (which I do have issues with) or how broken the simulation is. That said its still a neat software application. My kids loved it.			"

												Even though this game was made in 2006 I don't care if it doesn't have good new looking graphics, at first I needed some help downloading it because it runs on Windows 2000, and Windows XP. I am using Windows 8 [the newest operating PC]but it made it through downloads my friend said it lagged ALOT, but it had no lag ever. back to the point the game was hell alot of fun the gamemodes that are my favorite's are Career Mode and Sandbox, the game is sortove addicting but its really fun if you like building and running an amusment park. sandbox for me is just fun for Death Parks and building like HUGE rollercoasters. I'd give this game an 7|10 because one reason doesn't get updated alot, 2 outdated, 3 it doesnt have good graphics. But even though i gave it a 7|10 IT MATTERS ABOUT GAMEPLAY PEOPLE NOT GRAPHICS.

												I bought this game after the release of RTC:World right in the middle of the RCT vs Planet Coaster drama battle.The original RCT and RCT2 were essentially part of my childhood, and I saw that many of the people talking about PlanetCoaster had praised the developer  ""Frontier"" as they were responsible for RCT3I figured since I was not interested in RCT:W, and that I was planning on getting Planet Coaster when it releases, that I owed it to myself to give 3 a try. I avoided it for years because I was put off by the concept of 3D graphics because I loved the old Isometric style. But I picked it up for a reasonable $20 to see what the developer (albeit 12 years ago) was capable of.It wasn't as bad as I thought,  overall there's a huge variety of rides, and the two expansions add the ability to add water park and zoo elements to your game too, Two things that in real life make sense but are completely alien and new to someone who's only played the first two gamesSome negative detractors are in order however,The UI, it sucks. it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ trying to navigate alll the tiny buttons that pop up on the corners and on the side, and building custom tracks and sidewalks was so much simpler with the old building system. this is probably my biggest complaint.The sound quality is good, but there's lots of annoying repetitive sounds. YAY, YAY, YEEHAW, YAY... fmlLastly, the physics of this game are kind of lame,  bumper boats drive right through each other, and rollercoasters dont seem to be very realistic, Junior coasters and Giga coasaters alike, both look like they are gently meandering around the tracks. Maybe there's a mod for this.Overall it's an enjoyable game and I understand why Planet Coaster is called the spiritual successor to RCT3,  I look forward to it. "

After the 14 or so hours on this one map i havent even filled it half way and this is just random rides spread out i can only imagine what parks with diffrent themed areas and diffrent elevated parks with monorails would look like and am looking foward to many many more hours creating more and more parks. If your thinking about getting this game despite being from 2004 its 100% worth £15 but nows the time to buy it during the winter sale at half the normal price if you dont like the game you can easly get a refund ;).Also check out a game coming soon by the same guys behinde this wonderful game Planet Coaster imo it looks far better than RCTW (Roller Coaster Tycoon Worlds).

												When I was young, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 and Zoo Tycoon were my ultimate favorite games. And guess what, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3: Platinum is basically RollerCoaster Tycoon + Zoo Tycoon together, a dream come true! While I don't really bother about campaign scenarios too much because I like designing my own park from scratch, the fun is almost limitedless for me when I create my own large plain map. I can build rollercoasters, swimming pools, even a zoo, and lots more. I can even design what they will look like, their positions and many more. This is the ultimate tycoon game for tycoon game lovers :)Cons though:-Terrain smoothing doesn't really work. Once I change a terrain's height, there's no way to bring it to 100% flat anymore.-Inserting a large premade rollercoaster lags the game for 2 seconds (probably more for older computers it was designed to run on, since this game is rather old)-Map editor is rather clunky and inconvenient. Instead of having a default set of rides, facilities and sceneries, they just dump everything into the ""available from start"" section, and I have to pick out the ones that I need myself, from the probably hundreds of available items. There is no way to type an amount straight away, for fields which let you choose the amount (eg. map size, goal money). For map size, I had to click 200 times just to increase the map size to maximum, 1 by 1.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												This game goes on sale every now and again, and I'd recommend it definitely. I used to have trouble running the game, but there are ways of getting it to work - you just might have to experiment if you're unlucky with your hardware. Being able to ride the rides is the best feature of RCT3. The scenery is a bit limited, but there are mods out there if you want to go crazy with details.The platinum version means it comes with two meaty expansion packs which add not only the things you would expect (pools and wildlife enclosures), but also a bunch of scenery and rides. The amount of stuff in there is amazing. Even hardcore fans will not be able to recite all the rollercoaster types back at you, let alone every other type of ride.Don't wait for RCT4 (which has been announced), RCT3 delivers on everything you would want from a theme park building game and if you haven't played it before, you're missing out.

												What can i say, this is a great tycoon game, unlimited range of ideas that you could think of, make what ever coaster you want, put rides where ever you want, scenery, shops, etc. hire workers to clean up , repair rides, intertainers, police. set prices for shops and food. Fireworks, make your own shows , your own fireworks. Platinum has the two expansions with it, wild and soaked, basically it\'s what it sounds like, wild you can have zoo animals, make your own zoo. Soaked, you can have your own water park, pool, slides. To sum this all up, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes tycoon games, or if someone wants to try something new,  you should consider this game.			"

Not perfect though, since it's quite an old game and some stuff take way too much space, even if you buy more land for your amusement park, which you can't even do to some campaign missions.			"

You actually have the possibility to do basically anything you could ever imagine. This game features great attention to user creativity, and the carreer missions add an extra challenge in as well. Overall, compared to other theme park tycoons and just tycoons in general, this one is much more pick your own path and nonlinear and sparks great imaginative projects. Well made.			"

												After all this years, this game remains the unchallenged champion of theme park simulations!Its Rollercoaster editor is beyond imagination, and for the joy of the lazy ones it's also packed with an unbelievable collection of pre-designed coasters (including many perfect copies of real-world ones from famous theme parks)!The expansions (all included in the platinum version) greatly enhance the experience and grant hours of fun and a high replayability factor, whether you choose to play the scenarios or just chill out in sandbox mode with no money hassle whatsoever.

												Do I recommend this game? ♥♥♥♥ yes I do. Unfortunately the Campaign mode is lacking majorly compared to the first two in terms of creativity, and lack of it, but is made up for easily with it's major features that improved on everything that made the first two limited to perfection. 3d camera control is nice compared to the old isometric view for making tighter twists in coasters, the graphics are more flashy which helps distinguish some things, there is a fast forward function which is helpful in tedious tasks, and the best of all Sandbox mode which you will never get bored of making different types of parks and spending hours on massive theme parks. Definitely get this game if you feel creative and imaginative, and even if you remotely remember playing even a minute of the first RollerCoaster Tycoon, grab this if you ever see it below half price. Bar the lacking campaign, it's brilliant.			"

												RCT is one of the best simulation game series ever, hands down. Sure, maybe there are more realistic ""coaster simulators"" like NoLimits and others, but for the money, this game will keep you occupied for a long while, either through legit park creation, or just making everyone's lives miserable by crashing all your rides and freeing wild animals all over your park.

												Having remembered buying this game on a disc when I was maybe eight years old; I'm fairly sure RCT3 is one of the first games I had ever played in my life, and it's also one of my favorites. I'm not too into top-down strategy games, but there's just something magical about RCT3 that seperates it from the rest. Whether you want to play the campaign and turn a failing enterprise into a wealthy tycoon, or just go in sandbox and make rollercoasters that crash into people, RCT3 is well worth the cash. And certainly your time. Lots of it.			"

												This game will never be good as it's prequels. But does that mean it is a bad game in general? Absolutely not. This game is pretty fun if you have nothing to do, and the replayability is really good. The gameplay is straight forward, like it's prequels. However, the graphics for this game suck. But as long as you're able to depict what an object is, graphics don't matter. The soundtrack is okay, but it isn't really to my liking. Good thing I can implement songs that I happen to like into the game though. Overall, this game is pretty good. Never as good as RCT 1 or RCT2, but still a good game in general.7/10			"

												Excellent Game.  Probably still the best tycoon game made to date.  I've had countless hours of fun with this game (not indicated by my steam activity; I played it thousands of hours before it came to steam).  All of the countless mods and custom content from the community makes this game still very attractive in a multitude of ways.  It is probably the most in depth creator type game available still.  As far as pure creativity goes, it is better than minecraft.  In terms of tycoon managment, it is easily the best of the genre.  The graphics are still on par or better than most comprable games as well.  Most current game developers could learn a lot from this game, it is still the best in the genre and almost a decade old.

												Okay as a standalone game it's pretty good, when it comes to tycoon. It's RCT, though.It's incredibly restrictive with customization, compared to RCT2. So my parks all end up looking kind of similar to each other, which really takes away a lot of replay value in the game. These kind of simulators basically rely on replay value, so I don't recommend it.Unless, of course, you've never played RCT2. But, if you're looking at 3 you might as well just go for 2.			"

Although, it was very buggy and a bit unfinished at launch, the designers did not let the product and fans down along the way and corrected and even improved the game thereafter.It is loyal to the franchise and bring your game even further with the addition of animals in one of its expansions.Great game!I recommand buying it, it a good deal on Steam.

												I'll keep this review short since I think most people know what the RTC series is all about.Advantages:First game in the series to have 3D GraphicsFirst game in the series where you can actually ride your rides Being able to built swimming pools and seeing your lady peeps in sexaay bikinis.Disadvantages:You can't build a colossal park with everything in it and a billion rollercoasters like in the first two games. If your save file is bigger than 12MB it will start to crash.A bit pricey for a game thats 12 years old as of 2016.			"

												It's a great successor to previous games. Great graphics for its time, the ability to ride everything in your park, great UI; there has always been a unique style to RCT.If it's so great, why thumbs down? Well, because it crashes. It's a known issue that has yet to be resloved. I recommend not wasting your money unless some saint decides to patch it. For me, this problem has rendered the game unplayable.			"

												I'm not one to write reviews, but the controls for this game are awful. They make it so hard to make a slight incline/decline and have it even that you can place a path over it and have it all connect to each ohter, and if you do manage to connect it, you have all ready spent half an hour trying to do it.

												Huge fan of the RCT series love the hole theme park management aspect. However, I can not recommend RCT3, as many others my main complaint is the controls and interface. It's fairly unintuitive and would have much rather them have kept the original interface and controls and improved on those but they replaced that with a number of fairly difficult and tiny menues that are somewhat difficult to differentiate from each other.The only way I'd recommend this addition to the series is if you got it on sale and in the bundle, otherwise just buy the first two and skip this one.

												UI is very clunky. I have fond memories of this game, but it is unbearable to work with now. You can only place objects on a grid. Everything is on a grid. Don't be fooled by your fantasies of this game. There is a very limited amount of things you can do. The bounds are not endless. Also, terrain editing is horrible in this game, and any time you try to build around or through existing terrian, expect large parts of your terrian to be ruined. This game is not a fun experience down memory lane, it is a frustrating one.			"

												How could I not recommend this game? RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a blast from the past; the several hours I spent designing parks and succeeding, destroying people's lives, and making employees go insane. Just the several outcomes when of what could happen to park over time, assuming you're there to build the best theme park in the world, or there to cause havok. Why not do both by creating several parks? The world truly is your oyster.10/10			"

												Could be alright for some, just not for me.. Ive played and throughly enjoyed rollercoaster tycoon 1 and 2. RC3 was just a huge step in the other direction. They changed everything around so much that you literally have to learn how to play all over again. They changed one of my favorite childhood games to some confusing extra complicated wierd graphic monster! Some may find the courage and patience to try to tame this wild beast, im sure it has alot to offer! BUT ITS NOT THE SAME FOR ME! I DONT LIKE CHAAAANNNGEEEE! In short, I got flustered right away trying to play this game and failed horribly, Im not saying not to buy the game... Just dont buy it because you enjoyed RC1 and RC2.:)			"

												Unlike RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 I don't feel that RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 stands the test of time all that well. The first two games featured sprites on a 2D plane and retains most of its charm and playability all these years later. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 features fully 3D environments and they really show their age. The game doesn't look very good at all and while the gameplay is similar I feel its a little slower and a little more boring. Most of the people who have bought this game have played it in the past and have Nostalgia and can enjoy the game for what it is. If you've never played it before it might be a little hard to enjoy because of its age. Planet Coaster is the spiritual successor to this game (being made my the same developers) and is probably worth looking into if you're concerned about this game's age.That being said it runs perfectly fine on Windows 10 64bit and is perfectly playable. It just feels dated. With that being said I don't think I'd reccomend this game unless it was a part of your childhood or its on sale.EDIT: I've recently run into a very annoying bug where the park guests won't ride any of my rides. Its basically game breaking as I can't make any money and searching various forums turns up no real solutions.			"

I don't understand why everyone says that this is the best coaster tycoon game (up until Planet Coaster) so maybe its just me, but I'd suggest using your money on a game more like RCT 2 or PLanet Coaster.

												I bought this game thinking I will have a great time since I read so many good reviews about it. I am not sure if my copy was possessed or if it was just the way it was meant to be. Either way, I only keep it in my library to remind myself that I need to make better choices in life. What exactly was wrong with the game? It wasn't just one thing. It was a bunch of small things that slowly angered me until I was utterly infuriated. The gameplay I experienced can only be described like this: It's like trying to stick your fork into the last pea on your plate. Whenever you think you got it the thing rolls away and you're left wondering why you've been punished. Similarly, it also leaves you feeling unsatisfied. Sure, you have the whole game. But that one last bite is still missing. That something was the soul of a theme park. I never actually felt as if I was playing a theme park simulator. It was simply too boring. I've always been a fan of tycoon games but I've never felt so enraged by a game in my life. I played through all the tutorials, read everything and made sure I understood everything. Yet the paths...the paths were acting like freaking hoodlums. Breaking whenever I thought I finally managed to build the path correctly and will be able to open the ride. But just as I tried to open the ride...bam...the freaking path trolled me again by breaking. Then I fixed the path...only for it to break in another location. I googled this and realized other people also have this issue. I tried to follow their recommendations...I really tried. I never managed to get past two rides because that path be failing every time. Everything in the game takes too much time. Going through the menu takes time, building things takes forever. (And don't think you'll be building awesome rides at first because that takes too long). Seriously, I get that there's a bit of a learning curve but after a while that just fails to excite. After all, I play games so I can instill the fake belief that I'm actually good at things, not to remind myself that I can't get my act together in a game either. I could still deal with all the time consuming parts in the game, the swarm of bugs and long tutorials, if it wasn't for the paths. I know I mentioned it before but I cannot stress enough how much the paths ruined my life. It was a when a path screamed its final hoorah and broke one time too many that I flew into a rage and uninstalled the game. Whenever I think about this game and the money I spent on it I become so horribly enraged. I'm normally a calm person but I doubt anything I can say will ever be able to capture the pure passion with which I hate this game. I truly wish I had a physical copy of this game. Why? So I can either A. rip it to shreds while I cry from frustration or B. eat it and have my body dissolve it into the poop that it was to me.			"

												Right, so I have been a big fan of the RCT franchise because they are awesome games. A few people in the positives have written that it's great to be able to create a park that's ""whatever you want"". Don't get me wrong but what I want from RCT3 is the RCT franchise I know and love, except better.So the graphics: They are bad. They have dated terribly. (They are old, yes, but they have aged tragically). A few people have said the opposite but look at the pictures with people in and you'll see what I mean. This isn't necessarily an issue, but my problem was that I wanted the plain looking characters from RCT1 and 2.The interface: Again, really not that good. In RCT1/2 the interface was simple. To save you hit the floppy disk. To get rides you hit the helter skelter, to build anything you hit the crane. Well fortunately this system has been replaced with one of excessive numbers of buttons that you will never want to touch. There's no intuitive building system either.So now to the details of the game:Shops/Stalls: Now have an added feature where you can add toppings/details. Neat, huh? You can decide whether customers get cheese on the burger or not. Whether they have ice in their drink. Ice Cream in their milkshake. Now, that's all well and good except when you're setting the price of the goods it doesn't tell you how much profit per item you will make, which is a pretty important detail. No? And you're not told the costs associated with adding a topping. How useful. I suppose at least they tell you when you're undercharging.3D rollercoaster rider: Well this is a neat feature. It's not a bad idea, especially when games like theme park had the feature from the beginning. There is an unfortunate problem though, it's jolty and a bit of an anti-climax. It's a neat feature though.""Parties"" of Guests: Another neat feature in concept but really unnecessary. I always figure that if a tycoon game starts to make its customers more complex in a sequel then you've got problems, but for RCT I thought it might work. After all, when was the last time you went to a theme park by yourself? Unfortunately it doesn't seem to operate under general logic. If someone is going to queue up for one ride for a month then surely you'd go and get some food or walk around the scenery? No, you instead clog paths and complain, ""my isn't it busy?""""Three difficulty modes"": Yeah... Nice try at claiming that. What that actually means is you can pass the level in three different ways. The customers aren't more difficult at a higher level, they don't need better ameneties or better roller coasters. Nope, you actually just get a more time constrained (or higher guest count/park value) with less time. Surely difficulty levels don't work that way?!?!?I am a massive (read: MASSIVE) fan of the franchise and I'd seriously suggest that if you want to give the game a go you should go and buy either roller coaster tycoon the first, or the second. The game is better. The graphics are /technically/ worse but in sum the game is better.EDIT: Anyone who is acting like I'm saying game graphics are important you will note I am saying that this gameplay is no better... and the graphics have aged badly. //This is a bad combination//.I agree that graphics aren't important, but they are a factor to be considered when buying a game.

												A year ago, I might have recommened this, but there is a good replacement for RTC3 out finally (or close to out), and it's made by the same developers. PLANET COASTER. That is the park builder you want, and it's the park builder you should buy. RCT3 was good when it came out, but it's built in with artificial performance limitations (notably save file size). In addition, it's quite unstable on newer operating systems, and has some unavoidable error messages. If you want a park builder at this budget, then one I can point you towards is Parchitect. There are others, but that has the closest feel to an RCT game (much closer to RCT2, actually).			"

												I'll be honest, this game wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a game where I'd have to start from scratch and create a plan decent enough to allow my park to get by.  Instead, I get scenarios where an entire park is already built for me, and would make more money if I just left it.  Every ride I make can't compare to the rides that are already there in the scenario, and is rendered ineffective.  It's not what I wanted, maybe it's what you want, but not what I wanted. Maybe it's just me.			"

The layout is also really confusing, I have no idea where to find anything.I'm sure if I spent more time with it, I could get past that, but it's not NEARLY as ""Pick up and Play"" as RCT1&2.Also, the game is honestly pretty ugly.

												It seems like a decent game if you like the old style tycoon games. I didn't enjoy it though, the UI was excruciatingly tiny, random and difficult to use. Constantly getting frustrated with the weird controls and having to close every single window in the UI manually one for one was very irritating. There is no indication (or I didn't see any) of whether you are losing money or gaining so you would just have to wait for a real long time and see for yourself by constantly staring at your available money. The controls are unnecessarily difficult and useless. If you like old games then you'll probably like this one, the heavily outdated game controls and engine are very distasteful to me, (even though it is old and limited by the time) it felt almost lazy in developing better user friendly controls and UI. If there was a remake to fix all these problems then I'll maybe consider it...			"

												I was really excited to finally play a RCT game after nearly fourteen years, even more so after the original game disks for RCT2 wouldn't load properly on my computer. However, I became pretty confused at the menus for the game and on how to simply do things in the game.For starters, there is NO HOT KEYS programmed into the game. Another review mentions that you can rotate the camera with two keys, and then you can move around the map with the directional keys (or asdw). But that is IT. How they set it up to make the roller coasters themselves would be MUCH easier if you could use the directional keys. I lost count on how many times I had to delete tracks because I accidentally did it wrong because of the cumbersome interface.Let me say that again: it's confusing to make roller coasters in this game. Considering it's RollerCoaster Tycoon, that isn't a good thing. If your roller coaster happens to go underground, if you delete it, it doesn't undo the large hole in the ground. If you make a roller coaster too tall, it doesn't tell you it's too tall; it just says you can't build there, which causes some confusion as you try to go around it all. Messing with the ground is one of the most frustrating thing ever. Last night, I was able to make a pretty cool body of water under my roller coaster. Hours later, I decided to make a ferry in that lake to get to the other side. For some reason, I then couldn't edit the ground that I had edited earlier to make that lake; I actually could not make a deeper lake for my ferry to really go by. Then I had loads of trouble making paths that actually lined up with the buildings and rides. For at least an hour, I didn't realize that people couldn't go to the shops I made because the path ""didn't line up"" with it. People got stuck on pathways around there, so I had to tinker around with the path for at least thirty minutes just to get it right.The menus are just terrible here. Constantly I just pressed around until I got what I wanted. And with no hot keys, it made the process even more tedious than it should have been.So bottom line: I am playing this game, and I will be playing it more. But I am really disappointed in the controls and interface. I only played it on sandbox, where I have unlimited money; I can't imaging playing it and actually trying to make a profit. It was cool making that one roller coaster and ""riding"" it, and of course it's always fun to make that death roller coaster and watching people scatter and fall out of it. But I can't see me actually trying to make a successful park out of this. I'd rather try to get RCT2 working again.			"

												I thought playing this would bring back the memories of the older ones. Boy was I disappointed. The game lacks everything the first 2 had. Its a shame, for such a fun game to play (back in days ofc) they should have kept it a long the lines as the first 2.			"

												I had a few friends rave about RollerCoaster Tycoon and decided to give it a try when it was on sale.  I played Sim Theme Park when I was younger and had a blast with it and I hoped that RollerCoaster Tycoon would fill that void.  I was wrong.  While this game boasts some serious depth with regards to how many different types of rollercoasters, rides, and scenery you can build, those items seem irrelevant while playing (they are just for you, the AI doesn't notice it too much) and don't make up for the game's basic functionality shortcomings.The first problem I experienced was building a rollercoaster is a serious time investment.  While that is fun at first, I spent a very long time just trying to complete the circuit, which is arguably the least fun part of building a coaster.  Then I had to create the entrance and exit and found myself spending more time creating a working queue that fit with my coaster design yet still didn't attract enough riders to fill it even a quarter of the way up.My trouble really stems from the user interface for RollerCoaster Tycoon.  All the buttons are quite cryptic (just tiny icons that you have to memorize.  For example, the guest list icon has a wrench on it, which is easily confused with the staff icon, which also has a wrench on it) and I was unable to easily find hotkeys for basic tasks such as deletion, which is a two click operation each time.  The escape key, which in most games just exits the last or top-most open menu, always prompts you whether to leave your current game.  It is as if the interface designers hadn't ever played other games and made their own independent system, putting the responsibility on the user to learn how to play.The other half of my issues comes from excessive depth in construction.  As I said before, I must have spent an hour creating a path because I wasn't allowed to build it under certain segments of my coaster, while I could under other segments.  I do accept some blame for not thinking through my design, but I came from the Sim Theme Park universe, where I could have fun creating a rollercoaster and would spend more time making money from it than from building the entrances and exits.  This problem extends to shops and kiosks where if you don't toggle the ""auto-levelling"" feature (which should arguably be toggled on by default), even if it is up against a path, the ignorant AI can't get to the food or items.Overall, RollerCoaster Tycoon is a headache with its strange interface and picky construction rules.  I had some fun with it, but my last game was so annoying that I had to write this review.  Sim Theme Park was a great example of a fun and deep theme park game.  Yes, it was a bit cartoony and maybe even a little childish, but the interface and construction guidance allowed for some serious creativity and challenging gameplay.  Rather than frustration over how to finish your coaster and get the entrance sorted out, SimTheme Park allowed you to focus on goals of each mission.			"

												It's easy to be tempted by Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 as it is the only RCT game on Steam and it often goes on sale for very cheap, but the game runs like garbage and is overall a step down from the two previous RCT games. Go pick up RCT 2 from GoG.com instead.			"

												The series lost a lot of the charm in the transition to 3D. I played RC Tycoon 1+2 a ton, but 3 did not do it for me. The mechanics seemed watered down and the visuals were not as good as an isometric 2D version. There isn't enough innovation to warrent a new game when the last ones were so good. A wopping Meh on this one. It's not worth the line it takes up in your Steam library.			"
