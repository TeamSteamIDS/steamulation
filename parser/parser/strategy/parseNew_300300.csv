												Ichi is a simple looking puzzle game where you guide a yellow ball through a maze with the goal to pass through all the gates before you die.  The simple conceit is that you control the maze with only a left-click of the mouse.There are various elements in the maze, blue triangles that reflect the ball 90° red triangles that also reflect the ball 90° but also rotate 90° with each mouse click, another sort of triangle that can be turned invisible at a click allowing the ball to pass through, objects that are destroyed after a single hit, teleporters, switches and splitters that spit out 2 balls for twice the fun!  Every click will change the state of the maze, you can't set and forget, you have to constantly adjust and watch the ball like a hawk.Though the most important tool is if you click and hold the mouse, you can draw a single use short grey wall where the ball is currently traveling.  As you get to the higher level puzzles you will have to reflect the ball multiple times a level to succeed.  Whether it's a bug or intended, there is a small but noticeable delay from when you click and hold and where the wall starts and this will have to be taken into account.The graphics are quite good, the game is presented as though drawn in pen on graph paper though the mobile origins are obvious, giant buttons!  Levels range from simplistic to quite challenging and you receive a grade from A to C based on the number of moves, clicks, you make.  There is also an easy to use editor and an inbuilt publish and rate system with more that 20000 levels available online!While there are only 60 official levels, there probably should have been more, in the release and you'll probably be done with those in 2-3 hours, this is a fantastic little puzzler presented with style that's very worthy your time.

												The game itself is great. It's a casual puzzle game where you control everything with one button. A ball slowly bounces around the level, and you must control reflectors and draw lines to make the ball hit every circle in the level. The line-drawing technique is especially cool, as it requires you to predict where the ball would bounce into unfavorable places (like spikes) and preemptively direct the ball to cut off its own future path with a line which will later bounce it back to safety.The levels are simple and clever, but not mind-bending. It is a slow-paced, relaxing puzzle game.So what’s with the thumbs-down?The game is heavily focused on the level-sharing aspect, somewhat like Mario Maker. There are only 60 built-in levels, and the game advertises “tens of thousands more” levels on the title screen. 100% completionists will also find this an important part of the game, since one achievement requires having 100 other people play levels you create. There’s also a very long achievement for accruing 1,000 points, where you are only awarded one point per unique level you complete, and one for each unique click someone else gives on your levels. The only way to speed up this process is to create popular levels that a lot of people click on.95% of levels are empty rooms that instantly solve themselves. This is because everyone’s farming for clickbait for the achievements. Thanks to the fact that the player only gets a point if they beat a level, but the creator gets a point for every clickthrough, these are the only types of levels that ever get created, because they’re the only ones that get played. Puzzles that don’t look empty on the thumbnail might not even get clicked on at all. Want to browse the levels for some gems? Too bad, discoverability is abysmal: you can only view ten levels at a time, and it always returns to page 1 at the completion of any level. (Seriously?!) Levels can be tagged, but you can’t search by tags, only by ratings and popularity. Basically, if you don’t have level codes on hand from someone’s forum post or something, you’re stuck slowly paging through thousands of levels by ten at a time, then returning to page 1 after playing one.My biggest gripe, and the main reason for the thumbs-down, is that the level editor is far, far, far too glitchy to be acceptable. To give you an idea: placing 3 teleporters in a level will prevent you from placing any teleporters in any levels until the program is restarted. Dragging a red reflector off the screen will not delete the reflector, but just make it invisible until the level is saved and reloaded – its collision box will remain and block the way of anything else you try and place. Spike objects frequently become completely locked, unable to be moved or deleted, until the level is saved and reloaded. And that’s not even getting into all the bugs with the level-testing feature, some of which will cause the ball to spawn in the wrong place or randomly take away your line-drawing power. This all amounts to a royal frustration for even the shortest of level editing sessions (unless, of course, you're just making empty rooms that instantly solve themselves)If the editor issues were fixed, I’d easily change my verdict to a thumbs-up, but sadly there doesn’t seem to be a patch in sight. Seems the developers no longer care.If you’re not an achievement hunter or you’re otherwise just interested in the 60 campaign levels, I wholeheartedly recommend this as a short, clever, refreshing puzzle game. But the level-sharing system is simply not worth the trouble to get involved with. And that’s a shame, because it’s supposed to be the centerpiece of the game.			"

												Ichi is a fun little puzzler that shines all in the right ways. No doubt, a pencil like written board and little touches of pencil eraser make you feel like you are playing on the notebook at break time between classes back in the school years. It is a game meant for all those players who loves a chill out at evening with a puzzle game. The game keeps you addicted and the feel of paper background makes the game just the best. It is a one button to click kind of game that requires quick finger and a good reaction. I find it to be an incredibly charming game with well designed puzzles. It is a simple enough at first, but gets more challenging as it progresses. The first few levels are simple and easy, but as you progresses the levels become tough and difficult. You control a ball that travels round the screen and it must bounce off against the walls and triangle objects that are placed all around the board. The triangles can be interacted easily with the tap of a screen. The ultimate goal is to collect all circular objects with the less taps as possible. To finish a level you need to manipulate objects on the board through tapping, like rotating triangles, toggling buttons, drawing temporarily walls and so on. How well you finished a level determined by a grading scale where A is obviously the best completion grade, like in school. If you don't like the inbuilt levels of the game or you have an idea for genius level, you can create and share the custom level. It is easy and simple to use the editor. Custom levels created in number of thousands make the game endlessly playable. I would recommend getting this game. It is great and deserves a chance for everyone.			"

												Ichi's blueprint philosophy extends into the design beyond the colorful and inviting crayon aesthetic. While it comes packed with 60 premade levels for you to complete, these are merely a teaser for the main course that is making and playing user created levels. It's a one touch game with more depth than it gives itself credit for, but is simple enough to be instantly understandable to anyone that gives it a go.As I said, Ichi is a puzzle game that relies on a single touch to interact with the various mechanics within levels, with the goal being to bounce your ball around the screen collecting all the dots without running into spikes or getting overzealous with your taps (which will earn you a lower grade). The items you control start off simply, with triangles that rotate or disappear with a touch, but then evolve into more complex tools from switches to portals and various others which add upon each other to make puzzles more complex and engaging. Despite this, my biggest issue with Ichi is that all the developer made levels are surprisingly easy, to where I rarely felt any challenge from them up to the very end. Ultimately they act more like a tutorial to the user generated levels than something to fill a game with in their own right.Thankfully, with already 20,000+ created and more popping up every day, there are tons and tons of absolutely brilliant user created puzzles that will give you a far greater challenge if you want it. A handy tagging and rating system makes sorting through them easier than you'd expect, and a simple (if slightly over restrictive) editor allows you to forge your own puzzles should you feel no one has made one that's just quite right for you yet. It took a long time to get here, but in the end Ichi is just as much fun as it was when I first played it ages ago long before it managed to get on Steam, and can recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in an immensely easy to put up and hard to put down puzzler.

												Rather unsatisfying, simplistic little puzzler.About 2 hours in and having completed (with an ""A"" grade) almost all of the 60 official levels in the game, I've yet to find a single one of them even remotely challenging (and therefore rewarding) to figure out. And yet, I still feel like those levels have taken far longer than they should have to complete, for two reasons;First, because the pace of gameplay is so gratingly slow. The level starts, and within a few seconds it's pretty clear how to solve it - and you are left for several minutes just watching the ball crawl its way back and forth across the level before you can move on. Worse, maybe you overlooked something, and need to make a minor change to the sequence in which you collect the circles - so you must start again, and crawl your way along the same path again... This sense of boredom is only made worse by the extreme simplicity of the graphics, with the result that every level looks so similar as to barely be distinguishable.The second, and probably more significant problem, is the control system. Having been designed entirely around touchscreen support, they are an overly simplistic ""left-click-anywhere-does-everything"" affair, with no alternate or rebinding options. It wouldn't seem like a big deal, as the game mechanics are so limited - and, as far as rotating and activating or deactivating bumpers, if you've got a smoothly functioning mouse there's no real problem. The second control mechanic of drawing lines, however, becomes unnecessarily clumsy with these controls. If, for example, you need to turn a bumper then immediately draw a line, or vice-versa, this imprecision can easily trip you up and force you to restart the level - taking us back to problem #1.Overall - as a lover of puzzle games, I became so bored as to find playing the game a chore after less than 2 hours of gameplay - which in any case, was enough to grind through almost all of the levels. Unless it's 95% off, I'd recommend avoiding this one.			"

												Ichi is a very simple, puzzle game. There are sixty different levels to solve, as well as community created content. They range from very easy to very challenging, depending on how much experience you have in this game genre.The abilIty to create your own levels to share with the world is, like most games that have this feature, often abused. This makes the search for fun, challenging levels a bit difficult at times. Though most of the time you will be able to find easier puzzles, once you work your way past the all of the empty levels. It's not really much of a problem, just a little annoying.The music can get very repetitive, very quickly. The good news is there is a mute button, so if you don't enjoy it, you can just shut it off.I really enjoyed this game, and would recommend picking it up anytime. It's already cheap, so you don't even have to worry about getting it on sale.			"

												Ichi is a little ""pong"" puzzle sandbox game developed by a small Dutch indie studio.The look and feel of this game is quite good. There are 2-3 endless music loops, with trumpet, flute, strings, piano and guitar During gameplay you have rotateable or switchable triangle bumpers to change the direction of the quick moving ""pong"" ball. On walls the ball is reflected except if they have spikes - then you die. Another interesting elements are a divider, switches or swirl portals. A special ability is to draw a grey reflect line per left mouse hold which is useable once. The main purpose of the game is to collect all yellow coins in a level without dying. That's all. In the standard levels you have also a bonus  for minimum use of actions.But then you'll find the level creator and begin to generate your own puzzles. After you published them, they can be played by other players, rated, tagged and you earn each time a gamepoint your level is played. So try to make popular puzzles. Unfortunately the game points are highly neccessary to reach at least the 1000 points achievement. It's a real grinder.You must play or generate tons of rubbish empty levels to get this last achievement. The base game should you take 5 hours of playing but the further point collection bind you even longer. I needed over 30 hours. One small tip: You can change your game resolution if you press ALT+Shift on startup.			"

												If there's a simple yet challenging puzzle game, it's Ichi. The gameplay only revolves around rotating 'bumpers', so you can collect all items in a level (the objective). If you can rotate just enough, you'll earn better scores. A being the best and you can achieve every level with allotted rotations. There are sixty basic levels included in the game.The game also supports workshop, so you can download user made levels for more challenges. The workshop has no regulation, though, so you can literally upload broken levels and/or spam.Note about buying price: The game's been on bundle multiple times already. According to Enhanced Steam it's been 9 times, so there are bound to be keys floating around for cheap. Check Steamtrades.All in all, recommended little puzzle game. 7.5/10			"

												Awesome little puzzle game. Like advertised: easy to play, but damn it can get twist your brain in a knot. The goal is to collect all yellow rings in the level with an orb that bounces around automatically. The levels included gradually increase in difficulty, adding new elements and teaching you new tactics each time. When you're finally done with those, the game also includes a level editor to build your own puzzles. If creating puzzles yourself isn't really your thing (I know I'm terrible at it...) you can play the creations of other players. Right now, there are over 20.000 (!!!) puzzles made by players, so you don't have to worry about this game's replay value.			"

												A game bearing my nickname can only be that good.Jokes aside,this is a sympathic puzzle game. The game itself has a really simple gameplay; a ball is bouncing on some angles that you can rotate; the goal is to collect every yellow circles without dying from spikes (generally put on the border of the levels). Like some classic android games, you earn a rank going from A to C, depending of the number of rotations you take.Graphically, this game is simplist, there's not really much to say about that: musics though, can really get repetitive and boring after a moment. Whatever, this is a puzzle game anyway.Buy if you like me, my nickname, or if you simply enjoy those kinds of puzzle games.			"

												I really enjoy puzzle games that you can play for a set period of time and go back to later, like Kami and Toki Tori 2+. Ichi easily falls into the fun, but challenging puzzler category.If you like ""simple"" puzzle mechanics (move the ball to pass through all points) that progressively get harder, then you should really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are nice and simple and make me think of Ballpoint Universe because the background looks like blueprints drawn on grid paper. The music is nice and cheerful, however, I listen to my own music while I play. The controls are very simple (mouse only) and instructions are given whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The learning curve is minimal, however, the levels get very challenging, and obtaining an ""A"" grade for each level can be extremely difficult when you reach the later levels.In Ichi, your goal is to get a ball to pass through a number of points, in as few moves as possible. Initially, all you have to do is manipulate triangles by click the mouse, causing them to rotate - and change the trajectory of the ball when it comes in contact. Spike hazards on the walls are introduced, and you will see new mechanics like the ability to toggle solid triangles with a mouse click, or even drawing lines on the board to change where the ball will go.You can also create your own levels and play others', greatly adding to the playability.The game is a great time puzzler and I've added it to my time fillers between games (or just when I want some down time), alongside KAMI. Very good, challenging puzzle game, grab it if you are interested.Recommend!			"

												I love puzzle games and there are a lot of puzzle games available on steam, from big to small, from serious to casual and many of them are really great and really fun. Unfortunately, Ichi isn't one of them. There are three fundamental traits that make a puzzle game great. One of them is that if you can think it, you should be able to do it. That is, once you figure out the solution, the implementation shouldn't be too hard. There lies the main flaw of this game. The puzzles are pretty straight forward to figure out. In fact they are way too easy. But the problem is implementing the solution. It requires perfect timing and at this point Ichi ceases to be a puzzle game and starts to be a reaction / timing game. That is, you have to rotate an object at the exact right time in order to solve the ""puzzle"". It's not a bad thing per se but I was promised a puzzle game and  I bought this game in hope of solving puzzles. Puzzles are supposed to make you think. And in this regard, Ichi doesn't scratch my itch. Puzzles are too easy to be called puzzles. To sum up, if you like playing reaction/timing games where you have to do things such as press a button at the correct time in order to advance, then you will like this game. But if you actually want to solve puzzles, you have to look elsewhere.			"

												A very simplistic puzzle game that is both fun and challenging. The goal of the game is to collect one or more yellow circles, and to achieve this you must guide a yellow ""laser"" using a single button to turn and flip tilted walls. Sounds simple, but by adding elements like spikes, buttons and portals to the mix, there are enough ingredients to make for a good brain teaser.The 60 included puzzles are all well designed and interesting but don't take more than a couple of hours to solve with an A rating if you're above average at puzzle solving. There are more than 20.000 user created puzzles though, and even if most of them might be rubbish, you can sort them by popularity and easily have enough content to keep you entertained until you tire of the concept.And the puzzle editor is good and intuitive, so there's additional fun in coming up with your own levels if you're of the creative type.

												Great one-button puzzle game! The objective is to collect all the golden rings. It starts pretty easy with objects in the game being introduced as you go through the levels. It gets harder as the puzzle gets more objects into play. It currently has 60 levels.It includes a level editor so that you can create and publish your own levels. You can also play more levels published by other players. This feature is what makes this game really good but they really should improve the interface because more levels are being contributed. We should be able to filter which levels we have already cleared. It is getting hard for new levels to get popular because they are easily pushed to another page by blank and rubbish levels that solve themselves without you doing anything.With more than 35000 levels its not easy to run out of puzzles to solve!

												Ichi is a minimalistic one-button puzzle game. While normally ""indie puzzle game"", ""minimalistic"", and ""one-button"" aren't good signs to me, Ichi manages to both be a good core idea and really bring out the potential of that idea to the fullest, making it simple enough to pick up instantly but surprisingly challenging and brain-twisting at times.$5 might seem a bit steep given the simplicity, and I'm not sure of the point of it coming in a two-pack at all, but it is actually a solidly-made game and easily worth the cost. Plus, if you end up really loving it, you're not going to run out of things to do in it - there's over 21,000 user-made levels even after you beat the 60 that ship with the game.(Note: I beat all but one of the premade levels back before this game was on Steam and haven't really been interested in playing it again, hence my relative lack of achievements/playtime here. I still recommend it, though.)			"

												ichi is a simple but quit addicting puzzle game with a ""crayon"" graphic style where you need to take a yellow ball to her destination in a total mazepros:-a good number of premade levels -intersting gameplay mechanics (some elements can rotate,some can disapear, and some can teleport the ball into another location and the level and all this can happen at the same time)-there is a level editor s yo can create you custom chaotic level-you can play other people level (and there are some really well designed ones)cons:-the difficulty of premade levels is not linear so you can get tottaly chaotic levels and just efter it some really easy ones.-the level editor is very limitedso that's it for ichi if you love puzzle games it's woth the price but if not i would recomend to buy it when it's on sale.

												I've almost reached the 50% mark in the standard-play levels of Ichi. I really love this game, it's simple yet puzzling at the same time. Your goal is simple, guide a yellow dot to meet all the yellow rings throughout the level. But you don't take control of the dot, you command the objects within the level.I've only discovered six ""commands""/""action objects"" so far, red turning triangles, yellow portals, disappearing & reappearing blue triangles, the black splitter, the block that allows you to bounce off it, and the ability to draw a line. The former 5 are blatantly visible, the 6th is up to you. Once you discover that feature, remember it. It'll help you complete levels. I've cleared four more levels in Ichi than what I previously completed yesterday. Yesterday, I remember thinking, ""HOW CAN YOU BEAT THIS LEVEL? IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE!"", and today, about an hour after I woke up, I blazed right through them. It really helps you think outside of the box, in some ways. Since it's also a level-by-level game, it's perfect when you want to take a couple minutes break from work.My only complaint is that it says ""taps"", as it comes from mobile platforms. It applies to touchscreen computers, but not the others. But it really isn't that major.Isn't this game on sale now too? For less than one dollar. Honestly, buy it.			"

												This puzzle game is so good! I've never been so eager to write a review for a game as I am for this one (so soon after purchase). I LOVE THE MECHANICS - depending on the levels you have to for instance draw lines, rotate bumpers, hide objects, destroy boxes  to succeed. Ichi has an insane amount of levels and community content. So simple (visually) yet complex! The puzzles might take a couple of tries but it's a quick learning process and you'll feel great everytime you figure it out.			"

												A solid enough action-puzzler. The main game levels aren't very long or plentiful and don't get very challenging, but there's a decent (though fairly limited) level editor and ""40000"" levels but most of them are garbage; still plenty of decent ones though. Achievements are kind of annoying, but ehh. It's fun enough to get a slight recommendation, but probably only as a bundle game.			"

												Ichi is a simple, but fun little puzzle game. The whole goal of the game is to get the ball through all the rings without this one popping/dieing by simply changing its course with a single click on the right time. There are different ways for the ball to intereact with certain objects like teleporting and bouncing off from triangles you rotate.The game is quiet short with only 60 levels of simple but challanging puzzles, very simple ""crayon drawn"" style graphics and relaxing but upbeat music that doesnt get repeatitive easly.Where the game really shines is in its level creator, letting you make and publish your own levels online, and you can obviously play over 27000+ user created levels (as of now) and rate them.PROS+Good  and easy to learn mechanics+Good music+Level creator+User created contentCONS-No Full screen mode-Only a few pieces of music-Short loading times that take you out of the experienceConclusionThis is definetly a good game, maybe not a must buy on Steam but I could surely find myself enjoying this on my phone during small brakes. More casual gamers might find this more appealing than most hardcore gamers due to its simple nature, though I am not saying that a harcore gamer wouldnt enjoy it.Total Score8/10 (keep in mind this score is based on what the game is and not as a general view from all games available)			"

												A fun game, but also pretty short (the levels created have a lot of good ones, though). It is kinda easy for the most part, getting only a bit hard by the time you reach the last levels. You can leave this game open and play some levels while you are doing other things though, the mechanics and the music will make you relax, and, once you complete a challenging level, you get a boost happiness for achieving it.

												ichi is a really fun puzzle game. I was a bit wary at first because timing is crucial here and I don't have those things people call reflexes, but after realizing I should not aim for an 'a' rating on every level, it all became very relaxing and I still got a sense of accomplishment when I figured out the trickier levels. there are 60 of them, plus more than 100,000(!) made by users. most of those were probably only created for the achievements but I'm sure there are more than enough quality ones as well.

												7/10 - Simple and VastThese puzzles are pretty fun. The level of difficulty varies and there are over 75,000 levels. That's right! A fraction of a fraction of a penny each level! Great deal here. This is a game I keep installed play a few levels before bed.. etc. Finally, you can publish your own levels easily. Name them and get all the credit. You also get a little tracking number that allows you to keep stats on people that have played your level.. etc. So cool! One of my favorite things to do on the game. Worth more than $5 since there are 75,000+ levels. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Don't let the charming graphics and the simple one-button gameplay fool you, because this puzzle game - which is about navigating a ball through a level by changing the objects in it to collect all of the golden rings - offers a lot of interesting mechanics that are often combined in such way that you'll scratch your head a couple of times before that glorious 'Aha!' solution comes to mind, reminding you of how clever some of the levels are. The levels are well-designed in such way that they introduce the mechanics very nicely and will teach the player to actually think ahead about how to get to all of the rings.While the well-made level editor provides a way for the community to make their own levels and share it with others, most of the levels are overly-simple - sometimes even completely empty - and add only white noise to the content of the community. Most likely this is due to the achievement you get for 'Uploading your own level', which is obviously redundant, considering the community content 'fallout' it has created.In conclusion, I really enjoy playing Ichi for its charms and interesting use of mechanics. The level-editor adds a lot of creative freedom and replayability to the game, but the developer really has to think of a way to make sure that players cannot just upload an empty level for the purpose of getting an achievement. Other than that, I think that Ichi is definitely worth it's price.			"

You get a limited number of moves in the set game to get an a pass for 3 points, then you have some more clicks to get a b pass and 2 points then it's a c pass for 1 point. You can go back and get an a pass or a b pass if you got a b or c pass and get more points.the real point of the game is to build your own levels and play other peoples.Yes, there is a lot of Spam levels where you do nothing and they did nothing, They are good for easy points if you trying for an achivment, but that's about it.On the other had some player built levels are great and fun and all should be able to be competed but you can't see how and you die lots and it's good.

												A nice puzzler that has no timer, but counts clicks.  The fewer the clicks, the better your score.  You click to send the ball, pong style, to the objective.  While trying to avoid the various traps along the way, sometimes requiring good timing, and fast reflexes.  The graphics are a nice change of pace from the bright, flashy, seizure inducing graphics of other games.Pros:Easy to learn, just click or hold the mouse buttonGraphics are nice, mellow and not flashya lot of replay value, 28k + of user created levelscons:the click/response time seems slow, sometimes not responding at all leading to extra clicksthe music, my god, the musicnot the best game for the more serious gamers out there.  After a few minutes it failed to engage me any further.so:A fine game for those that want to relax and not engage too heavily into a more rotund game.  I like heavy interactivity with the games i play, and this lacked it, only keeping me interested for a few rounds at a time.  Not even the wife found it engaging enough to keep her playing for extended times.  Kids, however, can learn from this one.  Cause and affect being the main lesson.target group:kids 5+ and people that like quick gamesworth the money?For replayability alone, yes.  Even more so in a bundle or sale			"

One button controls, Tons of levels to spend time on, user created levels, and level creator.MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S NOT FREEWorth every penny of 90% discount sale.Other than that this game is really nice to get.Trading cards are always nice.Although you can probably finish the game in a solid 3 hours, some hard levels are a pain to get 'A' rating.(Am i doing this right?)

												Ichi is a solid game build on a simple concept.  It's completely mouse driven, requiring only a number of left-clicks per level.  The first click starts a ball in motion.  This ball will bounce off walls and other objects, such as triangles (which cause right angle direction changes).  Other clicks rotate triangles, or make them disappear or reappear, etc.  Using these principles, your goal is to guide the ball to areas of the 2D level to collect rings.  Early levels have 1 or 2 rings, later levels have more, or are harder to collect.All the shapes that can be interacted with will do so whenever you click, so where you are pointing does not matter.  In fact, the clicking could have very well been implemented as a keyboard press, though I imagine left-clicking was chosen due to sometimes having to click multiple times quickly.The levels the game comes with do not take long to progress though, though you will likely replay them at least once to better your score.  There is a grading system based on the number of clicks it took to complete a level.  For example, clearing a level might require 3 clicks in order to get an A, up to 6 clicks gets you a B, and any more than that and you get a C.  In another level, the number of clicks for the A is different.  Your goal then is to get an A in each level, which doesn't take a whole lot of time, and that's fine.The meat of where I spent my time was creating/sharing my own levels, and then playing those made by others.  This is a cool feature of the game, however, due to the grindy nature of the achievements tied to this feature, (make x levels, play x levels), most people just create crappy levels instead of trying to add to the vibe of the levels that came with the game.  There is a rating system, so that after you play a level, you have the opportunity to give it 1-5 stars and also give it descriptive words such as ""easy"" or ""fast"" or even ""rubbish"".  However, there is no culling of poorly rated levels, nor a way to disclude them from showing up when looking for new user-levels to play.In the end though, despite the shortcomings of the user-made section of the game, the packaged levels are good, the rating system is not too tough, and the game idea is a solid implementation of a simple concept.  The graphics are minimal, but not in a lazy way.  It comes across as more of a stylistic choice rather than lack of artist situation.I've talked two friends into also owning this game, so I definitely recommend it, especially when on sale.  I picked it up literally at 90% off, so I definitely got my 49 cents worth.  Whether full price is worth it, is up to you, but I can tell you I've spent $5 on a lot worse things!			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Puzzle game.Interface/Menu/SettingsDoesn't have an option menu.It starts out windowed mode (Press Alt+Enter to make it full screen)About the game.The game is pretty simple and boring. Each level that you play has a rating and the rating depends on your click ammounts. You have a ball which will bounce off from walls and shapes. You have to collect those things with your ball in order to complete a level. In the top left you will see a counter. If you overcross the counter then you will get a lower rating. Starts with A(10) Then you go to B (8).If you press ESC button then you are able to mute the sound/music.Graphics are ""drawing style"".Music is weird.You are able to toggle off the music and sound.There is no time limit. But Click Limit.There is a Restart level button.You can create your own puzzle levels.Repetitive and low variety.Game could be boring. Unless you are into those kind of games.Other things.Game is pretty familiar from some-other game.-------------------I Give this game a 2/10			"

												If you like puzzle games of any variety, then there is a high chance that you'll like Ichi. It is a one button game that can prove to be a challenge during the later phases of the stock puzzle modes, albeit a little too easy in the earlier stages. The game has simple but interesting mechanics, click the mouse to change the direction of a rebound object or to turn other objects on or off at the same time and draw temporary walls to assist you in completing some of the challenges. Very simple gameplay, but I definitely enjoyed my time with it.As mentioned above, the game has some challenging puzzles, however, a large amount of the stock puzzles offer no challenge at all, thankfully however there is a huge amount of fan-made puzzles to play alongside the standard set, a lot of which are very well made and difficult. Simple mechanics, fun gameplay, cheap price, there is no reason you shouldn't buy this while it is on sale.			"

												Ichi, This game really depends on the stages created by the players. Yes the players, You the player. The levels range from a creative art piece to brain stumping puzzles which may require to draw some lines and rapid clicking.The single Player levels are a joke, 60 simple puzzles. Just click and wait for the ball to bounce from Location A to Location B (Then again,thats the whole game), but it nets you 180 points if you do score perfect A in them. They shouldn't last you more then an hour and a half.To call a puzzle your own, you can create one in the Creation set. It contains spikes, buttons, rocks, red/blue triangles, On/Off triangles, Pogs, buttons, teleporters and an item that doubles the amount of balls on screen. It's main feature though is to change the layout of an empty box to whatever you most desrire, IF its possible to complete. Thats right, no imposible stages for people (except for that one ""Popular"" stage) to play.Ichi falls short due to how the developers do not seem to care about the game and many levels generated by the community that are just empty boxes. The Developers do NOT support this game anymore, nor will release a patch for any of the bugs you the players find and report.If you think about buying this game, wait until its on sale, buying at the $5 price is step for a game with no support from the Devs, or better yet, a simple flash game.

												Ingredients100g plain flour2 eggs300ml semi-skimmed milk1 tbsp sunflower oil or vegetable, plus extra for fryingpinch saltMethodBlending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.			"

												About 20 minutes of fun in 2 hours of gameplay for the official levels. Ichi badly needs a rewind feature so you don't have to start the whole sequence over if you click at slightly the wrong time. New mechanics are introduced very slowly; I don't need 10 levels to master the ability to rotate triangles. That said, there are thousands of player made levels so if you somehow don't feel like you've exhausted the possibilities during the official levels there's plenty more to be had.			"

												Ichi, This game really depends on the stages created by the players. Yes the players, You the player. The levels range from a creative art piece to brain stumping puzzles which may require to draw some lines and rapid clicking.The single Player levels are a joke, 60 simple puzzles. Just click and wait for the ball to bounce from Location A to Location B (Then again,thats the whole game), but it nets you 180 points if you do score perfect A in them. They shouldn't last you more then an hour and a half.To call a puzzle your own, you can create one in the Creation set. It contains spikes, buttons, rocks, red/blue triangles, On/Off triangles, Pogs, buttons, teleporters and an item that doubles the amount of balls on screen. It's main feature though is to change the layout of an empty box to whatever you most desrire, IF its possible to complete. Thats right, no imposible stages for people (except for that one ""Popular"" stage) to play.Ichi falls short due to how the developers do not seem to care about the game and many levels generated by the community that are just empty boxes. The Developers do NOT support this game anymore, nor will release a patch for any of the bugs you the players find and report.If you think about buying this game, wait until its on sale, buying at the $5 price is step for a game with no support from the Devs, or better yet, a simple flash game.

Maybe buy it.5€ are too much for this game, which makes interacting extremely difficult.The mouse cursor is invisible and triggers no mouseover effect even when the game controller is disconnected; leaving me guessing when to click while moving the mouse. Using a game controller does not allow selecting all visible elements; there is also no help on which buttons to use.Apart from these problems: The resolution is about 1024x768, there is no apparent option to change this.

												Ichi is not a bad game, but in terms of puzzle games, I'd rank it somewhere between SquareCells and 2 Digit, leaning more with SquareCells.The main developer-created content spans 60 levels, which doesn't occupy a whole lot of time overall. Not a negative feature, but that was the reality when I played through it. Puzzles are fairly short, and may take a couple of attempts to clear; possibly more if you're looking to get an A on the level.What ends up being a marketable statistic - its massive cache of user-created levels - ends up being one of the roughest things to effectively navigate. Unless you know exactly what the level is called, any older levels that are not popular will be essentially invisible - not many people have the patience to page through thousands of levels at a rate of 8 levels per page.What is really missing is an option to select a random level, as well as an option to select a random level that you haven't played yet.While the game can be completed relatively quickly (in the span of a few hours), the achievements can take much, much longer. For achievements, there are a couple that depend on other players playing your levels, as well as long-term earning of points. The former is fine, although due to older, unpopular levels effectively disappearing, players are more or less forced to continuously create content, even if they are just throw-away levels. This leads to a trove of garbage levels populating the newest tab.For the long-term earning of points, There is an achievement for earning 1,000 points. When each level completion grants one point, this quickly turns into grinding nonsense, that goes far beyond a simple extension of the game into a needless grind. Lots of games have an achievement like this, and while it doesn't play a large role in my recommendation, it's worth noting.Overall, I would not recommend buying this game for full price (and partially hesitant of suggesting to buy during a sale), and would instead recommend a game with better puzzle elements; the puzzle elements here, while they are developed, are probably not satisfying for mid-level puzzlers or beyond.

												I'm not a huge fan of pure puzzle games because I prefer they are in a game that is rewarding puzzle-solving not with points or medals but a new weapon or tool or something - like a dungeon crawler or a Zelda game. But these indie puzzle games are often budget priced and if they are original, I'll pick them up on sale.I played it for a little while and completed 10 levels in about 24 minutes which certainly tested my skill and determination. I'm not sure I will play much further because of the lack of reward I mentioned above which I find in other games.But I would give it a recommendation because it's original and not too bad, and very inexpensive, but I personally noticed severe lag in the controls on more than one occasion, and they feel a bit laggy overall. Not okay in a game which requires perfect timing.  It could be something on my end but I don't think so. I have over 800 games with no laggy control problems.I may keep the game in hopes it was a fluke or will improve in an update.			"

												This game doesn't even work! It keeps telling me to tap my screen to rotate the triangles and solve the puzzle. Now, I don't own a touchscreen but I wasn't about to argue with the game designers. Clearly they know what they're doing better than me and obviously they wouldn't expect people to pay money for a half-boiled port of an iOS version of the game.But woe, whatever fancy witchery they used to turn my regular computer screen into a touchscreen simply does not work. What a pity, this looked like a pretty mediocre game I might have enjoyed for at least 2 minutes before I got bored. Possibly longer if I was waiting at a bus stop or something, although I'm unlikely to actually have my desktop computer there with me at the bus stop.			"

												Fun little puzzle game where you can create your own puzzles or just play levels some other random people made.PROS: - Nearly endless replayability,           - Lots of objects,           - 60 premade levels, CONS: - Some puzzles take way too long to complete. There should be a speed-up button,            - Needs some kind of favouriting system to keep track of levels you really liked.            - Too expensive.I still recommend it, if you have some time to waste, or if you're bored. I got it for a 90% sale, so my money was worth it. Don't know if I would however throw away 5 € for this.SCORE: 6,5/10.			"

												I just love this artwork! Gives that handrawn feeling!You only have to click, thats all...but this is extremely hard and tests your reaction time too!The only bad part about this game is that your levels are rarely seen by people...8.5/10			"

												Ichi came to such a surprise to me when I played it. It was fun and lengthy for as simple a game as this was. It has an enjoyable number of levels with a unique style of gameplay and challenges. Getting a ball to collect other balls has never been so intriguing and captivating. This game (as mentioned on its page) has its own realistic achievements and level editor that will give you more then your money back in time. This game is well worth its price.			"

												Got this game for less than a dollar and was it worth it.  The puzzle involves bouncing a ball and rotating wedges to collect all of the rings using your ball, and it only requires 1 button to rotate all of your wedges.  Very simple and easy to learn, but I can see the puzzles getting really complex in the later stages.  Totally worth your money for the base content alone, and there is still a whole array of user-created levels I haven't even touched.			"

												Ichi is a ""one-button"" puzzle game in which the goal is to safely direct an automatically moving line to collect golden rings. By clicking the mouse, you can make red triangles rotate and blue triangles appear / disappear; by holding down the mouse, you can draw a grey line where the moving line is. The moving line can bounce off of these, which is necessary in order to change its direction of movement. There are also other obstacles like breakable blocks, warps, switches, and death spikes.The base levels are a bit on the easy side, but I still enjoyed solving them. I particularly liked figuring out the correct places to draw grey lines — there's some light reflex challenge involved in drawing the lines while trying to ensure the triangles aren't pointing toward spikes at the same time. Additionally, a level editor and currently over 50,000 user-created levels are accessible through the game's main menu. A simple, chalky aesthetic and some nice tunes make this a relaxing puzzler to play overall.			"

												A very fun puzzle game with one minor issue. Progession of difficulty is good and the levels are fun to solve. The issue for me is with drawing on the screen with the mouse. You can create a temporary line to block the ball by tracing over the path the ball travels on. Unfortunately with a mouse drawing the line can be a bit of a challenge, but I eventually got use to it.Update - now that I've almost finished the game the flaws are becoming a bit annoying. The music is terrible, had to turn it off. The puzzles with line drawing are mostly annoying.It would also be nice to be able to pause the game at any time to ponder what to do. What is this, an arcade game? Good thing the puzzles are relatively simple.Overall not a bad effort and worth it when the game goes on sale.			"

												Although the idea of the game is quite ordinary, the high quality graphic, music and UI made the gameplay smooth and enjoyable.It would be a good mini-game on mobile phone, but on PC…… Honestly the levels designed are quite repeating and boring. I quickly lost my interest. Perhaps puzzle game fans would like it.			"

												Ichi is a simple, but fun little puzzle game. The whole goal of the game is to get the ball through all the rings without this one popping/dieing by simply changing its course with a single click on the right time. There are different ways for the ball to intereact with certain objects like teleporting and bouncing off from triangles you rotate.The game is quiet short with only 60 levels of simple but challanging puzzles, very simple ""crayon drawn"" style graphics and relaxing but upbeat music that doesnt get repeatitive easly.Where the game really shines is in its level creator, letting you make and publish your own levels online, and you can obviously play over 27000+ user created levels (as of now) and rate them.PROS+Good and easy to learn mechanics+Good music+Level creator+User created contentCONS-No full-screen mode-Only a few pieces of music-Short loading times that take you out of the experienceThis is definetly a good game, maybe not a must buy on Steam but I could surely find myself enjoying this on my phone during small breaks. More casual gamers might find this more appealing than most hardcore gamers due to its simple nature, though I am not saying that a harcore gamer wouldnt enjoy it.Total Score8/10			"

												Amusing little puzzles. The strength of the game must come from its player-made levels, rather than the 60 the developers made. There are some gems in there, but the 100,000 player-made levels are mostly rubbish and insta-complete ""puzzles"" for people hunting achievements.
