								This used to be my favorite game. I've played it since 2011. I met the developers at PAX when they only had a tiny corner in someone else's booth. I was so excited when new patches came out and I bought all sorts of silly flair because I loved supporting the developers of such a great game. Over the past year or so things have taken an odd turn. Entire new ranges of unnecessary and overpriced sub-items are available that modify your mechs. Now they have de-powered the silly just-for-fun mechs as some kind of cash grab and made the parts available to play in PVP, this looks an awful lot like pay to win. This makes me sad. There is also the continuous state of beta that makes little sense. The developers announced they were less than a month from being done with beta 2 years ago. No one has any idea what the roadmap for this game is, but as it stands the developers feel they can change core mechanics on paid-for items at will. I will not be spending any more money on this game if that is the lack of respect I can expect from Carbon.I may not be some Youtuber but I promoted this game to my friends and clan with vigor over the past 4 years. That also stops now. I can no longer, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone.			"

								AirMech is a free2play game available for PC and Steam. It's an RTS (Real Time Strategy) with a fast pace and fair, competitive action. You can choose between PvP, Coop/PvE/Solo (vs AI), Survival, or CTF (Capture the Flag) game modes. AirMech was inspired by a classic Sega Genesis game called Herzog Zwei. The game is still in beta (ETA: Summer 2014) so bugs are still being fixed and features are being added. There is no pay2win involved in AirMech. You can't buy any advantage for gameplay. Everything they sell is cosmetics and collectables. This keeps the game fair and balanced for everyone. Once you've learned the game, you have just as good of a chance at winning as every other player.AirMech is developed by CarbonGames, an indie developer with a team of about 10. With no major publisher, they're free to do what they want with the game. They're very active with the community and join us in the chat often for questions, suggestions, and other feedback. If you like Action-RTS, come check it out for free. If you need help, ask us in the chat. My name is InsaneFirebat and I'd be happy answer any questions you have.			"

								Before you decide to blindly criticize my review keep in mind I have 377.1 hours invested into this game.Ah Airmech, where do I begin? I used to absolutely love this game. I first heard about it when Huskystarcraft played it on his channel. Yea, Huskystarcraft. This was a loooooooooooooong♥♥♥♥♥time ago. Back then I didn't have a PC that could even run the game, so I just watched gameplay of it. Eventually, I realized the sad truth that I just wouldn't be able to play this game, so I gave up. A couple years later I bought a new PC cuz my old one broke down, and I made my steam account. It was then that I realized that Airmech was on Steam and that it was free to play. I played the hell out of this game, and almost became completely obsessed with it. The game had everything I could ever want out of it. Competitive PvP, unique gameplay, people throwing around premium currency like they don't even care, and most importantly, customization. You could choose your airmechs, pilots, units, items, upgrades, and you could even change around the core stats of the airmech with parts.To me, the parts system seemed absolutely perfect. Most parts had different tiers, ranging from mk1 to mk4. Higher tiers weren't stronger than the lower ones, they just modified your stats more. If you did it right you could almost completely change the playstyle of your airmech. You could be anywhere from a slow tanking beast, to an agile glass cannon.The free to play model was spot on too. Most of the essentials were bought with credits. Credits being the main f2p currency. The few non-free essentials were mostly parts, items, and pilots. Most of them were relatively cheap and could easily be earned by any f2p player like myself with just some well accumulated active playtime. The expensive stuff was the cosmetic stuff. Things like skins for your airmech and fancy pets and decals.That's not to say that you didn't get much for paying. Aside from awesome skins and decals, you could also purchase units called 'ultimates.' The were obscenely strong units that were ridiculously OP and not allowed in regular PvP play. You could use them to shred your way through ruthless AIs, destroy survival mode, and have good fun with your friends in custom matches. But everything changed that one faithful day...The devs came out with an update that pretty much ruined everything I discussed in this review.The update split PvP into two different modes. One where parts were not allowed, and one where they were allowed...along with any ultimate units, pilots, or parts. To make things even worse, parts became a direct upgrade to your airmech and higher tiers of parts were direct upgrades. Furthermore, Higher tier parts could only be obtained from farming or trading with other players on the player market for premium currency. Players were left with a terrible choice, play a watered down version of the game for free, or farm for hours upon hours only to be dominated anyway by ultimate units. RIP balance, RIP f2p, RIP customizationAnd this isn't even the end of it. Remember how I mentioned ""unique gameplay"" as one the game's good traits? Well ever since that update the game slowly began to veering towards being just another MOBA. The game slowly stared to steer away from the RTS aspect of it's formerly great concept. Now the game mostly mostly favors an autobuild system AKA creeps or minions.RIP unique gameplayFor me, that was the dagger to the heart for this game. Don't waste your time. This game has been in beta for years and is shrinking more that it seems to be growing. Just don't bother.tl;dr Used to be great. Amazing even. But then, the p2w nation attacked... - [AngerR]MaxiumMeda			"

								First of all, let me say it, the tutorial right now is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that needs replacement. Once you get past it, you find the best free to play game on steam. If you have a buddy who's already into the game they can invite you into a game to skip the damn thing, but othewise it will take an hour or so to get past it.AirMech is an Action RTS set in the near future. Following a power war that destroyed nearly all global infrastructure, society has collapsed and a tiny fraction of humanity survives. The most skilled of them pilot the transforming vessels that caused this war, the AirMechs. These hybrids of planes and mechs are capable of causing destruction unparalleled by any other combat vehicle and then transforming to escape, pickup reinforcements, order a few light vehicles to attack, and return to continue the mayhem.The basic gameplay of AirMech revolves around using one of nine different transforming mechs to carry around and order eight types of units that the player has taken into battle to capture outposts which serve as deploy points for new units and refuel stations for your airmech, as well as increasing the amount of units that you can field at a time and increasing the rate at which the credits used to purchase units are accumulated. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the enemy fortress while of course preventing the destruction of your own.AirMech has been called a MOBA, but I think it far more accurate to think of AirMech as an RTS where your cursor can itself damage and be damaged by enemy units. This mechanic allows in AirMech for gameplay and strategy to occur that is not found in any other game. Destroy the enemy airmech, and they'll be unable to route reinforcements to the outpost that you're attacking until they get back in. You'll be able to stage a surprise assault elsewhere that they won't be able to deal with until they respawn. Destroying the enemy airmech greatly expands your tactical options and adds a new layer of strategy to RTS.There are nine AirMechs in the game. The Striker is an all around mech good at most tasks but inferior in almost all of them to some more specialized mech. The Helix is slow but great for ferrying units around and forcing enemy AirMechs to GTFO. The Bomber is great for killing clumped units like that jackal rush some hunk of cheese is throwing at you, while the Warthog specializes at taking down high health units one unit at a time and surviving long enough to do it. The Saucer is a versatile yet paper thin mech that can destroy large number of enemy units using its death ray or exploit a negligible amount of anti-air and turn the enemy armies to your side. The Osprey specializes in healing your units and is great for defending outposts that are under attack. The Neo is used to stage ambushes using its cloaking abilities and can slow enemy movement and prevent enemy mechs from escaping using its stasis blast. The Paladin is used to strength unit clusters using its attack, defense, and speed auras. Lastly, the Angel is used to snipe enemy units from a distance and then escape before you can be destroyed.There are over 70 types of units in the game, ranging from infantry, the only unit type that can capture and occupy outposts, to light vehicles useful for fast assaults on enemy outposts and a variety of cheese strats revolving around massing a couple dozen of them and sending them all to destroy the enemy fortress, to tanks, the mainstays of your armies, to anti-air built for the express purpose of destroying the enemy airmech, to healing units for all of you turtles, to a variety of turrets (don't overuse them or else you die!). Also in the mix are bombs that your airmechs can drop on the enemy units, mines, and artillery to deal with those pesky turtles. The game also features 13 unique pilots to provide large stat boosts to your airmech in exchange for some downside along with a host of items, which provide smaller boosts to your airmech. This host of combinations of mechs, units, pilots, and items allows you to play almost any way you feel like. I don't think that there's a play style that isn't supported in AirMech, the possibilities you have are virtually endless.Some might worry about AirMech being a pay to win game. These worries are not entirely unjustified given how many other games have gone down this path. AirMech, however, stays clear of it, employing the best free to play model I have yet seen in any game. The premium currency, diamonds, can only be used to purchase cosmetics, kudos, XP, and drop boosts, things on the player market, and ultimate items that cannot be used in PvP. Everything that affects the PvP game can only be purchased with kudos, excepting items that other players put up on the player market. A 10 minute match will earn you roughly 150 kudos, and most things in the game cost anywhere from 500 to around 3600 kudos. The grind in the game is thus very light, almost non-existent compared to most other ""Non Pay to Win"" games out there such as League of Legends or Warframe. Don't want the grind? Purchase AirMech Prime for $20 USD, which will instantly deposit 100,000 kudos into your account to spend to your heart's content. Purchasing diamonds in AirMech also gives you more value comparatively than in app purchases in other games, with $5 giving you enough to buy 1-3 skins, depending on the skins, and $10 being enough to buy 4-11 skins, once again depending on the skins.The community in AirMech is arguably the best in online gaming. Our global chat is full of people eager to answer questions, and it is rare to go half an hour without someone doing a giveaway known as a diamond roll, where someone spends 500 diamonds (Around a dollar in value) to start a diamond giveaway, where one random entrant will receive 360 diamonds and another 60. Recently the developers have implemented Black Diamond Rolls, which cost 5000 diamonds (around $10) and multiply the amount of recipients of diamonds by 10 compared to a normal roll. This variety too is surprisingly common. On what other game will people spend $10 to give away stuff to random players of the game? The AirMech community is simply amazing.What truly makes AirMech the greatness that it is is the developers. Carbon, a small studio of nine devs have worked tirelessly on AirMech for 5 and a half years. Their dedication is simply amazing, from working on Christmas Eve to get a patch out to hanging out in chat to answer player's questions to crafting the game to be free to play even though a pay to win game would likely have gotten them much more money. These developers work harder than just about any other developer you'll find and have done everything to make a fair game where you could spend a day grinding and be able to create a competitive loadout, where it doesn't matter in pvp if you've spent $5, or $140, or $600, or $0. Fostering the creation of a community where every day dozens of dollars are given away to random people through diamond rolls. Carbon is one of those few developers, and AirMech one of those few games where you can spend over a hundred and forty USD and not feel bad, for with AirMech Carbon has earned it. Few developers have put so much effort into creating such a fair gameplay experience, and a fun one, and few games have communities as friendly, helpful, and generous as that of AirMech. To say that AirMech is a game which you will probably have fun playing and which you could probably justify shelling out $5 for is like saying that if you want to live it's probably a good idea to breathe. AirMech is an experience like no other with devs virtually unparalleled in dedication. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and encourage you to help carbon out by buying a thousand diamonds or two, not because it's necessary, but because Carbon has deserved it with the experience that they've crafted. AirMech is simply a masterpiece.			"

								With nearly 480 hours on steam and probably close to 600 on the standalone PC version, I've played this game a lot. It was a great game, fun to play solo or coop, not so much multiplayer because queue times are horrendous, and you get flattened by a. smurfs or b. the main accounts, which i got matched up with anyways because there aren't enough people playing.Then the developers decided, ♥♥♥♥ it, lets nerf all these things that you had to pay premium currency for, change the deployment scheme, rack up the tax % in the market for EVERYONE by 2%, plus non-VIP (non paid) players were allowed to participate in the market, but with a massive 35% tax rate and no way to lower it. In addition, the ""tax books"" used to lower the tax are so rare, you basically have to buy them with premium currency from someone else who had them drop. Having said that, if you spent 3500 diamonds on two tax books, that would lower your tax 2%, only to have it go right back to what it was. In addition, hoarders exist, making it very hard to get a deal like that for basically anything good. In addition, the devs don't listen to those who disagree-they claim they listen to the silent majority, not just those who post in their forums, yet the silent majority would be those who play solo/coop, and the devs nerfed the units that the solo/coop farmers use. Now, these ""ultimate"" units costing around 600 diamonds each are basically the same as their base versions. And on the forums, the lead developer, james, changed a topic from the changes to the game to talking about a minigame while on the loading screen. Really? Instead of facing any problems, the devs just walk away from it. And that's not even all the problems. Putting in a mandatory purchase to use the chat when you didn't have to, a better looking ui for the pvp screen but not matching it up with the solo/coop screens, these seem like distractions to mask the issues beneath. They recently changed the stats of every single pilot, saying that this was to make the game more fair. Very disappointing for a game that I had high hopes for.			"

								Played the game for about 2 years. there have been a ton of improvements done to the game over that time.  The reviews that say this game is Pay to Win is laughable at best, and lazy in it's truth.   The game is kudos based (given for playing the game, win or lose)  All units (even the big cool ones...), parts, most pilots and items are able to be purchased with Kudos.   The premium currency is diamonds, which are only for cosmetics.  period.  Thats it. And there are even survey's to get free diamonds without spending a dime. The gameplay has undergone several revises since its Alpha inception.   The Matchmaking has been redone to help people in lower populated areas find games.  The matchmaking servers rememeber your ""lag"" or lack of connectivity to specific servers, and removes them from your server list if they get to be unplayable.  There are multiple modes to play, solo, coop, pvp, survival, challenge.  You can replay this game a lot. And while there are some wait times, they pale in comparison to games like League of Legends, with 1 hour queue times for a game. The game that is free to play allows the basic gameplay without ""VIP"" access.  Basically, allows you all the things VIP gets, with the exception of diamonds.  And even then VIP is only $5 to get if you choose it.  The basic gameplay doesnt hold back any content,  without VIP however, and you can still experience a very good game. All in all, the game is worth it in my opinion.  It has been around for 2+ years, just got a contract with Ubisoft to release the Xbox version of it, and is growing.  Worth the time if you like RTS/MOBA style games.  "

								I did a review for this back in 2014, although I deleted it due to fan boys simply assaulting me for being ""too hard on indie devs"" and that my ""concerns are invalid"" because I'm simply too stupid to understand Airmech. Now I'm back with 2 years worth of experience (note, that I play this game off of Steam.) And within those two years I have seen this game throw itself in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Airmech at first was a good game, it showed promise and had a chance to transform into something unique. But after some ""balancing"" updates and this Farmville♥♥♥♥♥♥they placed in the main menu, I have completely lost faith in Carbon's abilities to finish the job they have started. They are literally holding the chat hostage until you buy shovels to dig a hole in the ground to build a ♥♥♥♥ing radio tower. And what does Carbon have to say about it? They said that ""chat is a distraction to new players"" and ""makes them less effective online"" which is complete dogshit on a stick! The fanboys might believe it, but I refuse to go along with this.A lot of people placed faith in these chuckle heads, myself included. We bought tons of cosmetics to support them and ensure that the game would exit Early Access. Instead they have decided to just sit on it as an excuse if anyone questions the quality of the game.My final verdict for Airmech (currently) is a 2/10. Years of beta? Worthless cosmetics and less updates? I've seen modders do more within a week than this joke. And I want everyone to know clearly that I loved this game, it's the reason I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to see it in this state (especially when there aren't very many mech games on Steam) For now I'm done with Airmech. It has made me look like a fool among my friends after suggesting this to them, and it has stabbed me in the back when I thought this would be the one F2P game that couldn't ♥♥♥♥ up.			"

								This game has been beta for many years,  every change they make effects the game negatively.  The head developers make cash grabs often with many of their patches.  Often Patches will take away your rewards or heavily alter your paid for items that help in game.  There has been a mass exodus of this game by its players because of this. I will say that in this games glory days it was the best game on the market with a strong support system.  Strong online community and incredible fast paced, strategic gameplay.  If you've ever seen the original game from sega genesis called herzog zwei.  It's a direct counterfit.  Which is good and im sure the legal issues are whats making this game free to play.  The game is soo good actually that despite the numerous muggings and underhanded cash grabs i still come back to play somewhat often.  I feel that many players that have donated up to 300 dollars or more to help build this game and make it better,  are owed a heafty apology at this point.  Any positive reviews that exist im sure are most likely very old at this point.  It truely hurts to write a negative review like this,  If things change then so will my review.  Also There is one developer that is completely excluded from all negative aspects of this review,  and his name is insanefirebat.  If he did not exist,  this game would be nothing without his tireless efforts.  Illuminati greed snowballed this game into an abyss im not sure they can or even care to climb out of.			"

								""Early Access"" review, as such it is subject to change as the game progresses.Edit- 12/20/2014-------The frame rate drops mentioned below have been resolved with a recent update. However ping restrictions remain, even for private co-op games. The popup displayed below has also been removed.-------I love AirMech and hate that I cannot recommend it.AirMech is an interesting mix of MOBA and RTS elements with cool mechs and interchangeable pilots that add different stat bonuses.You have Creeps that scurry across the map similar to a MOBA, but you capture outposts and use those to build units to either defend or attack, similar to an RTS.There is a solo mode, co-op, and pvp. My experience is primarily in solo mode due to the exact reasons I cannot recomend this game.Solo mode itself is limited to 60 minutes a day unless you upgrade your account to Silver VIP, purchasing Gold VIP or Prime will accomplish this as well.Now then, to those ""reasons"" I hinted towards earlier. Carbon has designed AirMech without any form of lag compensation. Before the ping limit was added, if you joined a game with more than 150 ping you would cause screen freezes for everyone in the match.Higher ping would cause dramatically worse freezes. For years, Carbon has said they are working on it and looking for a solution... Well, they found their solution. Carbon has added a rather low ping limit which limits high ping players strictly to solo play, you can not even have a private match with friends.If your ping is affected by said ping limit, you will see this every time you log in: 


AirMech 
A Screenshot of AirMech
By: Aedensin




FYI I'm based in the USCarbon devs do not see this as an issue and act as if they do not care. I have been told that no games compensate for ping above 200 and that I should find another game after asking them about issues with ping, long before there was a limit.As a Prime player, being told to find a different game by a lead dev after asking a question was off putting but I continued to play because I love the game.Now in addition to all of the above, there are massive FPS drops that can only be fixed by changing video settings and this fix is only temporary, the drops will start again the next time the game is launched. Even the lobby is affected now, but that goes away once chat is hidden.I have to lower my antialiasing to 0 and then bring it back up to 4 to stop the drops. Originally the devs blamed it on a bug with certain unit skeletons, and it has not been fixed. This began when Carbon started preparing AirMech for its Xbox 360 release and changed every UI in the game. Mind you my computer is above recomended requirements.After all that has happened, my love for the game is wearing thin. I find myself not logging in to have fun but out of habbit to collect daily rewards. I can no longer play with my friends because Carbon has deemed the internet in my area unworthy.			"

								This is the best F2P game I have ever played.  I'd recommend going Silver VIP through one of the many ways you can so you have access to the Market.Anyone remember Herzog Zwei?  Or am I just old?  Well that game is this x1,000.  Just download AirMech and play already!In short, you pilot a giant robot that can fly or walk, and command units around a battlefield RTS-style.  You capture bases in games against humans (PvP) or bots (PvE) in a variety of battlefields.  In these matches you can use one of a number of mechs, either earnable through playing to earn spendable 'kudos'  or purchasable through packs.  The game is still in beta, and only getting better.  More maps, more mechs, more units, special holiday-themed units, event-themed units...you get the idea.Just play it already!  It's free, it's fast, it's fun, and it's ADDICTIVE!!!UPDATE: With the constant updtes to this game, it's becoming more and more balanced.  The developers are great and are constantly listening to feedback (and responding) on the ingame chat and on the forums.  It's great to see developers that actually care!			"

								Simple review:A very good and unique Action RTS. Spiritual successor of Herzog Zwei.You control an Airmech: a Mech that has an air form (duh).Build units and expand your control over the map in order to destroy the enemy base.A fair F2P model, active developers and awesome community makes the game very good. It supports 1 v 1, 2 v 2 and 3 v 3 as well as coop and survival (up to 4 players).Make sure you have a slightly good internet or else you will have either reduced amount of servers and players to play with.This game has a lot of competitive aspects and PVP is very fun and challenging.

								As game kept developing, I can't express, but write a negative review of a game that I used to love back then. Starting from 2015, the year where the game started becoming worse and worse, PvP forced on players while seperating fun PvP and ranked PvP into unranked P2W mode and ranked non P2W but hardcore players, forced farmvile-like things on players, nerfing ultimates, making parts pure upgrades removing creativity, adding an autodeploy system like an deploy arm, making market harder for free players to enjoy, tax books are extinct to point of costing over 9000 diamonds, and, worst of all, cratering this game into yet another generic F2P game by screwing up veterans and newbies with nerfs to stuff they owned and loved. Now they just overpriced junk that sells poorly and a mark of how stuff used to be good.The only good thing about this game now is there's a dev called Insane, you know, he's honest and very social guy, expect the other devs well, just instead of listening to community, they just try to destroy it. And it already shows, not only the matches are now harder to find, but there's literally no good old veterans now right there, there's only diehard players who think this game is awesome or just newbies passing in. Which will leave as soon as they play some games.The sudden decrease was in 2015, as you know, these updates forced many veterans to leave, inculding myself.But I decided to re-play it later...to disappointment to how this game has become.Other negative reviews were right. Sad to see how one of my favorite game's turned from unique into generic and betrayal of loyalty. Now I'm not recommending this game anymore. Rest in peace.			"

Starcraft Meets TransformersAirMech is one of those games really well made F2P titles out there that offers lot of PvP action, among this you got bunch missions that you can do to practice the game mechanics. I feel like the game is crossover between Starcraft and Transformers, there is lot of strategy elements to this game and by all means its not super easy.Plus Side Awesome Developer You can pretty much unlock everything with ingame currency Very optimized game, no frame drops Great opening tutorials and missions will teach you most mechanics of the game Lot of different Mechs and units to choose from, bunch of content Regulary updatedMinus Side Might be somewhat hard to get inside the game, if you practice in online only Some latency issues do exist (atleast in the past) "

								7/10This game is fun and very addictive, I recommend this game to those who love strategy games and have a high level of patience. Thats because this game becomes devastatingly hard when your ping reaches 300 and above. Other than that, you can still enjoy the game by playing the solo vs, solo survival, coop with friends close to your area, etc. which almost covers up the whole lag issues. But still, I'm waiting for those issues to be fixed, because this game only becomes very playable when you dont experience lag during your game. Ofc you wouldn't want to see your team losing just because of lag right?Regarding the market, this game is quite a true f2p game and not pay2win. Why? It's because, so far I haven't encountered any pay2win aspects that make me want to give up on this game. I'll give one example (based on fact), there's no airmechs in this game that you can't buy using in game money, even if there are mechs that you have to buy using diamonds (you'll know it later on), they are just skins based from the original airmechs. Ofc with skins your mechs would look better in the battlefield, but only having the original mechs wouldn't hurt right? SO you have to work for it if you want to buy them using diamonds! Also, there's this feature when everytime your referral (if someone would volunteer to become your referral) levels up to rounded numbers like 10, 20, 30, etc. you will get diamonds for free, and the amount always accumulates everytime your referral level reaches the next rounded number. This game already helps you with that, your job is only to work hard. Every people get what they deserved.P.S. The interface of this game is awesome			"

								I have played this game for literally 8 hours, but I can already tell this game can go far.The GoodVery friendly to low tier pc's.This game can run smooth on almost any pc, lowering the settings doesn't really take that much away from the visual appearance, so you don't exactly need a hardcore gaming pc to play this game.Very fun and fast paced.Not really much I can say about this, only that it's super fast paced and the tide of the battle can change within seconds.Not too heavy on purchasing items.You don't feel too pressured to buy stuff or diamonds from the shop, all the classes and most of the items can be unlocked and purchased with points you get for playing the game, the only stuff you can purchase is cosmetic items that look cool, and ""Ultimates"" which have buffed up stats, but you can't actually use these ultimates in ranked matches, so it's not pay to win.Balanced.Each class of mech is different and comes with different abilities and stats, so there isn't that one class that's super buffed up like Chuck Norris on sterriods. The extra items you can buy to put on your mech come with downsides, one of the legendary weapon parts came with a huge debuff and made me think twice before wanting it.MOBA? Maybe?This feels nothing like your average MOBA, such as DotA or LoL, Carbon Games definetly took the average MOBA and added their own saucy twist. The BadIt can be a bit confusing at times to figure out how to buy and equip units or how to use skills, so they could have made the tutorial a bit more detailed in some areas.You have to be online to play.Now, I'm not sure if there's a setting to keep you logged into the game, but you have to log into your AirMech account every time you launch the game, so you basically require internet connection to play. I don't know if this affects too many people but I thought I should make note of it.Matchmaking, I live in America, US West, and I would be matched up with people that are extreme distances away, so if the devs can change it to Area Based, it would fix a lot of lag problems.Anyway, that's really all I have.

								Still not believing that people can come up with so many MOBA-inspired games and manage to do different things.AirMech is a game that puts you in the role of a pilot controlling one of the most powerful war machines ever created - AirMechs, combat robots capable of transforming into fighter jets. Sounds familiar? Not surprised. But this time around, there is only very little of these, so you are instead of fighting the enemy head-on ordered to lead a sizable army in such a way you'll manage to destroy the enemy fortress while keeping the one you own alive, capturing outposts along the way to get more and more advantages.Nothing too original there, as you may see. What truly matters is the combat system and equipment system - because that's the REAL fun here.The combat system seems basic at first, but gets more complex later. Your AirMech is the equivalent of a typical MOBA hero - Has a main attack, runs around, gets XP and upgrades to get abilities. However, it's not only that, but also a RTS general unit and a fighter jet. Pressing space at any time will, if you have enough energy, jump you into fighter mode. That way you can't attack ground units (exception to the Warthog's praised ability) and can't be attacked by them if AA isn't their base ability, but can attack AirMechs in their jet mode. And vice versa, of course. The air mode also allows you to pick up friendly units, either from the ground or from any of your outposts if you build them yourselves, and drop them elsewhere. You can even give orders to them that way - except for most infantry units. These guys are just too dumb.But that isn't all. In your typical MOBA, you also have creeps, right? Well no worries, these guys are here as well. The thing is: They aren't the main non-player combat force; Your own troops are.Each player has eight slots for units he/she uses on the battlefield. There's quite a range of them, from infantry and tanks to APC's, AA tanks and Buildings. Each unit is highly different from others, which changes its role on the field, be it the capability to direct other troops, drop infantry on death, repair or even suicide in order to explode. I highly recommend taking a look at that store - a proper unit setup can do quite a lot. Alongside with that, there are buildings to be used as well - usually increasing either your unit capacity or giving you money to buy these units with over time. And turrets, don't forget about turrets.Every building can then be placed on a socket, which is exactly what it sounds like - a socket. In some cases, it only provides bonuses to have your building on a socket, in other cases it's a requirement to place them there. Units, on the other side, have the ability to interact with outpost, where infantry can get up on them and capture them while machinery can be placed on doorsteps in order to block off entrances. You can also pick things up and repair and rearm them above outposts as well as you can repair and rearm your own AirMech there. Last but not least, outposts provide another exit point for your production queue. Now, maps in this game are very little of, but their quality is undoubtable. They provide both linear advances and chokepoints and flanking possibilities, coupled with the placement of neutral units all over the place. I still managed to find a couple faults in the designation of spawn areas, though, but these are small things.There are several gamemodes right now  - 2v2, 3v3, Coop 2v2/3v3, CTF-style gamemode and Survival. But the devs are not done yet - planned SP campaign is not a bad idea. However, there are some server problems here and there - the 2v2 and  3v3 multiplayers have a lack of servers. Devs solved the problem by enabling only one at a time, which might come as bit unconvenient, but I guess it's okay as the game is still technically in Early acces.But more amazing features are waiting for you outside of battling - the game has a decent community system with rankings, levels, clans, chat badges and even in-game player market much similar to the one Steam has, except you pay only in  Diamonds - a premium currency. As well as that there are drops you can find after matches - special versions of units with some basic changes - some sacrifice armor to get speed, others get more health but lower speed etc. All this can be sold on the market so you can get more diamonds yourslef - which you can then use to buy something else even outside the market, regardless of whether you ever bought anything for the game. Also, there are private trades available - so you can always give something you don't need or use to friends. Found that feature very convenient.The other currency is Kudos - all the important stuff can be bought for that. However, you will not be able to buy cosmetics or ultimate units - a version of certain 'meta' units and buildings with very little downsides and extreme upsides. Or ultimate pilots - same deal there.Another thing is the equipment system. Players can have several loadouts, each with a different AirMech class, unit composition, pilot, special parts and improvements and cosmetics, upon which you can count stuff like team color, pets, flails and even AirMech skins. There are only few of the AirMech types, but each is very unique and features a different set of abilties as well as a different set of available equipment parts. The parts use a level system - you have a certain part capacity you can use to give your AirMech more specializated capabilities, which increases as you level up. Of course, the more drastic the effect of the part is, the more drastic is the part capacity and price going to be. Pilots are then another way to specialize your AirMech - they, however, affect more than just your AirMech.In conclusion, here's another F2P game worth giving a shot. It's not going to be any kind of revolutionary craziness, but it's rock solid and won't let you down on what it promises to bring.			"

								Very fun Action RTS game that for some reason not a lot of people seem to know about. You should definitely grab AirMech Prime now during the sale if you don't have it. AirMech is free to play, but with Prime you get all the classes and units (current AND future) unlocked instead of having to unlock them through gameplay. Even if you do not buy Prime you can still be competitive with the basic units you start with and just unlock other classes/units with Kudos (the in-game currency you get from playing). There are a few different game modes - 1v1 up to 3v3 PvP against players or AI, up to 3v3 CTF, and 1 to 4 player Survival - to go along with ranked matchmaking. There are also some challenges you can complete and a campaign that will be released for Prime owners sometime in the future.  "

And your cursor is a transformer.This is a Tower defence game. Yeah, where your cursor is a transformer.Have you ever seen a tank the size of a shopping mall with 6 cannons, being abducted by a UFO made out of cogs and clockwork? Or maybe you would be interested in a stealth bomber that transforms into a giant robot humanoid praying mantis?You will see much more than that. And that you will see too.These are the droids you are looking for. The cake is not a lie after all. Amazing game! 12/10!			"

								I had another review prior but I decided to change it because it was not written when some major issues I have with the game came up. FYI this isn't exactly a review about gameplay, it's more about treatment of new players.Game is unnessarily harash to new players which does more harm than benefit. The forced tutorial is okay, however it has far too much useless stuff as a part of it. The tutorial includes forced useless ""missions"" that you have to play to even unlock EXPANDED SOLO OPTIONS, you don't even get Online play yet. The way to unlock online play is to reach level 6, but for new players, IT'S A RIDICULOUS GRIND, could take hours at least. Well to top it off the UI is very hard to understand at first and frustrating to use.If you are a returned player or someone who will do anything to reach the online player, then you can endure the harshness for new players. HOWEVER, especially for returning players, THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE you will get dumped into the forced tutorial and deal with that frustration. When you do pass all that stuff, the actual game is pretty fun to play.But I can not recommend a game that doesn't treat new players too well. If this issue gets changed, so shall my review. If you were looking for a gameplay review, please check out another person's if that interests you.			"

								Its fun, its free, and not pay to win.  These are what it takes for a free to play game to get a positive review from me, and this game easily passes that test.A little about the game:Think MOBA like, only you choose what creeps you spawn, what those creeps do, and where to place those creeps.  Sure you're a giant flying transformer (air and ground modes for every mech) but placing units tactically will win you the game.  There is a great deal of strategy involved.Additionally, there is a GREAT tutorial that goes over everything.  All in all, a refreshing new look on MOBAs in a market flooded with LoL and DOTA clones.  10/10, well worth the $0 it will cost you to try it.			"

								When I first started playing AirMech one weird thing was it opened in a window instead of full screen.. and then I saw the graphics and I wondered why a game in this day and age would be so pixelated and resembling old game graphics when this game is still early access. Even in the lobby chat the words were blocky and straining to the eyes. BUT.. then I found the settings and switched to full screen with 1080p resolution and everything looked smooth and normal as it should be. I actually went through the starting tutorial with pixelated graphics but it seems the default settings need to be changed right away for a normal viewing experience. So each match you play (Solo, Co-Op, PvP) you choose a Mech to be your on field commander that can build units, collect and drop them on the map, research upgrades for your mech (each has different abilities) and fight the enemy in the air or transform and fight on land. The objective is to capture the outposts with creeps so you can gain territory and build more offensive and defensive units and in the end, destroy the enemy fortress with your units. I can't say the idea is original since I've played a game with a mode like this since the 1st generation Playstation days. However the different Mechs and playstyles is interesting and you need to be fast to control the situation. For each Mech you also need a pilot character which has different bonuses but also negatives for your setup. For example a higher defense bonus might give you a cost to Air Speed (Mech flying speed). These bonuses and negatives apply through the items you can equip to your Mech as well. You can play and earn favor to buy units, pilots, items from the shop. Some items are only purchasable with gems in which you can get by some quests you complete, dice rolls that other players can offer on chat to win gems with highest and lowest number.. or paying for it. After each match it shows you how much more you could've earned in favor and experience if you were a VIP member, which might get annoying. Some diamonds from quests you couldn't unlock unless you're a VIP member. When there's lag in a Co-op/PvP match it could get annoying as it's very noticeable. Your Mech stops.. then moves... then might stop... then move. But the experience will of course vary depending on location, ping, connection, etc. It's fun and satisfying when you're fighting the enemy Mech in the air and watching them explode when you finish them off. I'm not sure if solo play is really time limited or just means you'll stop gaining XP and Favor after a certain amount of solo play unless you have VIP. It's an interesting game to play at first but there might be some repetition and grinding involved. Nice to try out but sticking around depends on the player. I haven't really been playing though..

								Airmech was one of my most favourite games ever! It was simply awesome! Its gameplay is fantastic and there is a lot to keep you engaged. Do keep in mind that there haven't been a huge update is some time that brought any groundbreaking content or new characters. They improved the tutorials and added a small but insignificant campaign, but that's about it! I felt that the recent release of the game's VR version drawed the focus of the devs away from the original game. I am not sure though. Give the game a whirl! Its quite worth it!			"

								I used to love this game. Key words used to.Air mech is one of the never ending beta type games. If you don't know what a never beta is, it's where a game is ""In devolopement"" But they never change it that much, or often.Pros:-Good varity of UnitsCons:-Almost every update has something that ruins the gameplay.-Kiss fair Balancing goodbye-ALWAYS ONLINE DRMI would like to say the rest, but because this game is so confused on it's own identity. I can never Pin point a huge flaw with it, Nor Tag a confident positive.It's times like these where I wished some one would take Technosoft's Herzog Series, and remaster it. Because I am so fed up with this game NEVER BEING FINNISHED!Bonus Early access viewership and examples:-The communtiy market used to be free for anyone, then carbon games said no it should be members only. Then they made it free again...-Units originally couldn't go into battle automatically unless told so. Allowing for freedom to decide wither you want to place specific units at specific locations, or be a gunhoe gundam. Then Carbon games said no, and made it only automatic, WHICH REALLY HURTS BALANCING!-Buckys... I don't know what catagory they are in anymore. "

								I used to recommend this game and I almost feel regret in doing so.- ""free2play"" does not feel free at all. Others may not notice it but all those fluffy updates with existing microtransaction    really makes player want to spend money. - open beta for along time and the only thing that they update is some useless cosmetics and all those ""balancing""- there's lot of thing they can improve. ( better tutorial, single player campaign maybe )- for 1 year i've played this game, i'm still wondering what is the faction functions other than blinking when other    members online. (really needs improvement)- You need to log in every time you launched this game, which is not there before. So, no internet,no game.- Why am I connected to Europe server in pvp with approx. 1000 ping while in coop I played in Singapore and Japan    with ping below 100.The only reason i still keep this game in my library beacause it is a robot game and a unique one although I only play it for about 1 week every 2 or 3 months.

								Fast paced RTS/Tower Defense hybrid. With the player piloting a transformer mech.Most of the stuff can be earned, and what there is to buy with real money is cosmetic, mostly. While the game absolutely does want your money, it doesn't get ugly about it.Gameplay consists of you rushing around the map doing things such as collecting units (heavy units can be given Capture or Kill orders or just dropped to guard), deploying them in position, or battling enemy forces in person. You level up your mech during battle which allows you to build upgrades for youself. In addition you can build and place turrets or artillery pieces, drop mines, bombs or even bear traps. That's before we get into the funky stuff like stealth, healing or straight up stealing enemy units.Game modes are Solo, Co-op or PvP in 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or Survival modes. While there is an initial learning curve, AirMech is not an extremly complex game. I'm more of a fan of turn based combat but the quick pace of AirMech suits me just fine. Your mileage may wary. You earn one type of currency, the other can be bought with real $$. You spend currency unlocking units to build, mech equipment or buying cosmetics or pets and such. You also get random drops after some battles.What are you waiting for? Transformers (not in name/license obviously), free, good! Try it, you may not find the best game ever, but it is average at worst.			"

								Don't be fooled. I will start with the most important and that is the poor servers.Although in major countries there are playable servers available, for any other country, even sometimes to players in major countries, you get placed on a far-away, entirely irrelevant and weak server. Game after game after game is unplayable because an australian player hosts a game and it picks the korean server. Germany or South African player and you get plonked onto an unplayable Tunisian server. Don't even bother, if you are lucky to play online games where broken matchmaking (which gets worse each ""patch"") doesn't kill your game, you will get bored as heck- read on why.So you joined the game, you just passed level 10 and you can't join a single game- what gives? Well, too bad, you missed the first wave of beta players boat and they don't give a heck about you. The active players play exclusively with each other and farm with each other. New players get to play with new players forever, but eventually they all quit as there is no incentive to play, which brings me to the following:Levelling up in this game is utterly pointless. You earn a few locked diamonds (you have to spend real money to unlock them) at level intervals but levelling up is so boring, tedious, mediocre and repetetive that you either realise what a waste of time playing this game is, or you slave away, losing your soul game by slaving game, until you reach level 25 and hate yourself for trying, because active players buy their way to level 100+ with real money bought boosts and exclusive groupies.This game is fun until level 5-10ish. After that, it becomes stupendously mediocre and repetetive.The only new and temporarily interesting content in the game is bought with real money through the in game currency (diamonds). You can earn some of this currency in-game, but it will be locked and unusable until you spend real money to unlock it. These items bought with diamonds are purely cosmetic- so after unlocking several cosmetic items, you realize what a total waste that was as there is no benefit to having more than 6 cosmetic items as you can only equip 2 sets of 3 items at a time.New content added to the game that can be unlocked using in game money (kudos) are all the same. Roughly once a month 1 to 3 new items are added but these items are identical to existing items (that you likely already own) and only differ in icon-appearance. New items are therefore always redundant, pointless and useless.I feel I have warned you enough by now, and if you ignore my warning and play this game and realise you should've listened, servers you right. Enjoy hating yourself. I'm getting sick of writing a review about this game, with its uninspiring, lame and unhelpful dev's who only cater for the select few level 100+ players that virtually fund this game by themselves.

Early Access Review
								AirMech is a wonderful blend of a futuristic cybernetic real time strategy and an overhead dual stick shooter. For me I like dual stick shooters and real time strategies, so this game felt like a joy to play. Then you throw in, single player, cooperative play and player vs player, there's a lot here for everyone to enjoy. It controls like a dual stick shooter, left stick to move, right stick to shoot. There are mouse controls for those without a 360 controller. Since you are an air mech, you can transform from a jet or helicopter by pressing the left trigger to a giant towering robot. On the ground you're much slower, but you can fight the ground troops with ease. Then if you need to get across the map or fight enemy aircraft, simply transform and fly there. You can buy upgrades during a match, but you'll need to pick them up from one of your bases. Different mechs have different weapons and abilities like a sword or bombs, but without powering up abilities they feel pretty useless compared to guns.The object of each game is to take the opposing player's (or bot's) home base. Its just that simple. Like a MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). Your home base generates computer controlled fodder troops. These troops will automatically seek out other bases and take them over. So if there is an abandon base on a map, they're sure to find it, but if there's a tank guarding the base, they're sure to die trying to take it.Each base requires four troops to capture it. These four troops then guard it from turrets on the top. If the enemy's fodder troops come, they'll just be mowed down. They just walk into their doom. Everything gives your mech experience to level up during the match.When you get low on health or low on fuel, just fly back to one of your bases. Each base is somewhat different and has a different amount of healers and refueling devices. The more devices, the faster you'll be healed and refueled. If you run out of fuel, you'll fly slower. Using your shield and extra abilities will drain fuel, but I can't say that I used it that often. You can even pick up a unit, hover over a base and refill the unit's health. If you can't make it back to a base, change to your robot form to slowly refuel. Its a nice system. If you die, you're out of the game for X amount of seconds before you respawn at your home base. You can speed up the time by one second for 2,000 or so credits. Credits are your in match currency.Since this is a real time strategy, you'll also be building and leading units to victory. You can pick them up, move them around, select them to command where they go. These units along with your upgrades require time to build them. Once they've been built, you pick them up at a local base, and put them on the ground, one at a time. It doesn't matter what base you pick up your units, just that its one of your bases. The units don't heal themselves like you can. Instead you'll have to rely on specific healing units that will recharge health of nearby allies. Each unit requires credits to manufacture them and their upkeep. So if you don't have enough credits to support a large army, you will need to drop a unit into a base to recycle it before you'll be allowed to make a new unit.Before you begin, you can chose from your inventory of units to assign them into a nine unit menu. So if you've got two-hundred units to chose from, you can only use nine types per match. These units are soldiers, vehicles, mechs, turret guns, cash generators, mines and so on. Everything that you'd expect from a real time strategy. You can also select your pilot, air mech and equipment for your mech.The different pilots each have different pros and cons. The default pilot Hawk has 10% credits, 5% credits earned, 5% unit build speed at the cost of 3% unit damage resistance and 7% air mech attack power. Each pilot has beautiful art work and there's something that fits your play style. You'll even find Youtubers as pilots done in the same beautiful artwork. I guess its a way to thank them for their publicity.The game does a great job of introducing you to the game without punching you in the face that there are micro transactions in the way of diamonds. It lets you get completely through the fifteen challenge tutorial. Each challenge is a quick tutorial you'll blow through in no time. There are even star rankings, so you can return for better ratings, but its so simple there's no need to other than experience and gold called kudos.Leveling up unlocks new parts, pilots, mechs and units that you still need to buy with gold (kudos). Its an easy system like every other gold (kudos) and experience system. To keep things interesting the achievements (quests) in game will also give you a bonus of gold for accomplishing them. Things like destroying ten tanks in a single match. You can even spend diamonds to get gold and experience boosters for those that don't like the grind, but really the grind is the game of chess that AirMech is. Every match feels enjoyable, not just that but every match feels fast paced, unlike other MOBAs that can last usually an hour. I'm no fan of MOBAs, I often get bored long before the match ends. They feel like true grinds, while AirMech is enjoyable because its not truly a MOBA.There are different air mechs to buy, either with default gold or if you want something unique you can purchase premium versions.  It doesn't look like there is any difference in statistics between the gold bought air mechs and their premium diamond counter-parts. The only difference is visual. You will look cool when flying your neon gothic helix helicopter or your BlackOps helix helicopter instead of your standard gold bought helix helicopter. Cosmetics are good way of doing micro transactions. However, I can still diamond buy an premium osprey helicopter without being a level 8 to unlock the default osprey helicopter.You can gold buy enhancements for your air mech and equip them in the hanger before you go into battle. Each piece of equipment that you put on takes up part points. To keep things balanced each mech only has so many part points. So do you want a fantastic shield or do you want several good upgrades instead? The choice is yours and you can have fun buying and tweaking your mech to your hearts desire.There are several play options, solo where you play by yourself in either skirmishes of 1 vs 1, 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 2, 2 vs 3, 3 vs 3 or a survival facing waves of enemies defending your home base. Survival turns into a tower defense game. The three survival maps are built in spirals allowing for multiple access points into the map. You'll need to cover them all if you're going to survive all the way through. You can also redo the challenges and tutorial in solo play.In player vs player you and an ally compete in 2 vs 2 matches and this is where it becomes a grind. It is a drastic departure from the fun and joy of playing against even a difficult computer opponent. Humans know what wins a match and how to keep from losing. This results in some matches that took me around two hours, before someone gave up. I'm ready to throw in the towel at twenty minutes during each match. I'm not willing to go back and play again, due to how dull and monotonous it is. Its not a knock against this game, so much as its a knock against all MOBAs. I just can't invest the time in one sitting for something that begins to feel like work.Since this is a competitive game, there's an area where you can just watch players play live. Its got an elegant filter that you can quickly find the type of match you're looking for. It lets you learn tactics without having to look up guides or watch videos, not to mention scout future opponents. Its a nice touch that keeps everything in game.I watched several matches to see things play out to understand what works and what doesn't.I ended up having a lot of fun without spending anything.

								AirMech is a mix of both simple 2d pvp and RTS style unit manipulation.   You choose the assortment of units you will be using for a particular battle with various advantages / disadvantages / costs / tradeoffs / etc...  There are multiple strategies that are viable, so it doesn't seem like there is merely one right path (though there are a few better ones).  Your command unit can similarly by selected for various tradeoffs, and then buffed up and modified with its item configuration.  This is where you may start to bump into the 'Free to Play' nuisance, as paid players will have more and better options to work with.  The premium currency is completely blocked from your usage until you buy some directly, so although it shows that you are earning some over time, you can't actually use any of it until you pay (so it is simply a carrot that grows).  AirMech mostly suffers from a limited player base, probably caused by its vaguely annoying F2P experience.  Its worth trying out, particularly with a friend, but it is unlikely to affix itself to your frequently play roster.			"

								AirMech it's actually a pretty cool blend between ""classic RTS"" and ""new ARTS"". Think of it like a Dota-like game where you have control of your creeps and you can actually produce said units and issue orders to them.Mix a 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 RTS skirmish where you only control your AirMech and produce units but not buildings, with an ARTS where you play objective gaming, capturing key buildings to expand your controlled territory and overrun your enemy until you destroy their stronghold.The game has an amazing soundtrack, the music complements the fast paced gameplay. Each AirMech has a diferent playstyle based on their unique abilities both in ground form and air form, and those can be enhanced based of the Pilot of your choice, who by his or her own, has their own stats to push even further the abilities of your AirMech, your loadout choice or compensate for  it's flaws.It's an amazing strategy game with a little twist of ""I take action by my own and make things happen"". Godammit, it's even Free to Play and by the time of this review weights less than 400mb. It's definitely worth a shot.			"

								This game handles free-to-play very well, and it is certainly not a pay-to-win game, basically the only thing you can get with cash in this game is cosmetic items, and honestly, I find myself buying a lot of these to deck out my airmechs and make them look cool, but another great thing about this game's economy is the pricing, you can get about 3 new airmechs for 5$ depending on how expensive they are.On to the gameplay, there are a wide variety of units to choose from which I think makes this game pretty interesting, I love unlocking new units and playing around with them. There are also a wide variety of airmechs, pilots and parts, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and there is a very large amount of customization in this game, which I love.I spend a lot of time playing this game now, and it's quite addicting, if you get this game, I would highly reccomend getting the starter kit for 10$ to get the full experience, but you should play the game a bit for yourself first to see if you yourself really like this game, because this game also does not push you into buying the premium version (Silver VIP), for example, when you have premium, you get diamonds (Cash currency) for getting cetain achievments, but if you get Silver VIP, any diamonds from achievments you would have obtained before you got Silver VIP will be stockpiled up, and you can collect all of them after getting Silver VIP. Probably one of the best parts about the starter kit is that you get enough diamonds to buy practically anything you want which is great.Overall this is a very fun and interesting strategy game, and I would highly reccomend playing it.After reading through this, I've realized that it almost sounds like I was payed to write this review, but I wasn't, it's just that good, Carbon Games is a great company, thank you very much for making this great game, and not being stingy with the pricing either!9/10			"

								its f2p but the limits vs VIP are a bit rough. your limited on how much pve you can do per day, you cant use the special currency you unlock from missions,you cant sell items on the market or even use the market chat channel,you get about half the exp and money per match VIP's get as well as a much much lower drop rate on items and units, the crafting system requires lvl 20 for f2p and requires blueprints that are very rare to get by the time i completed about 100 of the 145 missions in the game i hadnt found any at all,and the recent mech parts change has made it impossible to do anything but put basic parts in all slots or skip slots entirely to put on slightly better parts in others,the addition of the base system is a nice concept sadly to construct the buildings that provide exp or money % boosts etc your going to require blueprints for those as well. feel free to try it for a while it can be entertaining but in the long run its not worth it unless your planning to spend some cash.

								It's a great game and has unique gameplay; the fact that you can pick up your creeps and drop them behind enemy lines brings new tactics that are otherwise unavailable in other MOBA games. It also has great unit and character designs, with each having their own strengths, skills and weaknesses. Each Airmech (the player-controlled aircraft/combat mech) has VERY different strengths and abilities. No cookie-cutter, copy-and-paste stuff here. No sirree. This game also allows you to purchase a pack (Airmech Prime) that contains all the airmechs and a large number of units, pilots, and parts(for real money, obviously).Free players have access to all the content in the game (with the exception of the cosmetics and very few items). Some quests give diamonds (premium currency). Now for the bad news: for free players, ALL diamonds are locked until you make a purchase with real money (5$ or more). The game does allow you to take surveys for free diamonds, but I have received a single diamond for the waste-of-time surveys even though I received in-game mail saying that I got them.This game is pretty good, however, with very few flaws (that I've personally experienced thus far, so I cannot speak for everyone else). Obviously my only annoyance is the locked diamonds (I just want all my guys in red! That's literally all). I do, however, recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind paying a little money. I also recommend this game to free players who don't mind the locked premium currency that ""you get for free"".			"

								Well I've loved this game since I started playing.  It's undergone huge transformations.  Game play is addictive and fun.  It is a unique blend of action and rts.  Sadly I've feel as though the developers dismissed the PVP aspect of the game; in favor of making it easier for new players to adjust.  Odd truth, as is you could once customize your Airmech (MOBA) the way you wanted using various parts and items.  You can no longer use parts in pvp it was ""to hard to balance"".  There are two classes of PVP Ranked and Unranked.  The Unranked system you are now allowed to use purchase able ""Ultimate"" Items and Pilots which means unranked pvp is now pay to win.  The Ranked system has a very small player base.  Probably 4 or 5 people that play consistently. I had high hopes that this game would find it's own niche as an esport type game but with the way it is now the player base is dwindling ...... or I feel it is.  Old veterans of the game are leaving it behind.  I find it heartbreaking actually.  I'm not sure what the developers could do to save this game but I feel like it's dying a slow death. Although I would say it's worth taking a look at and playing.  I am just disheartened at what it has become. "

Airmech is moba style Games with some Real Time Strategy elements mixed in for a fresh spin on the classic moba gamestyle.Players control Airmechs, giant mechs that are able to transform into various planes and helicopters at the will of the pilot. There are currently nine different airmechs(as of me typing this) that players can choose from, and more designs are planned to be added in the future! Each of the nine different airmechs play differently, each are equiped with different kinds of guns, missiles, and melee weapons along with 8 preset upgrades that will be unlocked as the mech levels up each match. Each mech also has 8 slots for the many buildable tanks, soldiers, turrets, and other things that the player uses to help the team advance or defend an area. These eight units are picked by the player before the start of any match. In addition to the player built units, each teams fortress automatically spawns basic soldiers to help capture outposts and attack the enemy.In the base gamemode, two teams of atmost 3 Mech pilots(Players) fight each other to gain control of the outposts around the map while trying to advance to the enemy team's fortress and destroy it. The Outposts around the map work as unit builders, where players can pick up the various units they want to spawn during the match. Not a big PvP(Player versus Player) enthusiast? Don't worry! this gamemode is available in co-op mode(One team of players vs one team of AI controled Airmechs) and solo mode(one player and two AI vs an AI team).The other big gamemode is called Survival. This gamemode pits four players against an endless onslaught of enemy units, whose soul purpose is to destroy the team's fotress.Now you might be thinking: ""This all sounds really fun, but how pay to win is this game? Whats the catch?"" And thats just it, there is no catch. Anything that can alter competitive gameplay in any way is bought with ""Kudos"", the currency in this game that is earned at the end of every match. This stuff piles up quickly and is only earnable through playing the game, but don't worry, once you start playing you will never run out of kudos!So what costs actual money in this game? There is also another form of currency called diamonds. This currency is the ""premium currency"" of airmech. This premium currency is used to buy cosmetic items and Ultimate items, aswell as being the currency of the player market.Cosmetic items are things that make your Airmech look cool. these range from Airmech skins, unit skins, different laser and exhaust colors, helmets for your airmechs, and pets that fly around you. None of these have any effect on gameplay.Ultimate items are... well, Ultimate! These items are stronger versions of the buildable units and Airmechs that are normally usable. ""But you said that paid items won't alter gameplay!""I said competitive gameplay. Ultimates are only usable in cooperative gamemodes, so if anyone is using them, they will always be on your team. Ultimate units are really just used when you want to dominate the AI team without as much effort.Lastly there is the player market, where players can sell various cosmetics and items that are no longer sold in the shop for diamonds.Is it worth putting some money into this game? I certainly believe so. But whether or not you want to is up to you. I strongly suggest playing airmech for a couple of days before deciding to throw all of your money at the screen. If you don't want to put any money into the game, don't worry, we won't judge!Thank you for reading this review, I know it was a long one.I hope you give this game a try, and enjoy it as much as I do!

								Now this game if you played old sega games like i did this would most be like Herzog Zwei.  This looks like a remake of it which makes me happy because people still remember the game.  Now the gameplay is fantastic its not like starcraft where you just command units,in this you can command units (except some infantry) and fight the enemy.  But..... the game can be a bit unfair due to the fact you can buy premium items and good units,which of course the devs need money. But this game is great but heres the final verdict  7/10+for old gamers Herzog is back+easy to learn gameplaying mechanics-pay to win EX: ultimite bucky against a bucky-some airmechs are a bit unbalanced+nice chances of ramdom loot+a monstorus variety of stuff			"

								Imagine AirMech as a Transformers MOBA, but with CTP elements and a whole lot better than actual Transformers. AirMech feels so much fun to play, whether you're having an ""I'll play this for half an hour"" moment or an ""I think I'll try to save up for that AWESOME looking AirMech in the store"" moment. Either way, this game is simple to pick up, play and replay. However, putting it down is the hard bit...Think of it this way: I'm writing this review, I have a highly positive view on the game, and I've only played 6 hours or so AND it's in beta. If a game can make someone do that and it isn't even finished, then it definitely shows signs of a job well done+ Good Gameplay+ Good Graphics+ Great Music and SFX+ Immersive+ ""One more go...."" (Six Hours Later) ""ONE MORE GO!""- A bit fiddly at the start, but easy once you get the hang of it9/10 - See you on the battlefield			"

								This fast paced action real-time strategy game with a little flavour of moba, and has a little bit of everything. Flying mechs that can transform into planes and helicopters, pick up units and deploy them anywhere in the battlefield. You have to protect your own base, and have to keep attacking at the same time by taking over these little bases around the map, your goal is to destroy the main base of the other team.Try this game, it's free and still in beta.

								This game brings me back to my childhood of watching the old Transformers anime. If you want a great MMO/singleplayer  with great AIs for solo play and a plethora of multiplayer options, this game is for you. Also, another thing that I love about this game is that you can post in and purchase from a completely public market, where you can sell excess items for the special gem currency. You don't necessarily have to buy gems, either. They can be crafted (sometimes) or gotten from the market. The actual gameplay, also, is impeccable. Keyboard and mouse controls are available for almost everything, and are simple and easy to learn. The graphics are smooth and very well done. Finally, it is possible to fully customise your Mech with different skins, cosmetic changes, pets, and more. I love this game, and it is amazing, especially for a free game.			"

								Played over 130 hours in the past and really looking foward to come back to this game. 100% recommended, played almost 100% of the time with friends. You can play it totally free without the need to spend money in. I never played pvp and already spent so many hours in, imagine if I played pvp...+ Fun co-op game to play with friends+ Fun to play agaisn't friends (and randoms)+ Fairly decent ammount of content+ Great for casual and serious gamers+ A lot of challenges and achievements+ A lot of strategic option in your gameplay- Sometimes while playing with other player, the game might lag a lot- Not that fun to play alone, but you can have some fun playing with bots- Only 3 people parties (4 in survival), so if you have a lot of friends to play this with, you're gonna be able to play with 2 of them only- You got to spend money in the game once to liberate the market to sell stuff to other players and profitOverall the weaknesses of this game are small and don't affect your gameplay that much, you ain't gonna enjoy it 100% without spending money in it once, but even without spending, I still 100% recommend this.

								Since the player’s list of tasks is geographically diverse (units and turrets are produced at command hubs that can be captured, and must be ferried around the map) and incredibly time-sensitive, the player must hurry themselves breathlessly around the map being economist, logistics manager and combatant by turns, and shirking any of these duties is detrimental to their overall game state.Leave your build queue alone for too long, you’re depriving yourself of the support of the at times vital support of artillery, heavy tanks, or harass vehicles. Leave the front lines alone for too long, you’re leaving your units to be free money and levels for your opponent. Neglect your upgrades (which can only be applied at a structure, away from the frontlines) and you’re depriving yourself of tools to get yourself further ahead in the match.I would go so far as to say, and I do not say this lightly, that AirMech is one of the most mechanically demanding strategy games I have ever played. It is not quite as frenetic as StarCraft 2 can be, but barring that I cannot think of a game that puts this sort of onus on the player to act and think quickly. Making poor choices in game is immensely punishing in a way I am pressed to describe in a way that’d be meaningful to my audience. Just pumping out whatever units you want is giving away money and experience to the enemy. paying attention to the wrong thing for too long can lose you critical momentum and map control.And the beauty (in my mind) of this all is that the singular focus of the AirMech unit itself means that this game can be meaningfully played on a console. AirMech Arena for the Xbox One is in early access testing right now, and has been on the Xbox 360 for… I think about a year? Maybe a couple of months. The player is by needs a little less able to multitask, but the game is eminently playable with a controller.This is NOT a comprehensive overview of the game. I have not touched at all on the game’s monetization model, which sells unit types and AirMech upgrades (and could easily be considered to give advantage to players who are willing to drop money on purchasing these things, which is potentially problematic though I personally don’t mind the model) but… I had to take a moment and share the admirably focused design of the core game experience, which I cannot help but appreciate.

It is the most fair business model i have ever seen, and some of the top players in the game are F2P, which shows that it is definitely not P2W, but instead Pay2Pretty. I have been playing this game for almost 3 years, and it is the most fun i have ever had in a video game. Although it can be a tad confusing at first, the community is helpful and if you stick to coop and solo until you hond your skills, you'll be a great player in no time!Try it out, it's free!

								Loads of fun to play. It's a nice blend of League of Legends and Starcraft. You can sit down and play a round in 5 minutes or play all day if you want.The variety of units leads to a bunch of unique playstyles. Infantry, tanks, and artillery of different costs/power give you all sorts of options for attacking and countering your opponent. You also have to find the balance betwen spamming units and going commando with your AirMech which is alot of fun.The graphics look good and aren't very demanding (I can play this on my Windows 8 tablet if I don't max the settings).The game is free to play but you have to pay if you want cosmetics (just like League of Legends). There are two in-game currencies. You earn Kudos for playing and can spend them to unlock new units. You earn Diamonds by paying money and use them to unlock skins and cosmetics.The game is great but keep in mind that it's still in beta. Units and maps are being rebalanced all the time. Sometimes the servers have problems and make the game laggy for a little while. That's all part of beta and totally expected.AirMech rocks!			"

								AirMech is an RTS game crossed with Action/MOBA style gameplay. You control an AirMech, which can pick up, move, and order units, dogfight with other Mechs, and transform into a walking robot to get in on the ground action. It runs very smooth, even on older systems, and only takes up about 250MB of disk space. THERE IS NO PAY2WIN, so if you're looking to buy your way up the rankings, then GTFO. The game is still in development for PC, Xbox, Android, and more platforms in the future. The developers are indie, so they pay attention to the players. Sometimes you'll see them in chat answering questions and talking about new things. Be sure to yell at them until they know how grateful you are for producing such an awesome version of Herzog Zwei (Sega Genesis, 1989-90).			"

-Quick Review-AirMech is a Multilayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) developed by Carbon Games and released on Steam in 2012. I personally felt like AirMech was a combination of Command and MOBA game mechanics.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There isn't much to say about the story in AirMech (that seems to be the theme among MOBA's these days, doesn't it?). The tutorial gives a type of story, “you're pilot of an AirMech” (Robot that can switch between Transformer-smash-your-face-mode and flying-harbinger-of-destruction) ...and that's about where the story stops and they say “okay screw it, you don't really care, you just want to learn the controls and blow stuff up.”Gameplay: The controls are very straight forward, you use ASDW for up, down, right, left. Mouse to aim, shift to toggle between robot and flight modes, number keys for quick building selections, and a set of other shortcuts to make your response time faster and give commands to units.Generally against the AI you don't need to learn and master these controls... you can learn them at your own pace... HOWEVER, if you want to get into the competition …Learn 'em and learn 'em quick, or else you won't last.One final note about the Gameplay is that there are a few different game modes, you're not exclusively forced to play with others, or do battles against other places. The game modes are as follows: Solo, Co-op, PvP, CTF, Survival, Challenges, and Campaign. (It was announced during the beta)Achievements: AirMech has 101 achievements (06/10/15) at the time that I'm writing this review, I have 62% of these achievements, and have given up on the hope of getting 100% completion, because some of the achievements require spending real money on the game.Price: AirMech is free to play, however, many features in game are locked unless you spend real money, many other features you can purchase with in-game rewards. To some people this is “pay-to-win”, but most of my battles were by myself against AI, so I didn't mind it.Conclusion: In conclusion, AirMech is a solid game, plays well, fun to do by yourself or with/against friends. I recommend this game because of that. But I would warn fellow achievers that this game isn't an easy “100% completion” you will need time, luck, skill, and money to get all of these achievements.I recommend AirMech to MOBA players, people who are looking for a different game style to play, or anyone who has time to play Free Games. ------Edits and updates------Edit/Update June 14, 2015:Redid this review on 06/11/15 to modernize it, don't worry you didn't miss anything in the old version.

								I remember playing an early version of this about 2 years ago and it was good. Now there are a series of tedious unskippable campaign missions. The NPC dialog covers most of the UI. I can't see how many credits I have. The minimap is sometimes just withheld. I can't see how many skill points I have to spend. Finally, after all the campaign missions, you get to build the main menu?I know this is early access but the game was fun 2 years ago and they've just added a bunch of hoops to jump through.			"

								Game is well polished, good gameplay somewhere in there, terrible matchmaking.If you play this game, expect to be pubstomped immediately and quickly.  This is due to a low player poll that this game has to pick from and a supposed excess of smurf accounts.If you want to pick up this game for the solo/co-op survival content, be my guest, fun stuff.  But matchmaking against other players without lots of experience and knowledge will get you stomped into the ground. Much like most ARTS, this game has a steep learning curve, if you wish to play it expect to do some homework.			"

								Incredibly fun game with surprisingly a lot of depth. Its a good combination of MOBA and RTS. Its still in Beta so features are still being added and bugs are still being fixed. Its free to play with the option to pay for cosmetics. It can take awhile to unlock everything for free (kinda like League of Legends) but the easiest to use units are the cheapest.There are several different game modes where you can play COOP against the AI or PvP against other players.The basics are pretty easy to learn. Tactics like just spamming troops only work against unskilled players or the AI. I would definitely recommend COOP for awhile until you get the hang of things (and to try out new tactics and unit combinations). You can win a COOP game in under 5 mintues by just massing units but you will find yourself wrecked if you try to spam units against a skilled player in PvP.PvP is super fun but there is a huge spread as far as skill/strategy goes. I've absolutely destroyed less skilled players and have been absolutely destroyed by better players. I found it really helpful to spectate games played by skilled players to see what they do. The action is non-stop and super intense when you're playing against someone good (if your AirMech isn't constantly donig something, you're doing it wrong). Fortunately, the match-making system sorts you by skill levels (but you can still end up playing a skilled player if there aren't many people in match-making).That said, I love AirMech. Coop is fun and relaxed while PvP gets the heart pumping. The developers are involved and listen to feedback. The community is small but friendly and helpful. You should definitely give AirMech a try!			"

Early Access Review
								This game used to be one of my faves. Before we start off, this game was in alpha and beta for like 2 years, and now they moved it in to early access. Its initial release was somewhere around 2012 or 2013, and honestly there has only been new classes and units, a few new maps and tons of skins and rares to collect that are for real-cash. This game used to be pretty good but it now only stands for veterans, because the matchmaking is extremely poor and you'll always have this one guy who is just going to do everything. The strategies in this game is more irritating than anything, where sometimes the enemy is just going to go straight to your main base and attack it no matter how many anti-mech units you put over there. I would say the game is balanced to a degree though so atleast there's that.The skins and rares to collect are swarming all over the game and its basically all real-cash. None of it is required, the game is 100% free but its really annoying when everyone are showing off their stuff and talking about it and how the market consists of like 80% collectors stuff. Some exclusive stuff are now also free, so that kinda frustrated me but i tried to not bother. Co-op and survival can be fun but it just doesnt hold up, especially when the multiplayer PvP is the core, which is unplayable becuz your win is based on luck.			"

								Honestly, When you get into the game, just stick to it. after a little bit you will start enjoying it. It is the only game in my Library that I never get bored of, Yes even the Famous Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike Series get boring eventually, But Airmech just feels like there is soo much more. Maybe its just beause its in beta, but the excitement of watching the game update is something that captivates me. As I say again, they game may not look apealling when you download it, but get past one level and become lvl 2, then see if you don't like the game anymore (I doubt it).			"

								This is a great game, it combines strategy elements with moba elements, you can control and build and micro manage your whole army, or you can just go john rambo and take on units head-on by yourself, (though not recommended on behemoths and devastators.) There are many different mechs you can control thatserve many different purposes. My favourite one is the warthog, because of its survivability and large damage per second, though it is not very good at supporting large armies, it can just be part of the army and combine a fully upgraded warthog and about 4 devastators with a few repair units, go straight for the base, because of your ground-to-air ability, you can quickly finish off damaged airmechs.

I wish they would put the Ultimates back to the way they were and bring back the ultimate striker!			"

								Review In Short:Airmech is an Action RTS game taht takes a twist on the genere of RTS gaming. This game is a mix of DOTA/LoL with a game like Starcraft. You control a character/hero that is your Airmech and there are creeps that spawn from your main base every so often. You can build your own units to fight by your side from a vast selection of units. Gameplay is usually fast and intense with plenty of aerial dog fighting and battlfield micro. This game is casual player friendly with opportunities for the more competetive player.Only problems are if you're an Aussie, finding people to play with can be quite difficult. Lag is also an issue if you are an Oceanic player.Feel free to add me in game and set me as your referrer (shameless self-promotion :P ). My name is VIRUSALPHA and I'm one of the few Australian players.Pros:+ LOTS OF CUSTOMISATION ( A CRAPTON OF CUSTOMISATION POSSIBLE)+ Fair Business Model+ Not pay to win+ Casual player friendly+ Intense gameplay+ Frequent updates, balance changes and bug fixesCons:- Not many Oceanic players- Meta shifts frequently post updates (which may or maynot be a good thing)- Meta meta meta. A lot of high tier players use the same tactic, strategy and loadout. People like to use the best units, best setup and best strategy. However if you're skilled enough you can work around it. Can be stale.Slightly Longer Review:(Adding on to the above)The meta shifts A LOT when big updates come and rapidly change after balance changes. This is probably a good thing, however the game can become borning when everyone adopts the meta. There is a tremendous selection of pilots, airmechs, parts and units. The problem is balance. Achiving perfect balance and harmony is far from near. Thier are hunderds of units to use but generally high tier players pick the same 8-10. Why? because those units are best. There's tons of pilots but players tend to choose 3 because they are the best. There's 9 airmech classes but professional mainly use 3. This is just one of my dissatisfactions of the game. There are units/mechs/items that completely outclass others which is sad. Balance is yet to be achived in this game which is forgiveable because it's still in BETA.The game's busienss model is fair, or even great. Everything can be purchased for in game currency which is amazing. A casual player can unlock plenty of items in 1 day. You can unlock all units, pilots and items for in game currency which is amazing. This currency is called Kudos. The premium currency in this game is Diamonds and the game gives you 500 to start with. With thos amount you can buy whatever you please but you CANNOT BUY POWER. You can earn diamonds through quests but these diamonds are locked until you make a purchase of anything in game and obtain silver VIP or higher. It's an incentive for you to invest money in the game with the smallest purchase avaiable being $5USD.Generally diamonds are used to buy cosmetics to look fancy and ultra classy. You can buy Ultimate Variants of units which are UNBALANCED AND SUPER OVERPOWERED ""BUT"" these can only be used in solo play, player vs AI (co-op) and custom games. These units cannot be used in regualr (unranked or ranked) PvP. Generally these items are for noobs :P Hence, upon starting the game you receive a random ultimate unit in your inventory. New players these days are VERY LUCKY. You get free items and cosmetics as you play the game. This is just a taste of what you get when you purchase diamonds. It's an incentive to purchase diamonds and if you do I suggest gettin the starter pack as it gives you best value for your money. So try out this game if you havent already. If you don't like it, simply uninstall.This game has a drop system. In this drop systems you can receive crates, cosmtics, pets, consumale items, stuff and rare unit alternatives which cannot be purchased normally. This drop system is fair and gives you cool stuff which you can sell on the player market if you wish.The market is acessable when you reach level 10 which isn't hard at all even for a casual player. At this level you can purchase stuff on the market. At level 50 you can sell stuff on the market. All items on the market are sold for premium currency. Unfortunately reaching level 50 is gonna take A LONG TIME. However after a purchase and obtaining silver VIP the marketis instanly acessable and for use. If you are not a VIP after selling an item you only get 30% of the diamonds you sold your item for with the rest being locked. So for instance if you sell a hat for 100 diamonds, you only get 30. There is also an in-game tax of 15%. So if you want to sell and earn 100 diamonds, your item will be listed for 115 diamonds. Once sold you get you 100 diamonds.There's loadouts in which you can customise evrything you need for a game. You can choose up to 8 different types of units to put into your loadout. There are infantry, light vechicles, trucks, tanks, big tanks, even bigger tanks, artillery, healing, radar units, traps, turrets and socket units that provide speical effects. You have a 9th slot for a guardian that provides unquie effects such as healing, radar and for extra damage out put. In your loadout you can customise your airmech. You can change airmechs, customise its parts, change cosmetics and a whole lot of other stuff. You have a slot for an item which provide small buffs. Finally there is a space for your pilot which is very important as pilots usually depeict your play style.The game has a crafting system which lets you craft a wide range of items but is restricted on current items you habe and your level.In terms of gameplay you will always be using your airmech to carry your units across the map. You can pick your units up and micro them. There are mass commands for macroing. Tanks are the main unit composition with support units such as healing and radar/artillery jamming. There are many ways to play this game. This game features outposts. Once captured they provide different effects and raise your upkeep. Yes you have upkeep. You use hot keys to build units and collect them from eitehr your fortress or outpost to place on the ground and assign commands. Outposts and fortresses provide healing. Outposts are occupied by 4 infantry/creeps and can be neutralised by killing all 4. You can capture an outpost by filling it with 4 of your own infantry or creeps. You can use the outpost to your advantage by healing from it and producing units and deploying them from there. Generally if you have more outposts than the other guy you're well ahead in winning the game. There some sockets on your fortress and sometimes a few on your outposts. You can socket your ""socket"" units onto these to activate them or provide buffs to turrets. To are 2 ways of winning a game. The first is by having your opponent leave :P The other way is by reducing your opponent/s fortress health to 0. There 2 ways to go about it. You can do it traditionally by knocking on their door with an army/convoy of tanks or by capturing all outposts on the map putting you into the dominating postition. While the enemy in in domination their fortress slowly takes adamage after a 30 second warning. This game mechanic promotes movining out and not slwo turely gameplay.This game often referrences other games and has special events often. For example you can find the Portal Cube, Sentry Turret, and Minecraft Creeper in game. Also the game also features a referral system in which you receive rewards. That's why you can find Total Biscuit, The Cynical Brit, HuskyStarcraft and Chimmney Swift in the game. Oh yeah about these events, special seasonal items are sold. Such as in Easter you can buy a Jesus pilot and during Christmas you can buy Santa.If RTS is not your thing the game is often called FarmMech as you have a basecamp.... You can grow and builds stuff... It's like Farmville... heh. Bunny Farm OP			"

Early Access Review
								Let's just start this off with one simple statement: This game is a joke.Now, although this game does have a good amount of content and can be replayed (Though only if you're with a few friends and can find some fun tactics to try) somewhat for at least 50 or 60 hours. After that and you're probably going to want to invest in their ""VIP system..."" Which just seems to be ever so slowly growing so that this game is less and less of a free to play and more of a, ""Free to try some of the content."" game.I started playing this game quite some time ago, and although I can't say I'm the most experienced player, I have had the chance of seeing this game grow, change, and (d)evolve. It started as a rather unique game with a good basis and a lot of potential. Updates rolled through occasionally bringing new content, maps, features, etc. and the community grew rather well. And much like many games, everything changed  when the fire nation attacked  when development seemed to slow to a halt. Now the game was much more cosmetic driven and it seemed to simply be held together by a few regular players, the newbies that flowed in at a constant rate, and the seasonal items- which was really the only ""content"" added.From here the game shifted... as I said, from a nice game that some people would play and toss, having had their fun, and others would find much joy into something much worse. It became a pay-gate game. Slowly features left, like the market listings and ability to sell your  oh so valuable  loot for a few measly diamonds (The in-game common currency that has a oh so familiar real world transaction rate) or market chats, etc.. There were levels of VIP too, bronze, silver, gold, and diamond. Obviously paying more meant you got a better rank (Going up as appeared), allowing you to gain wonderful bonuses, like increased funds from games, more experience, and access to useful features like the market. So where does this leave us? Well, ever so intelligent me gave in after putting what felt like many, many hours into the game and having a lot of fun, though the magic was lost and I was losing interest, I decided I would put down my fifteen dollars during the winter sale and get silver VIP and unlock these cool features. Originally I was on the fence, but upon seeing that  not only  would I get diamonds, market chat, market listings, better plots (A cheap gimmick that deserves to be in a mobile game, though that's not what I'm here to discuss.) among other things, and the cherry on top, the tipping point for my decision, an incredible all access map editor and creator. So I slapped my money down and felt good about my purchase.I worked on and off on multiple maps, finally ending up with one super map that I intended to be incredible. A map that would rival any other map that had been created by devs or fans in size and quality... With this new dream map in mind I set off to create it, working as much as possible, when time allowed. During this game I noticed more and more things shift towards this ""VIP"" experience and saw more and more things fall off the ""F2P"" model.And here we are, as of writing this, I logged into Airmech fully excited to work on my map now that school finals were over and I could return to my glorious map that was nearing completion. I clicked towards the map make, paused deciding first to check the store as I noticed an update had released recently changing and adding some things. Nothing new, not at least in the  real  content section. Nothing that added gameplay value or made me want to terribly come back. But none the less I checked and curiously noticed that there was a plot item for map creation (That I had already purchased) to my surprise and it said I needed Diamond VIP for access. Concerned I navigated over to the map creation section and  bam  it was gone. The only thing I cared about in this utterly trash game that the devs seem to be driving into the ground for the sole goal of making money, no matter how much it screws their fanbase (Who has already payed for this game, though they- I - Probably shouldn't have.) over.So I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't expect anything out of this game. Don't pay money unless you are 100%, absolutely, without a doubt, convinced that you will be playing this game for ages, putting down hours on hours consistently. Make sure you are willing to pay for diamond VIP and that you are willing to have everything you  already  payed for taken away at a moments notice. If not, then sure play the game but keep in mind what I have said and you'll do find. That's all then, it's a mediocre game with failed potential and a dying fan base and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developers.-----------------------------------Note: if you do intend to respond to this, please do the follwing.1. Make sure you have put at least 50-60+ hours into the game, have played all airmechs, all gamemodes, bought VIP, and interacted with the community.2. Do it respectfully, don't get upset because you are a diehard fan for this game (Or ignorant player who has just recently gotten into it and is still under the ""New Game Syndrom"")3. Make sure you have actually read what I've said... It may sound stupid but, really.  READ IT OR DONT REPLY 4. Have a good day'Almost forgot to mention... It is still better than Archeblade.			"

								Don't judge by the Steam record, I've played this game ever since it hatched onto Google Chrome. I'm so suprised so many people don't even familiar with this game's name. It is an amazing piece of works. The gameplay mechanics is second-to-none, the community is superb, and friendly and so helpful. I've never been so welcomed in a free-to-play game like this one. And if you're a fan of Mecha, there are no ways you're not going to love this game.Basically, Airmech is still in Beta now. However, the Campaign is coming out soon thereafter, with a price, which is well worth it if you got to know about the game's core mechanics.Pros:+ Innovative and unparalleled Tower Defensive/Offensive Mechanics.+ Extremely eye-catching visual and physical effects.+ Small size in terms of physical memory: Only ~300MB.+ Smooth framerates when the network is stable.+ Amazing community. Many people are very actively helping the new guys.+ The sense of achievement is amazing. Almost everything can be earned just by playing.+ Well-rounded and balanced gameplay mechanics, even basic loadouts with low-leveled units can be as powerful as the high-end sets. The items and units are all made with positive effects as well as trade-offs, forcing you to think strategically before getting them from the shop. The game is completely fair.Cons:+ Doesn't support offline mode.+ Friend list is a LITTLE BIT awkward. My friends and I had no idea how to add each other at first.+ The servers are sometimes infuriatingly laggy.Overall Score: 8/10. Highly recommended. Strategy fans will absolutely love this game.			"

								Airmech, giant robots blowing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other while commanding other smaller drones to attack the opposing team's fortress. What's there to say. That's not without it's flaws though.Pros:Solid GameplayWeekly rewardsDouble XP and item drop eventsCan be played alone or with teammatesRewards VIP membersA new campaign is emergingNewer features are being addedVast amounts of units and customization to get your mech in the best fighting conditionCake :3Cons:REGION LOCKED LOBBIES (Good luck trying to play with that guy from the United States if you are from Australia and need help with Warzone, used to be global before an update implamented Region lock)Can get really repetitiveUsing the old lobby systemQuests can be really diffuclt to complete due to afformentioned region lock.Despite the flaws, Airmech is a solid Mecha game. For those who still need their daily dose of Macross Missile Massacre, hop into your Helix Mecha and unleash hell. "

								A fantastic game. It's much like MOBA games (Dota 2, LoL, etc.) but also a RTS (Real Time Strategy). In this you play as a robot and you can transform into different ""AirMechs"" like helicopters and jets, etc. There are plenty of pilots though you get to pick one of three at the start and unlock the rest while you play. As soon as I started playing this, I found myself 3 hours later still in it. Great game and I would recommend at least giving this game a shot. At 236 MB or so it's worth the time.			"

								Sadly, I'm too biased to give a proper recommendation for this game. I played Herzog Zwei (1989) on the SEGA Mega Drive II, and this game is pretty much the spiritual remake. Infact, there's nothing spiritual about it; it's exactly the same.. Modernized, of course, but still. . .I whole-heartedly recommend that you at least give this game a go. It's free, it's 200mb, the tutorial starts as soon as you choose your character name. It's one of those easy-to-learn, hard-to-master games. You can't get it much simpler, so please give it a shot or two. If you get into it, let me know; I could use an extra sparring partner or two.--For those wanting to know what the game is about, in a nutshell:The player controls an AirMech, a commanding officer and the number one threat to players on the battlefield. The bird's-eye camera is locked with your mech centered and you move around with WSAD or a gamepad.. If you die, after some time you will respawn at your main base. The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy's main base.There are pre-placed outposts on the map which, once captured, serve as a pick-up point for any units you have queued to build. When placing units on the field, you choose orders for them, including; hold position, attack enemy, capture base. You do not directly interact with the units like in other RTS games (click to move), moreso give them guidelines to follow before dropping them from your aircraft for the AI to control.There's plenty of room for strategies and counters, most of which rides on your loadout; the game has several unique AirMechs to choose from and tens of units to unlock, but you can only enter a match with 8 blueprints at your disposal. You better choose wisely.			"

Notwithstanding the graphics of this game, the fact that surprised me was its download size which was just 200 MB and this made me extremely happy as downloading at 40kbps isn't that fun. i immediately downloaded steam client   and Airmech.Played it for 4 hours continuous until mom took over the house at 11 pm as i was not shutting down the computer.

The gameplay is fun, though it's a twin-stick shooter, the RTS element is nice and enjoyable, though the only problem is you can just buy the best kind of turret from the git-go and spam it until you automatically win the game. Other than that, the Airmechs have nice variety, the skins are worth it, and it is altogether an amazing game.			"

Arcade style freedom of movement and controls mashed together with a truly unique Real Time Strategy system. Lots of units to choose from to create effective unit combinations to bring into matches. The game play is quick, but allows for short and long term strategies. Different game modes COOP/PVP/Survival. A campaign mode is also going to be released eventually. I stopped playing Starcraft 2 because I enjoy this game so much more.			"

								Where should I start about this game? Well, mainly an RTS (If you've played Starcraft/Warcraft/Supreme Commander, this will feel familiar), except also with a mash of a few other things, like Territories from Halo & CoD with the way the maps are laid out. If one of your few quams w/ regular RTS gamesi is the lack of a DIRECT contribtion (other than being the ENTIRE ♥♥♥♥ING BRAINS of your military), then good news: Every person gets an ""airmech"" (hence the game's name), w/ which you can fly around, transporting troops & giving them some cover fire if you feel the need. Different mechs can do different things, such as: Steal units with the Saucer, launch quintillions of missiles as a Helix, turn invisible whilt piloting the Neo, & give your troops aura buffs as the Paladin... & there are more than that! Did I mention that they can switch between air & land mode? Well, they can. ;D I just have a few minor issues, such as the number of maps... there are only like 8 or 10. All in all, this is an excellent game. So get it. Besides, the game is FREE, for♥♥♥♥♥♥s sake.			"

								I absolutely love this game. A mix of MOBA/RTS where creeps are commandable... This game has a great community, a great set of developers active in the community and good game moderation. The game is NOT pay to win. Units can be earned and ELO based matchmaking limits ""pay exclusive"" units and parts out of the game. The actual competitive game is exclusively limited to units available to everyone whether they pay or not.On the other side for 9.99 the Starter Pack gives you 7500 diamonds (a very large amount of ""pay"" currency), VIP status in game along with lots of boosts. Lots of diamonds to buy cosmetic upgrades for the various airmechs.It's free to play, give it a shot. The game has a lot of depth and unlike most other MOBAs the community is full of more great people than horrible people. Also unlike most other MOBAs the game is legitimately fun!			"

								I remember a sega genesis game named Herzog Zwei. This is that game, given an udate. I also recall the single player version to be fun and somewhat addictive. This version allows play with up to four other people, as did the original...the difference here is the other three don't have to be sitting in YOUR place, sucking down YOUR Mountain Dew and eating your Cheetos. :)Seriously, this thing was fun for me then, it is now. Oh, the base game is free, which is to say a fair shake of content, easily competative to anyone that's spent money on the game. I recommend giving it a try. Play every man for himelf, (I think?) 2 vs. 2, (I've played this one!) or just the two of you. Or alone, even. Did I mention it's free? If you don't like it, delete it. What do you have to lose?			"

								An ambitious game that combines moba style arena gameplay with elements of real time strategy and the great twist of playing transforming mechas, which act as the typical class types that can be selected.The game presents itself well after numerous patches of added content. Although the rate at which is fairly limited. Gameplay can be extremely fluid and positioning on maps key. The slightest advance or attacks could prove pivitol in an intense match. Like with most modern RTS games core units such as tanks, mecha soldiers are evident. Not to forget the transforming mecha that one plays as. Thrown in as well are a few experimental units.Kudos being the in game currency which can be used to purchase numerous in game items, exception to diamond required costs. Its always pretty to cool to see references in from the video game community added to the game. Such as the Total Biscuit being an in game pilot or the suicide creeper unit from Minecraft.Sometimes the game feels empty with long waiting queues and annoying lag periods in game due to peer to peer connection to note a few unfortunate negatives. Contrary a worthy attempt creating such a varied game genre combination(yet to wait for full game release).			"

								This is one of my favorite PvP games!!...reminds me of Herzog Zwei, a great game on Sega Genesis. You're a mech that can change from a ship into a humanoid robot, armed w/weapons. There's planes, helicopters, flying saucer, etc. You build & control a huge variety of units such as tanks, robots, bikes, cannons, etc. The objective is to destroy the enemy's main base, after taking over enough smaller & Neutral bases.It has PvP modes 1v1 or 2v2, plus PvAI modes, lots of pilots to choose from w/unique abilities, etc.It's a pretty fast-paced shoot em up, with heavy strategy & tons of micromanaging.The game seems to be updated often & it's FREE to play.The only problem w/Airmech is that i never found many people who play it.I guess folks are mostly playing WoW & LoL, but i check back now & then to see what's new.Try it out & add me if you like it, i may get back into it.9/10 game, but if nobody's playing, that makes it unplayable as regular PvP.

								AirMech is a F2P MOBA-RTS hybrid that brings tons of fast-paced action and hours of fun.With its pretty artstyle and interesting charcters/units, AirMech puts the player in the boots of several AirMech pilots, each with their different bonuses and downfalls.The AirMechs themselves are the in-game player avatars, each one fills a different role and all of the AirMechs can, as the name suggests, switch between a air-mode and a mech-mode. The AirMechs are all balanced, as long as you know what you're doing there's always a chance to crush your opponents and avoid defeat!The RTS aspect of the game features the construction of defenses, resource buildings and special units. Creeper units spawn regularly, all creepers move to secure outposts which in return weakens the enemy fortress shield, allowing players and creep alike to destroy it.Oh and all of the AirMechs are obtainable through the standard in-game currency (Kudos), no need for premium currency nor hours of frustrating grinding as you can earn the same rewards offline versus bots as you do versus other players online.I'm sure many of you would avoid F2P games due to the risk of playing something that is ""Pay2Win"", no need to worry about that with AirMech; the premium currency (Diamonds) can only buy you cosmetic items and super-units that are restricted to PvE Co-Op/Survival action.The developers themselves, Carbon Games, are a very chill bunch of guys and gals, promoting fair and fun gameplay for all AirMech players.Even the overall community is very noob-friendly and casual, you will see many people just casually chatting, inviting people to games for some fun etc.Overall my only complaint is that right now there's only about 8 AirMechs, i'm going to assume that the devs will add more to increase variation in the game etc.If you have the time, i truly recommend trying this out. Be warned though, it's highly addictive!			"

								  This game is awesome, as long as you remember that it is in Beta...  There have been several updates (eg: Auto Deploy Arm) that have caused the playerbase to fall from time to time, but these changes - even those you may not like - are a part of playing a Beta state game.Some Great things about the game itself:  - Dota meets RTS (with prebuilt buildings to capture/deploy from).  - Massive Unit list to fully customise your loadout (from Infantry to Tanks to Artillery/Turrets and Support).  - Increasing list of Parts to customise your AirMech performance with.  - Pilots and Items to enhance your play style.  - CO-OP & PVP Leaderboards for weekly prizes.  - Simply an insane amout of purely ""cosmetic"" flair and pets to show off your personal Style (obtainable with premium ""Diamonds"" currency, generally bought with real cash).  - Seasonal Promotions in the Shop.  - Player Market.  - A Basecamp to build, with crops to generate free ""Kudos"" - also earnt just by playing (free ingame currency).  - Nanoforge (the crafting craze continues in AirMech...).  - All critical gameplay Units & AirMechs obtainable with Kudos.Some Great things about the Community in AirMech:  - Helpful & Friendly.  - MODS keep faction chat in check (Plus the ingame Swear Filter option helps).  - Diamond Rolls (sponsored by players) share Diamonds via a Chat minigame - Click those Dice! Highest and lowest numbers win Diamonds!  - Factions help newer ones to learn the game     I am the Leader of ""[Rise]"" Faction, contact me ingame for an invite to [Rise], there i am known as Dartis.     Some Factions also have Joining requirements, something to strive for.  - For those that sign up to the Forums, there are Giveaways hosted by Generous AirMech Members and Players.Some things new players confront when just starting:  - Diamonds! As said, these are the Premium currency obtainable with real money (generally).  - Market. There are Distinctive benefits (like reduced Tax) for those that are at least Silver VIP ($5USD) over those that are unable to (or choose not to). This makes selling on the Market (and earning those precious Diamonds) harder for those F2P'ers (however this isn't necassary to play or be good at the game itself).  - Kudos. Even though you will gradually earn Kudos, some players find it takes too long to buy everything they need to play (but please don't spend your early Diamonds on these things, you may regret it later).  - PVP. Ranked PVP doesnt allow Parts or Ultimates but Unranked PVP does. This has led to some believing AirMech is now P2W as Ultimates are only available with Diamonds. However Ultimates were 'nerfed' a few patches back and are not as OP as they used to be, they now only give an advantage. As an incentive, ""Honor"" was released for those who play PVP Without Ultimates against those that Do - earn enough Honor and you'll unlock some exclusive stuff...Overall, I love Airmech. Between playing CO-OP, learning PVP, playing the Market, ""ChatMech"", ""FarmMech"", Diamond Rolls (or the Ever OP ""Black Diamond Roll"") there is enough content here to have kept me entertained for years! Just remember its a Beta state game and so will you!Sign Up through this Link to recieve an additional 1000 Kudos to get started with!http://airme.ch/1BhNmCi "

								AirMech® is a mixture of popular MOBA's such as Dota 2[blog.dota2.com] and League of Legends[na.leagueoflegends.com] combined with lots of entertaining strategy aspects of an RTS. This game is VERY fun, especially with friends, and the matches are quite fast paced, ranging from 8-20 minutes. However, if you are planning on going into a PvP game, make sure you have a good idea of what you are doing, as Match Making can be a bit unforgiving with who you are up against. AirMech's large varity of Units, Pilots and Mechs to choose from, allows for lots of different strategies and playstyles, meaning that each game won't always be the same against different enemy players. The controls are fairly easy to learn and pick up, and the dogfights are always quite exciting to play out. Keep in mind when playing this game though, if you want the best units, gear, AirMechs, cosmetics or EXP/Kudos gain, then you must purchase a VIP Membership. Fortunately, having a VIP Membership won't put you at an extreme advantage against other free players, keeping the playing-field fair.A very entertaining, free game that is definitely worth your time, 8.5/10			"

								AirMech is a unique fast paced rts game. Made with PvP as a main focus the game is competetive and fun. It's almost hard to describe how this game is played because it has so many factors yet remains fast paced. If you recognize the following games this will  be much easier for you to understand. Airmech is (in my mind) a sort of fast paced supreme commander using some Moba elements such as creep flow. The unit Varity is huge and fairly balanced when you factor in airmech assistance. Since the game is small it's easy to download to simply try. Easy to learn, impossible to master. I recommend this game.			"

								A fun little free MOBA with co-op and competitive modes. Adds a bit more RTS as you can place units. Is a fast paced game and rewards are reasonable for your playtime. Is not pay to win!			"

								Airmech is awesome! When you are tired of playing DOTA and DOTA 2 you can simply download this game and install it. It is DOTA much like game plus you can customize your in-game character. Also you can buy extra soldiers for seizing an absolute victory. I haven't gone far on this game but I think it is wicked awesome. :)			"

								AirMech is a great indie F2P game that is currently in beta, which is created by the developer Carbon Games.AirMech puts a twist on the already familiar concept of DOTA with that, the hero (AirMech), you choose is able to have two forms, an aircraft that can fly for fast movement and troop transport, and a slower moving, ground, robot mode, that can deal more damage.In-game combat is simple. You get to train units that you can pick up in aircraft mode and drop down to capture enemy bases - along with the creeps that spawn from your and your opponents bases - and also attack enemy bases in your ground mode. There are quite a veriaty of AirMechs to choose from, ranging from the Osprey which is a medic Airmech, to a Warthog which is a minigun weilding, high damaging AirMech.			"

								It is a very fun and although it seems it may not be, simple rts. It has a unique stlye of gameplay so there is not anything to compare it to. Its free so I reccomend you at least try it. Also, there is Micro Transactions but NONE of it is pay to win. I found this game really fun to play with friends and to just give a try. Also, a tip to make sure you have alot of fun with it is, to start off find something you like to do thats special. I spammed turrets and had a blast shredding incoming waves in seconds. after you find something special roll with it for awhile and then try something else. It keeps the game going. Also, the community is VERY nice and funny and overall amazing.			"

								Despite the fact that it's impossible to get into a single online match, the game is very entertaining! Each Airmech has thier strengths and weaknesses and a massive unit selection for stealthy players or proffesional warriors. In chat, when stating a object, Airmech, pilot, or Airmech parts it'll be highlighted and give details about it so you know what the player is talking about. The airmechs can all level up so you can get more/better parts for your airmech. I also love this game because there are specific chats you can use like Market or Global. Market is for selliong items to other players while Global could be used to explain why you're the most badass Helix player ever! There are plenty of difficult and easy challenges for the player to complete or work towards and get rewards for it. The game also has cons to EVERYTHING!! If you use an Extensive Atlas you can have larger radar but unit upkeep lowers. There are cosmetics that can only be earned through diamonds which can earned by selling things on the market or paying money. There's even pets you can have that follow you around. My personal favorite is the cat and the bomb. Also, there's HATS.			"

								AirMech is a very special game. I enjoy how this game is free to play, and no player is ever forced to spend any money on this game. I personally have spent money on this game, because I like it enough to give it a little extra funding. Spedning this money however, has not made me a more skilled player, or better at this game in any way. Those who don't feel like spending money on this game, don't have to, which is one of the most appealing aspects of this game. AirMech is also very fun. If you need time to kill, you could easily just sit down and knock out the hours. And the game is not so addicting that you can't stop playing it. The developers of the game are very connected to the community, which is very nice. The community itself is also very friendly. So I HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone. It is free, so download it and give it a try! And if you need any information, there is almost always someone in the chat who knows the answer to your question. Overall, this game gets a 10/10 from me.			"

								This game used to be such an awesome game. Played it for days when i first got it and even bought some of the in-game currency. Which for me is nothing short of a miracle. Got tons of the in-game currency for free, thanks to the amount of generous players doing tons of diamond rolls. And had a huge amount of fun playing the game. And it was a fantastic game. Bought almost every unit available, unlocked pretty much everything and then.......nothing. Very few new updates, not even a handful of new units and no new Airmech. The new map has been in beta since forever and basically nothing was ever released so the game rapidly got boring. Which is a massive shame, as it has huge potential. With regular updates and new units...etc, this game could be epic.So i stopped going on it, except every once in a while to relive what could be such a super game.....Until today.... Whoever thought of that silly, annoying grabby arm thing that drops off your units has just completely ruined the game for me. Now when i build things, i lose them, they all get built in the same place and it just completely destroys the game.I recommend the game in the begining, as starting it is ace! But once you've unlocked everything, you'll rapidly get bored of it. And as you won't have played it without the ridiculous grabby arm, then it might not bother you so much, but otherwise i cannot recommend it at all.			"

								If stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like totalbiscut's and chimneyswift's inclusion as pilots along a furry who plays some dumb RTS no one who isn't asian cares about makes you mad, then don't play this game because you're probably autistic and hated Borderlands 2 because of the memes in it.That said if you like MOBAs you're either autistic or asian (maybe even both), but considering this is a more RTS oriented MOBA, you're either going to enjoy playing this because it's a breath of fresh air to the game type, or you're going to throw your keyboard in fury at your monitor and scream at your mom because you're some kind of ♥♥♥♥ing turbonerd who can't stand things being different.

								This game is a Tower Defense game, and it is really enjoyable for gamers that are really into futuristic and Strategy games. You are an ""AirMech"", or a mech that is what you control in each game. You are transformable, and one really good thing is that this   game is compatible with a video game console controller.			"

								Love the game so far, IT IS NOT P2W. Anything that can be bought to enhance performance with DIAMONDS (The pay-to-get currency) can only be used in CO-OP vs AI games. I think a lot of people don't realise that and quit thinking it's P2W. Cosmetic items are bought with Diamonds but parts and new mechs can ONLY be bought with KUDOS the currency you get for playing games.  This game needs more attention as it is GREAT. I love it so much so far.			"

								This game is great just from my first few hours playing it, from what ive seen there arnt really to many bugs. you will like this game of you like LoL (Leauge of Legends), because it combines an RTS game with a third pearson commander/leader unit that you play as. Some may say the game is a little bit micro transaction heavy, but with the all the content thats okay, and you can get most of what you need by buying the starter pack,(REALLY GOOD DEAL) for only $10, witch I think is very reasonable. Some might not like the graphics but I would rather have decent graphics and lots of content, than amazing graphics and a game with only 4 maps, that you have to pay another $60 for for more content that should have been in it the first place. My only real problem with the game is it takes a while to find ranked miltiplayer games but that will change when it grows a little more.Over All: 9/10			"

								I was very interested when stumbling upon this small pebble. It had that MOBA feel to it and an interesting concept of enabling air and ground combat using a robot and engineer chosen. This however, was a disappointment. The menu was a tad confusing and the tutorial was flat out not needed but was locked in. The bots are too easy even on the hardest difficulty and the gameplay seems dull when played alone. Don't pick up this game if you're looking for something great, maybe Hawken is a better choice but if you're looking for something to master and you're extremely bored maybe try it out, if not, don't even bother. 3.5/10-Andde			"

								first off, there are a few things i want to say about this game. i do not recommend this game, but i don't dis-recommend this game either. if you have some spare time, give it a try, but don't take time from your daily schedule to play this game.this game is fun. it just is. flying around stealthed, pulling enemies towards you by attacking their base is fun. gathering an army of snipers and seeing the mayhem unfold is fun.but there are a few things i want to say:this game is pay 2 win. there are certain things you can only buy with gems (premium currency) that are *much* stronger than their normal counterparts. you CAN earn gems for free, by referring, yaddayadda.playing against bots is plain stupid (but the only thing you can do, searching for a match against players always results in a long waiting time for a doomed match) they constantly have bombs and can really get on your nerves. but hey, that's the strategy they're using. again, i do not recommend and i do recommend this game, but steam will only let me say yes or no. so yes it is.

								I tried this game for a couple hours.  It's immediately engaging, and nice to look at.  If you're into twitch-style shooter games, this could be a step up for you as compared to other more traditional MOBAs.  However, it's far, far too ambitious for me to enjoy.You start off learning a bit about your Airmech and how to manipulate the ""minion"" units under your command.  At this point I'd say the interface and the ability to affect the game could just stop, and remain perfectly enjoyable.  Just being able to transform and fly around in the middle of a large-scale conflict, move units around, and the novelty of the control system would make an enjoyable game.  Unfortunately your responsibilities don't stop there, by any means.Next you find out that you can produce units, that indeed you need to on a constant basis, while managing credits and the time it takes to build them.  You must select units other than infantry by flying over them while holding a key and give them more explicit orders with other keys.  You use the function keys to create upgrades for your Airmech, which are extremely varied and a bit confusing in how they work at the outset.  Meanwhile you are trying to attack enemy Airmechs who scream out of the air at you from close off-screen, manage your territory, pick up your own units with another key that is unreliable at best, transform and use special attacks when needed.I'd compare this game to a side-scrolling shooter combined with a turn-based board game or an RTS.  There is of course a learning curve and I'm sure a high degree of expertise can be gained in it, but the end product is both too demanding and too frenetic to be very appealing to either specific crowd.  I'd have been quite happier if they toned it down a notch and decided to stick more with one or the other.			"

								The game is fun, but I have trouble playing it because of my laptop's hardware.  The game is kinda like a cross between Transformers, AoE, Tribes: Ascend (also free on Steam and super fun), and what I've heard about League of Legends, even though I've never played the game.			"

								It is a new spin on a MOBA. More than 3 maps unlike some other MOBAs. I like the fast pace and the tactical side. It is way fun with friends. Seriously consider trying this game out since it is free. It plays great right out though they need a better tutorial system than the videos by fans and the challenges. The challenges should really be called speed tutorials. SO, final word, just try it and decide for yourself if you like it or not.			"

								This is an ok game. On one hand, it can become very tedious to keep repeating the same strategies over and over. But the beauty of airmech is adapting these strategies around different mechas and troops like jokers, longhorns and t-45 turrets can be really fun. It's a mixed bag, but there's enough good to last a while. It gives lots of options for playing, like speedy hit and runs, all out offense or long range sniper. It's fun, and that's (almost) a fact.			"

								This was a very suprising game for me. I was not expecting much, because I thought it was either a MOBA or a brawler, neither of which I am a fan of. But, it was free, so I decided to download it. It well surpassed my expectations. It's more on the MOBA side but better than the other ones out there. It is fast paced with the units having almost as much power as the airmechs, or the hero character similar to other MOBAs. There is just so much potential to this game. There are many customizable options and it isn't a pay to win kind of game. It's definitly worth the download so farThe only things that I believe should be added are the following (it's still in early access, so i'm not too worried)-The lack of maps-Most of the maps are extremely similar according to the layout.-Some connections issues (i.e. latency, even though we have extremely new internet equipment [router, motem, all that jazz]).-CTF mode has yet to function (at least as far as I can tell)  And that's all the issues I can come up with. For an early access game, that's not bad.			"

								AirMech is an intriguing attempt at a fusion of moba/action games, with a small hint of rts. The game plays well, and while not inherently intuitive, the controls are well designed, and the games overall pacing is great.Although currently in Beta, the game over the last year+ has grown and improved, showing a dedication from the developers, and loyalty to the playerbase. As of right now, I have high hopes for the game, and am excited to see exactly what unfolds as the curtain of the official release rises.			"

								OK, i usually don't prefer strategy games so i didn't know what to expect from this game, When i started it all i had to do was make a usernaame so i did. When it was done loaded i played the tutorial and then started single-player 1v1 mode. After winning my reward was 136 kudos (in-game currency) and 112 XP.This game has a very unique leveling, there are three level systems, your mech, player and in-game.When you level up in-game you can buy special abilities/attacks for your mech. When you level up you unlock more powerful (and exspensive) units.This game is NOT a p2w (pay to win) Dimonds the money bought currency is only used to buy cosmetics and legendary pilots and you CAN buy units with dimonds.You fight along side your troops on the battefield.Multiple Modes:Single-playerCooppvpStory mode coming soon (Only for PRIME owners)Survival mode (online and off)Amazing transformer-like mechs. There are a lot of them, just to name a few:Striker- The fist mech you start out with, suprisingly AWESOME.Stealth bomber- Like dropping bombs?A10 Warthog- Yea.And more (and there adding more!)Including Different Skins for each (Costs dimonds)Combat 9/10Mechs 8/10 (Only air mechs :( Need more variety like humvees, tanks etc.online 9/10FREE 10/10NO P2W 10/10Different pilots each with talents 9/10Overall it's just an amazing expereince grab a friend or two or three or four and have fun!Overall 8/10maybe a 10/10 when it's finished!

								If you've ever played MOBA games before, you know they can be fast and furious; add in the ability to run around the battlefield in a transforming mech and things get even more crazy.  In effect the game plays like Herzog Zwei, from back in the Sega Genesis days; your mech has to pick up and deploy units to areas they are needed.For being an early access game this is certainly well polished, and i can honestly say i'm wondering what the campaign mode is going to be like in the future.

								Genre: Action, Strategy, Mech.In this game, you are a Mech that can transform from an AirShip of your choosing(Fighter Jets & Helos of variant kinds)You have one base with many bases mini Bases around, most are neutral while the enemy is on the other side of the map.Before Game, you have a choice of building/Units to pick from(buildings are Defence or Resource Building only) So playing a game with someone who has stronger units is a possibilty.Goal:  Destroy enemy Main Base. Capture mini-bases to use as heal points or to spawn units from. Infranty Auto-Spawn since they are required for capturing Mini-Bases, but when you spawn a unit of your own, you must go into Flight Mode, hover over your base, and pick up your built unit/structure and drop it somewhere on the map.(You can give units orders to Attack/Capture/Follow other Units/Stay & Patrol.)(Note, Infrantry units are sent Automatically to  Capture Mini-Bases or Attack the Main Base.)You may buy items for your Mech in the store where you will also find units(Infantry and Ground Vehicles) and Structures.Game is in Beta at the time of this post so much can't be said, lots of issues to where you might not even be able to play the game. But I suggest that people try this game as its free and no harm can come of that, and you may end up liking this game. Also at the beginning, you will have to chose 1 of 3 pilots(There are more Pilots to buy in-store, with in-game cash or Diamonds which is payed currency) after chosing a pilot, you will end up doing a tutorial about 8 mission long.(Total time about 30min-1hr Depending how fast you can do it, maybe faster than 30min) That all I can tell you, hope you like the game, and hope you found my review helpful.

Early Access Review
								Been with this game for quite awhile now over at least two different accounts, one with them and then one with Steam.  It has had ups and downs over the beta process but even when something was changed I still had fun.  The developers try to warn plenty ahead of time when something is going to change, giving as much detail as the are able so we are prepared when we log in and something as drastic as the whole UI changes (This happened recently).  There are things they have done that I have commended and others I have cringed at.  But generally everything has been great.When you first log in, at least back when I started, you are greated with wonderful art of NPC pilots greating you and explaining the basics of flying your own giant robot.  While the art or words of the greating may have changed over time, there is still a really well done tutorial that you can go through.  As the game has changed this has been updated to reflect those changes.  Over 15 parts you learn how to control the mech and deploy your troops.  By the end of it, part 15, you are set into a ""real"" match against a NPC pilot with full control over the battle.There are several game types, of which are rather interesting in their own way.  You have the basic match, with is just you versus them.  This can be 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3 and any combination of human or AI controlled pilots.  The AI are decent, having multiple difficulty settings for you to pick from.  Once you get the hang of the game you will find the AI rather slow or simply annoying, but they do at least give a bit of a challenge.Next there is a capture the flag variant where you have to grab a core from their base and bring it back to yours.  This is still played the same as a basic match, meaning you still have to capture neutral bases and defend them, but added in is the ctf elements.  I haven't played much of this version, but it did add a nice difference to the game.There is also a survival game type.  You versus the endless horde of machines!  You or up to four players defend a single base against waves of increasingly difficult machines.  There are small outposts you can try to hold as well, increasing your ability to put out defenses.  This is the one game type you will run into enemies that you can't make yourself.Currently there are 9 different airmechs to pick from.  There are all sorts of builds for each airmech with parts you can add to change how it acts.  The striker, the airmech you start with, has missles, guns and an electric sword and shield.  You can build it to better use any or none of those attacks.  You can even build it to better your army instead of yourself.  There are tank, sniper, rocket, cloaking and healing mechs, just to list a few abilities.The units in your army range from little walker robots all the way up to massive tanks.  You can also build systems that can't move but have better range or attack power.  Any of these units are able to be picked up by an airmech to be carried where you want to deploy it.  The battlefield changes constantly on where it is safe or not.  Carrying units affects your speed and fuel consumption, making long trips with heavy loads not recommended.I could write much more on the details of the game, but it's easier to just go play and learn.  On the subject of pay to win, it does have real money currency called diamonds.  These are purely for cosmetic things.  The normal game currency, kudos, can buy everything else.  Some things you have to use kudos for, making it more about your effort in the game rather then how much money you spend.  There are a few things you can use either kudos or diamonds for, but many of these things can be a detriment to get earlier then you have the ability to properly use them.The community is one of the nicer I've run into.  There are many peer mods that have received commendations from other players over time, giving them the ability to monitor and mute those in chat.  If you do have an issue the devs are also in chat nearly every day.  Or if they aren't around you can click a players name to commend or report them.  Everything from price to function is discussed on the forums with the devs, who while they might not take your suggestion, you are usually at least acknowledged.Come play some Airmech...we have explosions!

								First of, its the only MOBA i have played, but it left me with a good feeling for the rest of the genre.the game starts with players constructing a base and creating units, much like a RTS, but the players are alowed to fight along side the NPC troopers and vichles, how ever it does require some micro-manigeing skills, but its part of the game. vary few or no bugs, game never crashed on me and was really freaking fun. i would highly recomind this gam to all, and becouse its free if you dont like it, you have nothing to lose. my final rateing for AirMech, is 10 out of 10.

								Herzog Zwei on Steroids (DX10alone)In other words, a MOBA - RTS hybrid about flying, transforming robots waging battle over unit-producing factories.  Multiple game modes (including a sports-ball mode and a tower defense/onslaught mode).Completely free-to-play with a lot of re-skin trading, but somewhat grindy to achieve your full potential. If you like playing this game daily, I suggest buying into the Silver VIP status.			"

								Free to play, the words that make many people think pure grind-fest, pay to win aspects and generally commitment to playing constantly. While there are bonuses to perks, the thing I love is that most of the items you can purchase with premium money, you can get by winning battles. In addition, all the Over Powered items is restricted. Wait, this isn't a pay to win? I don't really think so. From what I have seen of the premium and VIP shop, it's actually very balanced. Those who do pay with real money get a slighter advantage, but not by much. Alrighty, we got the worst aspect of the game out, let's dive right into this with swords a slicing, is this worth the time? Surely, this early access game is horrible, you say! Look at all the other EA games that have scarred our wallets with promises of updates.Fear not, for this game is a gem which I highly recommend to anyone who is a StarCraft fan, RTS lover, or just love shooting the crud out of the other team. Now you might be asking why would you love this if you are a StarCraft fan, this game doesn't even resemble that Blizzard gem most people know and love. Actually, the art style of this game reminds me of that, very bold, isometric, and has units you can immediately relate to. In addition, another cool feature is that you have an upkeep, a maximum number of units on the field at any given time. As you capture more outposts, that number increases, if they get captured, it lowers thus making it a hectic scramble to try and take control of them as fast as possible. That's about as far as that goes, but if you are a die-hard fan of Command & Conquer, I suggest you try this out right now.Piloting the mech is actually very responsive. I point to shoot, it aims and kills. The speed of each game will have you thinking fast, moving from point to point, constantly responding to attacks. The difficulty curve of the game is slightly flat, but the customization of the game is just massive! You get to pilot one of several mechs, ranging from space ships and flying saucers to bombers and fighter jets. I guarantee that you will pick the game up thinking about spending 10 minutes in one match, then find yourself playing for hours.There are a few problems that I see with this game and one of them is the graphics. When you open up the game, it is in windowed mode which is nice, but I'm usually afraid of clicking out of the game while in battle which might cost me. Putting it in full screen, I immediately regret that. Everything becomes fuzzy and distorted, making the text hard to read and the gameplay a bit annoying. This is not game-breaking, but you will be deciding which you would prefer, having the small screen or going full screen. Another thing that bothers me is that navigation is a slight problem. Everything is easy to find, but the problem lies in the layout. As you go through, it's a mixture of large tabs, small tabs, intermixed sized tabs, and buttons.Other than those minor problems, this game is extremely fun to play. It will take a while to get use to the controls and field of play, but once you learn how to transform and move your units from point A to point B, you will be strategizing to take the next outpost. The gameplay is very solid, there are a ton of quests for you to do and challenges if you want to sharpen your skill. For an Early Access game, this is a highly refined and very addictive game.			"

								AirMech is an intriguing attempt at a fusion of moba/action games, with a small hint of rts. The game plays well, and while not inherently intuitive, the controls are well designed, and the games overall pacing is great.Although currently in Beta, the game over the last year+ has grown and improved, showing a dedication from the developers, and loyalty to the playerbase. As of right now, I have high hopes for the game, and am excited to see exactly what unfolds as the curtain of the official release rises.			"

								     Airmech is a game where you kill other robots called Airmechs. Destroy the enemy fortress to win! To help you on your quest to defeat the enemy fortress, you can establish units and defenses to guard the outposts you secure, and to protect your fortress. Outposts are captured by infantry units after the outpost is ""netural"". Which means it can be captured by either side.      Airmech can be a PvP or PvE or even a co-op game! There are a varity of different units, turrets, and defense units! Huge tanks, normal tanks, armored and manned jeeps, soldiers, laser pistols, and much more! Airmech is free, so no worries there. If you get Airmech on steam (you can get it on Google Chrome and stuff) you get your personal steam account!     Airmech is free, it's awesome, and it is KILLING OTHER AIRMECHS! What more could you ask of such a great free game? Get it now, sedate your curiosity, and battle airmechs, capture outposts, destroy enemy defenses and fortresses!      Boosts can help you get more kudos (Currency) or EXP. With a Kudo Boost you get:   +80% kudos for self   +20% kudos for all other players (stackable)     It is the same thing with EXP Boost,  execpt with expierence! Get Airmech, and refer Demveel for rewards for both of us! Get it now!			"

There is even a single player skirmish survival and co-op if your'e tired of competition and a fairly deep unit design system allowing for lots of diversity in tactics.If you enjoy games like starcraft but want even more challenge due to controlling your units + commanding your units, then try this one on for size you have nothin to lose!

								It's a great charming little game. It's not nearly as Pay-2-Win as the average F2P. However, I do hate the grind you have to do to earn new mechs and skills. If I were you, I'd give the game a shot and dive right on in. There's not another game like it, and the developer will actually interact with you. The gameplay is superb, yet there is a steep learning curve all in all, I'd give this game an 8/10. It's free, so what are you waiting for?			"

								Soo..... you hate league of legends but cant find a moba game to play? WELL! Try this for styleEdit: This used to be my favorite game. I've played it since 2011. I met the developers at PAX when they only had a tiny corner in someone else's booth. I was so excited when new patches came out and I bought all sorts of silly flair because I loved supporting the developers of such a great game. Over the past year or so things have taken an odd turn. Entire new ranges of unnecessary and overpriced sub-items are available that modify your mechs. Now they have de-powered the silly just-for-fun mechs as some kind of cash grab and made the parts available to play in PVP, this looks an awful lot like pay to win. This makes me and my wallet happy that now I don't need to spend money :)			"

								Recommended for a quick 5 minute game every now and then.It's a fast-paced tower-defense-style action game with startegy elements. Each player(s) starts with a base.Destroying the enemy base wins the game. Each base will produce units that automatically begin to roll towards the enemy base. On your way you will try to capture and hold neutral bases, that in return will allow you to produce more units in a shorter time.The units can't be controlled by the player. Instead you control a transport plane. Your job is to pick up one or more of these units and deploy them either in a defensive slot near your base for defense, or drop them on the battle-field as reenforcements for your offense.To support your units on the ground you may either try to shoot down the enemy's plane to keep him from deploying more troops. Or you land your craft, which then transforms into a ""mech""-style tank that can shoot enemy ground troops.If you are shot down, you suffer a time penalty, during which you have to wait before being allowed to re-enter the battle-field.As you win battles, you will be able to purchase other types of planes with special abilities and better ground units. However, the longer you play, the longer it will take until you reach the next level or can afford the next upgrade.This means that the game can get very repetitive, unless you invest real money to avoid the grinding.To be clear: this is NOT pay to win. Apart from optical goodies, you can get all items in the game without paying. BUT! It will take a long, long time to accumulate the amount of money you need to purchase the ""big guns"".So if you are looking for a face-paced, action tower-defense style of game with strategic elements and a grain of ""transformers"" and don't mind to do a bit of grinding, then this game is for you.If instead you are looking for either a ""mech-warrior"" style simulation game with some strategy or a full-scale strategy game with mechs, then look elsewhere.

								---OVERALL RATING: 3/5---Never seen a game that mixes Transformers and RTS (Real-Time-Startegy). Awesome in some ways. Stuff I don't like about the game, that its full of Micro-Transactions. Oh you want to beta test our campaign? Be a Prime Member! (for like 14 pounds) You don't have any Kudos (ONE of the In-Game currencies)? Well you can buy Kudos for real money! ... That's a real shame it has that. Even though I only payed onced, which was like 8 pounds, I dont recommend buying with real money.-Price: Free 4/5-Graphics: Cartoony 4/5-Having Micro-transactions: 1/5Overall, even though I rated it 3/5, I will still recommend this game. It's fun with bunch of friends!			"

This game is one of the best Free to Play Games out there.  you dont need to buy all this Fancy stuff to play the game right and Win.  Exept player vs player will be hard if you are just starting out just like any game.  You will need to build your Air Mech up.  Their are several Super nice people in the community, and just chit chatting is really Fun and one of the best aspects if you ask me.  The market is wonderful because You can sell your stuff too, and ask whatever price you want,  In Air Mech Diamonds that is.  It is worth paying for the package because the Dev. Did one Hell Of a Job creating this Fine Game.  Have fun and level up!.			"

								This is an ok game. On one hand, it can become very tedious to keep repeating the same strategies over and over. But the beauty of airmech is adapting these strategies around different mechas and troops like jokers, longhorns and t-45 turrets can be really fun. It's a mixed bag, but there's enough good to last a while. It gives lots of options for playing, like speedy hit and runs, all out offense or long range sniper. It's fun, and that's (almost) a fact.			"

								First of, its the only MOBA i have played, but it left me with a good feeling for the rest of the genre.the game starts with players constructing a base and creating units, much like a RTS, but the players are alowed to fight along side the NPC troopers and vichles, how ever it does require some micro-manigeing skills, but its part of the game. vary few or no bugs, game never crashed on me and was really freaking fun. i would highly recomind this gam to all, and becouse its free if you dont like it, you have nothing to lose. my final rateing for AirMech, is 10 out of 10.

								Genre: Action, Strategy, Mech.In this game, you are a Mech that can transform from an AirShip of your choosing(Fighter Jets & Helos of variant kinds)You have one base with many bases mini Bases around, most are neutral while the enemy is on the other side of the map.Before Game, you have a choice of building/Units to pick from(buildings are Defence or Resource Building only) So playing a game with someone who has stronger units is a possibilty.Goal:  Destroy enemy Main Base. Capture mini-bases to use as heal points or to spawn units from. Infranty Auto-Spawn since they are required for capturing Mini-Bases, but when you spawn a unit of your own, you must go into Flight Mode, hover over your base, and pick up your built unit/structure and drop it somewhere on the map.(You can give units orders to Attack/Capture/Follow other Units/Stay & Patrol.)(Note, Infrantry units are sent Automatically to  Capture Mini-Bases or Attack the Main Base.)You may buy items for your Mech in the store where you will also find units(Infantry and Ground Vehicles) and Structures.Game is in Beta at the time of this post so much can't be said, lots of issues to where you might not even be able to play the game. But I suggest that people try this game as its free and no harm can come of that, and you may end up liking this game. Also at the beginning, you will have to chose 1 of 3 pilots(There are more Pilots to buy in-store, with in-game cash or Diamonds which is payed currency) after chosing a pilot, you will end up doing a tutorial about 8 mission long.(Total time about 30min-1hr Depending how fast you can do it, maybe faster than 30min) That all I can tell you, hope you like the game, and hope you found my review helpful.

								AirMech is an intriguing attempt at a fusion of moba/action games, with a small hint of rts. The game plays well, and while not inherently intuitive, the controls are well designed, and the games overall pacing is great.Although currently in Beta, the game over the last year+ has grown and improved, showing a dedication from the developers, and loyalty to the playerbase. As of right now, I have high hopes for the game, and am excited to see exactly what unfolds as the curtain of the official release rises.			"

								Free to play, the words that make many people think pure grind-fest, pay to win aspects and generally commitment to playing constantly. While there are bonuses to perks, the thing I love is that most of the items you can purchase with premium money, you can get by winning battles. In addition, all the Over Powered items is restricted. Wait, this isn't a pay to win? I don't really think so. From what I have seen of the premium and VIP shop, it's actually very balanced. Those who do pay with real money get a slighter advantage, but not by much. Alrighty, we got the worst aspect of the game out, let's dive right into this with swords a slicing, is this worth the time? Surely, this early access game is horrible, you say! Look at all the other EA games that have scarred our wallets with promises of updates.Fear not, for this game is a gem which I highly recommend to anyone who is a StarCraft fan, RTS lover, or just love shooting the crud out of the other team. Now you might be asking why would you love this if you are a StarCraft fan, this game doesn't even resemble that Blizzard gem most people know and love. Actually, the art style of this game reminds me of that, very bold, isometric, and has units you can immediately relate to. In addition, another cool feature is that you have an upkeep, a maximum number of units on the field at any given time. As you capture more outposts, that number increases, if they get captured, it lowers thus making it a hectic scramble to try and take control of them as fast as possible. That's about as far as that goes, but if you are a die-hard fan of Command & Conquer, I suggest you try this out right now.Piloting the mech is actually very responsive. I point to shoot, it aims and kills. The speed of each game will have you thinking fast, moving from point to point, constantly responding to attacks. The difficulty curve of the game is slightly flat, but the customization of the game is just massive! You get to pilot one of several mechs, ranging from space ships and flying saucers to bombers and fighter jets. I guarantee that you will pick the game up thinking about spending 10 minutes in one match, then find yourself playing for hours.There are a few problems that I see with this game and one of them is the graphics. When you open up the game, it is in windowed mode which is nice, but I'm usually afraid of clicking out of the game while in battle which might cost me. Putting it in full screen, I immediately regret that. Everything becomes fuzzy and distorted, making the text hard to read and the gameplay a bit annoying. This is not game-breaking, but you will be deciding which you would prefer, having the small screen or going full screen. Another thing that bothers me is that navigation is a slight problem. Everything is easy to find, but the problem lies in the layout. As you go through, it's a mixture of large tabs, small tabs, intermixed sized tabs, and buttons.Other than those minor problems, this game is extremely fun to play. It will take a while to get use to the controls and field of play, but once you learn how to transform and move your units from point A to point B, you will be strategizing to take the next outpost. The gameplay is very solid, there are a ton of quests for you to do and challenges if you want to sharpen your skill. For an Early Access game, this is a highly refined and very addictive game.			"

								Soo..... you hate league of legends but cant find a moba game to play? WELL! Try this for styleEdit: This used to be my favorite game. I've played it since 2011. I met the developers at PAX when they only had a tiny corner in someone else's booth. I was so excited when new patches came out and I bought all sorts of silly flair because I loved supporting the developers of such a great game. Over the past year or so things have taken an odd turn. Entire new ranges of unnecessary and overpriced sub-items are available that modify your mechs. Now they have de-powered the silly just-for-fun mechs as some kind of cash grab and made the parts available to play in PVP, this looks an awful lot like pay to win. This makes me and my wallet happy that now I don't need to spend money :)			"

								Addiction in a small 400mb package that comes at no extra cost aside from the massive amount of time you will probably spend playing it.Fun 1 v 1 or 2 v 2 or 3 v 3 level designs similar to starcraft combined with desert strike style gameplay along with a robotech / macross / battletech style land air mech. There is even a single player skirmish survival and co-op if your'e tired of competition and a fairly deep unit design system allowing for lots of diversity in tactics.If you enjoy games like starcraft but want even more challenge due to controlling your units + commanding your units, then try this one on for size you have nothin to lose!

								Recommended for a quick 5 minute game every now and then.It's a fast-paced tower-defense-style action game with startegy elements. Each player(s) starts with a base.Destroying the enemy base wins the game. Each base will produce units that automatically begin to roll towards the enemy base. On your way you will try to capture and hold neutral bases, that in return will allow you to produce more units in a shorter time.The units can't be controlled by the player. Instead you control a transport plane. Your job is to pick up one or more of these units and deploy them either in a defensive slot near your base for defense, or drop them on the battle-field as reenforcements for your offense.To support your units on the ground you may either try to shoot down the enemy's plane to keep him from deploying more troops. Or you land your craft, which then transforms into a ""mech""-style tank that can shoot enemy ground troops.If you are shot down, you suffer a time penalty, during which you have to wait before being allowed to re-enter the battle-field.As you win battles, you will be able to purchase other types of planes with special abilities and better ground units. However, the longer you play, the longer it will take until you reach the next level or can afford the next upgrade.This means that the game can get very repetitive, unless you invest real money to avoid the grinding.To be clear: this is NOT pay to win. Apart from optical goodies, you can get all items in the game without paying. BUT! It will take a long, long time to accumulate the amount of money you need to purchase the ""big guns"".So if you are looking for a face-paced, action tower-defense style of game with strategic elements and a grain of ""transformers"" and don't mind to do a bit of grinding, then this game is for you.If instead you are looking for either a ""mech-warrior"" style simulation game with some strategy or a full-scale strategy game with mechs, then look elsewhere.

								---OVERALL RATING: 3/5---Never seen a game that mixes Transformers and RTS (Real-Time-Startegy). Awesome in some ways. Stuff I don't like about the game, that its full of Micro-Transactions. Oh you want to beta test our campaign? Be a Prime Member! (for like 14 pounds) You don't have any Kudos (ONE of the In-Game currencies)? Well you can buy Kudos for real money! ... That's a real shame it has that. Even though I only payed onced, which was like 8 pounds, I dont recommend buying with real money.-Price: Free 4/5-Graphics: Cartoony 4/5-Having Micro-transactions: 1/5Overall, even though I rated it 3/5, I will still recommend this game.

								     Airmech is a game where you kill other robots called Airmechs. Destroy the enemy fortress to win! To help you on your quest to defeat the enemy fortress, you can establish units and defenses to guard the outposts you secure, and to protect your fortress. Outposts are captured by infantry units after the outpost is ""netural"". Which means it can be captured by either side.      Airmech can be a PvP or PvE or even a co-op game! There are a varity of different units, turrets, and defense units! Huge tanks, normal tanks, armored and manned jeeps, soldiers, laser pistols, and much more! Airmech is free, so no worries there. If you get Airmech on steam (you can get it on Google Chrome and stuff) you get your personal steam account!     Airmech is free, it's awesome, and it is KILLING OTHER AIRMECHS! What more could you ask of such a great free game? Get it now, sedate your curiosity, and battle airmechs, capture outposts, destroy enemy defenses and fortresses!      Boosts can help you get more kudos (Currency) or EXP. With a Kudo Boost you get:   +80% kudos for self   +20% kudos for all other players (stackable)     It is the same thing with EXP Boost,  execpt with expierence!

The game is really ADDICTING! Sure if you want to use the cool stuff you just need to buy one thing, but after that, the game only seems to get better with that ""Since-of-accomplishment"" feeling! And I still feel (Honest opinion, not fact) that it is fair to buy a $9.99 USD ""UPGRADE"", reason being is because they pretty much give you access to almost everything except ""Diamonds"".

								You like MOBA games but tired of the same map? Or tired that your creeps are just annoyingly stupid?Try this half strategy half rpg game, you can fully customize your mecha with cosmetics and equipment to improve its strenght.Of course as it's a free to play game it has to have the premium part, but it's not a pay to win game, so even if you have the 'ultra' version of some units, you can't use them on pvp.But the vip version offers a hugue ammount of skins for your mech and that makes it speccially attractive.You can play PVP as you wish but not everybody is so brave, so you have a pve combat system, to beat the nasty npc with your friends.If there's something I could complain, is that there are not very much maps, units or team colours. Also the max player cap is 4 in a 2vs2 pvp match. But that's just the beginning of this game. They will update it and more things are up to come.As it's free to play, I would invite everybody to join this amazing game.			"

								The tagline for this game ought to be ""Be a giant robot transforming robot that blows up other giant transforming robots and tanks and things!"", because that's really what it is, in a nutshell. It's like a technological, futuristic, and much much more user friendly version of DOTA 2. It's free, but actually free. Not the sort of free where you can download it but have to buy in-game content to have any fun at all. This is legitimately free. You can buy almost everything with in-game credits (though you can also buy those with real money, of course), and it's not impossible to get your hands on the actual cash-based currency that lets you buy special stuff. I'll be honest, gettting enough in game money to buy the quality items takes a long time, but the game is really fun, so you don't mind. Also, there's a nice achievement system thatalways gives you something to do. If you don't feel like going on a massive rampage of destruction with your giant robot suit, that is.			"

								AirMech is a game that has a lot of potential. An Action Real Time Strategy game featuring transforming mechs, customizable loadouts with tons of different units? Sounds like a dream game.The question is, is it a realistic dream? I think it is. Let me start by saying AirMech has a very small playerbase right now compared to other Free to Play online games. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the game is still fun when played versus bots. The game has a bit of Pay to Win by having items be unlocked exclusively with in-game currency that can be purchase with real-life money, but the in-game currency is acquired at a pretty decent amount so you'll find yourself being able to buy two or three new units or a new pilot. The only thing you'll really find yourself grinding for is the ability to customize a mech, but all of the mechs are available at start to play as, just not to customize. The gameplay is fun and fast paced and heavily strategy based. Based on which mech you use you'll find yourself playing the game quite differently. My personal favorite mech is the UFO, which has so little outgoing damage and so little damage reduction I don't even bother shooting most of the time. The fact that the games are exclusively 2v2 is understandable given the small playerbase, but it makes for a less action packed game than it could be for people who play as more strategy heavy mechs than pew pew heavy mechs.The game has a lot of growing room, and I see it becoming very big if the game adjusts some of its.... Commercialistic... Aspects. I personally don't mind that the game has a lot of things on sale, but it's a LOT of things on sale, and you're going to be flooded with them the moment you load up the game. If I want to buy something, I will, I promise, but honestly having giant ads for your in-game items flash before my eyes right when I load the game makes me not want to buy them.The game is being constantly updated, though it seems that a lot of the updates are for things you have to buy. For a game in Beta, I feel this needs to be changed. Yeah, I understand that you need to put food on the table, but you're in the business of making a video game, which is also the business of making money. If your game is fun, and people enjoy it, the players will come and the money will flow in. All in all, as it stands, I give AirMech a nice little 7/10. It's above average. It has a lot of potential it needs to expand on, and it has a bit of a money hungry attitude it needs to tone down on. Gameplay wise it's a fantastic Free to Play game that rewards the player for being good at the game. If you're considering giving it a try, there's no reason not to.			"

								Airmech is a fun game, but it needs more people for the PvP.  When you start playing this game you go against people who are a higher level than you because the matchmaking couldn't find anyone on the same level.  I feel like the tutorial giving give you enough info.  If you wanna learn more on Airmech just go on youtube and look at some guides.                   Other than that, give this game a chance.  Im sure you will like it.			"

								EDIT: [Used to be a] great game. The devs have added so many useless pay-2-win features that simply ruin the game and make it confusing. The whole farm and hangar concept is useless, the parts are too confusing and cost way too much, and the part limit on your mech makes it so you can only have two fairly decent ones equiped. I have a 601-123 W-L ratio, and most of my wins are from noobs/new players. After waiting years in the queue system (not exxagerating), I either get level 1-10 new players that create boring games for me. or I get smurfs and high tier players that abuse the meta and end the game in a few minutes.It used to be a great game. Used to. I suggest you don't waste your time getting into it, you'll get addicted by what the game seems to be at first, but after time goes on you'll see the true nature of what  matchmaking is really like. And to get a decent amount of kudos requires ages of farming or hundreds of USD. Go play minecraft. Even that game is better than this. I mean, at least when you want to play there are other people on the server. Airmech is a ghost town.			"

								First impressions are everything when it come to a game. At first I thought to myself this game maybe a ""Pay-to-peice"" of you know what, but I gave it a try anyway. The game is really ADDICTING! Sure if you want to use the cool stuff you just need to buy one thing, but after that, the game only seems to get better with that ""Since-of-accomplishment"" feeling! And I still feel (Honest opinion, not fact) that it is fair to buy a $9.99 USD ""UPGRADE"", reason being is because they pretty much give you access to almost everything except ""Diamonds"". But still, great, fun, addicting, ""easy to catch onto"" game!			"

								i really think people should give this game a chance if you say the game is bad you should try and play it a different way or just try and enjoy instead of calling this game bad or not worth it because it is so worth the time and disc space to install and enjoy also its co-op is fantastic how you can divise a strategy to defeat the enemy in the way you fight and the way you can sneak up on the enemys base while your friends deal with the enemy troops but just to say in a shot way.This game is worth the time and is amazing to play and it will only get better i hope.

								This is a Modern-ized  version of an  old game  called Herzog Zwie.  This is a  fun  hands on RTS.  I had missed playing Herzog and this REALLY scratches the ich. Only things I dont  like is its a  Free to  Pay business model so you get the feel of a salesmen sitting next to you tryign to sell you a new vaccum.... and the  buttons/units need better tool tips. Some data like  damage per second  armor  speed  that sort of thing.  Its not a  huge learning curve but strategy is a must.			"
