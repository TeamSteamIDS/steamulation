												Disclaimer: I've played the free versions of this series for more than 300 hours, probably near 400. (about half of it spent with Gemcraft Labyrinth).Gemcraft has always been my favourite tower defense game by far, the difference between this series and any other TD is just ridiculous. Main reasons why I love this series as a whole: Pause button and ability to act during pause. I hate TD's where I need to act quickly. This allows me to think about what to do at any time I want to. Pretty much everything has a hotkey, which makes the gameplay a bit smoother compared to clicking everything. You're always doing something. It's really rare that you get through a wave without building or doing some micromanagement with your towers. The math in the game. Everything is told with calculatable numbers. I hate TD's that only tell something like ""A high damage, low speed missile tower"" with no numbers to tell me what it really does. 148 levels. This is not some basic ""get high score in these 10 levels"" tower defense, but it has a story/lore, hidden stuff, multiple ways of progression/upgrades, etc. The insanely good difficulty scaling. It's not an automatic scaling, but I can choose how difficult I want the game to be. At easiest, it's pretty easy (and boring) to be honest. But you can adjust stuff that changes the gameplay a lot like ""next wave comes faster"", ""you gain mana in waves instead of a constant stream"", ""faster scaling"", ""reduced effect of Slow"", and of course, endurance mode in any level. You can enable multiple different things at once, and harder settings means more exp = more skills = you can go for even higher difficulty. Difficulty scaling from ""easier than breathing"" to ""failed in first wave"" also means that this game has a difficulty for anyone. Want casual click-and-watch-explosions? You got it. Want to see how long you can survive against impossible odds? You got it. Every fail is caused by you and you only. The problem I see with most TD's is the situation where you think ""I have no idea which order I should build these towers to complete this level"". But because of the difficulty scaling and the complexity of the game in general, I've never had that feeling in Gemcraft. The difficulty scaling causes me to always try harder settings before hitting a wall of ""oh sh*t I went too high"". But because it was my own choice to begin with, it's just a facepalm moment and retry, instead of feeling that the game is peeing in my cereals. Continuing with difficulty scaling: even in mid-fight, you can make any wave of monsters harder by spending mana on it. Killing these waves rewards you with even more mana, but doing this requires you to really know your limits: anger them too much and they'll eat you alive. Using this mechanic is pretty much required to beat the hardest levels and difficulties, and it turns the game to a constant balancing of ""how much can I take?"". This mechanic is unique among the TD's that I've played, and it's also one of the many reasons I love this game.The usual ""get a bonus by sending in the next wave earlier"" is there aswell. The whole series is pretty much like Dark Souls of the tower defense genre. If you get into it, you'll say that it's the best one. The caveat is that it isn't the easiest game to get into, and it isn't for everyone.The free version of this game can be found at http://armorgames.com/play/15760/gemcraft-chasing-shadows. I'm not even sure what's the difference because I bought this edition instantly after noticing it's on Steam. But I'd say go try the free one, and if you notice that you run out of content before getting bored with the game, come back here.TL;DR: In the end it's still a tower defense game, but it's filled with loads of unique ideas/mechanics and everything is polished to the limit and above. For me it's the game that made every other TD suck just because they aren't nearly as good as Gemcraft.			"

												Gemcraft series is the ultimate Tower Defense experience for me, and ""Chasing Shadows"" is the best instalment so far. At first glance it may work and look like a standard TD game - monsters enter the map in waves, walk to our base along predefined paths and we have to defend it by building towers and traps, as well as occasionally using some spells. However, not only Gemcraft does it superbly but it also offers depth and complexity you won't find in most TD games.The most unique and fun feature of the game, in my opinion, is the wave angering. Player can spend some mana to make monster waves stronger (by increasing monster numbers and stats), which allows you to gain more mana and experience from killing the monsters... IF you can kill them that is. This one feature changes the gameplay from simple defense to the ""how far can I push it"" competition.Another feature, which adds extra replayability value, is the ability to customize levels. It's pretty fun to return to some of early levels later in the game to see how much stronger you have become by beating the level with some extra difficulty settings. You can add more waves, make monsters stronger, faster, tougher or tweak some game rules to get a harder map with higher experience multiplayer. Ah, the experience - player character can gain levels and unlock various skills and spells which will increase his efficiency in killing monster filth. There is no level cap, however some skills (not all) have a limit to which they can be improved. Add to it a wizard's talisman which can be socketed with talisman fragments gathered along your journey and you get quite a few ways of progressing, improving and specialising your character.However, Gemcraft originally being a flash game, has some shortcomings. To many people graphics would be the biggest one. Despite it being pretty ""clean"", readable and fitting the game's darker theme, it's still 2D graphics in low resolution without all those fireworks that other games have nowadays. Personally I prefer it that way, but to each his own.I have spent dozens of hours (flash version on ArmorGames, so obviously Steam won't show this time) with this game and can safely recommend it to other Tower Defense games fans. If you are unsure then you may try the free version of the game on ArmorGames to see if you like it. In any case be advised that GemCraft is not a game you can finish in a few hours. There are dozens of levels and some of the later ones can take as much as an hour to finish.			"

												Prepare to be addicted!  A tower defense game with a dark, gritty atmosphere and tons of choices for upgrading skills, choosing which types of gems you prefer to use, as well as extra stuff like spells, shrines, etc.   A map that lets you choose your path, and even replay levels to your hearts content.   And best of all, tons of achievments that actually give you in-game bonus points to use in upgrading your skills.  Finally, we achievment hunters can have a legitimate reason for getting achievements!Now I must warn you that I have not completed the game yet.  But 20 hours in and I haven't seen anything to change my mind that this game is highly reccommended.  Ok, so this is tower defense.  You build towers (traps, too!) and hope that they kill off the incoming line of enemies.  Only in this game the towers are powered by gems.  Each color does something different.  The green poison gem is my current favorite.  The red chain hit one is good too.  There's gems that steal mana from the enemy, deplete enemy armor, prevent enemies from regenerating their health, and more.  Gems are created with mana.  You start with some mana but also gain mana slowly and by killing enemies.  Use the mana to create more gems or upgrade your existing gems to higher levels.  You can have gems from levels 1-12, but so far I have only been able to afford up to level 8.  Each level costs more than the previous level to create a gem.  You can also move gems around, but there is a short wait time for the gem to socket before it can start attacking.   Gems can also be used to bomb enemies with wasp stings, but I haven't found that very effective.  Each time  you complete a level it unlocks one or more new levels.  Map sections are hexogonal and eventually it opens up two pathway options.  So the game is not completely linear, which I love.  You gain experience and also get shadow cores to use to upgrade your abilities.  There is so much customization in this game, so you can play it in your own style.  You can redistribute your ability points any time you want, so you're not stuck with your upgrades.  Or you can spend the shadow cores to increase your chance of getting better loot and rare items.  The maps have quite a variety of pathways.   And you can build little walls to make a maze to slow the monsters down.Graphics are seen from a top down angle, and the most realistic looking graphics that I've seen in a tower defense game, though I haven't seen them all.  Most of the games in this genre seem to be cartoon-like, but this game has lush forests, stone pathways, and dark insect-looking monsters!Music is more of a kind of ethereal chorus or extended chords.  Not a tune.  But it's perfect for this game.  It really adds to the monstrous ambiance.Replay value is huge.  As far as I know you can replay levels as much as you want, to grind for experience and to get the hard achievements.    But like I said, I haven't finished it yet so I dont' know if there might be a reason not to take too much time.Controls are done with the mouse and there are keyboard shortcuts.Story-wise, there are sometimes pages that tell the story but mostly it's just killing monsters.  Maybe there's more story later on, I dont' know.  This game won't appeal to someone who just wants to play once through a game.  It's for people who like to do the same thing over and over again.  I like to challenge myself to use the least amount of mana and still make it through the level, and stuff like that.  So, if that sounds like you, then buy this game without waiting!  It is well worth the price.  No need to wait for a sale.  The only bad thing is I'm neglecting my other games to play this one.  My poor backlog!Update:  I forgot to mention that there is blood but no gore.  And there's a setting where you can turn off the blood if you want.			"

												I am flabberghasted at how awesome this game is. Ridiculus amounts of content and depth for a ""simple"" tower defense game. I have absolutely nothing but warm recommendations for this game. But, in the interest of diversity, I will mention a fair few flaws or gripes.The game runs on Flash via Air. This means there's no hope of running this natively on Linux as it stands. It also means it will lag like crazy when you get to wizard levels 1000 and above and you really start to abuse the enrage mechanic and get thousands of monsters on screen at once. For simple story mode or casual play, you'll never notice. But if you're hardcore, lag will become a factor eventually.It also means that the entire client will bog down and not respond to inputs as the game lags, this can make controlling the game hard when there's a bajillion things going on at once. Remember to pause your game before issuing commands if you are going into those deep-enrage endurance games.Otherwise I have nothing but positives for the game. I freaking HATE the tower defense genre. Nothing but uncreative, pretty cow-clicky games with zero depth and no strategy EVERYWHERE. Gemcraft though? Totally breaks the mold and makes even a hater love it. That's the warmest recommendations I can ever give a game.			"

												There comes a point in this game where you realize that you absolutely need to learn the deeper concepts of combining gems.  There are people out there that have mathmatically derived the best combinations for a specific task to reap the synergies of gemweaving.  After getting a grasp on weaving, the base game becomes trivial and the new meta game begins.  Getting the highest level gem you possibly can create, how many experience points can you rack up on a single map, completing your tailiman (which provides in game bonuses) with all level 100 fragments, completeing all the achievments, etc...I whole-heateredly endorse this game.

												Don't mind my hours spent on the Steam version, because I have way more than 100+ hours on the free, web browser version itself - but now! - there's an almighty question many most probably have asked. ""Why should I buy this game when I can play it for free?"" Well, not only that you're supporting the developers but also introducing a literal gem into your game library. In comparison with the web free version, you'll get more content on the Steam version. Since the very first GemCraft, I was amazed of how a tower defense game could be so wonderful. I've played a lot, then have focused on playing 'Chasing Shadows', which comes after 'Labyrinth'. First Sight (TL;DR) You might think that it's some simple, boring, sketchy tower defense games like those on Armor Games, Kongregate and so forth. Not so! This is a tower defense game made properly, with love and basically revolutionizes the genre itself! Gameplay You're presented with a field composed out of roads which lead the monsters to your orb. What exactly is the orb? The orb is the point you have to defend from the monsters that swarm all over, that rush towards your orb to vanquish it. If a monster touches the orb, don't fret! Yet, if you let way too many monsters at it, it will get crippled. Once your mana pool is depleted and one last monster touches the orb, it's game over. The mana acts like a shield, protecting the orb from destruction. Dropping a gem bomb (Done by pressing B (default assigned key) and dragging a gem over a spot) on the orb will decrease the banishment cost and will furthermore decrease the damage received by the monsters. Mana is your single resource in the whole game, used in conjuring gems, towers, traps, amplifiers, combining gems as well as in gem bombs. How is mana acquired? It is acquired by slaying monsters and mining from mana shards with a tower which has a gem equipped.Defense of the orb is done by creating gems of a respective trait (colour) and grade. The gems can be combined altogether, the traits being distributed by half if the gem has two traits (colours), you can figure the rest out. These gems can be socketed in towers traps and amplifiers or thrown as bombs. In most fields, you will encounter shrines which can be activated by dropping a gem on them. Depending on the grade of the gem dropped on it the damage will be increased, the shrine will inflict the properties on the monsters. Walls can be used to create new paths for the monsters to follow. Traps are built on the road to inflict damage especially on the swarmlings which are quite fast, while amplifiers are built next to towers to amplify damage and properties of the gem it is amplifying. The gems can also be assigned on what to target, a building or a monster. Slowly you'll gain three area-of-effect spells and three gem enchantments, with a specific cooldown. Throughout the game you'll get talisman fragments to randomly drop which you can socket into their respective slot in the panel displayed in the 'Talisman' tab.The level of difficulty can be easily customized, by adding traits at the beginning of the level, dropping gems on the wave tablets to enrage the monsters which will yield more mana and you can also call waves in earlier which will give you mana as well.This game also has an experience system which rewards the player with skill points at every level gained and also with every achievement, said skill points can be spent on wizard traits that enhance your playthrough. The skill points can be stashed for a starting mana pool bonus. Graphics Not much can be said about the graphics but that everything is detailed quite nicely, the effects being absolutely wonderful and the way the vivid colours combine when mixing a gem with another of a different colour is overly pleasing.  OST & SFX The soundtrack gives an eerie feeling when playing, driving you to think of how deeply horrifying the story is, fitting  exactly  to the theme. Pros 'n' Cons  Pros +More than 150 fields to battle on+Eerie, atmospheric music+Variety of gems each with its own trait+Different modes to play+Personalization of the challenge+Rewarding XP system+Lots of achievements+Infinite replayability+Addicting Cons -Might witness lag on certain occasions Should you buy it? Totally! Highly recommended! For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here!   "

												First off, this is the most polished release I've seen in a LONG time. They worked on it forever, and it shows. This is, IMO, the game that defined the TD genre, and this latest release from Game in a Bottle doesn't dissapoint.If you love TDs, this is a must have. If you like TDs, this is a must have. If you hate TDs, you should still probably try it. No, seriously, it's that good.			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.GemCraft is a series that has been around since 2008, but this is my first experience with it. The tower defence genre is possibly me favourite genre beside RPG, so I was excited to see that the series is classed as one of the best in the genre. It works exactly like any other tower defence, the enemies have a set path to follow and you build your defense around said path. What I found to be very interested with GemCraft is, that your resource supply that you use to build your defences, is also actually your health pool of the crystal you are defending. As you kill the enemies, you gain mana, and in turn this increases your crystal's health, I found that to be an excellent feature and one that I had not seen before. No, the graphics aren't anything to rave about, but you don't need anything fancy for this type of game, all of the enemy sprites are nicely drawn as well as the environments you play in.  Each stage has a different path layout, along with different features on each map, such as gate locks, which have to be destroyed by your towers in so many turns before they automatically wipe your crystal out, this along with plenty other different scenarios (not all negative ones, some actually help you) make it that little bit more interesting to play. I found the difficulty/learning curve to be quite high here, the first two or three levels are really quite easy, but as soon as you start hitting level 4+, bearing in mind that there is 190 levels in this game, the difficulty really starts to pick up. I'm on about level 30 and each stage takes me a good four or five attempt before I manage to work out the best way to complete it. Given the amount of levels, achievements and replayability in GemCraft, I can easily say that there is well over a hundred hours of content if you want to put the effort in. That is an amazing amount of gameplay for a game like this. Tower defence lovers will almost certainly love GemCraft, and if this is a genre you always wanted to try, GemCraft is one of the classics that will keep you entertained for hours on end. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

I highly suggest anyone who hasn't played Gemcraft before to play the Free versions first.			"

======================================GemCraft - Chasing Shadows (Read on for the full review!)======================================TL;DR:Gemcraft is an astonishingly well crafted tower defense game with great difficulty scaling, sufficient graphics and audio, and lots of content. The RPG mechanics and lore give it life and purpose. Highly recommended.======================================Pros:+ Graphics: I like the variety between bleak and vivid colors.+ Audio: Not amazing, but the hit & death sounds are quite satisfying.+ Concept: Gem-enhanced towers? Gem bombs? Gem traps? Gem amplifiers? Yes.+ Difficulty: Slightly easy after a spike. You can then increase the difficulty for more reward.+ Replayability: I enjoy replaying levels with extra challenge to see what I can pull off.+ RPG Mechanics: Unlockables, upgrades, levels, skills & spells, and story.+ Lore: Well written, simple, given in scraps, great for those that do or don't want it.+ UI: Simply put, the UI is extremely well done. Simple, appealing, aesthetically pleasing.+ Variety: There's a gem for every playstyle, and many levels offering various gems.Cons:- Brevity: Eventually, going through all the basic levels to get to unlocks can get monotonous. I would prefer fewer levels, offering more tight design and unique challenges.- Rewards: I'm nitpicking here, but I dislike how getting really far in endurance offers much less experience than getting through the normal map on a higher difficulty or with trials on.Neutral:+/- Graphics and audio are well designed, but could be better looking/sounding.======================================Introduction:Welcome to Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows, the tower defense game where you use various gems and combinations thereof to make your towers methodically destroy your opposition. Gemcraft brings so much to the table with its lore, mechanics, and fitting design aesthetics. There are many options to suit your playstyle, and a lovely coming together of genres to make your experience fresh and exciting. Let's take a deeper look:Gameplay:You have 9 gems at your disposal: Red, yellow, orange, green, blue, cyan, purple, white, black; or chain hit, critical hit, mana leeching, poison, slowing, suppressing, armor tearing, poolbound, and bloodbound respectively. You are given select gems to beat every field with. You can use bombs, traps, towers, and amplifiers. A gem-enhanced entity that has a single or 'pure' gem will always be the strongest form of that gem. If you are to fuse gems, the individual components will be weaker, but the overall effect could be much stronger; an easy example of this would be combining almost any of them with the red gem, chain hit. I also should point out that you can fuse two pure gems of the same level to get them to the next level. (This works with hybrids, as well.) Some gems work better as traps than towers, green (or poison) being a good example of this, however, you are generally free to make things work however you wish, utilizing many or few of the tools at your disposal. On a final note on gems and their killing mechanics, I should mention that amplifiers don't seem to benefit from having their gems upgraded, they simply need any ol' gem present to provide a flat bonus.Moving away from gems, you have 25 skills that can be unlocked. Examples include cheaper construction, more effective gem bombs, and spell enhancement. Some of these are crucial, while others come down to preference. You can reset them at any time. You also have six spells. Examples are an AOE freeze and a special beam or barrage for your towers. There are two ways of unlocking skills and spells, tomes and wizard towers. Tomes require you to kill certain enemies such as 50 giants that have been frozen in their presence. Wizard towers require you to break locks, usually by hitting them directly in different ways. You recieve talismans from beating maps, rarity based on difficulty, which do things like increase damage or experience and make gems heavier. You have a limited amount of slots for talismans. You can upgrade talismans with shadow cores or scrap them to get more. Most shadow cores will come from killing spectres. Later on, you can spend shadow cores to increase the rarity of drops.Initially the game's difficulty will spike but once you get the mechanics down it becomes much easier. Then you have 9 trials and 3 difficulty modes to utilize. Trials are modifiers that impact the gameplay, but greatly boost your rewards. An early one adds waves and makes them arrive earlier. I recommend using this when you become familiar with a level so you can get a lot of experience. Be careful, however, because there is a mechanic where XP rewarded = current exp - previous highest exp.You can use these mechanics to unlock field tokens, which add levels and hexes to the map. Clearing a level could unlock one or more field tokens, (and perhaps a scrap of lore) allowing you the option to prioritize certain paths through the game's fields which enables you to get to unlocks faster, or put off a tough stage. The flexibility and depth presented in Gemcraft makes for a very compelling experience not found even in most AAA TD games.Graphics:The graphics in Gemcraft are serviceable. They are great on some points, but mainly the UI. The UI has everything just the right size. It is thematic but not overly fancy or convoluted. Things are properly highlighted or out of the way. Some aspects may be large and visual as opposed to other aspects being smaller and text-based, tucked away for those that desire more information. Everything is very well laid out, easy to get to, and navigation is quick and simple. With the amount of options present, this is a great boon for Gemcraft. The map is quite beautiful, the field level icons and gem graphics are nice, and the enemies look alright. I wish the enemies had a bit more variety though, being mostly variations of bugs. The textures could also use improvement in resolution, and perhaps some in their design. Many of the stages end up looking bland because of said design flaws of the textures.Audio:The music is good, not too obtrusive. The hit and death sounds are satisfying. Everything that needs a sound, has one, and usually they are nice. Like the graphics, however, I can't help but feel like there is a certain level of polish missing, that slight flair that can take something from amateur to professional. Noting, however, that Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is also a free browser based tower defense game, this is all actually quite impressive.Conclusion:So, in conclusion, Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is an excellent tower defense game with fun, depth, and style in spades. The concept is  beautiful. There are numerous options available, offering satisfying levels of control, and the excellent UI makes it exceptionally easy to play and navigate. The game can be as casual or hardcore as you'd like, and would be great for kids, adults, newbies and veterans alike. I recommend Gemcraft at full price. On sale is fine, too. On a deep sale, is also fine, however, you should definitely purchase this title, one way or the other. The dev deserves support, and the game is easily worth the money even at double the full price.======================================No drama, Just Reviews.If you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.====================================== "

												PROGemCraft (all different episodes) are definetly THE Tower Defense! It has the most amazing well thought through concept. Same as others I have played the series for hundreds of hours and bought this game to support the developer. I also want to note I am satisfied with this version just as well altough there is one thing which bugs me a lot (see con). Technically, this game is for someone who loves Tower Defenses and especially different ways to solve them. Early on everything is super easy but in the very late you will have to rethink concepts, try different strategies, think how to counter difficult monsters and the more difficult it becomes the more you will have to watch for your timings. The game contains tons of achievements and levels which are really different to play.CONThe author did not bother to make this version an HD version so its the same old graphics - which are beautiful - BUT for low resolution. In 1920p this game simply looks horribly upscaled and I do recommend everyon to switch to window mode and play it there - no one was bothered by this when it was a browser game, so why now? Because now the game is 8.99€ and I really think, this should have been the one important thing for a steam release. The game was already amazing and I would have bought the old version here on steam as well, as long as they were fit to a modern screen.The original resolution seems to be at least half the size of current screens.Still: If i play a tower defense for whatever reason, it is this series and no other. I grown up with the first tower defenses in starcraft and played them a lot through all of the blizz game titles and many of the popular flash games back then. I also tried some of the new mobile TDs but even if they look much more beautiful (new graphics vs old graphics upscaled) they all lack the creativity and possibilities of this one. This is simply the best!			"

												I've been playing the GemCraft series for years on Armor Games and I was thrilled to see this coming to Steam! This is going to eat away a chunk of my life now...It met my expectations and I recommend this to anyone who's into TD games. The sheer amount of levels, achievements, skills and game modes will never have you bored!			"

												This is an absolutely amazing game. It's the most recent installment in a series of great games, and it's very well done, especially for having been created by a small studio like GiaB. The scope of this game is massive; each of the 191 fields can take you anywhere from 20 minutes to 3 hours, depending on if you just want to get it over with, or farm the hell out of it for experience and achievements. The combat system is the best feature of this game, making it what is, Gemcraft. The ability to combine gems in any manner you choose gives you an insane amount of possibilities for how to build your defences, as well as having traps, towers, and amplifiers to place those gems in. Every field is a different challenge that requires different strategies to beat, and with 191 of them, that's a lot of strategies you can use. (Ok, really there's about a dozen different strategies, but you can implement them in a lot of different ways).This is by far the best 2D tower defence game I have ever played (or seen, for that matter) and I would personally rank it in the top 3 of all TD games. I doubt anyone else would fail to list it in the top 5, depending on their personal preferences.			"

												I have played this game for about a year on Armor Games, so I am qualified to rate this, even if it says I've only played it 3 minutes here.  Here goes:If you haven't played the Armor Games version, then this is definitely worth getting here.  Especially with the early Special Promotion offer.  If you've got the AG version, then it's totally up to you, as to whether you want to support the developer or not.  Either way, it is guranteed to give anyone who likes Tower Defense games many, many hours of gameplay.  Each level alone can give you 2 or 3 hours or more in a single Endurance run, and there are over a hundred different levels, starting with the 'F' hex, where 'F1' has 3 waves of a few monsters each, and they go up in difficulty from there.Some changes I've noticed-- there is an extra save slot here on Steam.  Also, you don't start off with Orblets or with a Red gem.  It's odd playing the first few maps without 'battle traits,' but here you don't pick up your first one until F4.  Also, it's nice being able to play in full-screen mode.  And it's alway fun racking up Steam Achievements-- this game has 419 of them.  And in 'Chasing Shadows,' it's not pointless to rack up these achievements-- each one that you get gives you a free skill point to improve your abilities with.The game isn't perfect, the way Gemcraft Labyrinth was, as Shrines aren't fun anymore: now they show up randomly, at random times and in random locations.  And I don't agree with the decision to tie the amount of times you anger a wave to the amount of beacons that appear-- in both cases I wish that I, the player, had more control over such decisions.  So some casual fans might find the game overly difficult at the start.  But for the fans, be it of Gemcraft or of Tower Defense games in general, these sort of decisions will only improve your gameplay as many of you now have a year of gameplay experience and already know when to use a white gem or when to use a black one, where to farm for mana and which maps are the best for early endurance runs.  I don't need to tell you guys anything as you already know and love the game.  So I'll add this one last point just for new players: don't be afraid to experiment.  There are plenty of guides out there if you get stuck, but sometimes it's fun to figure it out on your own.  Once you've played a few hours and want to optimize your gem ratios (and this can be as easy as deciding to make it out of two yellows, one red and one orange and four whites, or as hard as following the various high-level gem speccing guides which read like this: 2o+o+o+o+o+o+o+0(2o+b) + (2o+(o+r)+b+2b)+(2b+b+b+b+b+2b+(2o+b+2b) where r, b, and o stand for red,blue and orange gems. But you lose nothing by screwing around: even losing a level gives you shadow core, so if you want to try some prismatic gem to see what it does, go for it.  If you want to just keep playing F1 a dozen times before doing anything else, then do that.  It's your game, so have fun with it!			"

												Love this game.For the TD genre this game and all other installments offer a wide variety of strategy in how to lay your traps and fill your towers,but for me what real stands out is how u can adjust every level you play.Adding battle traits, many speed options, making the waves stronger and how u balance between those to not get overrun adds a new dimension to the challenge in every level.I advice any TD lover who never heard about gemcraft before or played the older installments to give it a try.

												I'll be amazed if I end up playing this game for less than 500 hours in total.Brilliant! And here are my top five reasons, which can ultimately be summarised in two words:Incredible flexibility1) There is a huge variety of stages to explore.2) It's not just about placing towers in predefined slots, you choose where to place your towers.3) The towers are powered by gems, but you have to decide what type of nine different gems to use and how powerful the gems are. The flexibility and number of possible combinations is mind boggling!4) I love the fact that unlocking achievements actually  yields skill points which can be spent on improving passive skills!5) Variable speed settings, up to 9x speed but also paused to allow you to manage your gems and place them on the field!There are so many more reasons, but stop reading this and go buy GemCraft and find out just how good this is!

												GemCraft: Chasing Shadows is both a great tower defense game and time killer. It offers a lot of flexibility in how you want to tailor the challenge - make it easy as pie, or brutally difficult, with a set of unique constraints to pick and choose from (similar to Bastion's idols). And you have plenty of tools at your disposal - different types of spells, structures and skills so you can customize your defense to suit the situation best, as well as an upgrade system that rewards careful utilization. Later levels really make you think through your strategy and approach, and will punish careless players.I've played dozens of hours of GemCraft chapters One and Zero, and feel that Chasing Shadows is an improvement on both games, so if you enjoyed the older titles and were considering this one, go for it.

												Add about 200 hours to my total for the time I played on the Flash version before the Steam version was released. That's how much enjoyment I've had with this game. It's a Tower Defense game with a story line, which is what initially attracted me to Gemcraft in the first place (been playing since the original back in 07). On top of that, it's a well executed game within the genre.Pros The replayability has to be the biggest pro. I've beaten the game twice (once on Flash and once again on Steam, they didn't have a transfer at the time, I don't know if they ever got one), and I still play for high scores. The motivation to get further and further in endurance mode is very driving. When playing through the game, there's over 150 different maps you can try. Some of them are homages to previous games (the epic battles and first levels mostly). And most of the maps are not simply reskinned versions of other maps. Each one has its challenges that make it harder. The sound. Well done sounds should convey what is going on very quickly (everything is working, wait now nothing is dying wtf). But the music should be unnoticable. It should blend perfectly with the game, and this music does that. It works very well with the settings.Cons The game has one set strategy for the end game. Basically the goal is to try and unlock mana, chain, bloodbound and crit gems and put them in traps. Then gem bomb the hell out of the end game. While the depths to the game actually give quite a bit of difficulty, once you know what you need to do it's very straight forward. My strategy has barely changed since I started running for high scores, regardless of map. That's it, really just the one con.This game is easily worth every cent. It has just as much content as any AAA game out there and for 1/6th the price.			"

												A tower defense game to rule them all!Only about 10% of the way into the total amount of stages the game offers and the game is pretty insane!Unlike other tower defense games you have Only ONE tower type you can make. (you also have floor traps but that is a bit later)Instead of having say the typical gatling gun, cannon, missle, etc you have one type of Tower, this tower just kind of shoots stuff within range. But the tower is actually useless until you put a gem within it! The gem you place within it then shoots and has special abilities.Chain: can hit multiple enemiesSlowPoisondrain mana (low damage but fills your mana some each time it attacks)armor destoryingand two buff typesblood (boosts off of its own attacking, after 30-50 etc it gets a bit stronger)Mana: The mana gem is more so a booster gem, your mana works in a pretty cool way, you have mana limits, but when you reach the mana limit you upgrade your limit, the Mana Gem works off your ManaPool level, so the more mana you store the stronger they get! Upgrading your mana pool also offers passives like more EXP, faster auto mana regen and such!The complexity of the game is not in making towers, instead it is all about crafting, with the 9 gem types you have you can upgrade and mingle their powers!Gems can go through levels 1-12 FREAKING TWELVE levels! You can level gems up by comboing them 1-1=2 2-2=3 and so on! Or if you have enough mana you can just buy a Pure Gem of that type which is upgraded, but has only that type of gem in it.Comboing gems is cheaper though, and if done right faster leveling up your gear!Along side all the crafting you have other skills too!Bomb, you don't need that gem? Too many baddies in an area? Make a gem and select Bomb and you can just drop that sucker right on all those jerks heads! Using a bomb also makes Mana Wasps which linger and cause a stunning affect!Floor traps. A gem type trap, mostly great for posion as far as I have played, but they are special since you can only play them on the monster path, but hey its more damage!Spells, eventually you get spells, allowing you to do things like freeze a group of enemies! Frozen enemies even EXLPODE on death dealing damage to more baddies!You also get Binding powers, much like a spell, but they are passive buffs you can give your traps. Floor ones get it forever, towers get a nice big buff for a few shots.This game is brilliant! There are even challenge missions where you have no passive skills and have to figure it out more puzzle style than most challenges.Best part of this game though for me? NO RATINGS! Always mad when you have to do the entire challenge again cause ONE guy got through some how? Don't care! All that sucker does is eat through a bit of your mana and you keep trucking!Another great thing is Endless mode being there right from the start! When you complete a stage you can do Endless on it with all the gear you already laid out, and just test yourself against ever growing enemies! Mind you, in Endless you can not get anything aside from EXP and accessories! But you get everything from the challenge you already gained even if you go for the Endless mode, so try it and get extra EXP! :D			"

												GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is the metaphorical hidden ""gem"" among indie tower defence games. You play as a sorcerer who uses magical gems to protect his ""orb of presence"" (the command centre or flag, if you will) from waves of monsters. This Fantasy theme was what made me buy this game in the first place, and I did not regret it.In comparison to other TD games I have played, the gems used in towers and traps have a particularly wide variety of effects, including but not limited to single target or multiple target damage, damage over time, slowing down, armor piercing, mana leeching (mana is the currency you spend for more gems, gem upgrades and buildings, and at the same time, it serves as the ""health bar"" of your orb - a connection with major tactical consequences) ... you can also apply special effects like freezing enemies in an area of effect or adding bolts to do higher damage where the battle situation makes it necessary. The monsters only come in a few different shapes and sizes, but the occasional attacks of flying gem thieves who can easily destroy your main front create exciting situations anyway. As there are so many things going on, I had no time to get bored of the attackers, and even if this would have been the case: The developer offers you the option to change the speed of time flow and even pause, a player service well-appreciated.The single levels, connected by an expanding map that offers you some freedom of strategical choice where to attack next, not only display the usual patterns of roads, building ground, pre-made buildings and so on, but also loot chests, mana pools, destructable monster nests and many other special features that help to avoid repetitivity. Scrolls, relics and crafting materials you loot on those battlegrounds are used to improve your character, give you new buffs and spells and thereby the power to master difficult challenges on the map in which you were defeated in your first attempt - which makes the final victory even sweeter. Talking about accomplishments: Apart from being an entertaining and surprisingly deep TD game, this is a real achievement factory. You get those for every single little step and discovery, and as there are many (see above), you are practically showered in them. I think I received around 80 in the first five hours of gameplay (more than Skyrim has in total!), and there are more than 400 to earn here. If you are on a hunt for Steam achievements, go and get this title!Graphics and sound are functional, they add some nice details to the whole experience, but the dynamic gameplay is definitely the major strength of this product. Within its own genre, I judge it to be an 8.5/10.			"

 Grindy, but entertaining tower defense that offers deep customization and many different tactics to complete the levels, boosting up the replay value a lot Starts out a bit slow, and with really simple, linear levels. After a while you start receiving upgradable gemstones for your talisman that give you passive bonuses. They might be x% damage to a specific enemy type, faster tower reload rate, more mana, slower killchain decrease rate etc. That alone lets you build a ""character"" for a specific playstyle. But wait, there's more!We have skills that also give passive bonuses, different tower types of course and combination of those tower types. You can either build a ""pure"" tower with one element, or a combination of 2 or more different types. So far i've been in levels that offered me 6 different types at the same time, and i could make a combination of all of them in the same tower. It costs a lot though! In addition to towers we have traps that are built on the ground for bad guys to walk over. Like towers, they can be equipped with one element, or a combination. We also have spells that give special attacks to your towers or traps. There are a lot of levels. Some of them are pure classic tower defense, some feature additional objectives like destroying a certain targets before the last wave, either by simply shooting them with your towers or using some specific spell/level gem to bomb them with. The design seemed first very linear, but after a while they started opening up, and we can build proper mazes on many levels! That's the most fun part of TD game in my eyes, and not many TD games offer us that, for some strange reason. After the waves you can start Endurance mode for more exp, enemies and talisman stones! If you want more challenge on the levels, you unlock battle traits when progressing in the game. They increase the exp in addition to the difficulty.I haven't experienced a single bug, everything runs smooth. Shuold you buy it?YES! Defense grid 1 has always been my favorite TD game, it offers everything a good TD game should. But i think this may replace DG on the number one spot! The amount of different playstyles this game offers is stunning.			"

												Though as of writing this review I have 76.7 hours, I must have played this for at least another 100 hours in offline mode. I'm usually not the kind of person to play Tower Defense games. The only TD game I have ever played aside from this was Fieldrunners 2 on iOS, and even then I played it very little. That being said, this game is VERY fun and quite addicting too. Got this on sale a while back, but now that it's on sale again for the 2016 Summer Sale, I wanted to take the time to recommend this game to everyone.This game plays just like any other TD I have seen: enemies walk along a path, you build towers along said path, and defend a certain end point of the path by shooting at enemies with those towers. But what really makes this game stand out is the customization of the towers and the possibilities and potential they have based on the gems that you create. You have gems of different colors, each color having their own effects, which you can put into towers and traps to damage enemies and apply those effects. However, you can combine gems to combine their effects, as well as applying a boost to overall damage at the cost of lowering their overall special power. These combined gems are perfect for towers, but for traps you'll want to stick with single color gems to get the most of their effects (until you get certain gems later that you can still combine with them and get an even more massive boost), as traps will greatly lower damage but will boost specials.There are many skills to unlock, as well as new difficulties that also increase your experience gain, not to mention hundreds of achievements. Thus, you get a lot of value for just a few dollars.However, there is one qualm that I do have with this game, and I know this is mainly an issue with it being a Flash game and all, but...when you get far into the game, to the point you have thousands of monsters on your path, the game will lag intensely. Even if you have a good computer, it'll happen. But, you'll only have to worry about that when you get really far into the game and you are farming for large amounts of experience. As of this review, my wizard level is at around 5,000, and I have had sessions where I would play on a single map for 6+ hoursPros:* In-depth customization of gems (you'll see just how customizable when you learn about things like 32-spec gems)* Lots of things to find and unlock, and great replayability* Very nice skill tree system that helps boost your gems and overall abilities* Talisman system, where you can insert collectible fragments that boost your stats* Practically endless, skill points being purchaseable with shadow cores (dropped from enemies) and some skills having no cap     (I read somewhere that theoretically the level limit is around 50,000 but don't know if this is true)Cons:* Very laggy when you get a couple thousand monsters on the path. This is to be expected since it's a Flash game but it can be an annoyance, especially when it becomes a necessity when trying to max your experience. All I can suggest is keeping your speed low (1x or 3x, I heard that with 9x enemies can even bypass some of your traps) and just doing other things at the same time to help pass time. Still, this is not much of a big deal and won't happen until you are really far into the game, so it's not something that should turn anyone away from this wonderful game.Even if you are not a fan of Tower Defense games, you will certainly find enjoyment with GemCraft.

Written review:Gemcraft is a very interesting and deep tower defence game. It distinguishes itself from other games in that you don't really have different towers to build, but you can mix different types of gems together in order to build/customize exactly the gem you want.Some pro's:- Tons of content (lots of levels, multiple modes of play, multiple difficulties)- Tons of customization (skills, talismans, battle traits, difficulty, crafting your own gems)- Lots of depth, the game has many interesting mechanics, such as banishment, amplifiers, enraging.- Fairly good tutorial- Quite some secretsSo basically it has everything you could ever want from a tower defence game. Here's some cons:- The optimization is terrible. When you do endurance runs, be prepared for about 1fps. My computer was top of the crop about a year ago, and it dies playing this simple flash game.- It can be very grindy. This depends on what you do though. If your goal is to beat endurance run, be prepared for a very long grind. - Making the perfect gem combinations is extremely tedious and full of weird math. Some people like this, I personally don't. Tower defence should be about skill of placement etc., not about being able to combine 500 gems in exactly the right order.I think this game is really one of the better tower defence games around. Lot's of depth and replay value, what else could you want? Furthermore it's priced very fairly. 8.5/10.			"

												Can't say it's a bad game, but if you are expecting the old gemcraft like I did, you are gonna have a bad time.What I like about tower defenses is reproducibility. No matter who is playing, if he is doing the same things as you do, you both gonna end with the same results. And this the major flaw in the resent gemcraft games, they are more and more random, which mean you can play multiple times exactly the same way, sometimes you are going to win and sometimes you won't.For example, sometimes a shadow apears and destroys your orb, does it mean that my plan was bad? NO! I just had a bad luck. So I try the same plan again and this time the shadow doesn't appear and I win. This is not how tower defense should behave.The game now has an insane amount of boring grinding (talisman, and repeating old levels for more exp), I can't even say it's a tower defense anymore, it's an RPG. So if a level is too hard, instead of thinking why is your strategy bad, you just go grind the easy levels until you can brute force the hard ones.Luckly there are vision levels which are actually a tower defense levels, no exp grinding, no random events.There is also an iron wizard mode, to which I got really excited at first, until I realized it's still has RPG elements, much less then the main game but still there is the option of completing more easy levels to have it easier at the hard ones.TL:DRIt's mostly a grinding RPG now, not a TD.It's not bad but misleading if you are looking for the old gemcraft TD.

												With hundreds of hundreds tower defence games it's easy to get lost in tons of clones and mediocre titles. Looking at GemCraft's screenshots or even trailer, I've put it in ""No, thanks"" category. It looks like another generic, Adobe Flash based tower defence, and it's true. This painfully simple looking game has it's roots in flash, as it was released in web some time ago. What caught my attention were positive reviews of GemCraft. I bit the bullet and boy was I surprised!Quickly, you are enveloped in minimalistic but eerie and mystical atmosphere. Curious, slowly unfolding story and dark music made it complete. With that, you slowly get to know GemCrafts mechanics. As you progress, you'll be gradually realising how big of a game GemCraft is. Though gameplay rules aren't revolutionary, the amount of features is overwhelming.As the title says, you'll be crafting gems to defend yourself from incoming waves of monsters. That's simple, right? You'll receive a massive amount of gems that have different roles and characteristics. You'll have basic attack towers, enhancement towers and traps which you can upgrade. That's still simple and familiar. Now, here's the thing - you're free to combine and mix gems you want. You want to have highly damaging tower that also freezes enemies? Or maybe you want it to also poison and lower armour grade? Sure you can. Everything combination you can think of is possible. It's the core of the game - not only you have to decide where to place the towers, what gems to choose, how much to upgrade them but also mix them just right from your own recipe.And it gets better. Looking at the map in between missions you'll see how gigantic it is. Even more so, you can shape missions just like a mix your gems. As you level up, gradually unlocked game modifiers can drastically transform the mission so much that your previous, perfect tactics become completely uselss. Many skills and mods offer a high reward at a price of high risk. That breaths a new life in levels that you would normally tick off as completed. As a cherry on top of the cake there are secrets that are cryptical enough to keep your curious.That being said, GemCraft is a top notch tower defense game that despite poor initial impression will keep you playing for long. If you plan to highscore endurance levels, it will perhaps last a lifetime.Final score : 8/10The  good :- Ridiculous amount of gameplay- Great, dark atmosphere and music- Freedom to create your own tacticsThe bad :- Somewhat basic graphics- It will devour your free time and ask for more			"

												Moving from a game without meat on its bones, here's one with an absolute ton of it. Chasing Shadows is the latest game in the Gemcraft series, which have appeared on flash sites before this; they have an ongoing storyline, but it generally features you playing as a nameless wizard, fighting monsters using gems, as the title implies. Much like Kingdom Rush, Chasing Shadows is a paid version of the game with all the premium content unlocked.Chasing Shadows is considered the second chapter of the game, and has apparently been in development since 2011. It certainly shows, as the game has a great deal of polish, and also looks quite nice considering it's a flash game. You play as an unnamed wizard who has just recovered from being possessed by a demon known as the Forgotten, which happened at the end of Chapter 1. Now free from your body, she aims to invade the Spiritforge, a citadel where the other wizards of the world are hiding out. From his old tower, your wizard aims to trap her before she can do this, which entails projecting himself into the lands ahead to free them of monsters and gather strength.You have quite a bit of freedom in Chasing Shadows. The game uses sort of a grid system, and you can build a tower anywhere there's four spaces free. You power them by slotting in gems, from a set selection in each level, although at some later point it seems you do unlock the ability to use types of them whenever you want. There's no real 'base' gem, as all of them have some special power, from a chance to hit multiple enemies, to poison, to stealing mana (the main resource of the game). You can also combine them, creating a tower that does multiple things at once. Not long in the game, you unlock traps, which make the gems deal far less damage but amplify their effects. Much later, there are also amplifiers, which buff adjacent towers and traps. Finally there are walls, which divert enemy paths. This all comes together to give you a lot of freedom with how you approach levels.Each gem has twelve ranks to it, which require increasingly large amounts of mana to create. This ties into the game's level-up system, where you gain more base mana every level, with an additional amount for the skill points you've accrued (three every level, plus a certain amount for each of the game's many, -many- achievements) but haven't invested. It feels like a game meant to appeal to gamers that like watching their numbers get bigger and bigger, not unlike Disgaea. And much like that series, Chasing Shadows gives you a lot of shortcuts to grinding, since the game allows - dares, really - you to play chicken with it at every turn.Other Tower Defense games let you call a wave early for bonuses. Chasing Shadows does that too, but also allows you to call multiple waves at once, including a specific key combination for calling every single wave still remaining to come charging in at once. Before that, you can drop gem bombs on the markers indicating them, causing more of them to spawn and tougher. Throughout the game you also acquire Battle Trait scrolls, which you can set at a level from one to nine before a level, spawning an extra wave for each and giving the enemy certain bonuses, but also increasing your total experience dramatically if you're daring enough. Since the first difficulty isn't very taxing while playing normally, this can spice up your experience a lot.There are quite a few levels in Chasing Shadows, but it tries its best to keep things from being boring, and most of them tend to have some set-pieces about them. This ranges from simple things like abandoned buildings or chests you can blow open for minor rewards, to ones that seriously affect a given level, such as Tome Chambers, which unlock a skill for you provided you kill a certain amount of enemies in its range, or Wizard Towers, which unlock further sections of the map if you break all the locks around them - and you should, since they'll fail the level for you if you don't.Compared to the other games I've covered, this one has a more solitary feel to it; there's no real music, and not too many sound effects, so if you want a game to chill out with while you're listening to something you won't be missing out on much. And if you want a lot of bang for your buck or a game that has a lot of avenues for improvement, it can offer that too. It's newer, but should definitely be recommended alongside Kingdom Rush and Defense Grid.			"

												Overall GemCraft - Chasing Shadows provides a relaxing, but not mindless, game experience. It is graphically pleasing and is not taxing on your computer's performance. The only negative I found while playing is that the tutorial is not very proficient at teaching the game, but the game is fairly easy to grasp anyway. Overall it is a solid game for the money asked.			"

												BEST tower defence on steam, no doubt!I recall myself playing ""Gemcraft - The Forgotten"" back in 2008, it ""possessed"" me immediatelyGameplayThe only resource you have is mana ---- build towers and craft gems out of mana, monster reaching your orb costs you mana. There are 9 types of gem in total: Mana Leech, Critical Hit, Chain Hit, Armor Tearing, Supressing, Poison, Slow, Poolbound and Bloodbound, each plays a different role in the defence. Combine gems with different components to have more than one special power, . Place your gems in a tower or a trap which defends in different ways, or might as well place them in a amplifier to strengthen other gems; they can also be used as bombs to kill monsters, enrage waves, heat a spark or strengthen your orb.RPG mechanicsReveal an epic story as you process. Unlock skills by opening tome chambers, unlock battle traits by unlocking wizard towers and gain talisman fragments to permanantly improve your play. Beat a level to gain XP, level up and spend skill points deliberately (although can be reset for free) Boost your gems using enhancement spells ---- Bolt, Beam and Barrage; weaken monsters by strike spells ---- Freeze, Curse and Wake of Eternity.Difficulty scales variouslyThere are 3 difficulties and 9 battle traits. One can easily beat the game on lowest difficulty with no battle traits. However, with ""Hatred"" trait set to level 10, monsters have +1,000,000% more hit points and +7% wave hit point increment, it can be quite challanging. You can also enrage to have more and stronger monsters, in result more mana and XP. Frankly, it's a ""choose your own difficulty"" tower defence -- great for both casual and hardcore players.Huge replay valueReplay previous levels on higher difficulty with some battle traits for more XP. Move on to endurance and see how far you can go. You can even finish endurance with flawless skilz and patience, but it's far from easy ---- 999 waves and hit points grow exponentially (as far as I know, there's no one who can beat a Haunting Hatred 10 endurance :P) When you become skillful and confident, there's Iron Wizard mode waiting for you ---- No XP or level, finishing a field grants you 5 skill points. A pure skill test without grinding, which I found really challenging and time consuming.Epic storyThere are 4 games in Gemcraft series ---- ""Chapter 1: The Forgotten"", ""Chapter 0: Gem of Eternity"", ""Labyrinth"" and ""Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows"". Chapter 1 focuses on a young wizard sent to fight an evil wizard in the East, at the end he was astonished that the evil wizard was possessed by a creature known as ""The Forgotten"". Chapter 0 is a prequel about the release of The Forgotten by the evil wizard. Labyrinth tells a story about a gembearer crafting ""Gem of Eternity"", elaborating the only way to fight The Forgotten ---- ""We fight her desperately to no end... We do not know any way to kill her, only seal her away temporarily with the Gem of Eternity. But she always gets free after a few decades... After being forgotten..."" And in Chapter 2, we follow the young wizard racing to the Spiritforge to seal The Forgotten, but ends in a very dramatical way. We encountered a shadow in the Labyrinth as a boss, but soon figured out there are lots of them wandering outside, killing them directly weakens The Forgotten ---- and this is why it's called ""Chasing Shadows"".Achievements419 achievements in total and finishing them actually gives you skill points in the gameLast but not least, it's faily cheap even not on a saleBuy and you won't regret it			"

You have for AT LEAST 200-300 hours of gameplay if not even more. It will not be easy for most players to reach 100% of the achievements ( yes 419 achievements) because u need to put some time into the game for it and also the game itself is really hard farther u go . when i say casual to hardcore i mean by that u can play the normal game all the way or you can put some traits that will increase the difficulty for more XP. So its good for every1.Stop reading and just go play lolLots of replayabilities and Lots of replayabilities :)I would give it a 5 out of 5Sorry if my english was bad and i hope you will enjoy this game Melovia			"

												Gemcraft is one of the most successful tower defense series for a reason.  This game is all about options, because with a little experience you can earn mutators to be set pre mission to increase the difficulty and the XP earned.  Since you only gain XP over what you did previously on repeat runs, grinding isn't really grinding, it's raising the bar for a second run.  You can also pour your power (through gems,) into the oncoming monster waves, to toughen them and earn you more XP.You also can find drops of talismans for more upgrades, and these can be improved. If you like tower defense games, this is a no brainer, up there with Defense Grid and Defender's Quest.			"

												Gemcraft CS is one of the best, if not the best, tower defense game on Steam. It is a straight to the point, massive re-playable game. Your role is to combine gems with varieties, in order to kill a specific monster wave count at every stage. There are two modes, a normal very adjustable one and a difficult, more fixed one.The breakthrough in my opinion is that the difficulty of every stage is adjustable to the players’ skill/likeness, by added traits in battle. As you gain levels and level up you get skill points to boost your skills and talisman fragments that raise your stats. Furthermore the enemy level and number is also adjustable, making the whole game suitable for any type of player, casual or hardcore. There are also a massive number of playing fields (some hidden, some as puzzle rewards).Great game overall, well crafted, balanced, with option giving gameplay. "

												One of the best tower defense games I've had the pleasure to experience throughout my life.  I played them all, and all of them were masterpieces.  They are all free to play on various sites (Kongregate/Armorgames).  While this game may seem like a rather normal tower defense game, it's much more complex than others.You build a tower which has nothing in it.  For the tower to do anything, you must place gems.  These gems start off weak, but can be combined with other similar gems or different gems to create very complex gems with a ton of various stats.  There's no ""build bomb tower"" or ""build barracks tower"".  You instead have gems like ""Slow the enemy by x"" and ""Chain in X range"".  They start off weak, but get much stronger as you invest into them.  You have to figure out which gems and gem combinations work best.   You can also place your specialized gems in other towers by just swapping them around, as well as traps and support towers(gives buffs depending on gem).  The player even has the ability to create a gem and THROW it at the enemies, doing damage/effects equal to the gem you used.  There are over 190 levels and each level can be customized (as you unlock the features by playing) to increase the difficulty, the wave amount, the amount of monsters, etc.  Each level feels different from the last, and it doesn't seem to ever get tiresome.  The game offers over 400 achievements, which while may not appealing to some, gives you skill points to spend on the various skills.   The skillpoints can be allocated in 25 various skills, all being able to be reset and toyed with at any time.  There is also an interesting ""talisman"" system which allows you to boost various things, sort of like rarer skill points.  Why buy it on steam and not play it for free? The steam version comes with new levels, better graphics, full screen, steam cloud, and achievements.  While not much of a reason to buy it to some people, the game is easily one of the best tower defense games  and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of genre.			"

												If you've played Gemcraft Labyrinth on Armorgames, you know the general drill.If you don't, it's a tower defense game.  You place gems in towers and let them shoot monsters -- different types of gems have different effects (slowing, poison, multiple hits, etc).  You try to kill all of them before they reach your orb.Along the way, you accrue experience points in order to gain skill points that make you more effective.  As you progress through the game, you come across ""traits"" that you can use to make a battle harder in exchange for more xp.  Pros:- Super addictive gameplay.  - There are a lot (a /lot/) of maps to play and things to do.- Over four hundred achievements- User-defined difficulty.  I like this.  Overall, each battle is pretty easy, but you're given many, many tools to make them harder (in exchange for more xp)...but it's all at your own discretion.- The game progresses at a nice pace.  You can go back to a map that gave you trouble ten levels later and walk all over it, or try it again with more difficulty.Cons:- Can feel very grindy.  As stated, there are /a lot/ of levels. - Enemy scaling (in terms of health or armor) isn't visually apparent -- if your towers are one-shotting monsters now, it is not apparent when that will stop until it happens.- Optimizing the angering of waves still involves annoying mathematical calculations Should you get this game?  You can play it for free on armorgames.com (it has microtransactions there; the Steam version does not have any microtransactions) and test it out.			"

												Tower defenses fall into two seperate categories.. There are non-GemCraft-types, and the GemCraft-Types.. Obviously the best category is the latter! The latest installment in the series, Chasing Shadows, is freaking incredible. I have found myself playing this game a lot since I bought it. My favorite part of this game is the fact that it gets better as you play. Even to this point I am having more fun playing it now than I was when I first started. The story itself is pretty damn interesting for a tower defense as well. After ~25 hours I beat the story and now I am continuing to get more experience from older levels to beat the hidden ones. I highly recommend this game, it is worth it especially at the price of only 10$			"

												I don't usually review games, but for some reason decided to for this one. I was looking around steam for good tower defense games because I've recently been on a Bloods TD 5 kick but decided I wanted something new. I looked around the top TD games and found this and a few others, so far I've tried 3/4 of the ones I picked up but GemCraft is far and away the best. You can build and upgrade gems that have certain effects, augmenting them by putting them in traps/towers/amplifiers or combining them, you can build walls, custom tower locations and even drop your gems as bombs and later on cast spells and enhancements. If you're looking for a TD game that goes beyond just building towers in set locations and watching this game is 100% worth the money. There are other customization options like skills you can upgrade and the talisman fragments which give you buffs, along with traits that can buff waves and increase exp and so many other things. This game is pretty much a must have for lovers of TD games and is dirt cheap.			"

												Gemcraft is a unique specimen. Hailing from humble roots as a flash game, Gemcraft 2 is actually the 4th entry in the series, and every entry has been vastly better than the previous.Gemcraft is a tower defense game. But it's not your average tower defense game. Sure, you build towers, but the towers themselves don't defend you. That's what the gems do, which you put in said towers. Unlike traditional towers, gems can be moved around, modified, and even thrown as bombs. It makes for a refreshing experience in an otherwise quite stagnant genre.On top of that, Gemcraft is one of the only tower defense games I've seen with RPG elements, and this one has them in spades. From your humble beginnings as a level 1 wizard, you'll have trouble making gems that can deal more than 50 damage per hit. But, if you know what you're doing, you can easily reach 4-digit, and even 5-digit wizard levels, whereby you practically sneeze out million damage gems. It doesn't take too much effort -- if you know how -- to create gems that require scientific notation to express their damage. My current record -- which won't take long for me to beat -- is a gem which deals between 9.61e19 and 2.30e21 damage per hit, with an 80% chance to crit for x4.16e15 damage, and whose shot bounces around until it hits somewhere around a thousand enemies. Also, it can reach the entire map and fires 30 shots per second. Sound godly? It is, until roughly wave 500, where enemies start coming in with 1e40 HP, give or take.Gemcraft does have one problem, however; framerate lag. Once you have several gems with incredible chain-hit elements, thousands of monsters on screen, and the works, the game will slow down to single-digit framerates. This will happen regardless of your graphics settings, and even regardless of your computer. My computer is a beast that can run pretty much any modern game at max settings at 60 FPS, so it's definitely not just me. If you plan on doing insane endurance runs, be prepared for the slowdown.

												I haven't played a Tower Defense game in years. I got h this one on sale, let it sit for a bit, and then decided to check it out. And... I am glad I did. Yeah, I know. I don't have a ton of time in. Yet. That will change, Pros:Singleplayer. No a-holes coming in and destroying your defenses just for sheets and giggles. It's all on you, you vs. the AI. I like that. Idiot griefers in MP TD games in the past are why I stopped playing. Not having to deal with them here is a HUGE plus. Not ""easy"". It is easy to pick up, but  can already tell in my short playtime, that it will not be easy to master. You need good strategy and planning, even early on. Interersting story to the game. Reading the pages as you unlock them adds a nice element.  Nice graphics and audio. Nothing spectacular, but nothing ugly either. It's bright enough and colorful enough to captivate, without being blinding with flashes and flying particles everywhere. The ambient sounds are realistic and not overwhemingly loud or distracting. Cons:Needs a little more of a Tutorial for new players, and those who are not familiar with Tower Defense games. But this is a minor thing, there is a Tutorial Booklet with all of the neccessary commands, it just does not explain to a first-timer how things work, and how they work together or against each other. Game is forgiving though- you can go back and replay any field until you get the hang of it. May be a bit overpriced at full price ($10 USD), for what you are getting. Steam Achievements- if you are hoping for a quick and easy 100% game, this isn't the game for you, lol! There are 400+ Achievements, and the global stats show that many of them take a ton of time and effort to get.  (But if you like challenging Achievements- this IS a game for you!) Overall? 8/10. Not a ""must have"", but a solid ""Should have"", especially if you love Tower Defense and can get it on sale.Now, I need to go and play this game some more. It calls to me...			"

												Probably the best TD game I have ever played, and one of the best games overall. It's shiny! It's fun! It's engaging! The combination of the number of skills to develop, talisman pieces to use and upgrade, and gameplay tactics to use makes this game fun at every level, with strategies constantly changing as you level up and advance. It's not a game where higher difficulty means doing the same maps over and over again -- you will have to rethink the way you play, redesign your skill placement, look for new strategies... It was the very first free browser game EVER that I bought an expansion pack for, and I never regretted it. Got hundreds of hours of gamplay out of it, and now with the Steam version there's even more content. I joined Steam just to buy it.			"

												Wow, what a deceptively great tower defense game.The screenshots show a somewhat bland top-down map, with some non-descript elements. It is only when you watch a gameplay video that you see a fluidity of animation that testifies to some measure of quality. And then, it is only after you have opened the main game up that you begin to grasp the immense scope of its long-term progression.An *extremely* clever game design. Simple to control, uncluttered, with very profound replayability over long periods, with long-term persistent skill & equipment unlocking/improvement. The game may be played for free on the website of the developer, but with ads; outright purchase to both squash those ads and to support the developer for such an excellent job is the way to go. Absolutely worth a try.			"

												Great game for tower defense fans.I first got into the series back in 2008 when I saw Gemcraft available on Armorgames. I had a good time playing through it and all the following gemcraft games after that. After Labyrinth, I rarely looked up news about possible new sequel over 3-4 years until I found out that it would be available to buy on steam or playable on Armorgames again. I was happy, but I had other games to play and decided to wait for a steam release along with a discount.Then one day, a new killer bundle comes up from Bundle Stars and I take a look at it - Chasing Shadows is right there, so I decide to buy. At this time I was still playing other games, so I didn't install it until a few days ago.The game is very fun and rewarding as there is a lot of variety! You can use various abilities on enemies, drop bombs on enemies and waves, place many kinds of towers, combine towers to upgrade them, add various rules that increase your exp gain, craft items and upgrade those items for various benefits all at your own pace (you can press space to pause wave and do whatever as long as you have the spell charges and mana for it). There is a big amount of achievements too. I've failed some stages because of bombing waves too much, but it hasn't frustrated me. You can restart the stage after learning from your mistakes and use 9x speed to get back to where you lost rather quickly.If you like getting achievements and playing tower defense games, I would recommend to buy this game.10/10 (might edit this more later..)

												I usually don't play tower defense games alot, but Gemcraft is different.Gemcraft is all about gems (as the name suggests), their special abilities and their combination. While a classic tower defense game requires you to build and upgrade static towers, in Gemcraft the only static part you will place, are sockets for gems (two entirely different socket types are available). And costs for sockets will become neglectable in the later game. The gem placed in a socket again does all the shooting and killing monsters. This gives the incredible advantage to combine and relocate shooting power at will.Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is part of the Gemcraft series, which can be found on Armor Games. I spent nights over nights and countless hours playing Gemcraft Labyrinth. I also dislike in-game purchases, so the Steam release, which delivers the full game (and more) for a one time purchase, is really awesome.One interesting thing about Gemcraft is, that everything works exponentially. If you have a thing for numbers, you'll probably love this. For example a grade 2 gem features roughly twice the power of a grade 1 gem and a grade 3 gem twice the power of a grade 2 gem and so on. Costs also increase at the same rate and enemy strength does as well. So in lategame you will find yourself surrounded by very interesting looking numbers. :)Besides the main tower defense action, Gemcraft features a variety to improve yourself like skill points, which will provide most advantage when precisely balanced between skills and unspent points, or talisman fragments, which feature a random loot and enhancing system. It's also possible to make the game harder. Alot harder. Just add your favourite battle traits to the battle.Further than that there are also countless other features, like gem bombing, dwellings, monster nests, mana pool management, shrines, apparations, and more.All together there is little I can not recommend in this game.Go, play this game now, it's awesome!

												Great game for tower defense fans.I first got into the series back in 2008 when I saw Gemcraft available on Armorgames. I had a good time playing through it and all the following gemcraft games after that. After Labyrinth, I rarely looked up news about possible new sequel over 3-4 years until I found out that it would be available to buy on steam or playable on Armorgames again. I was happy, but I had other games to play and decided to wait for a steam release along with a discount.Then one day, a new killer bundle comes up from Bundle Stars and I take a look at it - Chasing Shadows is right there, so I decide to buy. At this time I was still playing other games, so I didn't install it until a few days ago.The game is very fun and rewarding as there is a lot of variety! You can use various abilities on enemies, drop bombs on enemies and waves, place many kinds of towers, combine towers to upgrade them, add various rules that increase your exp gain, craft items and upgrade those items for various benefits all at your own pace (you can press space to pause wave and do whatever as long as you have the spell charges and mana for it). There is a big amount of achievements too. I've failed some stages because of bombing waves too much, but it hasn't frustrated me. You can restart the stage after learning from your mistakes and use 9x speed to get back to where you lost rather quickly.If you like getting achievements and playing tower defense games, I would recommend to buy this game.10/10 (might edit this more later..)

												I purchased this game without knowing anything about it. It was on a 80% off sale sit piqued my interest and as several of my friends had it I gave it a shot. I give thisgame a 10/10 for its design, polish and addictive gameplay and would dare to say itsworth even full prize.CONTENTI spent several hours already and even tho its always the same (protect your orb and kill off any critters before they can reach you) theres a ton of diversity in form of gems, skills, map types, special challenges, tasks etc etc. I didnt yet uncover the whole map or unlock every skill or tower or gem but so far I m busy whenever I find the time to log in. It shows that this game isnt ""new"" as it got additional content en masse over time and being faced with all of it now is kinda overwhelming but also very exciting as I realize I ll play this for a looooooooooong time.THE GOALYou ll be thrown into a maze with 1 orb at the end and 1 or multiple entries for critters. Sometimes the map also has Monster spawners in them including even more critters per wave. Each map has a pre-defined number of waves coming at you and also pre-determined critter strenghts. Each passing second will contribute you with mana, killing a critter adds yet more mana and of course there are other means to tap mana (environmental, gems, shrines). You use that mana in order to build stuff, create gems or upgrade existing gems. You can also just let it collect which enables you to increase your ""mana level"" representing your ""interest"" known from other games. Basically the more interest you can accumulate the higher the bonuses you ll get so the game ""taunts"" you with trying to beat the map with the least necessary tools forcing you to keep trying new combinations in order to maximize your result.TOWERSI call em towers but in reality these only represent the bases of your mazes (hey, that rhymed). Things like a tower foundation or trap foundation or booster foundations. All of these dont do anything on their own but require gems placed into them in order to damage critters.GEMSThere is a whole list of different gems with different attributes. Some damage, others debuff or buff. You dont have access to all of them at all times. The map you play decides which gem types are available to you. Gems can be placed or upgraded as PURE which means their attribute is especially strong or you can combine different colors of gems in order to combine their attributes. This means that both attributes become weaker then in a pure gem but the obvious advantage is that you now use 2 attributes at the same time. You can combine as many as 4 different colors in a single gem. Using multi-colored gems will increase their upgrade cost as well. Theres a whole segment of theory crafting behind the combination of gems. I didnt get all of it yet but I realize it supports rather INSANE combos which enables you to push  your results into incredible heights.SKILLS and TALISMANSThese represent a kind of progression curve for you. Skill points are mostly dependant on your level (each level grants you a certain number of points and also certain feats and tasks in the game do the same) and let you ""purchase"" bonuses in certain areas. Maybe you d like to get more mana per kill or make certain types of gems stronger? There are 25 skills to chose from and each one can be upgraded ""unknown"" times (my highest so far is 15 and I dont think it ends there anytime soon). In addition unspent skill points increase your starting mana so again you are faced with hard decisions as being able to create and place strong gems before the first wave appears can represent easy-mode. You can reset your skills and redistribute your skills at any time allowing you to micro-manage for specific maps.Talismans on the other hand are fueled by shadow cores and these are aquired by defeating enemies in general and certain critter types. Before you can use shadow cores you gonna need talismans and getting them is kind of a lottery thing. Theres a whole list of different types at different rarities. You have a ""wheel"" of amulettes enabling you to place a finite amount of them so replacing or keeping them in stock is a good idea later on once you start to ""optimize"" your amulets for the maps you run. The ones I used so far only have minor bonuses (up to +9% on certain things) but I havent found any higher rarity ones yet. You can use your shadow cores to boost the rarity chance of any talismans as well.MAPSMaps are unique in design and each one of them has a specific list of gems it allows touse. That doesnt mean you have access to all of them at the start as certain gem types need to be unlocked first before you can use them.""Mazing"" is a critical thing inside maps which you accomplish by placing walls in a pattern to force critters to take a longer route or come by certain spots multiple times in order to increase your possible kill time or make your placed gems more valuable (by being able to attack passing matters more then once with the same gem). Many maps also have structures or other specials which represent additional challenges. This could be mana wells, monster dens, shrines, spectres and (probably) many more (those are the only ones I had so far).ENDGAMEI m still busy unlocking stuff so probably havent seen half of everything but I spotted the ""Endurance mode"" already which is activatable whenever you beat a map and represents ""open mode"". Probably not ""open"" as they have a finite number of waves but the ones I sampled so far ramp up so quickly in difficulty that I gonna need a lot more levels, skills and resources in general to get em done. I read that some of them require ""multiple hours"" to complete so looking forward to the fun. At the moment my wizard is to weak and cannot beat more then a couple waves in endurance mode before he gets overrun.There are not really any ""hard limits"" on stuff like in other TD games where you can upgrade your towers a finite number of times before you reach the ""max"". I ve seen videos with incredible gem levels, wizard levels and overall numbers shown on the screen rivaling a T13rift run in Diablo3 (sorry). None of these can be reached with simply beating a map. You gonna need certain wizard levels, certain skill levels, certaon talisman set-ups and certain gem combinations in order to unlock them. Its the carrot which pushes you even further. I know I ll be there eventually myself but first I need to unlock all the required skills, farm more shadow cores, get more skill points etc etc in order to be prepared.You dont start a new map completely at zero. All the shadow cores, skill points, skills and talismans you aquire beforehand are at your disposal and stay with you in between maps making your wizard stronger the longer and more you play. I love this ""nurturing"" of a character of mine and seeing myself become stronger over timeAnother strong point for the game is that unlike other TD games you can use multiple strategies to beat a map. There are certain set-ups which allow you optimal results and these get fine-tuned all the time by hard-core players going after the elusive high-score (each map saves your highest score as a taunt for you to beat) but you have a lot more leeway to beat maps ""regulary"" giving you a lot of freedom and choice.UNKNOWN STUFFI stumbled across things like a ""compass"" which I can manipulate but dont have a clue whatto do with yet. Combining stuff also is obvious at first but there are detals to it thatwill be hidden to you until you start to experiment around. I havent seen half the maps yet but many hold extra challenges which force you to think about what you do and WHEN to do it.The game seems to evolve constantly and doesnt remain static. It fascinates me and hours keep going by at an alarming rate. I dont regret buying this game and recommend it 100%			"

												One of the best (if not the best) Tower Defense game ever. I don't have much else to say.well, thats a lie i have a lot to say about how much i like this series, since i have played all 4 installments.This installment is the best so far, content wise and everything else. (though the constant re-shuffling of gem color specials from each installment can get confusing).The fact that you don't get access to all the skills (and need certain wizard levels to improve) but need to find the skills first is my favorite change. And if you thought the game was easy theres also the ""iron wizard"" mode which makes this game a real test of skillI personally don't have any real issues with it (except with some of the ""vision fields"")Definitely a must have for those who love tower defense games			"

												Now that I've spend some more time with the game, it's time to write an extended review.Don't mistake this title for your standard tower defense game that is fun for a few hours and then you've seen every gameplay aspect. No, this game is quite on the contrary. The gameplay mechanics offer sheer endless possibilites.There are 9 distinct gems, each one having a different special. These gems can be put in towers (mostly damage), traps (mostly special effect), and amplifiers (buff adjacent towers or traps). You can also combine gems of different types and upgrade them. Instead of placing gems in towers or traps you can also throw them directly on the monsters for massive damage or buff the next minion, receiving even more mana and experience when killing them. You can call waves early, decide to save your mana for some seconds to gain increased mana regeneration, build walls to control the movement path of the monsters. There are different spells to cast and objects on the map to interact with.Am I done yet? No, I've hardly listed half of the gameplay elements. The rest is for you to discover in the game!Pro:- Gameplay mechanics- Replayability- Different play styles and tactics for levels- Customize the level difficulty in different ways- Hours and hours of fun (there is no real ending in this game, you can always level and improve some more)- Dark, moody atmosphere and story. I liked it a lot.Con:- Graphics are for the most part not HD, especially the land tiles may seem rather blurry / rough.- Complex game mechanics may be overwhelming for new players (but hey, is this really a con?)- Game slows down when a lot of action is going on, even on high end pcs. There are a lot of options to improve performance in the menu though, including a setting to automatically reduce graphic settings temporarily when the framerate drops.Conclusion:This game is a must-buy for all tower defense fans, and even if you're new to the genre or don't like it in general, you should give it a try. You won't regret it!			"

It's not a particularly difficult game to learn, but it does require strategy and it's entertaining. I can't tell you how many hours I've sunk into each the versions that they've released. It's one of my favourite ways to destress after work/school.			"

GemCraft is what every tower defense game should aim to be.PROS:- Depth- Skill System- Map Diversity- 20+ Hour Campaign- Replay Value- Community GuidesCONS:- Gem Combining- RepetitiveThe depth of GemCraft lies within its strong crafting system.  By the end of the game you are given nine seperate gem colors that all affect the battlefield in a diffferent way.  Along with this you are given traps, towers and amplifiers which all use the gems differently on the battlefield.  Combining the nine gem colors in different ways alters the way that the tower, trap or amplifier fight for you on the battlefield.The skill system is a great way to boost your performance on a level to level base.  The great twist is that you have to complete levels throughout the game to unlock these skills and then decide how you want to spend your points.  They can affect anything.  From directly boosting all gem damage to allowing your amplifiers to increase attack, you get to decide what the best lay out is for your play style.After the first few tilesets, the maps really branch out in interesting and unique ways.The campaign for this game lasts for quite some time.  You are offered several paths to go as you progress through the game, each allowing you to unlock more game features.  Even after you beat the game, there are three difficulties tied to each map.  On top of that you have the option of setting traits before each map starts to make the battle harder for you, but as a reward offering you more experience.  Additionaly once you beat the game, you can unlock iron wizard mode which is a fun challenge.One of the best features of this game is the community.  There are several great guides out, and after you have progressed through the game on your own I encourage you to look at the great work in the community tab to help you further your progress within the game.There are unfortunately a few negative things within GemCraft.  One of the biggest problems is not being able to save or macro gem combinations.  There are a couple external programs, that the truely devout use, but it would have been great for them to include a save mechanic in game for commonly crafted gems so you didn't always have to combine them by hand or use and external service.  DO NOT GET ME WRONG, this is in no way game breaking and does not affect someone who is just playing through the game the first time.  This is a grievance for end game play.Lastly, one of the biggest let downs with GemCraft becomes the repetitveness of the actual game.  Once you understand the key fundamentals at all difficulties it is more or less a rinse and repeat.Overall, GemCraft is in my opinion the pinnacle of what a tower defense game should be.  This game should be an instant buy when on sale.  And at full price is a great game for people who enjoy the tower defense genre.			"

												The GemCraft series changed my entire perspective on how a true Tower Defense game should be. Playing these games made Kingdom Rush and similar look so boring and dumb that I never even bothered with them.GemCraft plays differently than other TDs. It starts out painfully easy, but as the game goes on you unlock various ways to make the game harder for yourself, increasing both difficulty and rewards. Endurance mode is the epitome of all this; most ""infinite"" modes are just that, infinite. GemCraft's ends at 999, and it's no cakewalk.Here's generally how the game goes, from what I can tell:- Early-game: Playing maps on easy, playing with difficulty as you unlock it, gaining skills/power- Mid-game: Finishing up the remaining maps, going back to earlier maps and overloading them with difficulty modifiers to get lots of XP, completing challenge cheevos- Late-game: Endurance runs- Post-game: Trying to beat your high score on that max difficulty endurance runSince GemCraft ends up being quite a different experience, I recommend playing this and its earlier titles online first (but not the first one, it's not as good). You can find them on Armor Games or Kongregate.Also, Mac or Linux users: just because this game is Windows-only doesn't mean you can't play it! Just run Steam inside of Wine, install the game, and you should be good to go! (Disclaimer: Not all games work that well with Wine. This one just happens to be one of the good ones. Look up your game first to see if others have tested it!)			"

												This has become one of my favorite games, and I believe every tower defense fan has a good chance of really enjoying this game. Gemcraft - CS is based on the original Flash game (haven't played it at time of writing, but I should get around to it sooner or late). I've played a lot of Flash tower defense games, but Gemcraft is very unique, for many reasons:Gameplay & Mechanics: Is similar to other top-down TD games, in which your sole objective is to defend your base (in this case, your Orb) from hordes of enemies. You do this by placing gems into towers and traps. It's a simple premise, but the game incorporates so many elements that complicate matters. Every gem type has a different special effect, and many factors, such as the shape of the field, the gems you have available (you don't unlock all the gems for use on every map until later in the game), and the skills/abilities you have, just to name a few. You can also speed up time, which is very useful as things WILL get slow at times, or pause time entirely while you make decisions. This sounds broken, but I assure you, it isn't. You can even play in Iron Wizard mode, which disables most of the extra bonuses and makes the game more like a typical TD experience, with the difficulty being thrown at you head-on. Much of the game is the player investing more in their talisman bonuses and skill points to challenge more difficult maps and make more progress in endurance runs.Sound: Nothing too fancy, the music is ambient and fits the mood of the game, while the sounds do what they need to. Nothing I'd mind if they were muted, but not bad.Graphics: Same as the Sound department. Not bad at all, and the gems are pretty to look at, but nothing incredibly fancy. It looks exactly like a Flash game.Performance: The game runs very well overall, but there can be significant lag due to all the enemies and effects on the screen if you progress far enough in waves. A lot of people complain about this, but this is a very common, and often unavoidable problem in games. I have seen a couple of apparent fixes for this, but have yet to try them. However, it shouldn't be too hard to run this game decently.Replayability: When the store page tells you that this game has an emphasis on strategy and replayability, it is not lying to you. There are dozens of maps to play and as you level up and discover new strategies, you can replay stages you've beaten to gain more XP and go for rarer talisman fragments to further power up, and you decide how much harder to make your endurance runs. All this adds to many hours of replaying, which makes the game grindy, but to me it rarely feels like just a monotonous grind because I enjoy seeing how much stronger I've become since the last time I played a particular map, and regardless if it is a new map or not, it's fun to me. In addition, there are hundreds of achivements, and while some are freebies, the majority require at least a bit of skill to obtain. Your level can soar into the thousands and there is a lot of complicated math with the game's inner workings, for those who like solving that stuff (too intimidating for me). There is a lot to do in this game for dedicated TD fans, but more casual players may prefer a simpler experience.I love this game, and out of all the TD games I've played, this is one of the most unique I've played. If you're a longtime fan of the genre, you should give it a chance. You likely won't be disappointed.Pros:- Simple gameplay at its core- Many ways to customize your abilities and challenge level- Many, many maps and achievements, offering immense replayability for a TD game; the desire to keep earning things can become addictingCons:- The many facets of micro-managing various gameplay elements may turn off those looking for a simpler experience- This game is inherently grindy, especially with the randomization of talisman fragment drops and certain enemies that may or may not appear in a given run, so people who are bothered by grinding in games should probably stay away- Some people like an immediate challenge, but this game is only as hard as you make it, which some may not prefer			"

												Great game, packed with content. There are literally thousands of ways to play. There are 419 achievements, if you like that sort of thing -- and they provide skill points for upgrades so are valuable in-game. Of course, about half the achievements are easy enough (a bit like playing Candy Crush :-) but there are more intricate and fun ones to work out, and a few more hard-core (which are optional to complete the campaign). There is a whole hard-core culture of gem-weaving and insanely high XP levels, so it appeals to casual gamers and hard-core completists alike. There are hundreds of maps which look and play differently depending on which of at least 9 different gem-colours are available for your defenses. Definitely worth the money.			"

Shame on you.I wanted to add that this game even lets you decrease the range of your gems. The control you have over your towers/gems is incredible. Many target options, placement options.

												This is one of those games I find it hard to recommend to many people. However for a Tower Defense game, GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is pretty great.I won't be discussing the plot of the series, but I will say there are four games in the series so far. The first three being flash games: Chapter One: The Forgotten, Chapter Zero: The Gem of Eternity, Lost Chapter: Labyrinth, and finally Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows.The gameplay is very much of what you expect of a Tower Defense game. Place some towers, set up defenses, and don't let the monsters get to your base. However it isn't bright and colorful in this world. Everything is grim, dark, and depressing. After all, the world is much of a wasteland with those monsters around.Your main line of defense is gems. Yes, gems. These are your ""defense units"" of the game. There are a total of 9 colors of gems in the game, each with their unqiue own effects (note that Lime from Labyrinth is removed and White and Black are added).Besides being able to build towers, you are able to build walls, amplifiers (which are towers that power other towers..but they need a gem equipped to be used), and traps (which focus on effects more than damage)...I'd go on to cover the rest of the gameplay, but I'd run out of space by the time I do so. Plus there's an in-game tutorial feature that helps you learn over time about almost everything gameplay wise.The presentation as I said before is dark and depressing. However I did not mention how..enchanting the music is. It's hard to explain, but there's just something about the soundtrack that I really enjoy. While we're talking about presentation, the game obviously looks better than the first three games due to it not being limited as a flash game this time around. Heck, I can say it runs better as well.Overall, I do enjoy GemCraft - Chasing Shadows. Now there's one thing I lacked to mention. The game is very grind heavy. You'll end up grinding and backtracking to various levels to level up, just to be able to take on new levels, or possibly just to unlock something you missed before such as a Skill Tome or Battle Trait. There is also the overabundance of achievements, 419 to be specific. Most of which are simple, but eventually it will be difficult or possibly time wasting. There is also the ""Iron Wizard"" mode that can be unlocked. Meaning, you guessed it, this grind heavy game just got harder. Also there's a single achievement tied to it. ""Good luck.""If your a ""Completionist"" or happen to be a casual player, you're better off turning back now as this is a long game. A very long game. However if you're looking for something to spend your time on, and don't mind the repetitive grinding, I may as well recommend this game to ya. The full price of $9.99 isn't that bad, especially looking at how much playtime you get off of it.			"

												The game that essentially took the cake with the genre has finally come to Steam! So I will admit, I've been a major fan of Game In A Bottle's games for many years now, the first Gemcraft was probably the first one to really drag me in. The quality of the work put into this game and the pure strategic thinking required are incredible! This game is worth every cent they're asking for, and more. If you're not sure about it, give the flash version of the game a shot to see if you like it, but know that you're likely going to love what you see :)			"

												Excellent game, very well polished. The BEST tower defense game there is, no doubt. Think you've got the best gem, think again.It does suffer from what other endless defense games suffer from (bloons tower defense, I am looking at you), where your computer slows down to like 1 fps because there is so much processing going on.If you like Defense games, buy this.

												The definitive tower defense game. If you link grinding tower defense, this is an absolute must. It starts off slow and the snowballs as you unlock skills and skill points. It builds on GC: Labyrinth in a variety of positive ways which includes more unique map designs, set-piece levels, and even more focus on the story. It's not the deepest, doesn't have the best story, or the best graphics, but it is for sure a ton of fun.			"

												This is one of those games I find it hard to recommend to many people. However for a Tower Defense game, GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is pretty great.I won't be discussing the plot of the series, but I will say there are four games in the series so far. The first three being flash games: Chapter One: The Forgotten, Chapter Zero: The Gem of Eternity, Lost Chapter: Labyrinth, and finally Chapter 2: Chasing Shadows.The gameplay is very much of what you expect of a Tower Defense game. Place some towers, set up defenses, and don't let the monsters get to your base. However it isn't bright and colorful in this world. Everything is grim, dark, and depressing. After all, the world is much of a wasteland with those monsters around.Your main line of defense is gems. Yes, gems. These are your ""defense units"" of the game. There are a total of 9 colors of gems in the game, each with their unqiue own effects (note that Lime from Labyrinth is removed and White and Black are added).Besides being able to build towers, you are able to build walls, amplifiers (which are towers that power other towers..but they need a gem equipped to be used), and traps (which focus on effects more than damage)...I'd go on to cover the rest of the gameplay, but I'd run out of space by the time I do so. Plus there's an in-game tutorial feature that helps you learn over time about almost everything gameplay wise.The presentation as I said before is dark and depressing. However I did not mention how..enchanting the music is. It's hard to explain, but there's just something about the soundtrack that I really enjoy. While we're talking about presentation, the game obviously looks better than the first three games due to it not being limited as a flash game this time around. Heck, I can say it runs better as well.Overall, I do enjoy GemCraft - Chasing Shadows. Now there's one thing I lacked to mention. The game is very grind heavy.

												I'm writing this late review out of gratitude to the developer and because I believe this game deserves another positive review. This game is THE defining Tower Defense game. Every other I've played has come nowhere to the enjoyment I felt playing this. You want replayability? The game essentially never ends. You can beat the final map but you can always do better, or unlock new maps. Or replay older maps to beat it at a higher difficulty to level up.You want customisation? This game has it. Lots of it. Play the game how YOU want, how YOU would enjoy it. Sure, at high level there are common strategies used by most but the game lets you choose alternative ways if you care more about having fun than constantly beating your past exp score.And speaking of fun, yes, this game has all of it. My one criticism is - believe it or not - that this game is TOO good. I worry that the sequel (and there WILL be a sequel to this amazing game) won't have anywhere near the amount to expand and improve upon that this one did. But I should really have more faith in the developer than that, as they have proved how much of a good game they can already make.			"

												This is a tower defence game where you customize the tower by the gems you create. The gems can have their power increased from leveling them, and gems of different types can be mixed together (if they are the same level it will increase the level as well). The main difference I noticed about this game is that you can use the gems you craft to ""enrage"" upcoming waves to increase the number of enemies that come in it and increase the toughness of each unit in the wave. For the higher difficulties you need to balance the amount of gems you enrage upcoming waves with, and the amount of mana you spent to upgrade the gems to help kill the incoming enemies. The game allows you even more customization by giving you skill points that can be used to provide a global buff to your gems, or otherwise help you to defend yourself. There's a just a lot of depth, and its an enjoyable experience to play. Well worth the price point :).			"

												A classic gem who's first Flash installment I still have on my laptop.An addictive and extensive tower defense game set in a fantasy world, wherein you are a gem crafter; A mage that uses magical gems to cast spells. Gems that can be upgraded and combined to form more powerfull versions, which can then be used to arm empty towers, road traps or thrown as bombs.An extensive story line, great graphics and musical score, and tremendous flexibility in how you proceed through the world and each scene.A huge amount of achievements and the addition of talismen and special towers have extended this into an even more flexible and enjoyable series.My only hope is to see more of these fantastic Flash games grow out of their original platform base.

												It may not look like much on the surface, but this game is a diamond in the rough...GET IT?!?!! HAR HAR*ahem* Anyway, this is a ridiculously good tower defense. I thought Defense Grid was good, but this pretty much blows it away. I can't really put my finger on any one thing that makes it so good; it's just fun. There are a lot of decisions to be made not just in your defense build, but also in between missions with skills, talisman slots, traits, etc. Plenty of content and depth here. I also really like that you can seamlessly transition from any mission into the endless mode. If you're having fun with your build on a particular map or the layout of the map itself, you can continue playing on it in endless and just see how much XP you can rack up. About the only thing I would wish for is that the different gem types had more distinctive visual effects, instead of just different colors of the little bolts, but that's a pretty minor gripe. Bottom line, if you enjoy tower defense, you really can't beat this game, especially for the price.			"

Endurance mode really is endurance, some games can take up to 30-40 hours to complete due to the insane amount of lag that happens with all the monsters on screen. The real downer for the game, written in Flash. Hoping the next chapter isn't in Flash and plays a bit better.I recommend this game if you enjoy Tower Defenses and a bit of a story. Don't play the hardcore end game if you don't enjoy spending hours and hours of low frame rate and lag to boost your level. "

												Hi there!Do you like Tower Defense Games? Well, then you are at the right spot! GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is one of the most brilliant TDG!The story never fails to amaze me even though i have already played it as browser version.I am still frightened when the shadows shoo over the map whispering creepy noises. And yes you will get startled at some point. The storyline is narrated by book pages you find on your adventure telling you what is happening. Also an overview about the former series of Gemcraft is given by summing the whole plot up. As a beginner one gets used to the mechanics really fast. During the first levels many hints are given bit by bit so you dont get overwhelmed by the information. Anyway the lategame is still challenging due to the ""Endurance Mode"" which causes monster to spawn endlessly giving you a hard time but also lots of XP!Each wizard level grants several skill points which can be distributed into many different skills improving for example your  gem damage or reducing the charge time of your spells.Moreover during the stages talisman fragments are dropped which award even more bonus stats! Gemcraft has a distinctive achievment system with up to 419 achievments! They can also grant up to 3skill points giving you another goal to achieve!The stages are beautiful and challenging designed. On every map you have to think of a strategy before starting the first wave. Will you use traps or towers? Maybe both? Is there a way to stretch the monsters way by building mazes? Which one the 9 different gems will you use? If you get stuck just replay some stages at higher difficulty to get even bettter rewards! Overall i highly recommend GemCraft - Chasing Shadows! It sums up an amazing story, difficult stages and awesome mechanics! Greetings, Tevias			"

 57 billion flavours of potato	Let's start by saying that you get a lot of content for little money with GemCraft.It's a classic Tower Defense game, gameplay mechanics are very standard. Monsters go for your orb and you have to murder them before they reach it. The game is like the title says, based on gems, you can place gems in towers where they'll shoot enemies, or in traps where they'll damage those who walk on them. You can also use them as bombs, use them to boost your tower, to protect your orb, you can sacrifice them to shrines or you can expend them to make your enemies stronger. In fact, you can do pretty much anything with your gems. Customization options are near infinite. There are 9 base colors, each of them have a different side effect, you can upgrade, combine, destroy, level up your gems in any possible combination.You can build your own structures, towers, traps, mazes, depending on the geography of the level.There are a lot and a lot and a lot of levels. Enough to say you won't see the end of the game for a very long time.You can customize your level of difficulty to the ultimate detail. There are 3 base levels to choose from, but after that you can add some random combination of traits, add a wave of this or a wave of that, boost the enemy armor or their speed etc... You can call down multiple waves at the same time during levels, Sacrifice gems to add more enemies and other weird stuff.For adding difficulty you get more XP and drops as a reward. Those drops can be used to customize your Talisman, giving you a variety of skil bonuses. The XP you also use to customize your skills and boost certain gems or certain abilities.I'm not sure I have listed all the possibilities of customization for this game, in fact I'm not sure I have discovered them all. Choose your own adventure, kinda.	The game isn't particularly hard, especially since you can pretty much pick your own difficulty, so if you wish you can also make it hard for yourself at your very leasure. It does take a lot of hours to reach the end and then you can replay everything to oblivion.  And there are also side challenges, where you can't pick the difficulty. Those range from easy-ish to beyond impossible. Honestly I have no idea how some of these challenge are even possible to be completed. I just fail horribly 10 times then I move on. Thankfully they're all optional. Millions of achievements.	And then there are achievements. So many of them. Hundreds! Millions! Probably a quarter of all my Steam achievements come from this game. They aren't hard to get, they just take a little grinding and sometimes an interesting challenge, so they're a nice +. If you want to boost your number of steam achievments then this is the game for you.So all in all, there are just so many things to do with this game... but yet in terms of content it doesn't change that much. The levels get a bit same-ish. The waves keep coming and coming and coming and coming and coming. Like a Potato.	You can do so many things with this game, just like with potato. You can dice it, boil it, bake it, fry it. Turn it into crisps, croquettes and salad. You can have it with Ketchup, mayo, hot sauce and combine all of the above until you realize in the end, it's still just the same old Potato and not much more.But then, it's cheap and you can probably live off it for a very long time.

												I'm a Tower Defense fan and I'm really glad I picked up Gemcraft. Sure, some of its graphics aren't HD and look a little bit shoddy, but I don't mind at all as the actual mechanics are excellent. The use of traps, various spells, gem bombs, gem specialization and the different ways you can approach a certain map/level (e.g. by the use of traits) make the game so much more than just regular ol' Tower Defense where you build a maze for monsters to walk through and occasionally cast a fireball or something.While you are expected to replay maps in order to level up, I don't feel like it's too ""grindy"" because different difficulty levels and traits keep each map playthrough interesting and fresh.My minor annoyances with the game are interface/accessibility based (i.e. no ability to rebind hotkeys).I'm almost at 40 hours and I don't even think I'm half-way through the game yet. I can't stress enough how cost-efficient Gemcraft is for $10. Overall, I'm just super happy with my purchase. I would recommend Gemcraft to any Strategy fan who doesn't mind pixelated graphics, even if they're new to Tower Defense games. Although the game is complex, I don't believe that it's too complex for those new to Tower Defense (the tutorial book inside the game is excellent).There's a free web-based version of Gemcraft also available on http://www.armorgames.com. To view the differences between the Steam version and the free web-based version, read this: 	


Announcement: GemCraft Steam launch update 
GemCraft - Chasing Shadows, May 5, 2015

			Hey Everyone, Just wanted to give a quick summary of what’s happened since the Steam release, and a bit about the future of GemCraft – Chasing Shadows.		


On a final note, you might have heard of Kingdom Rush and/or Plants Vs. Zombies, two other popular tower defense games also on Steam. Both games are high-quality and extremely polished in the sound and audio department, but I personally think Gemcraft's actual gameplay is far more robust, challenging, and engaging.			"

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: Top-down Tower Defence The Good:+ Over 190 level, with 3 different difficultly levels and 9 battle traits with multiple levels giving you multiple ways of customizing the difficulty. The higher the difficulty and more battle traits you have active the higher the experience obtained.  + Endurance mode + Combining different gems together to get different results and create any type of tower effect you like. +  Special levels with pre-set gems and no skills active for added difficulty + Completing levels grants you experience and skills. + Collect talismans granting you percentage bonuses to a variety of different stats + With over 400 achievements, the game has an achievement encyclopedia to help you easily find achievements you have and currently missing.  Achievements also grant skill points. Conclusion: Tower defense is one of my favorite genres and I’ve played many of them on Steam and this game is easily one of the best. The game has so many options to customize the difficulty with plenty of levels providing many hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommended if you are a fan of the genre.			"

												Recommended for people who really like tower defense games. If you ""kind of"" like tower defense, you should probably just play the flash version, and you'll get bored before you hit the point where you would need to pay. If the prospect of >100 slightly varying tower defense maps appeals to you, and more so when I tell you you can go past 100 waves of monsters on each, and then more when I tell you about all the difficulty dials you can fine tune, then this is a good tower defense game to spend 100+ hours on.I particularly recommend GemCraft for the highly customizable difficulty. Over the course of the game, you unlock nine different difficulty dials, like ""more and stronger giants"" or ""send mana every minute instead of as I accummulate it"", and three difficulty settings; plus you can increase the difficulty of a wave by calling it sooner or ""enraging"" it by dropping gems on it, spending your mana to make the waves tougher and increasing the number of monsters; plus achievements for level-specific handicaps like ""only use slowing gems""; plus an ""Iron Wizard"" mode that takes away your ability to out-level the difficulty curve. Just beating the levels is not all that difficult, apart from scattered puzzle levels. GemCraft excels in letting you make the game as hard as you want it to be, and it rewards you for pushing yourself to the bleeding edge of how difficult you can make it. And with those rewards, you can play the level again, with difficulty turned up just a little higher... (Avoid grinding: your xp is your highest score for the level, so there is no gain for repeating a level without turning up the difficulty.)Read extended comments at killtenrats.com, search for GemCraft posts.

												In my eyes easly the best Tower defense game on steam.You may know this series from free flash games on Kongregate or similar websites,so whats diffrent here thats worth your money you ask ?-Many, many levels-great strategic deapth, as upgrade points that are not spent add mana to your mana pool wich forces you to find a balance between keeping enough mana and getting the upgrades you want-upgrades cann be resettet without costs. This encourages to test diffrent strategies.-very nice dark overall Style.-an amazing risk/reward system that gives the player control over the difficuly of the levels,by choosing diffrent handicaps. Every Handycap increases the amount of experience the playergains for completing the level.-good Music-many Archievments that give bonus ""shadoworbs""(upgradepoints)-you can switch between normal X2 and X3 at every time, so you dont have to watch slow enemys as they dragtheir lazy body towards your tower, and you can pause whenever you want.So if you liked the Flashgames but wantet some more depth here you go Gem Craft- Chasing Shadowsis the game for you.This gem is truly worth its cash.

												I was really torn wheter i should give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down. To review this game you basically have to think of it as two seperate games. There is the early game where you're just trying to beat all the levels, hunt some achievements and experiment with different ideas and strategies without really knowing what you're doing.This part is fun, well done and i'd totally recommend it.And then there is the late-game where have to do crazy long endurance runs (i've seen people going for over 24hours) that follow a very strict strategy and it basically becomes an endless grind for XP. This part ""could"" be fun (if you're into that kind of thing) but unfortunately the game can't handle the crazy amounts of monsters and the huge numbers it has to deal with later on. It's boring enough to sit there for hours doing nothing but enraging all the waves to max and upgrading your gems. But the horrible lags make it excruciating.So is it good or bad? If you're looking for a good tower defense game, that can capture your attention for a few days.. buy it. Totally worth it.If you're a completionist that wants to push his gems and wizard levels to the max.. don't buy it. The game will break your soul trying to do that.			"

												This is as close as any Tower Defense game has come to being a digital form of crack in a long time. The dude that makes these just super ""gets"" TD gameplay, and the result is a stunningly subtle game with just, really impressive depth when you get into it. It unfolds like an origami tessaract.Most game developers will not achieve in tens of gigabytes what this developer has done in a very small game package. The gameplay is addictive, intuitive, frustrating, rewarding... Good pace to everything. Very, very, very well tuned.The reason that the game reviews are listed as ""overwhelmingly positive"" is because this is an incredibly good game, one of the most fun TDs I've ever played and really crafty as you get into it further. Buy it when it's on sale and enjoy a crazy deal on some good Gemcraft fun.			"

												I don't usually go for games with 'cheap' graphics, and it did take me a few hours to get into this one.But once you get going... there's just a ton of tiny features, tons of incremental growth to keep you moving.  So much variation in how you can approach each map, that it's almost infinite.  There's a good balance of winning/losing for me - sometimes it kicks my butt and I have to re-think a level, or know that I have to come back later with more tricks.Lots of fun for a really quick game or a marathon.

												It's a great tower defense that will keep you playing for many hours. However, after 25-30 hours the game loses nearly all of its depth as certain gem combinations (which are available for all levels from a certain point onwards) are way too powerful. In the end only a few real challenges remain while the rest of the game drowns in meaningless repetition.			"

It's pretty easy to get into, but there is a complexity to the gem combination system to satisfy any theroy crafter out there. The game is great too in luring you into a false sense of security, then throwing something unusual at you that just crushes you. Not in an unfair way though, with some re-thinking to your approach to the level you can get past it and usually learn something in the process. The game is quite vast too in size with far more levels than I've typical seen in the genre.			"

												Very polished game. 191 different, unique maps. Great sound design, gives a feeling of oppression. You get stronger by clearing areas, and you can get more by re-visiting them and getting a better score. You are in control of the difficulty and there are various ways to adjust that, before and during the fight. This means you cannot get stuck, as eventually you'll be able to win by pure brute force. And once you start doing survival mode farming techniques, you discover that there is no level cap.Then there's the huge list of achievements. Awesome. And they're also tracked ingame separately for each individual save, which boosts replayability. Also, Iron Wizard mode for a simplified but much more challenging playthrough.Try the previous chapters too if you liked this and want more. They're flash games playable for free in the browser. They have somewhat different rules and much less polish, but the feel is the same.			"

GemCraft is a unique tower defense game, where, instead of towers, gems are the main weapon to fight endless hordes of monsters. Place your gems in towers, traps, or amplifiers, replace and switch them as you wish. Even combine them to create more powerful gems with powerful abilities, drop them as gem bombs or activate powerful buildings, the possibilities are endless, the choice is yours! Fight your way through an epic story, unfolding mysteries and facing sinister enemies and artifacts, as you try to entrap the Forgotten, an archdemon with an unknown agenda and no known way to kill, and to slay her demonic avatars, the shadows. Fierce and desperate battles await you... - Highly Recommended!			"

												Think you like Tower Defense games, if you haven't played a Gemcraft game yet, then you need to quit lying to yourself...  Gemcraft is the only TD game.  Think you have a hardcore machine, try an endurance run on Gemcraft, then tell me you have a hardcore machine...  Think that you are an elite player, call me when you complete all the vision fields, if you can...  No really, call me, i still can't eat those vision fields...			"

												Amazing tower defense that pleases casual players and has alot of depth. You can customize in which way the maps will be harder before going into it, but you can also make it harder on the fly, by enraging waves or calling waves early. Being able to move gems to different places (towers, traps...) adds a new dimension to the strategy,All things considered, probably the best tower defense I've played.			"

												what some people forget to mention, this game series has been around since the early days of the free online flash games. ide also like to mention the all the games are free on armor games to play, however this is the only way to play them offline on any pc :3gemcraft - chapter 1 the forgottengemcraft - chapter 0 gem of eternitygemcraft - the lost chapter labyrinthand now chasing shadows.though i have never beaten one of these games, they are all amazing, this one being a payed game, it does have the quality of a payed game compared to the previous two (though content size wise they are all pretty big)for he who does not like spoilers please skip to the next because this is where a detailed analysis of the previous games in the series begins.now these games have a plot almost as crazy as the FNAF timeline, meaning prequels, sequels, prequelsequels etc. so im going to try and explain the games in order, then put them together in a timeline sense.the first game (a f2p flash) is pretty simple, gemcraft chapter one, the forgotten. you (a young wizard) discover that another wizard to the east has unleashed monsters for unknown reasons, sounds simple right? wrong. across 48 levels you will battle your way to the end of the game only to discover that this wizard found something called ""the forgotten"", and it has possesed him, as you have clearly beaten all of this wizards challenges, it decides to kill him and take you as its host. you are then told that it is going to take you to the east ""to unleash more havoc on the spirit forge"".in game two, a prequel sequel (chapter 0). where you play as another seemingly random wizard, only you are in fact the bad wizard from the FIRST game. the story follows bad wizard as he tries to find the ""gem of eternity"", a gem with mysterious power. he looks for it everywhere, the wizard council tries to stop him. one day his compass points north twards the gem of eternity, as he travels north, fighting ""arcane guardians"" and eventually finds the gem of eternity. as he unlocks it he unwittingly unleashes ""the forgotten"" from the first game, he becomes the bad wizard from gemcraft chapter 1.in game three, a sequel, but not entirely a prequel, this game takes place at the same time as the first game in a timeline sense (lost chapter). the story follows (once again) a young wizard, who has one final quest, though it only appeared on his map AFTER the village he was guarding was attacked. the map lead him to a labyrinth. once in the center of it, the wizard used four crafting pylons to create a new gem of eternity. he then travels to the spirit forge to put the gem where it belongs.which finally brings us to game four aka chapter 2. (which i highly reccomend you play the game to learn about, im spoiling this for myself unfortunately because im a gametheory gamefreak like matpat I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING) gemcraft chapter 2 (game 4) follows the first wizard you played in the first game (meaning the 2nd and 3rd games were really just exposition at this point). on your way to the spirit forge, as previously mentioned at the end of chapter 1, however on your way you pass through an old trap ""the sycthe gate"" which separates you from the forgotten. after regaining conciousness you find yourself at your old wizard tower where you build a new trap to attempt to seal the forgotten before she reaches the spiritforge.along the way you find new structures and enemies which i believe were not in the previous games. as you continue twards the spiritforge, your character does the unthinkable in the games, actually thinks about the games own plot. who is the forgotten (ponders the ""summoning of"") as well as if the summoning was ""really an accident"". you also ponder about what the forgotten is actually doing as well as why. eventually you find the gembearer, the wizard from game 3 chapter 0 (boy this is confusing isent it?) dead, you also find the gem of eternity that he crafted next to him. you take the gem and decide to take it to the spirit forge for him while using its amazing powers to kill hordes of monsters attacking the spiritforge, which is when we finally get into some detailed information. the gem of eternity, after absorbing the essence of the monsters, begins glowing with a blinding light. the gem replica (assuming the replica is the one made by the gembearer and the origional is still there) begins transferring its energy to the OG gem. it then fires a powerful burst of magic at the spiritforge shield, destroying it.it is then revealed that the gem replica you found next to the gembearer, was corrupted. in all the previous instances where the forgotten was sealed, she would slowly corrupt the gem, twisting its power to her own needs and binding all the fake gems to one another (apparently the OG gem at the spirit forge AND the one you are using are both corrupt replica's, read on young one). so when you used the fake you used the corrupt power of all the gems and destroyed the shield of the spirit forge. the forgotten even let the player live after their initial separation at the scythe gate for this purpose.in the end you were a pawn to the forgotten in order to break into the one place she could not enter nor corrupt. she probably never meant to let you live and the game alludes to a sequel in which you enter the spirit forge after finding the REAL real gem (apparently the OG gem at the entrance to the spirit forge was ALSO a replica/fake gem which is why it mentions that she binded all the fake gems to one another)very clearly these games are extremely detailed for free flash games (even more so after becoming pay games) for those who were smart enough to not read the blotted out there is most likely another game coming in the series and i am now giddy with anticipation to find out what lies in store for it.

												If you're new to Gem Craft, google it, and play browser based. After a few levels you'll see why it is so well loved, (if you're one to like TD games) and you'll likely think to yourself: ""Man, wouldn't this be great fullscreen?""Yes, of course it's better, and more content overal too! Though, It should be noted that holding the shift key, while building and moving gems, will slow your game no mater the circumstance (no enemys/good hardware). To remedy this: simply pause the game as it is a single player experence; there is no need to rush. I have encountered few problems otherwise. The game is finished with the expected, but well executed pixelish graphical style of its type. This TD will give you a great varriety of strategic choice both durring the levels, and throughout the meta-game/overworld. It is the one game in the sea of thousands that I would comfortably recomend buying off-sale. It is truely worth the ~$10, and would give the creative genius behind the series what they deserve for such a well thought-through, risk/reward strategy title. It really does feel like the game has been fully fleshed out. It is far from what a browser flash game is normally.Now, I know I haven't told you many specifics about Gem Craft, but this is because you can easily experience the mechanics with the browser version yourself. And if you are too lazy for that, there are many, many more reviews that actually break the game down properly for what it is.This is my first review, and will likely be my only one for a while. I don't write negative reviews. I don't write positive reviews. I only wrote this after seeing the recent sale, and I was reminded of the near perfection this gem has been polished to.-Thanks Game in a Bottle!			"

												9/10 Great tower and gem upgrading game.Pros:-Very in depth and elaborate upgrading, gem combining, skills, and bonus systems.-Map is expansive and progressive as well as repeatable, and more difficulties more unlock bonuses-Every game feels unique, play at your pace. Make it harder to get more bonuses. Go endless mode with no consequence.Play how YOU want. It isn't too linear. If you like a map, keep playing it the waves are random and can be increased.Different effects you add make each level every time you play it different.Cons:-I just feel like this game is too big at times. Like when will it end and whats my end goal? Maybe I will find it later.-With this unique system in place it is extremy easy to jump 20-30 levels at a time. Very OP and needs to be tweaked so the XP isn't THAT rewarding. Now I feel like I'm just chasing the limits as hard as I can. I have become my own enemy, not really the level themselves. Perhaps this is too hardcore for me?Other thoughts:-At first I was like this game is ugly. Cause I had it full screen which it isn't meant for and I was a little disappointed about that. But then I started playing it in windowed and realized WHO THE HELL PLAYS FULL SCREEN? Alt tabbing or watching a movie in the background is perfect for long puzzle matches with endless mode. So it was okay.			"

												Great game, but it's still a flash game.The author took all that time, and for what? It's still a flash game. The re-designing may have taken up a lot of that, but for how many months that took I was expecting something with a new engine. Oh well, maybe next release. It's still fun and it's been improved to the point where the browser flash game version is worthless, but this still performs like the old one :(To the developer: This series has potential, but it could really use a jump away from the dying Flash platform to its own engine. Now that it's made the jump from the browser to the OS, it's time to look for some engine options and begin building the next Gemcraft hit. I will buy it just as I bought this one, even if the worthless and embarrassing supression gems remain part of the game.			"

												The Gemcraft series are something very close to my heart. It's not just a game to play. It's an art to look at in awe. A masterpiece to learn from. The embodiment of perfectionism when it comes to game design. That is Gemcraft. Never has any game captivated me so much, whilst being just a flash game with no budget and a single developer. Everyone should give the game a go. Just because the tower defense genre is saturated and full of horrible clones, doesn't mean that a few gems aren't present in it. Gemcraft is a game of planning, calculating, trial-error and design. Any player can learn a great deal from playing it about both game design and tower defense in all it's glory. Give the game a try, you won't regret it :)			"

												Gemcraft - Chasing Shadows is easily the best online flash game I've ever played, with me investing 100+ hours into it.In this game, towers can't do anything on their own; to be able to attack, a gem needs to be placed inside of it. There are nine basic gem types, each with its own unique effect. By combining two gems of the same tier, you will create a single stronger gem of the next tier. The different gem types can be combined, which will result in a gem with higher stats, but with less of each types' bonus effects.This already is a significant innovation, but the game has plenty more new ideas up its sleeve: the combination of the traditional health and gold resources into a single mana resource, 25 skills to level up, special boss enemies, traps, collectible talisman fragments, three strike spells and three gem enhancement spells, and plenty more.This is an easy recommendation to anyone who is a fan of tower defense games or strategy games.

												This is a fantastic tower defense game and I recomend it to anyone who wants to play one. As a tower defense game it suffers from many of the same issues that all tower defense games suffer from, so make sure you are ready for a bit of grinding, because all there is to do is kill enemies over and over again. But who cares, this game makes it so fun to do so that you don't even realize that you spent 1/2 the night killing frozen swarmlings near a tome building to get the next skill and now have to dose yourself with massive quantities of caffine just to function during the day.If you like tower defense games get this one now. If you don't know if you like tower defense games, this is a great one to start with. If you hate tower defense games why are you reading reviews for this game at all?			"

												Gemcraft: Labyrinth was the best tower defense game I've ever played... Until this game! I'm going to get hundreds of hours out of my $10, so there's great value there. One nice thing that really adds to replayability is the battle traits feature. You assign them to add difficulty, which adds to the XP modifier. Its alot of fun, adding traits until you're BARELY able to beat the level, then leveling up 5 times! (or failing on the last wave and knowing its ALL your fault!)Yeah, buy this game!			"

												I've lost countless hours to the browser version, and will likely repeat now that it's on steam.  Played the original and the prequel extensively as well.If you love tower defense games, this one is a no-brainer.  It's one of the most, if not THE most expansive TD game I've ever played.  It also features tons of options.  You can skip several stages, pushing for the end.  You can do them all repetitively, always trying to squeeze a bit more XP out.  You can use that XP to buff your abilities, or leave it be in order to buff your starting resources.Use random drops to once again buff your abilities,  Farm for better drops, or ignore that entirely and push on.  Use your XP to create custom builds that suit your play style.  Like traps?  Invest in trap buffs.  Towers?  Get tower buffs.  Like the effects of a specific gem?  Spend XP on that gem type, and it is now available in every map. Like a challenge?  Unlockable modes allow you to buff enemies or handicap yourself.  Finishing stages with these conditions can significantly boost your XP gain.  But, as said before, you can completely ignore those modifiers and simply play the stages.  Casual to hardcore, Gemcraft has broad appeal.  You can burn through most stages in a few minutes, or aim for endurance mode and spend an hour or more trying to amass a ridiculous XP score.  Once again, if you like tower defense games at all, give this one a look.			"

												I first fell in love with GemCraft when I discovered GemCraft0 and spent hours, and hours, and hours on it. This is my favorites, and the best tower defense game ever. It may not look like much - but it is so much. It's a story, its leveling, its strategy, creating, planning, grinding, and challenging. Hearing the monsters pop as you smite them with blasts of magic is a great feeling. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it whatsoever. If you love a challenge, killing things, crafting things, and strategizing - this is your game.			"

												When I first had the genre of 'Tower Defence' explained to me, many moons ago, I was dubious. How can a game, with such a simple objective, be anything but a five minute filler? Well, I started with Chapter 1... Who knows how long ago that was now! As soon as I heard that Gemcraft was coming to Steam, I was on cloud nine. Finally! A way to accurately track all those achievements, full screen, and a chance to see just how many hours you can dump into the  week long endurance battles. I honestly can't recommend this game enough! To newbies to Tower Defence, why filter through the mediocre when the best is waiting right here! To the veterans, this developer has certainly earned their salt and deserves this, why not show your support?I really should be walking the dog.... just 5 more waves ;)			"

												I bought this with almost no reviews posted (and those positive) almost as just a thank you to the original Gemcraft. Those guys deserve a few bucks just based on the first Gemcraft.  So after spending 8.99 on this, and putting in 15 hours, I dont feel I've touched the depth of this game. I mean its tower defense over and over but the mechanics, gameplay, and speccing will keep it very fresh for a while.  Great buy.			"

												I adored all the flash games, figuring it couldn't get any better. And then this comes out and blows them the ♥♥♥♥ away. The difficulty is steep but fair, and all gems serve a unique purpose in their own right, and since each stage demands a different set, you have to learn how to use them all.I do have 2 complaints though, and they're so minor that they're practically nonexistant.1. Whenever you close the game, your Battle Traits are all set to 0. It's not a massive problem by any means, but I tend to forget to set them, or forget how high I set them.2. There's no quick way to switch out your Talismans, or your skills for that matter. I'd like for there to be an option to have different sets, so you can mix and match depending on the stage, without having to use a minute or two on switching Talismans and skills around.			"

												Gemcraft is one of the few gems (pun intended) that everyone should own. It was great on Armor Games, it is great here. I'd pay 60 dollars for this game because it is easily capable of stealing 500+ hours of your life and you will still enjoy playing and mastering it. I have invested months into this on Armor Games and I look forward to doing that on here as well. Many games released these days come with a 60 dollar price tag, 20 hours later it is an after thought. Do yourself a favor and if you enjoy tower defense games, buy this right now. Gemcraft is so easy to play, it has insane depth at the same time, and just constantly draws you back with its addictive gameplay and replayability.			"

												I've played the GemCraft series of games since the very first one released as a flash game on Armor Games, and I've been hooked on it ever since. The Tower-Defense genre is very well defined, it's been fleshed out too many times to count. Yet this game, and the series as a whole, GemCraft, has innovated it beyond what I think anybody would believe possible. The game is challenging, it takes a lot of actual tactics and thought. It's fun, a seemingly endless amount of content in-game for you to play through and the replayability is high with the difficulty modifiers. The skills in game really make a difference during play-time, and the overall length of the game is stunning for a tower defense game. Not to mention, it actually has a storyline to go with it.And to think, it was a flash game for the longest time.I've been waiting forever for it to come out of Steam Greenlight, and now that it has, I'd recommend it to anybody looking for something new and fun to pass time with.

												GemCraft is the quintessential tower defence series.  Don't be fooled by the Chapter Two in the the game's pictures, this is actually the fourth game in the series.  Unlike most other games, every single GemCraft game added a bunch of new innovations to the formula (including this one with Gem Enchantments, the amulet equip system, and bound-type gems).  What this means is that this game has more polish and value than most $60 titles released today.There are very few games on Steam that I can recommend higher than this.			"

												There is Hope for this Genre yet.GemCraft is an amazing game. It nearly went to my top 1 of TD games, but now sits on a very close 2nd place, with a huuuge buffer until the 3rd. So what does make this game so amazing?Well, i´m always glad to see when a developer knows what he´s doing. And that is most defenitly the case with this game: The mechanics work great, there is a decent monster/tower variety and the levels are very well balanced.It´s not that expensive, and what you get are serious hours of playtime and content. The most upvoted reviews for this game have a playtime of 150+ hours for a reason.Take all the above and throw in some decent RPG mechanics and you have a game that deserves your attention.All that with the sheer variety of levels makes it one of the best TDs there are and easily recommendable...

												Out of all Tower Defense games GemCraft particularly stands out for its unqiue mechanic of combining gems of different kind. That defines the depth and all possible interactions making it a truly amazing experience. Abundance of skills and talisman fragments system help create a fresh feel for every playthrough. All that is what makes the game fun for both casual and hardcore players as there's always something else to discover while trying to push the limits of the game.Steam version has a new play-mode called ""Iron Wizard"" which is like another game in itself and it's worth trying out if you are looking for new challenges.

												Every once in a while I look for Warcraft 3 tower defense map packs, hoping there will be something new. I've tried numerous tower defence games and this is by far the best. It scratches the tower defence itch like no other. $11 CDN is most certainly a fair price for this game. One reviewer says they purchsaed the game for $2.50 during one of the big sales, this absolutely blows my mind. If the graphics and UI were less 'Flash-gamey' this could easily be a $60 tower defence game. With the graphics it has now, I'd say its a $55 tower defence game ;)[EDIT]I almost forgot that people might actually be interested in what make sthis game so good aside from some weird price speculation haha.You can control the range of a tower by hovering over it and using the mouse wheel. As far as I can tell there are 9 gems that do different types of damage/have different modifiers.You can buff the level itself makingit more difficult and granting you more xp when you defeat it.After beating each level, you can choose to continue it on ""Endurance Mode"". You have a talisman that you can put fragments in that give you bonuses against certain monster types. Fragments are randomly found when killing monsters.There is a skill window where you can put skill points into various skills. (Note that the more unspent skill points you have, the more starting mana you begin each level with!)Look, just buy this game. If you've actually read this far, you are either bored you will like this game. Either way, you should get it :)			"

												This has to be the... best tower defence game I've played.. ever.The amount of options you have when it comes to upgrading skills, the way you can combine gems(gems are you towers, for anyone who hadn't figured that out), the talisman system and the way of how you unlock levels is awesome.And hey, achievement collectors, get ready to collect 419 achievements.In my personal opinion this game is completely fleshed out, the gameplay experience is great, no flaws, as far as I am concerned, after 15 hours of gameplay.Risk, reward.This games risk-reward system is amazing, you can bomb levels that are about to come with gems to enrage the level, increasing the HP, amount of monsters and amount of armour they have, but you gain mana(Mana is your 'money' in this game)+XP for it, do you want to bomb 2 levels for some mana+xp and risk loosing or do you want to keep it safe? You can even build strategies on some levels around this.The game also has traits, traits are some things you can bump up for each level, for example you can make all the monsters have more armour(scales from 1 to 7), you can make it so you only receive your mana earned every 10 seconds while playing, making levels come faster, up to 50% faster, in return for a large XP bonus multiplier, the game also has 3 different difficulties(difficulties are tied to each level, the entire game is not hard if you set it to hard, you set each levels difficulty).This game handles the risk-reward system very good, it's absolutely brilliant, I was very impressed by that.The actual gameplay is well paced(yes, the game has fast forward options), it keeps you entertained and it's very fun and oh man, it is very addicting.The game has a story but it's not really that entertaining, every now and then you unlock 1 or more pages of lore/story/whatever you want to call it, each page is about 30 words long, in my experience all they do is add to the dark and grim atmosphere of the game, I'm not invested in an actual story like I am when I'm playing Walking Dead(an extreme example but you get the point).9/10, amazing game, an absolute must buy if you're into tower defence games, I strongly recommend it if you want to dip your feet in a tower defence game for the first time as well.

												what some people forget to mention, this game series has been around since the early days of the free online flash games. ide also like to mention the all the games are free on armor games to play, however this is the only way to play them offline on any pc :3gemcraft - chapter 1 the forgottengemcraft - chapter 0 gem of eternitygemcraft - the lost chapter labyrinthand now chasing shadows.though i have never beaten one of these games, they are all amazing, this one being a payed game, it does have the quality of a payed game compared to the previous two (though content size wise they are all pretty big)for he who does not like spoilers please skip to the next because this is where a detailed analysis of the previous games in the series begins.now these games have a plot almost as crazy as the FNAF timeline, meaning prequels, sequels, prequelsequels etc. so im going to try and explain the games in order, then put them together in a timeline sense.the first game (a f2p flash) is pretty simple, gemcraft chapter one, the forgotten. you (a young wizard) discover that another wizard to the east has unleashed monsters for unknown reasons, sounds simple right? wrong. across 48 levels you will battle your way to the end of the game only to discover that this wizard found something called ""the forgotten"", and it has possesed him, as you have clearly beaten all of this wizards challenges, it decides to kill him and take you as its host. you are then told that it is going to take you to the east ""to unleash more havoc on the spirit forge"".in game two, a prequel sequel (chapter 0). where you play as another seemingly random wizard, only you are in fact the bad wizard from the FIRST game. the story follows bad wizard as he tries to find the ""gem of eternity"", a gem with mysterious power. he looks for it everywhere, the wizard council tries to stop him. one day his compass points north twards the gem of eternity, as he travels north, fighting ""arcane guardians"" and eventually finds the gem of eternity. as he unlocks it he unwittingly unleashes ""the forgotten"" from the first game, he becomes the bad wizard from gemcraft chapter 1.in game three, a sequel, but not entirely a prequel, this game takes place at the same time as the first game in a timeline sense (lost chapter). the story follows (once again) a young wizard, who has one final quest, though it only appeared on his map AFTER the village he was guarding was attacked. the map lead him to a labyrinth. once in the center of it, the wizard used four crafting pylons to create a new gem of eternity. he then travels to the spirit forge to put the gem where it belongs.which finally brings us to game four aka chapter 2. (which i highly reccomend you play the game to learn about, im spoiling this for myself unfortunately because im a gametheory gamefreak like matpat I MUST KNOW EVERYTHING) gemcraft chapter 2 (game 4) follows the first wizard you played in the first game (meaning the 2nd and 3rd games were really just exposition at this point). on your way to the spirit forge, as previously mentioned at the end of chapter 1, however on your way you pass through an old trap ""the sycthe gate"" which separates you from the forgotten. after regaining conciousness you find yourself at your old wizard tower where you build a new trap to attempt to seal the forgotten before she reaches the spiritforge.along the way you find new structures and enemies which i believe were not in the previous games. as you continue twards the spiritforge, your character does the unthinkable in the games, actually thinks about the games own plot. who is the forgotten (ponders the ""summoning of"") as well as if the summoning was ""really an accident"". you also ponder about what the forgotten is actually doing as well as why. eventually you find the gembearer, the wizard from game 3 chapter 0 (boy this is confusing isent it?) dead, you also find the gem of eternity that he crafted next to him. you take the gem and decide to take it to the spirit forge for him while using its amazing powers to kill hordes of monsters attacking the spiritforge, which is when we finally get into some detailed information. the gem of eternity, after absorbing the essence of the monsters, begins glowing with a blinding light. the gem replica (assuming the replica is the one made by the gembearer and the origional is still there) begins transferring its energy to the OG gem. it then fires a powerful burst of magic at the spiritforge shield, destroying it.it is then revealed that the gem replica you found next to the gembearer, was corrupted. in all the previous instances where the forgotten was sealed, she would slowly corrupt the gem, twisting its power to her own needs and binding all the fake gems to one another (apparently the OG gem at the spirit forge AND the one you are using are both corrupt replica's, read on young one). so when you used the fake you used the corrupt power of all the gems and destroyed the shield of the spirit forge. the forgotten even let the player live after their initial separation at the scythe gate for this purpose.in the end you were a pawn to the forgotten in order to break into the one place she could not enter nor corrupt. she probably never meant to let you live and the game alludes to a sequel in which you enter the spirit forge after finding the REAL real gem (apparently the OG gem at the entrance to the spirit forge was ALSO a replica/fake gem which is why it mentions that she binded all the fake gems to one another)very clearly these games are extremely detailed for free flash games (even more so after becoming pay games) for those who were smart enough to not read the blotted out there is most likely another game coming in the series and i am now giddy with anticipation to find out what lies in store for it.

												Solid tower defense gameplay. Quick to learn for beginners, insanely tough to manage high-end challenges for those who enjoy the grind.Master the important skills, and you too can command deadly forces as the most pimpin' of wizards with more bling than half the rap artists on the planet combined.

												For a game that's under $5 ( on sale ) there's no question it's worth buying. It's a tower defense game so obviously you need to like them or you wont like this but as far as the game goes it's suprisingly deep and fun.It has a talent tree to customize you're wizardA crafting system in the form of a talisman to offer even more customizationAnd a system for increasing difficulty for more xp and a chance at better drops.The gameplay is simple to learn but still has enough options, so you have lots of choices. Some work better than others. You combine gems to slot into your defense and depending on what you pick and how many are combined you get different effects. Raw damage is important but it isn't everthing.  "

												There is Hope for this Genre yet.GemCraft is an amazing game. It nearly went to my top 1 of TD games, but now sits on a very close 2nd place, with a huuuge buffer until the 3rd. So what does make this game so amazing?Well, i´m always glad to see when a developer knows what he´s doing. And that is most defenitly the case with this game: The mechanics work great, there is a decent monster/tower variety and the levels are very well balanced.It´s not that expensive, and what you get are serious hours of playtime and content. The most upvoted reviews for this game have a playtime of 150+ hours for a reason.Take all the above and throw in some decent RPG mechanics and you have a game that deserves your attention.All that with the sheer variety of levels makes it one of the best TDs there are and easily recommendable...

												This is an awesome little game! It is a hidden little gem i picked up for $0.21. This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of ""OHHH!!"" moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play. One more thing is that great soundtrack, props to them!PROS-Great learning curve-Puzzles never get boring-New Mechanics add depth-Puzzles are very satisfying to solve-Puzzles are so clever (I know i've said it a bunch but I really love the puzzles!!!)-Great price-Secrets keep the game interesting-Never too easy or too hard-Awesome music to play toCONS-None (I can't complain as the game has everything advertised plus much more and FAR exceded my expectations)The game is short and can not really be a con for being so, as it cost me a mere $0.21.

												Every once in a while I look for Warcraft 3 tower defense map packs, hoping there will be something new. I've tried numerous tower defence games and this is by far the best. It scratches the tower defence itch like no other. $11 CDN is most certainly a fair price for this game. One reviewer says they purchsaed the game for $2.50 during one of the big sales, this absolutely blows my mind. If the graphics and UI were less 'Flash-gamey' this could easily be a $60 tower defence game. With the graphics it has now, I'd say its a $55 tower defence game ;)[EDIT]I almost forgot that people might actually be interested in what make sthis game so good aside from some weird price speculation haha.You can control the range of a tower by hovering over it and using the mouse wheel. As far as I can tell there are 9 gems that do different types of damage/have different modifiers.You can buff the level itself makingit more difficult and granting you more xp when you defeat it.After beating each level, you can choose to continue it on ""Endurance Mode"". You have a talisman that you can put fragments in that give you bonuses against certain monster types. Fragments are randomly found when killing monsters.There is a skill window where you can put skill points into various skills. (Note that the more unspent skill points you have, the more starting mana you begin each level with!)Look, just buy this game. If you've actually read this far, you are either bored you will like this game. Either way, you should get it :)			"

It offers hours of gameplay and it does have an integrated leveling system with many skills. And then just for 10$?

												Amazing tower defense that pleases casual players and has alot of depth. You can customize in which way the maps will be harder before going into it, but you can also make it harder on the fly, by enraging waves or calling waves early. Being able to move gems to different places (towers, traps...) adds a new dimension to the strategy,All things considered, probably the best tower defense I've played.			"

												Cannot recommend this game enough.I've only played a few hours so far, but have easily spent thousands of hours playing many TD games.This one, is very simplistic at first glance.- put gems in tower- upgrades gems to do more damage- rinse and repeatBut no, it is far from it. I've barely scratched the surface, but judging by the amount of locked slots for skills, challenges (which boost your xp gain on maps), etc., there is still a lot for me to uncover. It may not be as flashy as other TD games, but I'm more about substance as opposed to flash.I haven't encountered any major endearing plot or narrative to speak of (yet, I'm still fresh into this game). But the sheer amount of content and replayability I've enountered so far, makes this purchase an absolute no brainer.It's a steal at the current sale price, and still great value at regular price. My hat's off the the devs and publisher for this title. Best TD game I've played in a long time.			"

												#52 GemcraftActually a fun tower defense that gets pretty in-depth.  You simply can't over power the mobs, there's too much to account  for.  The hp, shields, speed, buffs, your buffs, it all has to be planned for.  Then you have to gem crafting angle, which is a nice concept for this type of game.  Most games like this take you through 20-40 lvls, maybe 10-15 hrs of game time, but this one takes you through 100+ lvls, then you have buffs and different lvls of difficulty adding up to a serious value for the money.

												Amazing tower defense game with astounding - at some times, intimidating - depth and customization. Every facet of the player's build can be customized, with skill points obtained as the character levels up and glyphs that fit in the talisman providing passive bonuses in battle. Wizard scrolls add set difficulty penalties to levels, but allow for much greater experience gain. In battle, tower and trap locations, gem strength, abilities, & range, and even the number and strength of enemy waves can be controlled and micromanaged as much or as little as desired. Many levels have optional challenges or strategies that can be employed, and the later levels open up greatly, allowing the player to contruct intricate mazes for the monsters to traverse.There are definitely optimal set-ups, and the game loses a bit of charm once these optimal set-ups are discovered and utilized, but it is still very compelling and fun.

												The GemCraft series has pioneered my absolute favorite concept in the tower defense genre.The idea of directly spending resource to generate higher risk/difficulty/reward. Spending resources to make incoming waves more difficult, which in turn, end up dropping even more resources. This ensures that GemCraft will be able to *always* challenge you at any phase of the game, on any map, because you will always have incentive to make each individual wave as difficult as you possibly can.Now, what I'd say the GemCraft series does very poorly is balancing its gem(tower) types and encouraging variety. Instead, there are very super optimal setups that are very homogenous (ie, not diverse). I will not give these away in the review, since discovery is one of the few fun parts available due to this.Check the hours played of myself and others - there is clearly a lot of content here to properly hook somebody.

												I am a big fan of Tower Defense games, and I can say without a doubt this is the best one I've ever played.First, there is a ton of content. over 190 levels, with most of them having 3 difficulties + an endurance mode are sure to keep you busy for hours and hours.Second, the gameplay. While this is a tower defense game, there are some RPG alements mixed in, and as you clear fields you gain levels and skill points, which form a satisfying progression that can be felt heavily in the game. Playing the game itself is also a breeze, thatnks to the fact that practically everything is keybound and you can pause the game to take action.Third, the difficulty. The difficulty in this game is heavily scalable. In addition to the 3 difficulty modes, you can set battle traits to increase things like enemy health and get more xp out of it. It's a high-risk, high-reward system that works very well.Also, the game has a nice story, even if you haven't played the previous games on the series.			"

												If you are a fan of Tower Defense games, Gemcraft is an absolute must-try. I have spent a lot of hours on it on armorgames.com (in case you were wondering: dude, already a review with barely any hours on it?), and I'm absolutely sold. What makes it so special compared with the enormous amount of other games available in the genre? Here are some key words (tl;dr: read only key words):1.) Experimentation: Most TD games are quite simple: you have a limited amount of towers types that can be upgraded, each with their strengths and weaknesses. Strategy is mainly finding the right combos and placement.In gemcraft however, you build up defenses by forging gems and building defensive buildings separately, to then combine them. With 9 different gem types (all with their own colour) that have each a specific power and 3 different tower designs, you have a lot of freedom when creating your defenses against the demon hordes. Gems of different colours can be fused together to form powerfull combogems and can even be converted to gem bombs to rain death and destruction from above on a specific target.2.) Create your own dungeon:In most TD games you have 2 areas: the path that enemies follow to reach your base, and areas suitable to build your defenses. Sometimes it's a grid area that makes you puzzle for ideal placement, sometimes it is restricted to a few spots limiting the amount of towers you can build. Gemcraft has only one rule: There must be at least one route that enemies can follow to reach your base. As long as there is a path of one square wide with horizontal or vertical connections, you can build your towers on any surface that allows building. Aside from your towers, you also have the ability to build walls. Wide path? Make it narrow and windy by adding a lot of walls forcing enemies to follow a zigzag pattern! Multiple routes to your base? Block them untill there is one left! Create choke points with deadly traps waiting to turn unaware enemies into dust! Be carefull though, buildings and gems are build from the same recource pool (mana), so you are forced to be efficient.3. From sandbox to nightmare with one clickEver had that feeling during a mission when you were like: man, my defense is impenetrable, this is no longer a challenge, this is boring. Gemcraft allows you to suddenly turn the mission from an evil minion's deathwall to a tense fight for your live.  You can make the mission harder in various ways. First, like a lot of TD games, you have the option to early call waves. Only now you can decide to early call multiple waves at a time (if you are brave enough). All waves are displayed as 'wave stones' on the left of your screen, and they are all visible from the beginning. If you really want it, you can scroll down to the bottom, click the final round stone, and watch the fireworks (or your ultimate doom).Early calling a wave gives bonus mana and xp, so it's not just for fun. Another way is using gems. As I said earlier, gems can be turned into gem bombs to lay waste on the battlefield. However, when used on a wave stone, the targeted wave will be enraged: enemies become stronger, faster, more resistant, and more numerous. The stronger the gem bomb or the more gem bombs dropped, the stronger the wave becomes, and the higher the exp reward. Last but not least, you have the option to activate mission handicaps before starting the mission, such as less time between different waves, monsters receiving damage resistance on a direct hit, and much more. This can be very helpfull when you want to replay lower levels to rise enough in level to beat the harder fields.My verdict: Gemcraft is a landmark in the TD genre: it is challenging, tactical, allows a lot of experimentation, and is not short at all (you WILL require a lot of hours of gameplay to even reach the hardest fields).

												Gemcraft:CS is a great tower defense game, lot of content and lot of variety. It's about gems, of course, you spend mana (which also represents your life bar) to conjure more and more powerful gems in any combination of 9 flavours, each one bringing a different special ability to the final product. Then you socket these gems into stationary assets you build on the field, such as towers, traps, and amplifiers. And then, in time, you'll unlock three area-of-effect spells and three gem enchantments, all on separate cooldown. And then you'll get talisman fragments to randomly drop, and will socket and upgrade up to 15 of them into a large panel, securing a number of additional bonuses and perks. And then you'll gather xp at the end of every mission and invest them in the 25 skills available, or stash them in order to get a different kind of bonus. And then you'll move up and unlock all of the 150+ battlefields available, up to the Spiritforge. And then you'll want to try vision battlefields, where skills and talismans and all that stuff don't matter and you're alone and scared like the first time. And then you'll want to try Iron Wizard mode, with different rules to the game. And that's just scratching the surface.On top of all that, you can drastically personalize the level of challenge: each battlefield can be played in one of three different difficulty settings, and up to 9 crippling traits can be enabled to different extents in order to make the game more engaging/unforgiving. And even then, you can increase the challenge dynamically by calling in waves ahead of time and even 'enrage' them, which is to say 'spend mana to increase number, healthpool and armor of foes in a wave'.This little gem (hah) has a lot going for it, so if in doubt, trust a random stranger on the interwebs and buy this game!

												It's a tower game. Can't really be that fun, right? WRONG!This is a strangely addictive game. First couple of maps that one plays won't probably leave lasting impressions. The graphics are ok but nothing special, the storyline (there actually is one) isn't memorable and initially the tactics at the player's disposal are limited. You may even be tempted to put the game back in your (virtual) library shelves, but you'd make a BIG mistake.Give it a few rounds and you'll start unlocking skills and building up an amulet that can enhance specific traits. And your scores start to soar as you unlock more maps, So you start thinking: ""I'll give it just another go"" and then something new pops up.  Eventually you'll get stuck on a seemingly impossible level. But then you realise that if you go back to older maps and replay them with the newly acquired skills your old score will multiply unlocking even more skills.And that's when you get really hooked! You play a wizard committed on stopping a demon called ""The Forgotten"" that will summon hordes of monsters on each map level hurling them at you. Basically it's a matter of constructing ""choke points"" manned by towers and traps to obliterate ever-larger waves of fiends preventing them to overwhelm your ""Orb of Presence"". Towers and traps are powered by gems. Gems can be combined to achieve powerful combos, or used as ""pure"" (convinient if high on the ""Pure Colours"" skill), On completing maps players will acquire skill points that can be spent to get more powerful levels of particular skills as well as amulet fragments. Skills need to be unlocked by acquiring the relevant wizard skill tome in some maps, a sub-objective of the main objective of staying alive as long as possible. Invariably you will eventually be overwhelmed on each map, but the challenge is to push that boundary a little further each time, unlock new skills and try new tactics.Skill points can be reassigned at the beginning of each map so you are not stuck with a bad choice of skills and this encourages the player to experiment. I have changed tactics a few times and the results are not always predictable but that's part of the addictive fun of this game.Give it a try. Actually give it a few... And then you'll probably write a review similar to mine.			"

												Never played a Tower Defense game before (well there's that game mode in Patch Con! but never got interested on it).Anyway, after my casual 4 hours of gaming I can tell you this: Gem Craft is rather simple but it hides a huge ammount of complexibility. Basicly speaking all you have to do is to attach the gems you're given for each stage into towers and traps and their effect varies depending of the gem level, type and where you use it and how you use it. Also, the game offers you a way to increase the challenge in the way you seems fit for you game style with a risk/reward system that can be activated before the stage or during it as the waves of enemies comes in (by calling more waves at once or empowering each wave with the cost of a gem used as a bomb). As you become more powerful and earns the ability to build new towers and traps, you'll feel the urge to try to get a higher score on a previous map or how long you can last during an endurance run. And this is just the tip of the iceberg here.Summing up:GEM CRAFT IS THE DISGAEA OF TOWER DEFENSE (without the comedy by the way).			"

												The best tower defense i have ever played. Played the previous iterations of this series online for hours on end before it finally made it to steam. Great atmosphere/artwork and spectacular gameplay mechanics. You can make you gameplay as complicated or simple as possible, depending on how you want to play (which really gives you a lot of room if you want to do a short run or really go for the long grind)My only gripe for this game is that it is just a port of the flash version online, meaning that when you get upwards of over 5k monsters on screen fps drops by half and when you have 10k+ its basically 0  (reguardless of PC specs). I hope eventually this gets ported into a better engine for better preformance but all and all fantastice game.			"

												This game was probably the best $2 I've ever spent on Steam.   Super portable (plays on my work laptop) and a really fun way to kill a few hours.It can be really tough to advance to later wizard levels quickly until you discover some of the best strategies for getting loads of mana.  Try to figure them out yourself, or google them.... but once you get through that hurdle it's really fun to advance quickly.			"

After 72h, I have not even seen 75% of my first playhtrough, and there are 3 difficulty settings which change the rewards you can change on the fly... really rewarding Xp system, and a ton of achievements, which all provide skill points in game to make you stronger...You learn new skills, spells which help, upgrade your gems, and discover new malus cards which make the game harder, but give more Xp, so you need to find the right balance. On certain maps, you need to fulfill special requirements within the mission to unlock new tombs with new rewards. Highly recommended!			"

												A lot of quality of life features were removed from the free version of Gemcraft since the second game. It costs $5 for the premium flash version  of this game and is a hassle to maintain the license code to maintain the save file. Therefore, if you want to do things that made the game easier like bonuses from triple gem combinations, .etc, then get this. Even better, you can often buy it below the $5 asking price of the Flash version on here. It's practically a no brainer for those who want to enjoy more Gemcraft.Best part is the extended demo known as the Flash version is easy to find and play if you're curious about the quality of this great game.

												I love this game and have been playing the series back from when they released on armorgames. You can still play it there for free with a majority of the content there. I am not exactly sure what exactly is missing because I purchased this oon steam as soon as I saw it but if it is anything like the other games in the series you can get agreat taste for the game for free. I played the other gemcraft games for hundreds of hours before I donated to the developer. I just hope that the older games will get moved to steam as well, I would love to play them through again just for the story.For some cons, at the end of the day its still a flash tower defense game, if $10 feels like it is a bit steep for something you can play online for free then thats perfectly ok. I purchased it because I love this dev and want to see more. After a while it can feel repetative, but I feel that that only happens to me when I don't bother to increase the difficulty of the levels and in this version it gives you even more options to do so. But if you don't want to have to manage your own difficulty level to suit your needs then maybe look elsewhere. The game is long and if you play each level on the easiest difficulty then you probably will get bored eventually. If this is your first foray into the series you will be lost in the story. It picks up where the last gemcraft ended and provides you with some backstory but not nearly as much as I would have liked. However, the other games are all free so there is no reason not to go back and play them if you want. The graphics are not spectacular, but they have their unique style and it helps when you have something like 400 units coming on the screen at one time and being attacked by 20 different towers. Overall this is a great game in a great series and I cant wait to see more from this dev. There is no reason to not at least go to armorgames and give it a try and see if its your thing or not. Just make sure you throw the dev some thanks if you enjoy it.			"

												1. Gameplay: 7/10You get ""tower base"" which can be built on the allowed terrain; including the path of the monsters, but mostly the path is too narrow to build without blocking their path. You can then craft gems, combine gems, upgrade gems and socket them into these tower base. Completing levels give you exp. You can make the levels/waves tougher and add exp modifiers. This exp is used to level up your character. Each level gives you 7 skill points, which can be spent on unlocked skills. Skills are unlocked by completing objectives in certain levels.2. Level Design: 5/10The levels are rather quite restrictive. Most of the times it's quite obvious as to where to build the towers. There are very few levels which encourage heavy mazing.In the 8 hours I played this game, I found the gameplay to be rather repititive, specially because of the level design.3. Soundtrack: 2/104. Story: Irrelevant/can be ignored.5. Aesthetics: 4/106. 1080p, fullscreen/borderless window: YES.7. Final thoughtsThe game is worth picking up because you will defintely enjoy the first 10 hours. After that, it's kind of a hit or miss. I, personally, abandoned the game after 8 hours simply because I got my fill out of it. You can also try a free version of the game available @kongregate.comI got the game in a sale for ~$3.5 and it was defintely worth the money.			"

												A surprisingly deep TD built around player customization and is as long as you want to make it. So many elements can be customized to control how difficult(and rewarding) a play is. You can turn every level into an endless run for boosted exp, augment specific waves of enemies to make them harder, a meta game customization in the form of slotting items into a talisman for more effects.If I had to knock the game for anything, the UI could have been a little more informative regarding what things do, enemy stats and danger, but all that is simply learned through play.

												After playing the Armor Games flash version, getting the steam version, with updated features, as well as additions to the core game seemed like an obvious choice.  I've followed this game on the Game in a Bottle blog for months, waiting paitently for the release, then the Steam version.  I can confidently say, I'm glad I could wait as long as I did.Gameplay is fantastic, blowing away the Tower Defense genre with unique features similar to an MMORPG.  With the ability to grow skills, customize your strengths with the talisman, and grow by constantly throwing yourself at the same levels with constant increases to difficulty, this game will manage to suck away hours, while staying fresh for a while.Then theres the hardcore side of things.  Endurance runs to actually BEAT a level.  It's a faux-endless, but every stage can be beaten.  And your power never stops growing.For the gamer who is an upgrade enthusiast, this is the game for you.			"

												Gemcraft is one of the best games I've played in a long while. While it's facade of a Tower Defense game may drone you away as you think of 'Balloon Tower Defense.' Do not turn away my friend!Gemcraft is suprisingly indepth for a Tower Defense game. While you dotn build special towers to do special jobs, you are provided gems tha do different jobs that can be mixed, matched, and dropped as bombs to give ulimited posibilites.You can put gem's in 'Traps' to make their special abillities, like posion or multi-hit, stronger or simply leave them in towers for a damage boost.

												GemCraft, got me through several boring college lectures ^_^ They really stuck with the principles of the labyrinth game, it all came back to me within a few minutes. If you liked labyrinth, get this. Now.They even added a feature to finish off a level in endurance mode. I think that's new. So you breeze through the easy missions, but then click the ""endurance"" button. It's awesome if you have a solid defence going and want to keep going in a mission.			"

												So, what is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said (especially the review by Genoce)? Well, not that much. I mean, it's not a TD game for everyone, that I will admit. With 190 levels, a gazillion ways to tweak skills and difficulty settings, and the way to combine gems to create just what you want, it does have a higher treshold of entry than most such games. But if it does get its hooks in you, then wave goodbye to the next 100+ hours or so of your gaming schedule. And so this review should pretty much end.However, I'd like to also respond to some of the negative criticisms in the game, which is going to take up a lot more space:""It's too random, what with the specters and shadows.""While it's technically true that these add an element of uncertainty, it's not that random (for one thing, you get warnings beforehand that it's about to happen), and it's therefore most certainly possible to plan for it. In fact, once you know how to deal with those things, then even if a shadow show up on wave 5, they'll never be a problem. And personally, the levels I've felt where randomness was more of an issue are the special Vision levels, because they're meant to be tight fights at all times. Sometimes they're so tight, that if your gems in the first wave tends to end up doing minimum damage shots, you've already lost. Then the next time you try said gems shoot maximum damage, and you survive and move on to clear the whole damn level.Aside from that, I've hardly ever played any TD game that is -less- random than this game (maybe the previous games in the series, but they too had it, if in different forms)! For one thing, like I said, the difficulty setting is completely and utterly under your control, and never feels arbitrary. Take Kingdom Rush in comparison; the game's later mission levels on that game requires a lot of planning -and- early wave luck (i.e. good damage on the first few hits)... And that was on casual difficulty. Normal and Difficult requires nothing less than utter perfection in every single detail there. And Cursed Treasure 2 has levels entirely depending on early mana flask drops if you want three stars. This game, mana flow is forever something you can do something about, and you have a lot more freedom in placing your towers. There's nothing happening in this game that you cannot react to (except the aforementioned low-damage early shots in the vision fields).Oh, and it seems like the amount of Shadows appearing has been severely downgraded compared to earlier versions of the game. I'm currently ""It is too grindy, especially if you want a complete game.""Well... Yes. It's true. I mean, if you know what you're doing, you can sweep through the main levels doing them all only one time each, and the Vision levels are completely set in terms of what gems and spells you have, so obviously any amount of grinding won't help you beat them. But if you want a complete game, you'll have to replay levels, yes. And yes, the levels are pretty long too, because this game is about making a set-up....Which is something you do in every TD game that's worth a damn anyway. And at least if you want to grind here, you have to be clever about it, since it will always only be the highest score you get in any given level that counts. Also, don't forget Gemcraft Chapter 0. If you wanted a complete game there (i.e. each level completely shining), you had to replay every level 8 times. 8. Frickin'. Times. Here, you can get away with twice each (once on Looming and once on Haunting difficulty, ignoring Glaring), and if you unlock Haunting early, a fair few can be beaten with only one attempt.""There's barely any mazing.""Again, pretty much true. You don't spend that much time setting up walls to lead the monsters exactly where you want... And that is a bloody good thing too, because every TD I've played that's required excessive mazing on every level are immensely boring; with the fields usually being mainly empty except for a few ocstables that prevents you from optimal mazing every time. Who needs that crap? I sure don't.""Once you find the optimal strategy, it's nothing else to do.""Again true (I sense a pattern here)... And I'm not going to defend this per se, except saying that in the Gemcraft series as a whole, much of the point is about figuring out how to exploit everything. And I personally -like- games that gives you the option of doing that, provided they make sure that (barring going online and looking up other people's work) it's a challenge to find out how to exploit it. And this game's got that challenge. Way back when I first played this on AG, I thought I had a pretty good deal going on with the things I'd made up... and then I read about how other people had found stuff that put my strategies to utter shame (though they had the Magician's Pouch; I hadn't. I still wouldn't have figured out that other stuff in a million years, though). Still, my non-Magician Pouch based strategy was good enough for me to then beat field O6 at Wizard Level 56. Others had problems with that field 30 or more wizard levels above mine, so that was nice. :DAnyway, as you can see, I'm not always disagreeing with these criticisms, and you as a buyer should take them into consideration, as that this is a very, very specialised Tower Defense game. But I certainly like it, and since it is available to try out for free on several flash game websites, you'll have the opportunity to try it out for yourself. And I think you should. ;)			"

												P.S. Russian review: http://igrotop.com/games/gemcraft_chapter_2_chasing_shadows/posts/obzor_gemcraft_2_chasing_shadows'King's Bounty' series is the best tower defense game for pc in my oppinion, yet Gemcraft Chapter 2 is right next to it and will definetly take much more time from me. This is well polished and super content-wide game. The problem with most tower defense games is their short campaign, but here we have a hundreds of levels X 3 difficulties, so its always enaught things to do. The amulet is really good idea for a game, which makes it feel more like RPG (Diablo-style). Not that many games feature such a nice randomisation of monsters and items (talisman fragments).The other good side is very wide options, so every player can work around visuals a lot. Resolution looks good on my 1920x1080 and FPS is high at max settings with quite an old PC. Also its rare to find a good atmosphere for towers-game — thanks to those graphics, visuals and weather it feels deep and satisfying. But the most significant is the traits system, which makes this game super unique even among RPG-s and H&S genres.The only problem is: to play it at full power, i will have to find and deliver a whole day just for Gemcraft 2. And thats good, since Terraria and Titan Quest was the only games being able to cause such interest for me. And this game is pretty much cheap for its wide content.-----And a negatice article... I really dont like an idea of getting 2-7 or even more wizard levels at once after beating a single map at the early-game. The leveling system would feel much better if you could gain those levels slowly. Also for me its pretty hard to figure out which map was first beaten and which was the second and so on. After you upgrade and gain more strenght you are coming to replay old levels, but, unfortunatly, there is no good guide or assistence on understanding which map you should re-clear right now to get benefits. That causing a confusion, since i am forsed to note every single level after beating it. Moreover, its hard to find levels placements, since they all look the same from World Map view and there is no even explanation which letter is first / second / etc. But hey, thats just my own problems with game, it dosnt mean everyone will suffer from similar feelings.

												I've played this epic TD game on Armor Games for hours and hours a couple of years ago. Upon purchasing this game on Steam I simply wish to show my gratiude for the developers and other fellow fans of AG. I remember all the good fun I've had back then--and now I could relive some of the good times!I've only started, so far this newly released version seems to be well polished, and offering much more than the flash version. And it yet keeps the original taste(or atomsphere?) of the out-dated flash version.However the graphics is set in widescreen in default, and it doesn't support the old good 4:3 scale. That's sad, for me, but I suppose it wouldn't bother a lot of you guys, so I'd take it myself then.The other reviews explain the details pretty well, nothing I need to add here.Recommened.If you like TD games you'd love this. If you're not sure about it, you can just go to Armor Games and try the flash version out.			"

												I've taken a shining to very few tower defense games, but this one is a particularly impressive piece of work. Masses and masses of content and well thought out mechanics in an ever escalating cascade of insanity. It is NOT an easy game by any means, but it all feels quite well-balanced, and rewards you for challenging yourself. My only real gripe is that the primary way the game handles escalating difficulty is by throwing monsters with higher and higher health and armor values at you; which seems like a natural progression, but the armor values quickly escalate to the point where any defenses that aren't absolutely top-level for the part of the stage that you're at, won't even put a scratch on the enemies. This means that the optimal strategy for almost any stage is to have one, maybe two towers that you pump all your upgrades into (along with a few traps and amplifiers), because if you spread out your resources you'll be utterly ♥♥♥♥ed when the armored giants roll in. It's still tense as hell and requires constant management, but it seems like it could be more of a spectacle with encouragement to install a bigger spread of towers.That being said, it is addictive as hell, well worth the asking price, and easily one of the most impressive TD games ever made.

												On its face it's probably one of the best tower defense games out there. But there's a point in the game where you go from having nothing to having everything (and beyond) and the challenge fades away.Once you ""get"" how to really play this game, it becomes very repetitive and unchallenging. Certain gem combinations mean easy access to literally billions of EXP. I played this game from level 1 to 130 without using these especially deadly/plentiful gem combos, but as soon as I found them, I went from level 130 to 2200 in a matter of days playing pretty casually (I left the game open, so my hours plays doesn't really mean anything). Also, because this game is built on Flash, it runs very poorly on even the best of setups – the problem being thousands and thousands of monsters on-screen at the same time. When every wave has 999 monsters coming and you're sending them in advance at the highest of speeds (which you'll have to do, since you'll be pretty bored watching everything die), the frames hover around 10 fps for me. It doesn't matter that much because I'm not doing anything besides upgrading gems (to 45+) and enraging waves (which includes repeatedly clicking everything... also boring). It's almost as if people figured out how to exploit this game and then the developers sort of went along with it. If this is actually what happened, good for them for adapting how their players ""game"" the game, but in reality, it just doesn't work that well.			"

												A updated look at one of the most popular web-based tower defense titles.  Solid, but standard pathing, construction, and other elements found in many other titles; the main features here are the RPG progression, and the use of 'gems' to power towers, traps, and other attacks.Gems can be summoned for mana, combined to support multiple effects, leveled up for increased effectiveness, and even dropped from the heavens.  Dropped gems' power are based on their level, and can be used as bombs, to power up friendly structures, or even to power up enemy waves for higher challenge and reward.It's a great concept, and it makes for one of the deepest offerings you'll find in the genre when combined with the skill tree, branching map, and countless modifiers to customize your play.  On top of that, GemCraft features an absolutely watertight theme, carrying a grim and sombre dark-fantasy tale.An instant classic.			"

												This game feels like it throws every possible upgrade mechanic at the wall just to see what sticks. It's not that the core tower defence system is unenjoyable, it's that when I try and play it like a tower defence game in the way I think of games in the genre, I find that all the ancillary mechanics end up stripping away the core motivation I have to play these kinds of games.It all ends up boiling down to optimising for experiences points and item drops. It has to be said that my strong distaste for this game is not unrelated to my strong distaste for MMOs. The whole justification becomes circular, and in the never ending loop of grinding for more stuff in order to get better at grinding, I just don't feel like I am getting anything out of the experience.I'm relatively sanguine with TD games that have a few modest upgrades here and there, but this goes so far overboard that I can't actually see the game through all that noise.

												Ok keep in mind this is a very VERY 'initial thoughts' review (less than 1 hour played,) but wanted to post before end of the flash sale.Very nice tower defense game, with some interesting new mechanics. Mana = money, with it you craft gem types to place in towers for different effects (chain damage, slowing, armor break, and a lot of effects not normally seen in tower defense actually). You can also make 'gem bombs' any time for aoe damage or to destroy one of your own structures (the base structures cannot be sold). I like the sort of old-school feel of the maps, and minor path-building is available, except on the few maps I've tried the paths are too thin to lengthen much yet. Tons of skill points to spend (unspent goes to initial money/mana, I think that's a cool mechanic), talismans, and other goodies. Hundreds of achievements. Lots of menu options too, all with mouseover explanations. Other notes: They seem to still be releasing updates like bug fixes and suchHas 2 window size modes, full screen and drag to any size. I love drag to resize, but for some reason this disables Steam overlay/ screenshots for this particular game. It has some story too, which I never care about, but the good thing is they dont bother you with it. It's just there in notes if you want to read them. Nicely done!Overall:This game won't put you in awe, but it seems to be a very good quality game; it feels solid.  Definitely worth a few bucks on sale (66% or better) for TD fans, otherwise, I probably wouldn't go for full price. But any quality game can be worth full price, and this so far looks really good.

												As a tower defence fan i couldn't pass this game. At first it seemed like a fun game with lots of mechanics. Past 30 hours and a few unlocks it reveals itself as a really poorly made TD game... -So it's all about gems - there are 9 types of gems, 6 of them are barely have any use, other 4 are a must have if you want to beat a difficult map (and unless you unlock them you're limited to what developers give you on that map)-Gems have different effects on monsters but every tower is the same single target cannon (exception is a chain gem with which your shots deal damage to several monsters in a chain)-What seemed to be a lot of mechanics is actually a pretty shallow set of similar things, half of which arent even viable like combination of more than 4 types of gems, cause you will LOSE a lot of damage because of a skill that buffs only up to 4 gem combination... or traps... traps are essentially useless cause they can't get even close to what a buffed tower will do... or gem bombing which is only ""useful"" to make waves stronger to get more exp/mana... or barrage spell which travel so slowly it lands when tower shots already killed everything and if your barage is actually killing something then you probably buffed waves too hard and might just die anyway-WAY too many waves... WAY. 1 map can take an hour to beat on high difficulty and you use lots of traits and also enraging waves...-It lags like any other game won't ever lag, cause to match your power you need to buff waves more and more resulting in thousands of monsters on the map-It's insanely unforgiving... you can sit for an hour on a map with like 150-200 waves, enraging them, then you accidentally (cause of lags or losing patience) enrage them for a bit more than you can actually hanlde and there it is - youre ♥♥♥♥ed, start the map over again-Limited demolitions... WHY THE ♥♥♥♥? You are carefully building a labyrinth and bam you placed something wrong a couple of times, well you better be precise next time cause you can't remove it anymore...-Annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥coming out of nowhere without any warning ranging from a harmless ghost flying by to a huge fat ♥♥♥♥ness requiring lots of dps or it will oneshot you or how about losing control for 20 seconds? Sounds fun right?If it was developers first project then these flaws might be actually somewhat forgivable (is it even a word?), but looks like it's already a game series (it might be just an updated version, i'm not sure). What i liked is the style and maybe some challenges. I wish developers use their acquired experience and improve the game or make their next project better.			"

												Gemcraft was always the daddy of tower defense games, but this one is simply not as good as previous ones.  I have persevered with this game for a long time, coming back to it several times since I purchased it, but ive come to the conclusion that its just not as good as previous episodes of Gemcraft.  too much micro management			"

												Great game, huge amount of achievements and fun enough to keep you moving forward. very unique tower defense game, interestin mechanics, smooth operation and have never encountered a bug. Quite challenging but not oppressive, interesting upgrade system adds to the overall gameplay. No TD fan should be without it in their collection.			"

												A tower defense type game that offers alot of freedom in terms of how you want to place or develop your gems (aka towers or traps), easy to get into hard to let go all in all a very satisfying game to play. Alot of replay value here you can make levels as hard as you want (and there is lots of them), lots of achiefments to go for (it is so satisfying to get an achiefment on almost everything you do) also the in game menu to browse achiefments is a great way to see what ones you can go for I give it 9.5/10 a true gem :)			"

												So good I bought it twice. (Armor games and here). Thank you for making such a highly polished gem of a game.My only issues: It's a little too easy (too much xp/fragments/cores/harmless beacons all being factors). I miss the xp/scoring system of Gemcraft Labyrinth... I know it wasn't perfect and ended up being boxes to tick but it did structure each level around earning those mulltipliers and put a nice limit on xp earned. It was also nice to know which levels you had a low score on by mousing over that orb (and to need to go back to those levels because the difficulty was higher).Other than that, a great game by a singular talent. Good luck with whatever you do next, I'll look forward to playing it and to see what happens with the next Gemcraft gane whenever you delve back into things.			"

This means that when they down voted the game, they really did enjoy the game, but are annoyed about something stupid and don't know how to really see a game.

												I'll update this after I've spent more time with the game.I can recommend this, but with one caveat:  While it is a well-polished and fantastically interesting TD game, the challenge ramps up unexpectedly and ridiculously at around the 5th map.  The first few maps were a breeze, then I got to this one, and it has stopped everything I've tried about 40 times...  It even seems to be getting more difficult, for some reason.  I have literally no idea how to progress past this map, other than grinding the passive benefits and such, which I find to be a bit odd, since I normally expect these kinds of games to revolve around just strategy.  Well, as I have made it pretty far a couple of time, but for whatever reason, (even when duplicating the build order that was successful) I cannot get further than the third wave now, which makes absolutely no sense at all.  It is literally as if the map got harder between tries.I'm going to keep pounding away at it, and I'll update my review as I hopefully progress further in the game and can provide more helpful feedback.  I would say the devs could stand to tweak the difficulty curve a smidge, or else provide just a bit more insight into the mechanics that I am probably missing somehow.  It's a pretty well-designed game other than those critiques.  I can't wait to see more of it...if I ever get to.  ;)			"

												Easily the best tower defense game I've played, just goes to show it's not the size that counts but how you use it, very small game file but the most in depth TD game I've ever played, I got into TD games with Defense grid and I have had a hard time finding one that could compete with the enjoyment I got from that game, then I stumbled across this game for $1.99 about a week ago and I've been hooked, there's so much to do, the levels just keep going and the replayability of this game appears to be endless with all the options.  Truly amazed by this game and once I make it through the base game I will try out the other fun stuff it offers.  I love the fact you can place things where you actually want to put them and aren't restricted to set places like some other TD games do.  I will keep my eyes open for future installments of this game.  No other TD game I've played comes even remotely close to how great this one is and I've played as many as I could since I got hooked after Defense grid.			"

												The latest title in the GemCraft series of Tower Defense games comes to Steam. I played this, only to realise why I had stopped playing the previous games in the series. It gets repetitive. Sure, there's some strategy with combining gems together to create more powerful, customised gems, to shoot down those enemies, but that's all you'll be doing. For 100+ levels. All the different monster types, level layouts, talisman fragments, wizard skills, aim to provide some variety, but their effects are fairly subtle, most of the time you will be waiting for your gems to shoot down the enemies. If I were to continue playing this, I would be doing it in short bursts, I probably wouldn't be able to sit down and play this for hours like other strategy games I like to play. I'd only recommend it if you love Tower Defense games, or are a fan of the GemCraft series.			"

												Well, it's GemCraft. You've likely logged dozens/hundreds of hours on its flash-based counterparts. You've likely done so on company time. You're a monster.The Good: Tried-and-tested Tower Defense Formula. One of the better/more creative systems out there. Good difficulty scalars (once you unlock them) for extra challenge. As usual, a campaign mode that's ridiculously long. You'll definitely get value for money here.The Bad: There's really not a whole lot new here, as compared with the Flash counterparts. For experienced players, the starting difficulty is far, far too easy. It can be a tedious grind to unlock additional challenge scalars/levels to bring the game up to your level. The story tie-in is a bit boring, in my opinion. But again, storytelling has never been a very strong point for TD's.The Ugly: Graphically, there's no notable upgrade from GemCraft's Flash days. It's looking pretty dated - nice sprite art as usual, but texture quality is far too low for this day and age.The Verdict: GemCraft still remains one of the most fun TD titles across any platform. Allows for a passive play-style, but offers reward for players who take a more active interest in game sessions. Its old age lends to some cobwebs around the edges; but with such a unique/trademarked gameplay style, it's difficult to fault GemCraft for not further expanding on its elements.Definitely worth the asking price - just don't go in expecting a total rebirth of the genre.

												Before reading this review, or even buying this game, go play gemcraft labryinth to find out if this game is for you.when i learned this games predessesor, Gemcraft Labryinth, had a second installment on steam, i was thrilled. but after completing most of the Labryrinth, i was greatly underwhelmed by this game. so im going to make a list of pros and cons, about why you should go play the free flash gemcraft over this one.(im only 25 stages in, so this review is up to change)PROs:- It has better art style- there are new diffrent types of gems that are creative- the mana pool automatically expands, putting a whole new spin on resource managementCONs:-  walls are smaller, and map has more detailed paths, making mazing alot harder and more costly.- you can no longer buy types of gems to use. it does force you to use diffrent strategies, but i think some gem types are just garbage, and it seems that most levels in the first 25 have poison and armor tearing, and almost none have bloodbound and manapool gems.- poison is even worse now, it does alot less damage over even more time.- im 25 stages in and it still wont let me build a amplifier- the world map is much more disorienting. its harder to find things, and its not as clear.- unlocking things is no longer based on your skill level, its based on progression. this is hands down one of the worst changes. before, it was based on level. the harder you make a level for yourself, the more levels you get, thus making you unlock more the better you are. in this version you unlock stuff by beating levels. im almot level 100, after beating 25 stages, and i can still barely raise the difficulty on levels.overall, i would enjoy this game much better if you unlocked stuff as you level, and if you could buy gem types in a level again. but i dont really think this game is nearly as good as gemcraft labyrinth, so go play that instead.

												Unfortunately, despite having a great PC, the game's frame rate is terrible - even with the graphics as simple as they are. I also played through the first 10 levels or so and just didn't find myself hooked, like with some tower defense games.The mechanics are poorly explained, and I found myself struggling to undertsand why to bother upgrading some of the skills, or the talisman components. Each gem has a wall of text explaining it, but the mechanics of combining gems and upgrading are poorly laid out and explained.			"

												This game would be good, except where it comes to dropping gems in to the box things where the towers are. If you do not position it exactly, it will not drop the gem!Plus, endurance mode is absolutely pointless, very shortly after selecting it, just 1 or 2 waves, you will be over run with so many enemies (normally 1 at a time, but when this happens they are piled on top of each other, with about 3 or 4 to a pile, and a total of approx 10 times as many as normal) that you may as well have just quit the map at the end of the normal round, and this is when playing in casual difficulty mode!And just like every other tower defense game, eventually you will get to a level that just simply overpowers you with a pathetically high number of enemy units, that you have no hope of stopping, leaving you defeated!DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU LIKE GRINDING OR ARE A HARDCORE PLAYER!!!

												Good game but not a tower defence game. You build a couple (1-3) towers, upgrade it and, nothing else. The rest of the game is spreadsheet work. Tower types are boring - tower types only differ in how they do damage. There's barely any mazing (you have to build walls, like, 2-3 of them every few maps, but that's it) because most paths are still narrow. There's barely any need to think about coverage/good positioning, because as mentioned earlier you build only a few of them (sometimes even 1) and towers shoot so fast you don't need to think about mobs of weak enemies vs single strong enemy.The main depth of the game is in the numerical works, if you're into it. There are only 3 different type of mobs - small medium and large. They differ in armor, regen, may be some extra wacky special but can be summarized as ""tanky stats"". Your tower is pretty much the same, hit armor, hit regen, crit, etc just different way to deal damage. Then there are talismans, which are small bonuses to your damage, mana etc and skills, which allow you to build tower cheapers, deal more damage etc So basically A LOT of numbers and your goal is to balance them until you win. So I suppose it's probably fun for people who enjoy a lot of spreadsheet works. But it's not tower defense.			"

												Was hoping for more to be honest, The gemcraft: Labirynth was a master piece which i still play frequently. This game feels like the developers tried to be too innovative, changing up stuff that worked perfectly before. I will probably play some more of this, because I don't like writing down stuff I haven't really explored, but so far it was a big dissapointment.Edit: Played some more and I still think the game is lacking, I can't change my rating for it unfortunately. Don't misunderstand the game is not faulty nor it is bad, i quite like all version of this game, but this is far from the best one, and the others are free to play. So what I recomment is you play GemCraft labyrinth onlne, rather than this one. I would rather buy the premium version of that than this instalment of the game.			"

												Based on the reviews on Steam, obviously most people really like this game. Many reviewers call this their favourite TD game.I wish I felt the same way, but this game doesn't work for me. After playing it for about three hours, I can tell this game isn't for me. Problems I have with the game include:- I played about 15 levels, none had an interesting level design, they all seemed very ""samey"". On a good TD game, I can remember the details of a level long after I finished it.- I only encountered two different monster types. I know there are more, but two types after 15 levels? Look at the gameplay video, almost all the levels shown in the video have the same few monster types.- You end up setting the difficulty of each level yourself. I don't mean that you chose, for example, normal or hard difficulty. There are no difficulty levels like that, at least not for quite a while. By default, the early levels are trivial to finish. You are suppose to hit waves of monsters with gem bombs before they launch to increase the difficulty. I expect the designer to adjust the difficulty levels during testing, I don't expect to do this myself.			"

												I'm not impressed.  The graphics are too basic.  It could easily have been programmed that way in the 20th century.  Its pixellated, almost retro and not even isometric.  For such primitive visuals it loads slowly.There is little to differentiate the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy.  Tower selection and placement doesn't seem to matter much.  Weapon strikes and dying enemies have forgettable animations.  There is very little strategy and gem type availability seems to be random for each level. I quickly became bored of the gameplay.The gem-crafting aspects seem tedious and overly complicated.  The best evidence of this comes from the wordy tips.  These may be helpful but the design is dated.  Unless you come back to the game a few times in the one day it is easy to forget the details.The various aspects of the game don't seem to mesh at all.  I can tell from other reviews that people voting this game up appreciate the franchise rather than this title.  3.5/10			"

												If you're a tower defense junkie, out looking for ""an addictive experience"" to waste your life away with, then this is the heroin you need.You can buy this game, when it's on sale, or you can play it FOR FREE in your browser (with probably some very minor limitations)....and if you feel the need to play more than FIVE of these levels, you ARE a junkie. ...because this game is 2% experience, and 98% ""chasing shadows"", i.e. grinding to get more XP so that you can grind some more.In terms of a grind fest, this is superb, though. This guy has spent many, many years perfecting the art of the tower defense grind, until he got to a point where he could SELL his tower defense game....but it's a freaking TOWER DEFENSE GAME!There are TONS of these things littering the internet.Just say no. Walk away. Do something with your life. Go outside....because if you don't, then this game features maybe 50-100 levels, that you have to play and RE-play about nine times each. Ask yourself: Do you want to spend several months playing a tower defense game? ...or would you rather look up the final level and the ending on YouTube? Think about it.Update:In case you want to know how long it takes to grind through this game, I can give you an estimate. A good game takes around 40 hours to beat. After 40 hours, you tend to get bored with a game, and it becomes a chore that you dread instead of enjoy.Getting HALF WAY through Gemcraft, takes 65 hours. 65 hours of just grinding. You're stupid if you buy this game.Update 2:I've tried to listen to podcasts while grinding through this game, but after 87 hours, I just feel too nauseous to play anymore. I'm physically DISGUSTED by this game.Update 3:101 hours - the end nowhere in sight. Oh god, oh god, please make it stop!			"

												Fun initially, but becomes posesses exactly the wrong mixture of insanely hard puzzles plus a brain-numbing grinding. 190 levels... and to ""finish"" the game you have to complete all of them three times?! Not counting the special playthroughs you'll need to do to get meet goals that give you more skillpoints. All the levels require the same strategy, ultimately - build a tower near your orb, surround it with amps, and push the ""u"" key constantly for a hundred waves or so.This would almost be a good game for casual players, since the main levels are so easy. But there are one or two levels that are so ridiculously hard that they seem impossible even in theory. Avoid this game if you don't like the idea of spending several hundred hours breezing through levels with the exact same strategy, then banging your head against the wall for ten hours trying to beat one of the ""special"" challenges.

												The reason why I'm not recommending this game is simple: You can go hunt down earlier versions on Armorgames or Kongregate (and you should, if you like/love tower defense). Yes, this game has more features, but really the gameplay is very similar between every game in this series. They don't really introduce anything that reinvents Gemcraft. However, with that said, the thumbs up or down isn't helpful with this one, because if you like Gemcraft (or you end up liking the earlier games) you should go ahead and buy this game. While the story is, well, it isn't awe inspiring, it is fairly good for a Tower Defense game. Additionally, for those who love tower defense, this series has pushed the envelope in a scene where the envelope just sort of sits there, in the corner . . . Twiddling its thumbs. So, in essence, if you like the Gemcraft series you should support the developers and this is a way to do it (and it is the only reason I bought the game). Hopefully the next game in the series will not only  push the tower defense envelope but the Gemcraft one as well.			"

While GemCraft has quite the loyal following, the sheer amount of depth and relatively abstract nature of the gem lore and dizzying combination mechanics left me bored. I fault the game for being fairly inaccessible to newcomers, as well as having fairly dated graphics and interface. It just feels old, and not in a good, nostalgic way.While there is apparently metric tons of depth, I found myself quickly moving on to other titles. "

												It's not thaaat bad, I do understand why it's so popular. Still, I can't recommend it, and here come the reasons: - It's just too easy, really. In the 10+ levels I have played so far I have been in trouble just once. There _are_ higher difficulty options, but you have to _unlock_ them through grinding for countless, boring hours. - The active-pause doesn't make this better. Using active-pause in a tower defense is just breaking the game. - The leveling up is ridiculous. Not only do you get xp for things like ""Select an enemy"" or ""Place a wall"", i.e. just for _anything_, but almost all skills are just passive boons not altering the gameplay in any way. - Also, while there are many different types of gems, their effects don't differ _that_ much actually. It really doesn't matter if you do extra damage by having a chance of ""critical hit"" or a chance of ""chain hit"". - While combining the gems does stack effects in synergistic ways, those synergies are ways too obvious, making everything even more simple. So, if you want an epic time sink and some _very_ shallow sence of achievement, or are just a die-hard fan of the genre, you might have fun with gemcraft. For me, it is more like cigarettes: just not enjoyable at the beginning, addictive yet still not enjoyable later on.			"

												This is a very very very simplistic tower defense game, from a 2D top down perspective.  Graphics:  Very poor - top down, fixed resolution, low resolution, it would look bad on a tablet.Gameplay:  Tower defense.  Deviation from the heavily overdone theme is limited - an XP/upgrade system and different damage types.Technical:  It's stable and smooth but it's less demanding than a web browser or an ebook reader.   No customisable graphics settings/controls.There's a lot of tower defense games.  This is a second rate ""me too"" low effort entry.  You deserve better - and there's better free tower defense games than this one - don't give them any money.			"

												This game, although it has a goal and story, is pretty much a sandbox Tower Defender. There are tons of ways to customize the level and difficulty, both before and during the level. It's kind of like an old arcade game, where you're trying to reach the high score and there is no defined ending.Unfortunately, the game does suffer a bit because of it. There's never a need to stop and reconsider your strategy, you can always just go around grinding for exp until you can brute force through the game. The monsters are just walking numbers with hardly any relevant features. The bosses are nice, but you usually don't need any special strategies to beat them, just keep shooting with your strongest gem. The gem types aren't well balanced at all, you always need to go for highest damage output and ignore utility because monsters will get exponentially more healthy as the time goes, but they will not get significantly faster or regen more health or anything that would make you want to use utility gems.This is very unlike games like Kingdom Rush where you have only 4 tower types (can be upgraded into some specialist towers later), huge variety of opponents and only few places to place your towers. In that game, you need build specific things to counter specific enemies. In Gemcraft? Nope, just combine yellow with red and upgrade whenever you can.There are probably some techniques needed to beat endurance (1337 waves I think) or get grade 100 gems, but even then it's mostly about grinding enough experience to be able to do it.The strong point of Gemcraft is all the customization. There's really a ton of ways you can play. But why would you? If you go too far with the difficulty buffs, you're not gonna beat it no matter what. If you go too low, you'll be bored to death. It's hard to find the sweet spot. It never feels like there's a challenge that needs strategy and wit because you can beat everything if you grind for more experience.It's a good time waster when you're tired and just want to get instant gratification by doing nothing.

I highly reccomend if you have any interest in tower defence.			"

												note, I have not sank much time into the Steam version, so this is more of a general review of the game. Pros--Excellent Tower Defense Game-Hours upon hours of fun-Visually appealing-Low Spec requirements-Most polished and refined Gemcraft game to date(should note, this is literally made by one dude as far as I know).-Decent tutorial for beginners. -Very challenging. -Steam version is the best version of Chasing Shadows. Cons--Steam version lacks microtransactions, meaning you have to grind to get Shadow Cores. This admittedly is a grey area.-Price, although worth it at $10, is questionable because I can play it for free elsewhere with most content unlocked via a $5 transaction. The Steam exclusive content is more for end-game people. This is alleviated during sales when its <$5. -(this may only apply to armor games version) game gets laggy with many enemies on the screen.(once again, grey area)-ability to place amplifiers at will is pretty deep into the game. Over-all score 9 out of 10. Verdict- Play it on Armor-Games to get a taste of it, then buy it here on sale.  "

												Calling GemCraft a tower defense game would be like calling the batmobile a car. The basic idea is the same: there are paths that the monsters take to your orb and you have to build defenses to stop them. However, GemCraft has by far the most unique features of any TD game. Let's go through a few of them.-Rather than having a few types of towers with different abilities, you have one tower. Which, upon placing it, does nothing. You need to socket gems in it. There are 9 types of gems, each with their own effects. I hear you think, 'how is this different from 9 types of towers?'. The answer to that is that you can combine each of these gems with other types to your liking. For example, you could have a pure poison gem, that does a lot of poison damage, but mediocre attack damage. You could also make a dual slowing/armor shredding gem, which would both slow enemies and decrease their armor, although both effects will be weaker than if they were in an pure gem. However, the dual gems damage would be higher.-In addition to towers there are also traps, which will enhance a gems specials, but decrease its damage. The final building you can place are amplifiers, which will boost adjacent gems stats and (if the same type) specials.-Your currency, mana, is also your health. When a monster reaches your orb you automatically spend a small amount of mana to banish the monster so it reappears at the start of the path. This makes the player be more considerate about upgrading gems, since too little mana reserve means that a few monsters could destroy your orb.-The ability to anger waves. You can drop a gem bomb on a wavestone, using mana, which will make that wave have more and stronger monsters. However, they will also give more xp and mana! Try to see how much you can anger without getting overwhelmed.-Every one of the ~190 maps can be beaten on 3 difficulties, and with 9 battle traits to increase both the difficulty and xp gain. If certain new maps become too difficult, try going back and beating some older maps with more traits to gain more xp.-There are many ways to play. Grinding is never needed to beat the game, but if you want to grind, the option is there, although it would probably make the rest of the game more boring. Maybe you want to use a bunch of gems that are lower grades, or stick to a single gem that is more powerful You could just play through the story and be done with it, or you could push the game to its limits, seeing how far you can get on endurance.-There are 25 skills that can make you stronger. However, the cost increases with the level of your skills, and skill points also give you some more mana to start maps with, so it is wise not to spend them all.The one and only complaint I have about this game is its horrible preformance. Since it runs on flash it will drop to 1 fps or even less when there are thousands upon thousands of enemies on the screen. However, these situations will only be encountered if you want to push the game's limits. If you are a casual player you will not have any problems with this.GemCraft is one of the best games I've ever played and I would definitely recommend it, especially for tower defense fans: prepare for a game that will change the way you view the tower defense genre! If you're still not convinced you can always try out the free version on ArmorGames, where also the previous 3 games in the series can be found. They're not needed for the story, and the gameplay is far inferior, but you might still want to try them out.			"

												I bought it on sale.  I am a big tower defense fan, but waited for a sale to buy this.  I love it!  Its a very classic style tower defense.  It doesn't include a FPS or other type of hybrid experiance other games offer.  Instead your busy managing buffs and debuffs while the enemy's walk through the level.  There are allot of maps, and there is almost always a new experience to enjoy.  Even after 100 hours I haven't played all the maps or reached max level.  The problem with it is that its sometimes hard to know what map you should play next.  It also has no top scores, which limits the ability to compete with friends.  Lots of achievements, and earning achievements is a major aspect of the game.  I hope they bring more GemCraft games to steam.			"

I played it out to all 419 achievements completed, a couple hundred hours of play. It was even good to play when keeping an eye on my one year old, as it was fun and engaging but easy to pause and easy to handle even with divided attention. A great game folds multiple layers of simplicity together to forge an alloy much stronger than any of its individual components. That's gemcraft. I look forward to more from this developer.			"

												Well, Well, Well. Gemcraft you have become an Executable, and a £4.99 executable at that, which for many of the series followers is a giant betrayal, i am a game designer with a degree in Games Design so i can understand why they made it a pay only game unlike all 4 or 5 previous gemcraft games which By the way if im doing a review im going to be brutally honest. Gameplay - well rest assured this game lives up to the previous Gemcraft games being the next in the series with the story following the same format as the previous games, the evil darkness is trying to get hold of your spirit forge and you need to stop her (i say her, because it clearly states the ""Evil shadows"" are female [possible spoiler]). game play is very similar to the other games however the biggest difference is there are now 2 new gems, the Black and the White, although the previous games didnt have these gem colours their effects were in the games, if i can remember correctly the Black gem is what the Red gem used to be it will get more powerfull the more it hits an enemy, and the white Gem gets more powerfull the more you upgrade your manapool. i will say that the previous gemcraft game gemcraft the labrinth was amazing, and if ""game in a bottle"" make a new game similar and make it cost £4.99 then it should damn well succeed where the others didnt, the map should be  2 or 3 times bigger with more to do on each level. although there is alot to do in each level theres not as many levels or at least it doesnt feel as if there is. The world map is a grid sytem each tile on the grid is a letter of the alphabet with probably 4 maybe 5 levels in each tile, so there are a lot of levels which is good :) but... for a game that used to be a flash game on the internet i was expecting alot more from an executable that now costs £4.99.All in all Still the best Tower Deffence Game out there im just dissapointed that there wasnt more new content that the other free games already did.Verdict -  The game is still very good and i still play it even though ive completed all levels, if you cant bring yourself to pay for the game my advice is go online and play gemcraft: Labrinth for free then if you like that one finish it and buy this new one. it is still worth it, and you never know they might rectify the price sometime down the line :)			"

Chasing shadows is the PC release of gemcraft I have always wanted, expanding on level systems maps, towers, gems, etc. In most cases despite coming from humble begginings as flash games, these games do nothing but improve upon the original flash glory.

												Since I dumped an enjoyable 80-something hours into completing Gemcraft Labrinth years ago, it was a long wait for this title and another long wait for it to get a Steam release (originally on Armor Games). Easily one of the best tower defense games for a number of reasons: variety, difficulty scaling, progression and depth of mechanics. The earlier levels even seemed to be set up in a way to make certain emerging ""low effort strats"" unusable after a while, such as giving a level layout that made chaining poison traps too difficult.My biggest issue is regarding mana-pool gems, as their special property essentially nullifies the shortcomings of having a dual-colour gem, and then some. This is extremely pronounced when stacking difficulty to the point where I found all I needed to finish every level on 50x+ difficulty was a mana-farming trap, crit tower gem and zero-to-any number of slowing traps. Mana-pool gems changed the game too much for me.			"

												It's six months into 2015 and this is undoubtably my favorite game of the year. As an avid GemTD, Wintermaul, and ElementTD player, I can say that GemCraft is the BEST TD I've played yet. Here's why:Mazing in a MapOne of the problems with games like ElementTD was that you were never able to maze. At the mercy of the map players are forced into placing their powerful towers in obvious places. Oh look, there's a bend where my tower is able to get as much exposure as possible, guess I'd be foolish to not put it there. In GemCraft players are allowed, and encouraged, to manipulate the creeps' pathing. On multiple -- and frequent --  occasions the player is presented with a variety of choices as to how they want the creeps to move throughout the map. Not only that but, after you destroy spawning huts (located on certain levels) you're able to dynamically reorient your choke points [the game will warn you if you're trying to 'block' the creeps from getting to your orb] making you pay attention at all times. Gems and Their MechanicsGems come in 9 different types all with effects ranging from slowing enemies to breaking their armor and can be upgraded, combined, and even  spent on making waves harder (more on this later). Unlike towers in most TD games gems can be repositioned without any cost to the player's resource, the only downside is that the gem needs to resocket itself which takes a few seconds. What sets GemCraft outside of traditional TDs is how gems interact with traps, bombs, tower pedestals, wave enhancements, and amplifiers. Unlike most TDs players can place trap slots throughout their mazes. These slots do not block movement and the gems inside trigger when enemies pass over them -- they are not consumed and can be moved to tower pedestals at the player's will. What's interesting is that the damage of the gem is greatly reduced (%80) however its effect is multiplied by an enormous amount. In some maps I never used a tower what so ever, just a lot of traps and some powerful synergy between the game's progression and RPG elements. Tower pedestals are slots for gems that allow them to function like towers. Gems will attack monsters that pass by and inflict their special effects if they can. Pedestals can be placed all over the map so long as they don't block the creeps from the orb (though they can redirect them).Amplifies are placed adjacent to pedestals and increase the damage, attack speed, range, and special effect modifiers of the gems inside the towers. The cost: the gems can't attack. A balance between leveling the primary gem and the gems in the amplifiers is needed for best results.Bombs are essentially consumed gems which a player can drop anywhere on the battlefield. Their damage and effects are increased and help players mop up monsters that pass through their defences. Though I haven't focused on bombing or specializing into it I certainly like the idea of making a skill build that supports their use. Bombs can also be used to enhance incoming monster waves by increasing their stats (HP/Armor) and by spawning more monsters Mechanic: both high and low level gems will increase the incoming wave's stats by a fixed amount that rises the more gem bombs you use to enhance the wave. Higher level gems will increase the monster spawn count by a larger amount depending on level. Confused? Allow me to elaborate.You have a wave that consists of 10 reavers, each with 100 hp and 5 armor. If you drop a low ranked gem bomb (rank 1) the wave will have an additional 2 reavers, instead of 100 hp and 5 armor they will now all have 110hp and 7 armor. However, if you use a high gem rank (let's say 10+) the wave will gain an additional 20 reavers all of which will have 110 hp and 7 armor. If you wanted to you could get the wave to spawn an additional 20 reavers with rank 1 gems however the stats of the reavers in that wave would be ridiculous -- probably 500 hp and 100 armor.So why the hell would you want to fight and kill more reavers?! The trick is that it helps you later on. The added reavers all grant experience and mana (the game's currency and life support) and, if you're demolishing the early waves, can help you stock pile experience and mana for the later parts of the game. In essence the game's difficulty is dynamic and influenced by the player, every wave is as hard or as easy as the player wants it to be. RPG Elements Hooooo!As a player accumulates more experience and ventures through the hexgrid they will gain skill points, skills, spells, enhancements, talisman fragments, and battle traits. Skills are more like talents in that they are all passive. Some of the skills in the game include effects like: gems placed into traps have their special modifiers increased, poison from poison gems is more effective, monsters reward more mana per kill, decreased cost of building and combining gems .... the list goes on and on. The best part: most skills have no maximum level! This seems OP right? Well it isn't. Each time a skill is leveled it requires 1 more skill point to level up: Rank 0 to 1 [1 skill point]Rank 1 to 2 [2 skill points]Rank 2 to 3 [3 skill points] See the trend? There's a catch. For every skill point you don't spend on skills you gain 7 initial mana. So if you had 100 skill points you'd start with 700 more mana. Allocate too many points and you might find that the early waves demolish you. Balance is the key. The only spell I have right now is the freeze spell. Usable anywhere and instantaneously deployable the freeze spell .... freezes monsters. Not much else to say but hey, you can spec into reducing the cooldown of freeze if you like it a lot. I'm sure there are more but I've yet to come across them.Enhancements are temporary, or when used on a trap permanent, buffs that recharge over time and can be bestowed upon any tower or trap on the map. My favorite by far is the beam enhancement which, you guessed it, makes the gem shoot a beam of armor ignoring blazing light to enemies who are within the tower's range. This lasts 12 seconds and can be increased to 16 with enough points (probably more if I spent more points on the skill). Talisman Fragments is the game's equivalent to gear, although much less interesting and impactful. Fragments can be slotted, upgraded, and their effects span from increased damage to reavers (screw reavers ... man) to increasing the player's starting mana. The fragments drop randomly from monsters and have a rarity system. I'm hoping to find some fragments that increase length of my beam enhancement...Battle traits are map modifiers that increase the level's experience multiplier. Often times they make the game harder however, stack enough of them in a single map and you could be pulling in 8 times the experience for each monster slain! Off the top of my hard is a trait that makes waves come faster while another makes giants more resilient (+HP/+Armor) and slightly more mobile. Traits have 7 levels of effectiveness and multiply experience gain by +0.3 (or 30% MORE exp).ClosingSeriously, the game is $9.99 and it's worth every virtual penny. There's a lot I didn't mention about the game including skill synergy, particular gem combinations, and endurance mode. If you're looking for a cross between a TD and an RPG, along with a metric crap-ton of replay value then I urge you to purchase this game. There are very few games that are challenging these days and GemCraft is one that will make you think, pause frequently, and hate yourself for being overzealous -- 300 swarmlings at wave level 10? Yup, shouldn't have dropped that many bombs.			"

												Unlike many tower defense games, where advances and unlocks are just given to you for getting far enough into the game, Chasing shadows has skills and traits unlockable after solving the puzzles for them.  It's a more organic feel  and much more satisfying.  The ability to increase the difficulty of the maps in multiple ways keeps the game fresh, so that even the first level can still be challenging and interesting even when you are advanced in level.

												Although i played several hundreds hours of other Tower Defense games over the last 15 years i never really cared about Gemcraft. Big mistake. After finally picking up the game here on Steam i discovered what i missed out all the years.In terms of variation of towers and enemies the game doesn't offer that much like other TD games and even the graphics look dated. So what makes the game so good?Honestly, everything else. The game combines almost every core feature a TD game should have, but rarely does one single game offer that many.The amount of mazing to do is excellent and not too excessive, ingame options to speed up are super helpfull and make the game more challenging. You always have something to do or think about.I could write a really long review, but ♥♥♥♥ it. If you love Tower Defense games: PLAY IT.If you want a interesting story, stunning graphics and beatiful sound: Get out of here!So far one of the best Tower Defense games out there.  My personal favorit is still Lottery Defense (available for free at starcraft 2 arcade) but this game is probably the deepest TD on steam.			"

It doesn't include a FPS or other type of hybrid experiance other games offer.  Instead your busy managing buffs and debuffs while the enemy's walk through the level.  There are allot of maps, and there is almost always a new experience to enjoy.  Even after 100 hours I haven't played all the maps or reached max level.  The problem with it is that its sometimes hard to know what map you should play next.  It also has no top scores, which limits the ability to compete with friends.  Lots of achievements, and earning achievements is a major aspect of the game.  I hope they bring more GemCraft games to steam.			"

												Pros:+ Very engaging for a tower defense game. You have an assortment of spells that you must use to counteract sudden bursts of strong enemies, which keeps you on your toes. Unlocking new skills requires smart use of these spells.+ Huge amount of content, with nearly 200 maps.+ Very atmospheric with creepy graphical effects. When the antagonist starts showing up, the game actually gets quite scary without ever relying on jump scares. Neutral:o Lots of grinding. If you like power leveling your characters in RPGs, this will be a pro for you.o The game isn't inherently challenging. You have to set up your own mix of difficulty options to match your current level and find a sweet spot.Negative:- Hilarious balancing issues. A strong yellow-white dual gem will have over a million DPS, whereas all other gem types usually only have a couple thousand. Monsters can heal over time, but even bosses only regenerate like 15.000 HP per minute. Your one million DPS uber gem will laugh at this, and gems that cancel out those healing powers are oboslete. A strong poison gem in a trap will deal about 7.000 HP of poison damage over time to every monster it hits - not quite so useful when even the swarmer type enemies have 150.000 HP each.- Higher difficulties hardly strengthen the first wave of enemies, but the rate at which waves get stronger increases dramatically. You could beat wave 60 without any effort, but then get stomped by wave 80 on the same map. This means that you'll just be sitting there for 20 minutes to then see if you can beat the final few waves.- If you use the Chasing Shadows mod, there's huge reliance on RNG. If a Shadow shows up early, its armor is so thick that you cannot damage it and you just die. This adds nothing to the game, it just means that you have to restart the map until no Shadows show up for the first 5-10 waves.In the end, the pros still outweigh the cons, especially because most of these flaws are related to high-level play and will not be relevant to you before you've already more than gotten your money's worth out of this game. It's still one of the most entertaining tower defense games I have ever played.			"

Also the way that you can use walls to path the monster is really great. The different powers are varied and feel powerful without feeling overpowered. Plenty of levels, progression, etc. My own gripe is that my progress from the flash version cannot be transferred over.			"

												Excellent tower-defense. Very complex but accessible, with a lot of content: you can play it for hours and hours.To make your mind before buying, you can also find previous versions of the game in flash on free game sites.			"

												Awesome game. Been addicted to the series for a while and Steam selling it is pretty awesome. One complaint:I max out the trait to add 7 shadows to each map. 100+ waves. So...why in the hell do I consistently get 2-3 shadows within the first 2-6 waves? Honestly, that's ludicrous. It's like an RNG for an instant lose. (Cue the ""Lrn 2 Play"" people) It should be random, and not structured, because that's part of the challenge. But there really should be some sort of control. Minimum wave before the first shadow, or minimum wave between shadows, or maximum number of shadows per number of waves. Something to make 107/7 not equal 3 more often than not.This is a pretty minor complaint in the grand scheme of things though. You are not obligated to activate that trait. But it's still something that irks me. Definitely not a dealbreaker though. If you like TDs, this game is solid.			"

												As always from this series of games, a very solid piece of work. Decent storyline, good progression through levels, skills and  the talisman feature, tons of replayability, nothing extra to pay for and potentially hundreds of hours of game play.The only thing that should hold you back from buying this game is whether you are a fan of tower defence style games, even then I'd still advise you to give it a go as it's probably the best and easiest to get into of the genre and at a more than reasonable price you can't really go wrong.

												GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is an outstanding tower defense game that's one of the more stimulating ways to kill time.The main gimmick of this series is that your towers are sockets for gems, which are the source of your attacks and can be switched between towers as well as fused to combine their special effects.The game has very complex mechanics, but it doesn't feel overwhelming as they're introduced one by one and many are optional. It's a lot of fun to get accustomed to new abilities or structures, and the game is only punishing if you want it to be.Aside from common features such as custom targeting, fast-forward (up to 9x), mazing and calling waves early, there's many unique concepts, lots of different structures to keep things diverse, and the ideas from previous GemCraft games have been vastly improved.Slightly annoying: demolitions are costly and limited even in the preparation phase, so if you make a mistake with wall building you may have to restart and build everything again.Chasing Shadows' main problem is that it runs on Flash, so there's no linux support. For a flash game it runs well though, lag is only an issue at extremely high levels.There's a lot of content. The large amount of maps is supplemented by custom difficulty modifiers and the option to continue each level in endless mode. On sale, the amount of playtime you get for 2€ is just ridiculous.			"

While I preferred Gemcraft: Labyrinth, each one has enough going for it to be worth a play if you are at all interested in the genre. Levelling, difficulty modes, all sorts of strategies and ways to try and break the game or at least game the system. I look forward to the next installment.			"

												I picked this up expecting nothing much, I don't even like tower defense games, but I got a lot more than I expected. This is really a pretty engaging and fun game with more options and more involved gameplay than even the trailer makes it seem (unfortunately not a very great endorsement for the game there.) You have six types of structure, nine types of gem, and every gem types can be mixed together to produce different types beyond the basic ones across several levels of gem strength which all adds onto map positioning, bombings (just throwing gems at things instead of socketing them), enraging waves, early calls, and other mechanics. I expected a pretty dull time waster but Gemcraft put a lot of tools on the table here and made every new map feel different than the last and a fun challenge to find out how to make sure you survive past the last wave...And then you can even hit a button when you finish for a no risk continuation of infinite waves to see how well your setup actually would fare past what it needed to which usually results in a horrible failure 15 minutes into but awards you with extra experience for the effort. Oh and did I mention the skills, spells, and talisman systems? Those are nifty too. The game even rewards you for NOT spending experience so just about everything is a choice you're making between one of several options, even deciding to spend experience. This isn't a perfect game but it's a pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good one. The graphics are really poor, Flash is still Flash, and you'll have heard your fill of sound effects and music in the first few hours easily but what it does do it does it too well to dock it too much for that. It's MUCH better than the cost would lead you to believe too so give it a shot.			"

												As someone who played every entry in the GemCraft series, i was little disappointed at first, at one point in the Game everything starts to feel like a grind, most levels aren't difficult, just build your little beat it all setup and call waves early and upgrade you area of death. It gets more difficult as you unlock more difficulties, but personally i recommend people to play it in Iron Wizard mode, less options, no going back to get stronger, just more streamlined and just the right amount of challenge.

												Probably the deepest Tower Defense I've ever played. If you look up things like ""GemCraft gem weaving"" you'll see the  depth. It's a numbers game for the hardcore, and it rewards anyone willing to invest that much effort by utterly breaking down at high level play, which ultimately, isn't that what you kind of want if you're into that kind of stuff?The only thing that was kind of disappointing was how little strategy is actually involved in placement--you don't want more than 1 or 2 gems on the whole field, and the game got much, much easier for me when I finally cottoned on to stop trying to carefully place and upgrade gems with effects and just funnel all the mana into one beastly mixed super gem and then march everything past it. Not that that's bad, just not what I was expecting from Tower Defense--this game is about crafting, wave management and spells. It's also a huge game. 25 hours in and I still don't know how big the map is. In short, fun wave defense for the casual, with a bit of a wall for those in the wrong mindset, and lots and lots to do for the hardcore.			"

												One of the best tower defense games I've ever played.  There are so many other aspects to this game that you really have to think about some of the levels (some not so much) and there's a lot of ways to play some of them.  With the extra features, it's a game you can play for a long time and still be seeing new things.			"

												Most reviews for this game don't do it justice. After a certain level you only start counting damage or mana as an exponent. E80, E90, E100. Even with a high end computer, games can take more than a week of play to finish.This is one of few games that really does scale to insane levels.			"

												I am tempted to call this the ultimate TD game. It's a TD game that everyone looking for a new TD game should pick up and try. It has numerous levels. It has interesting upgrades. It has a good amount of grind that is made interesting by a variety of valid strategies. It has interesting and unique concepts. But there is one thing that really sets it apart from other TD games: there is a highly mathematical late game that has spawned a community of math heads searching for the perfect gem. At a certain point the game isn't any longer about beating the levels. Instead it is about coming as far as possible in an endurance run, using the most cost efficient gems and deploying your strategy in a way that minimizes lag while stile allowing you to farm the enemies with mana gems (=gaining currency). Suddenly everything happens in orders of magnitude.The lag is the only downside really. It is a flash game originally, and at some point you start sending continuous waves of enemies with increased speed. This kills the fps. So playing an late-game endurance run is kind of a nerd thing. It can easily take 5-10 hours and it requires maintenance.But it's a great TD even without these endurance runs.			"

												Graphics wise, this looks like a flash game, but gameplay wise this is one of the most in depth tower defence games out there (If not The most). Gemcraft is about creating really powerful gems (towers), and how amplifiers and diffrent types of gems complement eachother,and detouring the enemies' path. The leveling system is really nice too. I highly reccomend if you have any interest in tower defence.			"

GoodA tower defense closer in style to the old mods for WOW3. Flexible placement of towers, traps, amplifiers, and walls. Skills, player level system, drops (talismans, shadow cores), battle traits (difficulty/reward enhancement), enraging waves, and 3 difficulty per map gives this game plenty of playtime. The flexibility in difficulty and the risk/reward of harder traits make the chance for better talismans a thrill. BadI did find the main storyboard to increase toward the end and requiring playing through old maps on the harder difficulties (xp + flat skill addiiton for completion) to complete the later maps. I did not enjoy the one time maps labeled ""V"", they are not required but the lack of the bonus skills/talismans made them too hard. The low fedlity did make some of the assests hard to spot and it did have some poor optimisations (low cpu/gpu use) for the large enemy counts. The tower damage and enemy health did not seem to line up, eg 2M enemy health and a tower doing only 19k and the number of hits displayed are not enough.			"

												Awesome game. Been addicted to the series for a while and Steam selling it is pretty awesome. One complaint:I max out the trait to add 7 shadows to each map. 100+ waves. So...why in the hell do I consistently get 2-3 shadows within the first 2-6 waves? Honestly, that's ludicrous. It's like an RNG for an instant lose. (Cue the ""Lrn 2 Play"" people) It should be random, and not structured, because that's part of the challenge. But there really should be some sort of control. Minimum wave before the first shadow, or minimum wave between shadows, or maximum number of shadows per number of waves. Something to make 107/7 not equal 3 more often than not.This is a pretty minor complaint in the grand scheme of things though. You are not obligated to activate that trait. But it's still something that irks me. Definitely not a dealbreaker though. If you like TDs, this game is solid.			"

												As always from this series of games, a very solid piece of work. Decent storyline, good progression through levels, skills and  the talisman feature, tons of replayability, nothing extra to pay for and potentially hundreds of hours of game play.The only thing that should hold you back from buying this game is whether you are a fan of tower defence style games, even then I'd still advise you to give it a go as it's probably the best and easiest to get into of the genre and at a more than reasonable price you can't really go wrong.

												Very well made and addictive tower defense game. High quality and very challenging. Needs some rebalancing and maybe some of the mechanics could be more interesting. Especially gem combining - could it be less focused on calculating the best possible combination sequence? Sometimes it feels like a Maths degree is needed to properly beat the game, since combining the same gems in different order may give different results, which felt surprising.Anyway, very recommended game, which can give hours of enjoyment. Can't wait to see what mysteries the next part of the campaign will reveal.			"

												Bought this game on sale for (I think) 2.5 euros, and I have spendt over 250 hours with it. The best thing about this game, IMO, is the initial progression, where you progress in game to unlock diferent skills and new tower types. This might last for a while, but eventually you will start developing mana farms and killing areas and turn the game into a grind fest (harvesting experience and items can lead to a field taking over a few hours). Not so cool.HOWEVER, during this process, you will unlock the Iron Wizard mode. Here, your skill progression is limited, you will need to make trade off regarding the skills you use, and the game does not suffer from this grinding fest (as much anyhow). Basically, because the benefits you get from unlocking each field is a one time boost. Of course, as you progress, each field will take more time, but this increase is somehow limited. This last mode is excellent. Expect a though challenge though.			"

(note upgrades only increase a towers look and numbers). Also, you can place your towers nearly anywhere! I support buying this game for as much as 10$.			"

												This game is so cool!!!This is a Tower Defence game with plenty of elements.The basic idea is to build tower with different type of gems. The gems could be combined into mixed gems with lower attact but inhert multiple special powers.There are more elements than tower.Mana: Could be regard as money and healthy.Trap: With very limit attact and range, but enhanced special power like armor reduction, posion, etc.Spell: Enhance tower for a while or give special permanent power to Trap; Freeze monstor; ...Skill: Ability to reduce cost, increase attact permently.Fragment: Enhance the ability.....There is also a story, and many many archivements. So COOOOOOOL!!!!			"

												Amazing tower defense game. Too many TDs are watered down I feel, but this one retains that hardcore minmax feel that the TDs of old (WC3 Customs anyone?) had. Incredibly addictive, incredibly fun, so much to unlock, even after 50+ hours I'm still unlocking stuff and new levels. There's tons of incentive to go back and redo levels, and heaps of depth in general. Highly recommended - the best TD on Steam for sure. Carries with it a long legacy - gemcraft stemmed from its first iteration on Newgrounds.			"

												GemCraft was a franchise I found on Armorgames way back when in 2012. I always enjoyed it for killing time with TD was a hobby of mine. Allows you to restrict the path of enemies and combined 9 different gems to make custom towers as well as traps.Loads of different maps, low resolution but honestly that helps due to the amount of enemies.Fun TD game, summer sale of 2016 £1.39 totally worth.

												Addictive Tower Game that is more than just another gem game. Don't let the title confuse you - there is no need to have played the prior versions of this game to jump into this one.  Further, there is much more mathematical and stats depth to this game than what I initially expected.  You can really self-modify this game (don't confuse this as a software mod, I am referring to modifying settings and difficulties in-game).  There are many different ways to earn bonuses via the stratified difficulty settings by category and type.  The variables are so many - each playthrough of this game could become very unique.  This is like RPG meets Tower Game.  Admittedly, I am satisfied especially with the 75% off sale price during the current Steam sale, so if you're waiting for a similar price point, it comes around.

												It's a great mix of everything that makes tower defense games addictive. It's got challenge, it's got tons of different possible properties and attack patterns for your towers which it also lets you mix and match at your leisure, it's got space for all kinds of tactics, from the more conservative to the high-risk-high-reward, all-out assault, the difficulty can't only be adjusted when selecting the stage, but even in the middle of the game itself by choosing to (and being rewarded for) speed up the spawning of monsters or make them stronger for a period of time, and these are just a tiny part of the game's selling point: writing them all on such a tiny space would do them no justice.A definite 10/10.

												If you enjoy tower defense games, this one is absolutely worth picking up. It's got some fun story/lore mixed in with the exploding monsters and magic gems and surprise attack ghosts. Gameplay is solid, music is great too.If I had a criticism of any kind it would be the shadow cores. They used to be a premium currency, but are simply an in-game resource in the Steam version, and that would be great except that they still drop at approximately the same 'frustrate you into buying them' pace of most free-to-play games. (There may be methods of speeding up their production in the mid-late game that I haven't reached yet.) The mechanics that use them aren't vital, nor do they really subtract from the game, but it's a minor background frustration for me. For the record, my 'time played' stat on Steam in incredibly misleading, because I bought a copy of this game on Armor Games when it was released purely on the strength of a prequel game (which I'd also purchased) and between the two I've easily played 600 hours, probably more.8/10 overall, 10/10 for value in the hours of entertainment vs. dollars spent sense.

												Amazing tower defense game. This is the 4th in the series (first on Steam).The story is told through pages written in your journal as you complete stages. There is a lot of time inbetween story elements and you're given very brief paragraphs, but for a story to have so few words it truly is epic. The title layout is ingenious as you can infer some of the story from it.

It doesn't hunt to support the creators either!As for the game, it is one of the best series of tower defence games you will find. The only low points would be the slighty laggy interface (at times) and the graphics not being High-Res HD stuff.

Also the game gives you such a wide assortment of ways to make the game even harder if you want. Or you can just spend hours playing through the game without bothering with it.			"

												3/5 This is a great game and a great example of both the genre and this series. What I like about GemCraft overall is that the different gems lead to a surprising amount of complexity in the game without having 100 different kinds of towers like other TD games. HOWEVER: The major drawback to this game is that the late game is all about getting thousands of mobs onto the map and then it lags out extremely. I finally quit after WL 9000 because I got tired of a single map taking 3-4 hours to get 55 billion points. I know most of this comes from running on Flash/Air, but the overall game mechanics of late game obviously push Flash well past the breaking point, or at least the fun point.			"

												SHORT ADVICE:If you are new to gemcraft just go play the previous ones first - they are legitimately free on the web. (why below)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW:For some reason I liked Chapter 0 and The Labyrith better...Maybe its because they don't explain things properly in this one...1. How da heck to hit things with bolts.2. How to play the other mods of the maps. (You know you light up one orange dot in ? what about the empty holes)3. How to maximize your earnings per level? (it was pretty clear before, summon that much, call this much early, do a chain of that many. etc etc.Basically navigation and explination at least to me is a downgrade from previous games.The color of some gems has changed for whatever absurd reason.I like the series - but the beggining of this one is getting on my nerv constantly. Maybe it gets better when i unlock more stuff. I feel like punching someone in the face because of it.OVERALL:If you were ok with the previous ones there is enough to go around with this one. Perhaps they were rushing a release and needed to cut corners - who knows. If you haven't played em - as I said go play em - they are free.Othwerise - it is another gemcraft. There are some improvements to controlls but you'll likely be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to appreciate it too much.Honestly even with the annoyances these people have deilvered good content plenty of times to earn my money regardless. Not many games can offer you that much playtime at that price tag.			"

												It's six months into 2015 and this is undoubtably my favorite game of the year. As an avid GemTD, Wintermaul, and ElementTD player, I can say that GemCraft is the BEST TD I've played yet. Here's why:Mazing in a MapOne of the problems with games like ElementTD was that you were never able to maze. At the mercy of the map players are forced into placing their powerful towers in obvious places. Oh look, there's a bend where my tower is able to get as much exposure as possible, guess I'd be foolish to not put it there. In GemCraft players are allowed, and encouraged, to manipulate the creeps' pathing. On multiple -- and frequent --  occasions the player is presented with a variety of choices as to how they want the creeps to move throughout the map. Not only that but, after you destroy spawning huts (located on certain levels) you're able to dynamically reorient your choke points [the game will warn you if you're trying to 'block' the creeps from getting to your orb] making you pay attention at all times. Gems and Their MechanicsGems come in 9 different types all with effects ranging from slowing enemies to breaking their armor and can be upgraded, combined, and even  spent on making waves harder (more on this later). Unlike towers in most TD games gems can be repositioned without any cost to the player's resource, the only downside is that the gem needs to resocket itself which takes a few seconds. What sets GemCraft outside of traditional TDs is how gems interact with traps, bombs, tower pedestals, wave enhancements, and amplifiers. Unlike most TDs players can place trap slots throughout their mazes. These slots do not block movement and the gems inside trigger when enemies pass over them -- they are not consumed and can be moved to tower pedestals at the player's will. What's interesting is that the damage of the gem is greatly reduced (%80) however its effect is multiplied by an enormous amount. In some maps I never used a tower what so ever, just a lot of traps and some powerful synergy between the game's progression and RPG elements. Tower pedestals are slots for gems that allow them to function like towers. Gems will attack monsters that pass by and inflict their special effects if they can. Pedestals can be placed all over the map so long as they don't block the creeps from the orb (though they can redirect them).Amplifies are placed adjacent to pedestals and increase the damage, attack speed, range, and special effect modifiers of the gems inside the towers. The cost: the gems can't attack. A balance between leveling the primary gem and the gems in the amplifiers is needed for best results.Bombs are essentially consumed gems which a player can drop anywhere on the battlefield. Their damage and effects are increased and help players mop up monsters that pass through their defences. Though I haven't focused on bombing or specializing into it I certainly like the idea of making a skill build that supports their use. Bombs can also be used to enhance incoming monster waves by increasing their stats (HP/Armor) and by spawning more monsters Mechanic: both high and low level gems will increase the incoming wave's stats by a fixed amount that rises the more gem bombs you use to enhance the wave. Higher level gems will increase the monster spawn count by a larger amount depending on level. Confused? Allow me to elaborate.You have a wave that consists of 10 reavers, each with 100 hp and 5 armor. If you drop a low ranked gem bomb (rank 1) the wave will have an additional 2 reavers, instead of 100 hp and 5 armor they will now all have 110hp and 7 armor. However, if you use a high gem rank (let's say 10+) the wave will gain an additional 20 reavers all of which will have 110 hp and 7 armor. If you wanted to you could get the wave to spawn an additional 20 reavers with rank 1 gems however the stats of the reavers in that wave would be ridiculous -- probably 500 hp and 100 armor.So why the hell would you want to fight and kill more reavers?! The trick is that it helps you later on. The added reavers all grant experience and mana (the game's currency and life support) and, if you're demolishing the early waves, can help you stock pile experience and mana for the later parts of the game. In essence the game's difficulty is dynamic and influenced by the player, every wave is as hard or as easy as the player wants it to be. RPG Elements Hooooo!As a player accumulates more experience and ventures through the hexgrid they will gain skill points, skills, spells, enhancements, talisman fragments, and battle traits. Skills are more like talents in that they are all passive. Some of the skills in the game include effects like: gems placed into traps have their special modifiers increased, poison from poison gems is more effective, monsters reward more mana per kill, decreased cost of building and combining gems .... the list goes on and on. The best part: most skills have no maximum level! This seems OP right? Well it isn't. Each time a skill is leveled it requires 1 more skill point to level up: Rank 0 to 1 [1 skill point]Rank 1 to 2 [2 skill points]Rank 2 to 3 [3 skill points] See the trend? There's a catch. For every skill point you don't spend on skills you gain 7 initial mana. So if you had 100 skill points you'd start with 700 more mana. Allocate too many points and you might find that the early waves demolish you. Balance is the key. The only spell I have right now is the freeze spell. Usable anywhere and instantaneously deployable the freeze spell .... freezes monsters. Not much else to say but hey, you can spec into reducing the cooldown of freeze if you like it a lot. I'm sure there are more but I've yet to come across them.Enhancements are temporary, or when used on a trap permanent, buffs that recharge over time and can be bestowed upon any tower or trap on the map. My favorite by far is the beam enhancement which, you guessed it, makes the gem shoot a beam of armor ignoring blazing light to enemies who are within the tower's range. This lasts 12 seconds and can be increased to 16 with enough points (probably more if I spent more points on the skill). Talisman Fragments is the game's equivalent to gear, although much less interesting and impactful. Fragments can be slotted, upgraded, and their effects span from increased damage to reavers (screw reavers ... man) to increasing the player's starting mana. The fragments drop randomly from monsters and have a rarity system. I'm hoping to find some fragments that increase length of my beam enhancement...Battle traits are map modifiers that increase the level's experience multiplier. Often times they make the game harder however, stack enough of them in a single map and you could be pulling in 8 times the experience for each monster slain! Off the top of my hard is a trait that makes waves come faster while another makes giants more resilient (+HP/+Armor) and slightly more mobile. Traits have 7 levels of effectiveness and multiply experience gain by +0.3 (or 30% MORE exp).ClosingSeriously, the game is $9.99 and it's worth every virtual penny. There's a lot I didn't mention about the game including skill synergy, particular gem combinations, and endurance mode. If you're looking for a cross between a TD and an RPG, along with a metric crap-ton of replay value then I urge you to purchase this game. There are very few games that are challenging these days and GemCraft is one that will make you think, pause frequently, and hate yourself for being overzealous -- 300 swarmlings at wave level 10? Yup, shouldn't have dropped that many bombs.			"

												This is a great new approach to tower defense games.  There's a ton of strategy required to play.  Thankfully they also offer opportunities to increase play difficulty (with added rewards) for folks that are pretty good at this sort of thing.  Thus both newbs and adepts alike can enjoy the experience.Performance can be a little laggy at times on my rig (i-7 920, 12 GB RAM, GTX 660 Ti @ 4K), but that may be just because I'm pushing things out at 4K on this decrypit machine.In any regard, it's tons of fun, quite playable and well worth the money.  I can see myself spending probably 100 hours with it and I'm already 22 hours in.			"

												Probably the deepest Tower Defense I've ever played. If you look up things like ""GemCraft gem weaving"" you'll see the  depth. It's a numbers game for the hardcore, and it rewards anyone willing to invest that much effort by utterly breaking down at high level play, which ultimately, isn't that what you kind of want if you're into that kind of stuff?The only thing that was kind of disappointing was how little strategy is actually involved in placement--you don't want more than 1 or 2 gems on the whole field, and the game got much, much easier for me when I finally cottoned on to stop trying to carefully place and upgrade gems with effects and just funnel all the mana into one beastly mixed super gem and then march everything past it. Not that that's bad, just not what I was expecting from Tower Defense--this game is about crafting, wave management and spells. It's also a huge game. 25 hours in and I still don't know how big the map is. In short, fun wave defense for the casual, with a bit of a wall for those in the wrong mindset, and lots and lots to do for the hardcore.			"

												I dunno about this one. Seems like it's more of an exponential number-based skinnerbox than a tower-defense game.Maybe the meta of figuring-out how to optimally farm experience points *is* the point of the game, but I found it rote and boring after a while. And after watching a bit of high-level play, my hunch that you'd fundamentally be doing the same thing for dozens of hours and devolve into exploiting the same strategy over and over again seem to be pretty spot-on.That, and I doubt I'm the target-audience of these style of games, as I tend to quickly get bored of games that try to hide repetition behind exponentially-increasing numbers.So, meh. The game's not for me.			"

												This is by far one of the best tower defence games I have ever played and Im glad it came to steam. There is a steep learning curve but there is also the most fantastic community I have seen for any TD game ever.The system is the most complex I have ever seen in a TD which may not be to anyones tastes but if thats not your cup of tea you can still enjoy this game and keep it simple.The late game is (again) the most in depth I have ever seen for a TD game and hardcore TD fans will find much to keep them busy. The story is fantastic ( I suggest playing previous incarnations on a browser just to follow the story) and the graphics are cool and a bit more serious than the more fun, cartoony TDs out there.I know Im saying the most ever etc, but Im not exaggerating. If you know of a more in depth and complex TD game, send me a message and I will literally suck the words out of the screen and damn well eat them.Reason for review change and thumbs up:Since the game has been updated it seems much of the early game lag has been all but eliminated. I have tested by going to endurance mode and calling all waves to have around 2k monsters on screen, then pausing and holding shift and enraging waves. This no longer causes the gamebreaking lag that plagued the steam version which has brought me back to play and made me very happy.			"

												Simple in design, complex in gameplay. This tower defense variation skips the fanciful, colorful graphics that some great games have to offer but offers much more engaging gameplay through the strategies that you devise. Much of that burden relies on how you handle the ""crystals"" that you learn how to manipulate throughout the game. However, the game still includes the typical fare that you would recieve from other tower defense games, such as a plethora of maps to conquer, multiple skill modes, etc. In addition, many of the perks and boons that you recieve for advancing your gameplay are achieved through RPG experience points through the character you play.I bought this game for a mere $1.99. As far as I can see, the challenge has just begun and there are over 400+ achievements to be won. Give this title a shot!			"

It reminds me alot of old Starcraft: Brood War-esque TDs with a mix of SC2 Gem Tower Defense minus the randomness, and there are many, many, many different maps that are all beatable and replayable in countless ways.

There are enough mechanics to keep you actively focused on what is happening with your towers, the monsters, and the orb you have to protect, you can lay out paths (or deal with what you're given, in some cases), and the game is legitimately challenging. Even after ""completing"" the game by story standards, there are a hugeeee number of achievements, extra difficulties and traits to figure out, and a lot more interesting things to keep plugging away at.

												Solid, if unimaginative tower-defense mechanics. Everything you'd expect to see is here: building towers, walling-off enemies' paths into serpentine mazes, upgrading your defenses. GemCraft has an simple and intuitive take on tower design.  Gems provide the stats for each tower. You can swap them in and out of towers, upgrade them, and combine them for increased effects. All of this takes place while managing your mana pool. Mana is gained passively and from destroying monsters, then used to create gems, towers, walls, traps, etc. The economy of this system is rewarding for those who like to micromanage but no so punishing as to discourage experimentation. Outside of each level, you can unlock new skills to improve various aspects of your experience or hold onto those skill points for more mana at the beginning of levels. This trade-off is a nice change of pace from blindly allocating points as soon as they become available. In addition to skills, enemies may drop glyphs which can be socketed in to a grid and upgraded, providing further customization and buffs. Additionally, traits can also be found that are used to increase and customize the dificulty of  any level. Did I mention the levels? There are so many. A great deal of content is packed into this game.The only area where GemCraft is lacking is in the graphics and presentation. The entire game has a semi-gothic, old-school vibe similar to Diablo or any other notable RPG to come out the 90s. This style may appeal to some, but overall, the look of the game isn't very memorable.			"

												This is probably my favourite tower-defense game, like, ever.The controls are really easy to get into, and unlike with some TD games there isn't a massive learning curve you need to go through in order to complete the game. There are TONS of achievements, which can be off-putting for completionists, but achievements are handed out fairly regularly so it always feels like you're progressing. The gem combination system also means that regardless of your defense style there's a way to play to your strengths. Although there may be flashier games out there, nothing beats a game with solid mechanics.I think there are free versions of this game online, but the paid version is honestly worth it once you get into the end game. I would definitely recommend the investment.			"

												This game takes the tower defense genre, and makes it  all that much better.  You are presented with your lane, and several gems which contain different powers and damage ratios.  From there, you must devise an effective defense strategy.  This game truly must be played to be appreciated.  There is a free version available on the dev's website, so that yyou may try this game before you buy it.  It is well worth every penny.  I bought it on sale during the Holiday sale, and out of all the games I purchased, this one is hands down the best of the lot.			"

												I have played all the versions of gemcraft and they become better and better. Gemcraft Labyrinth was perhaps equal to this one. I played the limited free flash versions. So I picked this up on a bargain and played with access to all the elements of the game, and it is nearly poorer than the limited version. And I am sad to give it a negative review. For these reasons:It's strong suit is that you can scale the difficulty quite well by cranking up the challenge. However if you get good at it you end up with getting to big of a reward for this and with the added bonus you get from things the pay version it soon becomes to easy. You advance way too fast and nothing becomes more of a challenge than you make it and even that becomes hard after a while. By playing skilled through maybe a third of the stages you can easily just click ""send all"" on the rest of them and finish them in seconds, if you like.The above would be fine if you could actually scale the challenge up, but can't because it lags really bad after a certain point. My rig isn't the best of rigs, but it plays worse than the web browser flash version. So at some point you start not play the best you can, but rather at how you can avoid lag. Which only works so far before that also more or less breaks down because even that becomes easy.Then it is the graphics itself, I kind of expected this to be scaleable so that it would render to any screen resolution. It doesn't, so if you go full screen (which increase lags) it is gets grainy and blurred.If you have never played it and it is a bargain I can recommend it for the time you spend to learn it, which is enjoyable and less laggy. Also if you have played previous free versions and wanna throw Game in a Bottle a few coins. And maybe the iron wizard mode is enjoyable which cranks up the challenge by removing some of the things that made the series great.			"

												Probably the best tower defense you'll ever play. If you remember any of the old days of playing Gemcraft on sites like Kongregate or Armor Games, this will be a great throwback for you as the Gemcraft formula is back and only better.The game's unique approach to tower types makes it all the more fun and GIAB has even managed to work what the equivalent of boss fights are into a tower defense game. The maps are numerous and plentiful, and definitely justify the modest price tag you see above.The challenge fields and the ability to bump up the difficulty as you please in the game helps keep manners entertaing even after the main game has been beaten. Overall, I'd *completely* recommend this game to anyone who's even enjoyed a tower defense game before - I'm confident you won't find a better one out there.			"

												Played the previous gemcraft games on armorgames.com. I created my armorgames account, just so I could earn the achievements for gemcraft.When I saw GemCraft - Chasing Shadows on steam I had to have it! On the moment of writing I finished the story line and got 38 hours on record. I will probably get 200+ hours in the coming months.In my opinion when it comes to Tower Defense, this is THE game franchise you must get.Pros/features:- very deep gameplay- good storyline- learning new strategies even after 50 levels.- skill point system makes it scalable for each level if you get stuck- loads of achievements, of which some you will mostly reach just before defeat (and with that not earning them)- 9 different towers of which the effects can be combined- allows for additional upgrades of tower without upgrading the tower itself (amplifiers)- you can construct traps and walls- you can throw bombs- wave control - by sending next wave early or anger coming wave with bombs- each level is a different puzzle wherefore you'll need different tactics and strategies- 3 difficulty modes - difficulty traits with different adjustable levels- static upgrades/improvements via talisman fragments which can be collected by playing levels- wide variety of enemies and wave types (25+ combinations)- six different spells to use during a level- 4 speed modes which can be changed during gameplay including pausecons:- got a message that adobe air crashed (game kept running though)- can become very laggy when there are a lot of objects on the screen, no matter your GPU "

												It's a great mix of everything that makes tower defense games addictive. It's got challenge, it's got tons of different possible properties and attack patterns for your towers which it also lets you mix and match at your leisure, it's got space for all kinds of tactics, from the more conservative to the high-risk-high-reward, all-out assault, the difficulty can't only be adjusted when selecting the stage, but even in the middle of the game itself by choosing to (and being rewarded for) speed up the spawning of monsters or make them stronger for a period of time, and these are just a tiny part of the game's selling point: writing them all on such a tiny space would do them no justice.A definite 10/10.

												This is by far one of the best tower defence games I have ever played and Im glad it came to steam. There is a steep learning curve but there is also the most fantastic community I have seen for any TD game ever.The system is the most complex I have ever seen in a TD which may not be to anyones tastes but if thats not your cup of tea you can still enjoy this game and keep it simple.The late game is (again) the most in depth I have ever seen for a TD game and hardcore TD fans will find much to keep them busy. The story is fantastic ( I suggest playing previous incarnations on a browser just to follow the story) and the graphics are cool and a bit more serious than the more fun, cartoony TDs out there.I know Im saying the most ever etc, but Im not exaggerating. If you know of a more in depth and complex TD game, send me a message and I will literally suck the words out of the screen and damn well eat them.Reason for review change and thumbs up:Since the game has been updated it seems much of the early game lag has been all but eliminated. I have tested by going to endurance mode and calling all waves to have around 2k monsters on screen, then pausing and holding shift and enraging waves. This no longer causes the gamebreaking lag that plagued the steam version which has brought me back to play and made me very happy.			"

												Solid, if unimaginative tower-defense mechanics. Everything you'd expect to see is here: building towers, walling-off enemies' paths into serpentine mazes, upgrading your defenses. GemCraft has an simple and intuitive take on tower design.  Gems provide the stats for each tower. You can swap them in and out of towers, upgrade them, and combine them for increased effects. All of this takes place while managing your mana pool. Mana is gained passively and from destroying monsters, then used to create gems, towers, walls, traps, etc. The economy of this system is rewarding for those who like to micromanage but no so punishing as to discourage experimentation. Outside of each level, you can unlock new skills to improve various aspects of your experience or hold onto those skill points for more mana at the beginning of levels. This trade-off is a nice change of pace from blindly allocating points as soon as they become available. In addition to skills, enemies may drop glyphs which can be socketed in to a grid and upgraded, providing further customization and buffs. Additionally, traits can also be found that are used to increase and customize the dificulty of  any level. Did I mention the levels? There are so many. A great deal of content is packed into this game.The only area where GemCraft is lacking is in the graphics and presentation. The entire game has a semi-gothic, old-school vibe similar to Diablo or any other notable RPG to come out the 90s. This style may appeal to some, but overall, the look of the game isn't very memorable.			"

Place gems to kill monsters, upgrade them, combine, drop them on the monster's heads, drop them on buildings, make them boost eachother, place them in the traps, etc. There are also skill and lvling systems. Game looks nice, nothing fancy but it doesn't really matter as it's tower defense game. Music is very climatic, suits the game very well. Highly recommeded for any TD fan out here.			"

												GemCraft is an interesting beast, and if you like tower defense, then this game is for you. That is unless you like having your hand held through the process. This is a game that commands your understanding before you can succeed, and unless you're planning out your skills and utilising your talismans, it can quickly get the best of you. As far as I have seen, this game offers a wealth of replayability, with the ability to go back to any map you've completed and play it with difficulty-increasing modifiers, and also just harder difficulty levels, not to mention an ""Endurance"" mode. Ultimately you could spend a tons of hours just work through the levels, and it's a greatly soothing game to play when you just want to chill.			"

												I'm not a big tower defense guy.  I liked ""Plants vs Zombies,"" but that's pretty much it when it comes to this genre for me.  So when a friend from work kept saying, you have to try Gem Craft, and that he put over 200 hours in, I finally gave in and gave it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  The game isn't pretty to look at, but wow is it fun!  I was looking at trying a quick 10 to 20 minutes, since that's how much I usually give these types of games, but holy crap, I was already an hour in before I realized it!!!And therein lies the problem.  The game is addictive!And that's a problem for me, because I have a very addictive nature.  I forced myself to stop playing this amazing little game, because I know it would become my weekend.  Will I revisit Gemcraft?  Sure!!!  But if you do have an addictive personality, especially with video games, beware!  It will suck up time!  Great Game!!! "

												Yet another GemCraft game and it brings new elements to play with. Even so players must know about the older games and thire story to make sense of the games sorry. Skill tree has expanded even more and it gives room for new player and older players. Ability to unlock new skills and towers gives more of the challenge realy seperates this game form older ones (especially from GemCraft Labyrinth). Talisman ands it's pieces give more of the re-play value for collecting better pices. Overall great game Score 9/10. Recommeding this game for everyone who wants to play simple yet challenging TD			"

												If you played the hell of the online free game at some point, like me, and wondering if to get the paid steam version, the answer to your question is - YES.This game is simple and fun, and as hard as you want to make it. It has a great and unique mechanic that encourages replayability, and not in the annoying way. This game is what you get when all the fluff is stripped away and mechanics are perfected till they sparkle. Seriously, the retention levels are crazy, just look at the achivements distribution, things that take many many hours to get are achieved by 30-40%~ of the owners. GG			"

												Unlike many tower defense games, where advances and unlocks are just given to you for getting far enough into the game, Chasing shadows has skills and traits unlockable after solving the puzzles for them.  It's a more organic feel  and much more satisfying.  The ability to increase the difficulty of the maps in multiple ways keeps the game fresh, so that even the first level can still be challenging and interesting even when you are advanced in level.

Beating the game once is great, beating it again on the higher difficulties is cool, kitting a ridiculously high level and smashing scores intot the billions of billions and seeing all the games numbers shown as exponential notation is beyond satisfying.

												If you love Tower Defense this game is right for you. I love this TD. I played it so much I don't remember. Started on Labyrinth and I can say I'm not bored after tons of hours of playing this. Avesome game. You can upgrade so much things, and if you have done with whole map you can just play edurance and reach awesome Wizard levels. Only one thing I am missing right now is chance to buy other types of games in game. So you have for example just mana and poison. But...It's just harder and that doesn't matter for me. (Edit: probably I am just not enough high level to have them all xDDD )Anyway I'm happy it's on steam and I finally can support developers. Great TD game. From me 11/10			"

												GemCraft is probably the best tower-defense game right now.I played all the games of the series and I must say, it developed fine.In the game you have to face hordes of monsters and defend your wizard orb (which is your anchor).To do this, you can craft and use the nine different gems and you can also combine them!There are also spells that can enhance your gems or attack the enemies directly.In some maps you'll find special buildings that either support you or the enemies.There's also a story about a being trying to destroy the world with the monster hordes.The only bad thing I found about this game are the almost unchanged graphics from the flash version.But the rest of the game is really amazing.

It gets more difficult as you unlock more difficulties, but personally i recommend people to play it in Iron Wizard mode, less options, no going back to get stronger, just more streamlined and just the right amount of challenge.

I don't know when ill beat this game, but judging how i've unlocked 20 tiles (most of which containing 5-7 maps) and i haven't seen the other side of the board, i wont for a long time. That said, I hope it never ends. However, I'm still giving this a 9.5/10 because of V21. ♥♥♥♥ V21.			"

												GemCraft is a great game!!!  If you enjoy tower defense, RPG, or strategy, this is a great game to dive in to with tons of value.  In fact, it feels like an RPG with the layers and layers of upgrades and leveling up.  The achievements are fantastic and have in game relevance.  Crazy good value, especially when it goes on sale.  I was a tad overwhelmed early on, but once my experience level began to rise (don't be afraid to gem bomb wave stones or call them early to gain experience) and I earned spells, I got on a roll that was hard to stop.  Great game, that I can not recommend enough.  Can be played intensely or zenly.  Ok, zenly isn't a word, but you get the idea.  Point is, it's flexible.			"

As a wizard I imagine my storyline as a sort of 3rd person Omnipotent with my consciousness hovering above the world, enchanting gems and warping the battlefield to my varied whims.  Gemcraft does get difficult, but with an skill system and equipment you can always find another way to win.  The strategy of maze building adds the element of nearly infinite replay for alternate pathing and tower placement.  This is the direction TD should be going.			"

												The best tower defence at all.Pros - Tons of variables to custom your stile - You can edit the difficult (and consecuently rewards) in a lot of different ways includind buffing enemies in the middle of game.  - Because of the last two the game has a lot of replayability. It's almost mandatory play older stages to level up, BUT, each time you replay, you improve your score so there is no way to get 'free' levels play a stage over and over again. - Long game. Lots of hours.  - You have all the stats so you can do the math to analize dps or strategies if you like. Cons  - Late in the game there will be so many enemies in map that the game will be slower.

												GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is arguably THE tower defense game to play. Well-balanced with fair challenges.GemCraft is my favorite Tower Defense series because of how involved the player must get to succeed in progressing through the games. GC-CS is particularly involved, adding more content to test the player's ability to devise level strategy. The story is well-integrated into game mechanics. The skill tree is balanced. The level difficulty scales well.Some characteristics worth noting:-GC naturally discourages grinding because only the best performance on each level is counted towards XP. About midway through the game it becomes possible to farm XP, but a lot of strategizing has to be done before that.-Unlike many other TDs, structures are not limited to set positions on the level, leaving more options for the player.-The concept of combining gems (defenders) for combinations of abilities gives even more options for strategy.To developer: Please release the rest of GC on Steam eventually. Gotta have it all together.			"

												SHORT ADVICE:If you are new to gemcraft just go play the previous ones first - they are legitimately free on the web. (why below)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------REVIEW:For some reason I liked Chapter 0 and The Labyrith better...Maybe its because they don't explain things properly in this one...1. How da heck to hit things with bolts.2. How to play the other mods of the maps. (You know you light up one orange dot in ? what about the empty holes)3. How to maximize your earnings per level? (it was pretty clear before, summon that much, call this much early, do a chain of that many. etc etc.Basically navigation and explination at least to me is a downgrade from previous games.The color of some gems has changed for whatever absurd reason.I like the series - but the beggining of this one is getting on my nerv constantly. Maybe it gets better when i unlock more stuff. I feel like punching someone in the face because of it.OVERALL:If you were ok with the previous ones there is enough to go around with this one. Perhaps they were rushing a release and needed to cut corners - who knows. If you haven't played em - as I said go play em - they are free.Othwerise - it is another gemcraft. There are some improvements to controlls but you'll likely be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to appreciate it too much.Honestly even with the annoyances these people have deilvered good content plenty of times to earn my money regardless. Not many games can offer you that much playtime at that price tag.			"

												After the first hundred hours, I still feel like I'm not even halfway through this game.  Well built Tower Defense game -- arguably the most solid one I've played.  While the graphics leave something to be desired, the replayability and massive amount of customization possible make this game nothing short of addictive.The best part, for me, has been being able to reset traits and bonuses you've earned entirely, and even between fields.  This feature has significantly decreased the amount of grinding that one sometimes needs to do in order to advance in a TD game.  However, even grinding doesn't feel like the right word -- playing the same field on a higher difficulty, or with newly defined gemstone parameters, makes the field suddenly feel like a new game, with new challenges.  And with better than 100 fields, it never gets old.Get this game if:  You are a tower defense fan, even a casual one; You enjoy puzzles and strategy; You like a lot of playtime for the dollar input.Do not get this if:  You need maximum use of your videocard; you dislike grinding to level up, even a little bit; You require roleplay elements in your game at all.

												I played the flash version before the Steam version, so I am more experienced than it may seem. The game is more than just a classic Tower Defense, as you create and upgrade the gems that power the towers as well. This is a good idea for someone who is looking for a TD game that is more involved and, perhaps, feels more high-stakes.You earn experience and ""shadow cores"" when you play, so that every game, you are progressing in the game. In fact, lots of progression is available, which creates high replayability and allows plenty of exploration in your different skill sets and ""talisman"" (which is like a set of perks or bonuses) choices. The game is huge and nearly endless, which I view as a bonus, because you can never really get bored, with special modifier ""traits"" that can increase the difficulty after you've beaten the original level.If you're looking for a game into which you can put many, many hours for lots of replayability and a high difficulty cap, this is a great game for you!

												GemCraft - Chasing Shadows is one of the many web-based TD game ""GemCraft."" But before you turn this down as 'another web game that is a waste of money to get on steam,' the game has, in my opinion, the best mechanics any TD game could ever have. The 'Gems' are more customizable than any other game I've ever played. The game itself can get repetitive but there are special levels that will change your game plan every now and again. Recommended.			"

												I bought it on sale.  I am a big tower defense fan, but waited for a sale to buy this.  I love it!  Its a very classic style tower defense.  It doesn't include a FPS or other type of hybrid experiance other games offer.  Instead your busy managing buffs and debuffs while the enemy's walk through the level.  There are allot of maps, and there is almost always a new experience to enjoy.  Even after 100 hours I haven't played all the maps or reached max level.  The problem with it is that its sometimes hard to know what map you should play next.  It also has no top scores, which limits the ability to compete with friends.  Lots of achievements, and earning achievements is a major aspect of the game.  I hope they bring more GemCraft games to steam.			"

Peek around in the discussion forums and elsewhere online and you'll see. The end game is rich--like watching Youtube videos and ready formula-heavy strategy guides rich. Absolutely worth the price.			"

												tl;dr : Super fun TD with a simplistic approach but a lot of depth.Extremely fun and addictive TD game with a simplistic (but super efficient) approach. You can always be challenged more. And you can always progress.Just 3 monster types but many modifiers. And enraging. And occasional special monsters (flying ones). And beacons to take care of. And things to destroy. And special objectives to unlock skills and traits.Just 9 gem types but all the combinations are possible. And they do different things in towers, traps and amplifiers. And you can also use them as bombs. Or to enrage waves for more challenge.The game is simplistic but never boring thanks to a lot of variation in what happens, what you need to do (apart from building towers), and what you can do.Dozens of levels, very cool ""spell crafting"" mechanic, very customizable and rewarding difficulty system, hundreds of achievements (which give a bonus so you're motivated to get them). All the systems (looting, crafting, talisman, skills, environments, achievements, traits, gem bombs, enraging, towers/traps/amplifiers, flying ones, beacons...) everything is well designed and smart. And the game is still interesting even after you played hundreds of times because it's never the same thing twice, and by increasing the difficulty you are always challenged.I'm almost 400 hours into the game and I'm not done. I haven't even finished every map on every difficulty setting. And I even have a few achievements left to unlock.What other game can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours for that price ?			"

												This game is an amazing tower defense game that has a unique combining two towers to make a new one mechanic. I used to spend hours playing this game back when it was a browser game, now that it has a proper Steam release & doesn't suffer from any of the stutter or performance issues that the browser version had this is a must get! If you played the browser version of that game you will also notice that the Steam version has a few various updates to it.			"

												Awesome game. The storyline is a bit wafer-thin, but the gameplay has loads of depth. There are quite a variety of equally viable strategies to choose from and tweaking the level settings to increase the difficulty to suit your skill level is easy and well-rewarded. You can also stick around after the level has 'finished' to face a neverending horde of supercharged badguys for bonus points. The interface is great, the controls are relatively simple and intuitive.			"

												GemCraft: CS is easily one of the best tower defense games I've played. Highly addictive, challenging, an immense grid of levels to beat, and very clever gameplay mechanics (gem combo formulas) make this a must-have for tower defense fans.			"

												I loved this game ever since finding the second iterarion online, when I found it on steam I knew I had to buy it. My one game idea Id like to see them work on is perhaps a 3d puzzle that has highways so your playing top down with multiple levels, perhaps even having to build towers that need to be made taller. Im not saying this would work but may be cool idk just throwing it out there. Love this game and cant stop playing it lol.			"

												I've played a number of tower defense games over the years, but never seriously. I thought it was just a genre full of fairly generic, brief diversions. None of them seemed to be serious games. None had any real depth. After an hour, you'd seen everything the game had to offer.With GemCraft - Chasing Shadows, that hour will give you just the briefest glimpse of what the game has to offer.This game has so many fantastic and innovative concepts brilliantly intertwined that it's hard to even know where to begin to describe it. Just covering the individual features like the amazing trait system, which allows you to tune the difficulty for increased XP gains, or the deep skill system, which give you the ability to tweak the power level of every tool at your disposal each game, or the wide array of gems, each with unique characteristics and the ability to combine with others, will not come remotely close to doing the game justice.GemCraft - Chasing Shadows combines all of these elements and many more in a seamless whole. Every single part of the game is smoothly intertwined with others. Leveling gives you skill points, which tweak your gems and spells, which define your towers and play style. All of this is impacted by fragments, allowing you to further tweak your build and play style. Even getting achievements is tied into the game by giving you skill points!Even with everything I've said, so much was left uncovered. This game is crazy with content, all of which is fantastic. It even has an interesting story! This is not your usual tower defense game. It's the pinnacle of the genre. If you don't play this game, you are doing yourself a tremendous disservice. Buy this game.			"

												First Ill start my reccomendation with the bad.The frames can drop to like 2 - 4  if you have a lot of monsters on screen. it doesnt use the gpu at all and is still powered by flash like the browser version. Long story short, the only way to gain mad exp in this game is to bring huge amount of monsters on screen and kill them but the engine cant handle it.which really pisses me off, but for what I paid, I feel like I got more than my monies worth out of the game which is a great tower defense game, just with technical limitations. Very enjoyable game so Id still recommend.			"

												Very addictive. Starts off easy,  then before you know it, nothing else matters. This game is a good buy. I got it for cheap from bundle stars. I didn't even know I liked these type of games! A must buy!			"
