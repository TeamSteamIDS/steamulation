												Ah, Braveland. It's hard to know what to say about it. It is not a bad game. I'm tempted to call it good. But I'm not going to do that, and I wouldn't recommend it to people.At $4.99, Braveland seems reasonably priced. On sale, it might even sound like a steal. But you're going to get a few hours out of it, and there's nothing remarkable about those few hours.There's nothing really awful about Braveland. The graphics are slightly unnervingly Fisher Price, but they're effective and the backgrounds look nice. There are only a few songs, and they sound competent and appropriate. The interface is fine. The mechanics are... well, balanced and kind of standard for this kind of game.So what's the problem?There's not much depth to the battles, and there's not much to it besides battles. You pick up a modest variety of classes, and can bring up to five with you: archers, healers, knights, scouts, etc. Their roles are fairly obvious and they do them well enough. But you can really use whatever combination you want, and the gameplay won't change much at all.The story is... well, the dialog is spelled and formatted correctly and does tell a pretty straightforward story about soldiers, bandits, villagers and the like. No one really says anything very interesting, but the conversations are short and inoffensive. The most personality you get out of the game is that bandits are dime-a-dozen jerks, and your peasant friend is a bit of a coward. There's a hero, who doesn't actually fight, and annoys me a little to look at him strutting around the world map as though he's helping. Technically he provides stat bonuses to the rest of the team by leveling up, but he mostly just speaks for the team and collects power-ups.There's no real replay value to the campaign, but there's a Survival mode where you can play battle to battle, losing characters and buying new ones, and see how far you get. I played around with it a little, and it might add a bit of life to the game if you wind up loving it. So, there's a bit of hope for getting more play out of the game at least.I have played a lot of Flash games in my days, on sites like Newgrounds - RPGs, tower defense, strategy games, action, etc.. Braveland feels very much like one of those games. The look, the feel, the length, the design choices and the options the player is given. Indeed, I feel like I've played Bravelands many times already. Except usually, when I play this kind of game, it's free. Often, it's also got something more novel or fun about it.Normally, it's probably not good to get lost in the weeds talking about free vs. paid gaming in a review like this. I guess all I'm saying is, Bravelands is a dime a dozen kind of game that you see all over the internet, and even if it's got a bit of polish and isn't awful, it's hard for me to justify anyone spending their money on it. For a few dollars more, there are lots of really unique, memorable games on Steam.If you just want to blow through some clean and simple RPG battles for a few hours, you probably won't hate this game. If it looks like it might be really awesome, it's not. It's just not. Look at the other reviews. A lot of the positive reviews say that it's short, it's easy, there's not a lot to it, it would be good for kids, etc.. Hardly ringing endorsements. If this game were getting 1 to 10 ratings instead of Yes or No, I don't imagine they'd be all that high. Nobody really loves this game. Everyone just agrees it's okay. If you want an okay game, buy Bravelands.			"

												I'd say it's exactly what you can see on the screenshots. Not so sure about ""old school"", feels more like a phone game with the on rails movement, very simple and clean interface, and it's definitely not as deadly as the old school games I remember. Playing on normal, if you walk into something too hard and lose your entire army, you get to keep the army anyway and the poor men collect some gold for you to reinforce so you can try again. It's entertaining enough for €4, but not much more. I'd say buy it if you're bored, like this type of games and want something new. Not a must have in the game collection by any means.			"

												Cool little turn-based strategy. Something like a mix of Heroes and a fairy tale.I enjoyed playing it, but unfortunately there are some minor problems.First of all, the game has absolutely no replay value. 5 hours is enough to beat the game on hard level of difficulty.After that you don't really need nor want to play it again. Secondly, there are limited amount of fights, so leveling system is really poorly made. Same with gold, you just can't farm and earn as much coins as you would like. For example, there is achievement to buy all skills for your units. I noticed that achievement just before the last fight with 500 gold on me. Last upgrade costs something like 1500 gold. So i had to sell one of my equipment to achieve it. Pretty stupid, isn't it?Another problem is with AI. Computer doesn't really know what strategy means. For example it does not protect ranged units and is trying to kill my healer first, even if it would last for ever.And well, there are not many units available unfortunately. Also absence of Dragons makes me sad :(Anyway, it is a cheerfull game which will give you fun. The price is not so high also, but i would suggest waiting for a promotion or get it in bundle.			"

												Small cartoonized game based on hard soil of ""King's Bounty"" and ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" and originally made for smartphones. Contains easy short linear campaign for wanna-be-knight with ""they burned my village"" motivation... and sometimes-challenging survival mode.Is it worth buying? Well, yeah, especially if you get one of those 75-90% discount coupons. Steam cards for this game are quite high, so you have a chance to get more money than you paid. Other good thing for a game collector is simple achievements. With some basic planning and skill you can get all 21 in 1 walkthrough, which takes from you approx. 3 hours.Overall - not of great value, not a mustbuy, but looks nice, adequately priced, and have some chances to challenge you for a short time. 8/10.PS: I get it as present from Bear, so I'd like to thank him one more time there! Спасибо!			"

												Fun game, but too short.I finished the story in 5 hours and in that time I unlocked all the units and bought all the best equipment.  The game was simply too short.  Its slow at first, but opens up nicely once you unlock all the units, then the game ends shortly after that.There is no grinding to earn extra gold to get better gear or more units.  Its a causal game with almost no replay value.Overall the sound quality and ""cute"" art, make up a nice little strategy game.  Would probably be great for someone new to the turn based strategy genere, but veterans will find it lacking.I do recommend this game at a discount price.			"

												If you like Heros of Might & Magic style games - you'll love this short intermission of a game.  The first thing I thought of when I played: This would make a nice introductory game for those wanting to get the feel of those TBS games like Age of Wonders, HoM, Kingss Bounty etc.. It is simple, yet keeps you going. The story is just for show, as there is no development. Controls, like the game play, are very linear. Music, although repetitive, is not annoying. Adds just the right amount of ambiance.   But sometimes simplicity is the key to a great game. And for $4 - it's a good addition to any startegy lovers library. "

												It's not a bad game even though I don't recommend it. (Edit: I recommend The Banner Saga instead of this if you're looking for a casual turn based tactic/strategy game. The battles in that game are more satisfying and the story is more interesting.) It's an okay game. The reason I don't recommend it is because it's too short and too simplistic. It's a turn based tatical/strategy game that needs little to no tactics or strategy. If you have a strong team, you will win without problem. If you don't, good luck. It's too simplistic to apply any tactic or strategy. It's a casual game with an appealing art style that you might want to play when you are tired and not in a mood to play something that needs too much attention or energy.			"

												Braveland is a turn-based strategylike game. We get a small linear map where you will encounter enemies and you need beat them on a classical, hexagonal battlefield. The village of our hero was robbed so he will try to get back all the resources what required for the survival of the village as winter is coming. Of course, the story dont stop there, our hero find more conspiracy behind that robbery.This game is not long, could be finished on hard difficulty in 4hours. This game dont gets anything new to the gaming industry, not a revolutinary game. BUT...I bought it on sale, so was only 1eur+few cents. definetly worth that price, 1/10 value of a movie ticket and twice as long entertainment.i like to get achievements while playing and this game have some. additionaly, developers of this game are not retard, they added achievements what you will get on your playthrough not like in other 4hours games where they add not understandable achievements like play game for 100hours or kill 50k enemies while you will get like 1-2k in one playthrough.Game is very entertaining. These kind of games could be repetative after a few hours but in this case the game ends before you could have that feeling and while you progressing toward the end there will be something new in each battle: New enemies, new abilites, new troops.achievements difficulty: 1/10price-value ratio: 9/10			"

												Braveland is a very casual TBS. It's a good game to play in half hour intervals. It also provides a solid 5-7 hours of gameplay. I'd say that's a plus for the pricetag.The game's battle system isn't very deep and it's clearly designed for casual players. Despite this, it manages to throw heavy (yet short-term) consequences for playing badly on hard mode. The game has a small element of resource management wherein the more efficient you play, the more money you get to keep. If for example you play terribly on hard mode, you'll end up earning less gold (you'll have to pay more to replenish your party). The battles are finite so you can see how this can affect you. Luckily there's a way to earn gold in case you mess up. Be warned though that the other method is pretty boring.I went in expecting a casual experience and that's exactly what I got. The only thing I can really complain about is that window mode was not part of the option menu.4/5. Not bad!			"

												This isn't a deep RPG with complex strategies and agonizing decisions. What it is, however, is a fantastically fun tactical turn-based gem. A bit more linear, it follows the recipe of titles like Faster Than Light and boils the genre down to it's essence. Fight, improve your team, and take on bigger baddies.  Oh yeah, and find or buy a little loot along the way.  After a long day of work when you just want to play and not have to think too hard, this is a great addictive way to kill some hours and destress a little. Highly recommend. For $3.99 US you can't go wrong.			"

												You liked Heroes of Might & Magic? Or perhaps King's Bounty or Age of Wonders? Stripped of all city management, you basically just have the turn-based combat. Braveland takes this and adds a big, friendly smile on every creature.It presents you a cute, classic storyline: a happy farmer boy loses his family and farm to bandits and sets out on a bold journey for revenge, but it turns out there is something more sinister going on and the happy guy wants to deal with it. He travels around and beats up the bad guys who take the hits with permanent crooked smiles on their faces. At first the dialogue attemps some meme-based humour (arrow in the knee anyone?), but they are quickly discarded for cheerful, repetitive greetings and taunts.Travelling happens on a board with enemies, stores and events in each tile. It's linear, though you can (and should) check every branching road for bonus items, gold and experience points. Gold gets you more troops and items, experience gives small bonuses to creature stats and increases the cap on troops.While I only played the hard mode, combats are easy for a player familiar with turn-based strategy games. Combat AI does not offer surprises in neither good nor bad ways, so it's okay. There are only 7 different types of troops to buy and around the same number of different enemies with upgraded versions of the usual ones coming later into the game. Basically all of them also smile all the time.Why, I even lost one battle! Being vastly out-numbered, my troops collected their pocket money and gave it to me to hire more troops for another try. Happyland would have been a more appropriate name for the game.In conclusion, Braveland would probably be a nice introduction to turn-based strategy games for children or people not acquainted with the genre. For the rest of us it's just a small snack (it lasted ~4 hours for me) that gets a dusty taste towards the end. Get it on sale.			"

												Braveland is a fun little strategy RPG where you play a guy who's village was destroyed and he's out for revenge. You have a overhead map you move around on going from point to point. Each point either has an enemy, friendly, store, or treasure.You can buy and find or buy gear to increase your attacks, and defenses. You will also earn specials that can be released after being hit so many times. Each special costs a different amount and can be pretty helpful at times. As you progress through the map you will come across friendlies who will join up with you. You'll get help from knights, archers, and healers for example.When building a team for battles they give you a point system. Each unit stack costs a certain amount and your max points to use is 15. So for example farmers costs 2 points per stack and archers are 3. Then after leveling up your main character you will be allowed to recruit more people per unit stack. This way when you go into battle you would have like 15 farmers per stack, 10 archers per stack, and so on. Enemies may only take some damage or may wipe out a few people from the stack. After each battle you are given exp points and gold. Then if you lost people you get charged a certain amount to revive them. I played the game on easy considering I have a ton of games to play and really want to clear out some backllog. It has a cool little story and was fun to play. I finished it in about 5 hours. Braveland is definitely worth playing.			"

												Recommended at a discountThis is a very easy casual turn based strategy game. If you  are new to the genre then this is a game to get you started. If you are looking for something with more gameplay elements or are a veteran of the genre than you should avoid this game at all costs.The game consists of you moving and attacking enemies on a hex based grid. Some units have special attacks that need to be recharged every so often. After every battle you are awarded gold and xp. Gold is used to buy more units or items that give you a small passive bonus to your defense or attack rating.  Achievements are also really easy and in a couple of hours you can get them all.   "

												It's like the King's Bounty games (good) if they were really short and super dumbed down for iOS (less good). I can't say it didn't amuse me, but it's pretty bad, and super short - 3.7 hours to completely beat it with 20/21 achievements (screw To Arms!) and all fights completed, so in the end I can't really recommend it even at the really low $5 asking price.I guess you can get it if you're hard up for games like King's Bounty and you've already beaten The Legend, Crossworlds, and Warriors of the North, don't want to play (more) Legions, and aren't QUITE hard up enough to play the Ascension to the Throne games or something.

												Cute little turn based tactical game. Fairly basic tactics and quite repetetive but it's fairly brief and it warranted getting to the end. There's a little scope for varying your army build, you basically get 15 points with each unit type being worth from 1 to 5, and there being 7 units to choose from once you've unlocked them all. Over the course of the game as you level up you can purchase extra forces, and basic items that improve your skills. Again this is very simplified and you may as well just buy the most expensive (i.e. best) stuff. I found the heaviest tank unit to be woefully underpowered compared to the crossbow unit, especially with the power up triple shot action that the crossbow guys have, and the tank is also very slow, and can be tricky to position to get the best from his power up skill of attacking all surrounding hexes.I'm pointing out what could be considered flaws here but I did enjoy playing it, and it was never intended to be a heavy thinking game anyway. The quick battles are neat and the constant stream of new stuff being just a few minutes away keeps you interested. This is a casual, easy playing game that you could easily beat over the course of a week on your lunch break.			"

												A casual turn based strategy game with some RPG elements.  Even at its toughest level, the game is still perfect for casual gaming.  The graphics are flash like animations, the music is decent, but most importantly the game is fun.  You start with a small recruited army and as you move forward through the map you will encounter new enemies, new recruits, and new items to increase your stats.  Every fight will get you gold and experience.  Gold can be used to purchase more recruits and the experience can increase your stats.  What makes this game casual is not the fighting, you will definitely need to know how to fight in a turn based strategy game.  What truly makes it casual is that when you finish a fight, the gold received from winning the fight is automatically used to revive your dead troops from the previous fight.  This means that typically, unless you get your butt kicked, you will maintain a stronger and stronger army as you move through the map.It is not a very long game, and there are two other games to continue the very forgettable storyline.  If you are looking for a simple, yet entertaining game of this genre, I definitely recommend it.			"

												This is a strategy-RPG game, like a Heroes of Might and Magic. Well, at least regarding the mechanics of the game.You can buy different kinds of units (melee, ranged, magic) with both basic and special attacks, and you have to fight lots of ennemis on a map with hexagonal cells. Winning a fight will give you money and experience. With the gold, you can buy units and pieces of equipments for your hero : they will boost your entire team and grant them special bonus.There is a total of 7 different units, and you have a restriction of 5 different units per battle plus no more than 15 stars total (best units are 5 stars, so you can't have 5 different units if you want the best ones).Your hero have some special powers that can be activated with Fury (not sure about the name in English since I played in French) : you will get this ressource if one of your unit is getting hurt by an ennemy. You can equip up to four pieces of equipment : an armor, a weapon, a hat and a belt.But sadly, that's it : compared to the same kind of games (HoMM or even King's Bounty), there is nothing more in terms of gameplay. Sure, this game may have been created aiming at specific people, but it looks a little bit too simplified.Graphics are the kind I like, so that's great for me. But there is not that much content : you have to choose between 3 difficulties at the beginning of the campaign (Easy, Normal, Difficult), and you can adjust it while playing the game (not during a fight, just between them). I did complete the campaign mode firstly on Easy then on Difficult : each time, it took me only 3 hours to defeat the final boss, clearing all of the ennemies on the global map. There's also the Survival mode (you have to survive 10 fights), but that's it.If you've already played this kind of games, I suggest that you might just go on Difficult mode from the beginning, because it's not even that hard. Moreover, you'll be able to unlock 100% of the achievements within one walkthrough.To put it in a nutshell, if you are looking for a HoMM-like game that is easy to complete within an afternoon (3 hours for the campaign, no matter which difficulty you choose), I guess that's a fine choice. The current price (4,99€) seems a little bit high, but if you can get it in a bundle, well, it should be okay.			"

												Have you ever played a King's Bounty game?Yes?This is the same thing, except simpler, shorter and everybody looks like Playmobil figures.No?Read on!Braveland is a strategy game where you lead a band of fighters on a quest to stop the person that wrecked your village.Battles take place on a hexagonal grid where a single cell can contain any number of units of a specific class. So if you have an active party of 76 farmers and 24 archers you'll see 2 units on the field. One for the farmers, one for the archers.Units take turns based on their speed stat and will move up to and/or attack the enemy.This all sounds quite nice, and tactical turn based combat was what drew me to this game in the first place.However, the game is very limited in scope.There are ~12 classes in the game, of which ~6 are recruitable. They're almost all human, and rather lacklustre. It doesn't help that the art style makes everybody look bland and uninterested/uninteresting, truly like Playmobil figurines.Progression happens on a world map, where each node is an event or a battle, and these progress roughly linearly (there are short branches that lead to minor upgrades every now and then). Battles can not be replayed.All in all the whole game seems to lack passion.None of what it presented managed to surprise or engage me.The plot went nowhere, the upgrades, spells and allies you gain don't really change the basic formula in any way.There's nothing wrong with the game, but I don't think you should play it.

The gameplay is not deep or strategic; the concept is more like endure longer than the enemy rather than strategize and defeat them. The game is only $5 but it's more like something I would play on my phone. It's not something I would recommend as a purchase on Steam, or for any kind of night in.			"

												Well, it's a simple mobile port turn based hex grid strategy rpg game (wow). It's not bad, it's not great either... do not expect much and you could find yourself having some fun. For a low price (I got it on a bundle), it's a very pleasant surprise and was nice to kill some time at work playing it (don't tell anybody). Solid little game.			"

												Fun small casual game with easy mechanics, good tutorial and a linear story. It's a charming mini version of Heroes of Might & Magic just without the building (town development) aspect. Around 10 enemy types and allies, most with a special skill to be unlocked (purchased) as you play. A huge plus is that after each fight you don't have to restock on soldiers but rather you have automatically gold deducted from the reward to ""revive"" your wounded army. Instead, you purchase soldiers as your hero levels up and you gain more slots. I wish there was more weapons/armor available, but other than that skill variation and stat variation is decent. Appropriate price tag.			"

												Braveland is like... A child's first tactical RPG. It introduces all the basic concepts of positioning and knowing how each unit interacts with one another while remaining simple enough to master inside of ten minutes. Being something of a TRPG snob from ""back in the day"", I find the game to be refreshingly easy, even on the hard difficulty.The graphics are a colorful and fun hand drawn style that helps mark the game as somewhat laid back. The story, while simple, touches on many of the overarching themes found in more complex titles and does so in about five hours, which is well worth the $5 price tag. All-in-all, I would recommend the game unless you want to play something hardcore like Final Fantasy Tactics.			"

												Braveland is a turn based strategy for beginners to the genre.  There is a bonus given for losing battles to encourage players to never give up.  Healers are more effective as offensive casters.  There is all the sheer basics that make up a TBS, but nothing more.  If you are a beginner, or you want to introduce your children in to the genre, or you really want a game that is easy to max out achievements on, give it a shot.  If you are looking for a solid challenge, you're simply not going to find it here.Edit: Since my last review, I decided to play it all the way through in all the different modes.  Hard mode wasn't much different than normal, but did offer a little more boosted enemy AI.  Failure still pays out.  Survivor mode was actually a fair challenge.  Unit death is real, and you have to buy units between battles.  This gets tricky, as they only offer specific units for sale between each battle.  This makes healers imperative, but also puts a huge target on their head.  The longer you last, the bigger bonus they will give you next time around.  Survivor mode also cuts out all role play, which speeds up the game drastically.  Even with survivor mode, the game simply isn't as tough as the Heroes of Might & Magic series, which I would recommend to those who found this game too easy.			"

												Braveland is a turn based RPG game and in my opinion worth the 5$ because in my mind a game worth 1$/hour and i played 5.6 hours to complete it at 100%. The music is perfect but there is only 1 or 2 of them in loop. I played hard mode whole time at the begining it was really hard losing half my money to repair my armies but when you do upgrade your armies the game get easier and easier. The graphics are 2D but with cool colors. The story is fine . This game is a one way for the mission because they are in a straigth line. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5Sorry if my english was bad and i hope you will enjoy this game Melovia			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|+|Braveland is a turn-based strategy game which mixes the style of casual mobile and traditional tb strategy games.Good:Nice graphics and music. Enjoyable battles and progression. Traditional units with a little bit of a unique approach. Some good improvements to previous titles.Bad:Pretty much straightforward gameplay: battles cannot be replayed, grinding is not present, not enough choices. Tactical combat is not deep enough.Overall, I recommend Braveland to anyone who wants to play a strategy game which can be played in small bursts.

												The game is very straight forward. each unit does it's job and you basically do your best to minimize your loss while taking out enemy units. The special skill each unit have should be used as quick as possible whenever the cooldown is finished, I see very little purpose holding onto them whenever they are back up.pretty simple game, so far I haven't encounter much difficulty. Hopefully it picks up...you do have to spend your gold wisely since there are no farm spots for gold. You get gold by defeating your enemy in fights and if you lose units during the fight some gold is automatically deducted to recover those units. So less casualty = more gold at the end of the battle.GOLD is the only resource that you can spend, so you either expand your unit's life by filling up whatever your capacity for each unit is or go for hero items that gives global benefits, you as the captain can only equip 4 items that have global benefits.The combat get's repetitive quickly...And you as the captain don't actually get to fight, you serve as a passive unit that gains experience so you can upgrade stats that affect your squad.TL;DR - TBH 5 dollars is a bit expensive for the amount of depth it provides...

												Eh, the translation is wonky and the combat is simplistic. There's not a lot to recommend for most gamers here. It's probably a good game for the casual mobile phone market, but this isn't going to test your tactical expertise, and it isn't going to win any prizes for the storyline.Braveland is essentially a story one man's 'roaring rampage of revenge' against the EVULZ empire that came and sacked his little village. And he does it by telling other people to fight for him! Clever clogs! So you pick up some villagers, some trackers and other generic units and just go from place to place fighting battles, where you smack the enemy and they smack you until one of you runs out of numbers to smack with.It is that simple. Even on hard, there is little challenge provided, seldom any mechanics to speak of, and most dialogue go the way of ""ooh look at that simpleton with an army behind him, let us strip him naked and sell his stuff for money"" followed up with ""No way guys, let's kill them all!"" and you slaughter them.

												This is my review for Braveland ; (6.5/10)Storyline: The storyline is dull and unintresting (atleast for me) it's one of those turn-based basic games, where it's focused on the combat and character elements rather than on the levels of story.You get to move along the map while meeting friendlies/enemies and having this typicall ""chat bubbles"". I just skip those lol. (2/10)Gameplay: Unlike the aspect of the story, the gameplay itself is enjoyable for a turn-based strategy game.  (8/10)1- Character Elements -@You can view each character's information which include: health, damage, defence , range of movement and number of turns. There is also a description of character abilities and what it's capable of (stunning/magic damage/healing etc)@Level System: You level up by getting exp (obviously) by defeating and winning enemies. @Main Character: You buy more units or upgrades with the coins you get, you can't upgrade your units and however, you cannot fight with your main character (you only fight with your 'squad' aka your units)2- Combat- The combat is fun and easy. You get tips in the start of the game to understand the basics, and then you will just get used to the combat and know what to do.There are some points however, where you will have to move forward and fight weaker enemies instead of trying to beat an overwhelming enemy squad because your squad is not strong enough (which makes the game challenging.)Gameplay Styles: (5/10)3 Difficulties (Set to Easy/Normal/Hard)Easy is too easy , Normal is challenging enough and Hard oh well, it's for those of you who want to hit your head in the computer in order to win each match even if you have for example 5 units and your enemies have 500.Enjoyment: the game is fun for a regular and basic turn based game, I recommend it (it's not have so manyhours of gameplay either so it's just for fun for your free time) - (4/5)Repeatable: Didn't finish the game yet, but it's one of those turn-based games which the difficulty is the only thing that will change your gameplay. (1.5/5)Frustration: Except for extremely unexpected challenging enemies (bosses with 300 health and 2 units of it) the game is fluent and you will feel like a god playing with your super talented squad. - (2/5)Boredom: You will play this game for few hours without breaks. (1/5)You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see what this game has to offer.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=285800&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall "

												TL;DR A fun, cheap, turn based game that doesn't have too much to the recipe, but that doesn't make it bad.Pros:+ Affordable+ simple+ a good introduction to turn based play+ an acceptable mobile to computer portCons:+ Bland environments+ uninspired soundtrack+ lack of strategyBraveland is a mobile game brought to computer that revolves around basic turn based play to conquer levels in a specific order. This is not a game that you will drown tons of time in, however, it is a nice relaxing game that has more acceptable features than negative ones. I certainly would not recommend this game to somebody looking for a new obsession. Rather, I would suggest this game to someone who has never played a turn based game or someone who is looking for an affordable but fun little game to pass the time.			"

												Braveland is a strategy, turn-by-turn RPG game, with alot of ressemblence to the Heroes of Might & Magic series style of combat. You can cast global spells via your rage, you can recruit units in towns, you can fight obviously and you can cast spells via your heroes. You also have advanced commands like wait and defend, etc...The gameplay is good! The hard mode is quite challenging and I think it can only be done only with alot of strategic thoughts and taking care while spending your gold. The music is good, but it's extremely repetitive. The graphics are O.K and the animations are fairly good.The game only takes around 4 hours to beat in hard mode with 100% achievements completed. Then again, it's only $5 USD so it's pretty fair! By the way, this game is an iOS port but I did not noitice at all while playing, good job to the devs!The story was pretty mediocre in my opinion, not enough dialogues and a really standard story. I think the reason i've liked the game is because it really remembers me of my early gaming in strategy games.I will recommend this game to anybody who hasn't played a strategy turn-by-turn game since a few years, but honestly this is far from being my favorite game, it's just a fun little game that doesn't take long to complete and is pretty enjoyable.

 9/10  - Game mechanics (very simple but fun) 6/10  - Story (not much of a plot, but could be worse) Achievements  - Easy to get 100% completion (around 10 hours)This is a fun but very short and simplistic turn-based, casual game. The game mechanics are the best part of the game even as simple as they are. The story merely sets up a reason to fight and maybe an occasional chuckle. I'd suggest buying it on sale for a buck or two because it only took me around 2 hours or less to beat the story mode on easy difficulty. Even the highest difficulty really wasn't that challenging. There's a survival mode that I haven't played much yet, but it might give the game more replay value--would be better if there were more achievements.It's also an easy game to get 100% achievements for achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s--took me 10 hours to get all achievements with at least an hour or two being a result of me forgetting the game was on in the background. So while it could have been longer and more difficult, it was still tons of fun.Updated for formatting and mechanics.			"

												Truth be told, I have a definate prejudice against games with ""cute"" cartoony characters with tiny bodies and big heads. I find that I just can't take them seriously. And Braveland falls comfortably into that category. - But that's okay. At $1.99 USD, I don't have to take it seriously. I was looking for something casual and cheap and it was both. It took me 3 hours to beat it on ""easy.""   It is vagely reminicent of Heroes of Might and Magic and of the King's Bounty series in that the Hero doesn't actually take part in the battles and the troops move around on hexes.  If you have played either (or probably even if you haven't) you will catch on quickly. The only things I didn't like were - 1- the Troop restriction that esentially forced you to keep peasants (called ""Farmers"") in your army throughout the game. But that turned out okay too. They aren't as worthless as in most games. And 2- the almost complete lack of re-playability. (Maybe in a couple years. I might try it again.) At this price, it was definately worth it. I'll watch for the others to go on sale too. (But I won't pay full price.) "

												Braveland is a simple, lightweight turn based strategy in the vein of Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics.  You play the role of the Commander of a small and motley crew of fighters seeking vengeance against an evil army that sacked your village.  The player starts with a pitchfork-weilding peasant and an archer, and eventuall unlocks 3 more melee fighters, one more archer, and a healer.  The healer is also able to cast magic bolts at enemies at any range.  The player's character doesn't appear in the battle directly but is able to cast attack and status effect spells during battle.  The tactics are generally pretty simple.  The largest force a player may bring into combat is 5 members but because there is cap on the sum of ranks of player units, the later, there is a choice as to whether to bring a lot of fast/low armor units or a smaller number of slow/heavily armored units.  Despite its apparent simplicity, there is just enough depth to keep the game interesting through its campaign.  The campaign isn't terribly long, with a full playthrough on Normal difficulty taking about 4 hours.  Muc longer than this, and there would need to be more depth to keep the game interesting.  The graphics are pleasant, with a hand-drawn motif thant is a bit more sophisticated than the retro-throwback style so many games employ these days.  The colors are bright, animations are smooth, and it is generally fairly clear what to expect from new units -- both friend and foe -- when you first enounter them.  The music is well produced and fits the game's art style to a T, with a somewhat medieval/fantasy feel and a nice mellow overworld theme and battle music that conveys tension but keeps with the smooth and relaxing feel of the rest of the game.  Bottom Line:  That ""smooth and relaxing"" feel is this game's draw.  It is not a super deep prove-your-mettle-as-a-general battle/war sim.  It's deep enough to be a little engaging but not so involved as to be distressing.  It is a diversion for a few minutes or hours getting away from the hectic and stressful beat of real life or a soothing distraction to pass the time on a bus or in a waiting room where your undivided focus for several hours simply isn't available.

A few items and different unit types to not make the gameplay incredibly boring/stale.  However some more diversity would have been nice.Won't take very long, I went through the whole thing in just over 3 hours.  Still, give it a go if you like strategy games.			"

												I just played through this. It's a lot of fun and if you are looking for something simple, turn based and also a bit addictive, I would highly reccomend this game. There is also an option for survival where you get through 10 rounds of battles. I just discovered that today and can't seem to defeat it all just yet - so that is a bit challenging :)			"

												Braveland is an amusing little aside, and I do mean little.  It's very linear, very straightforward, and easy.  Quite easy.  Almost insultingly easy.  The game won't take you long to beat, as there isn't much content.  The classes are rather mundane, but they'll get you by, as there are only 7 of them.  All things considered, it gave me what I wanted, an entertaining little game to play during my free time.			"

												I was really much into it from the very beginning. I am usually not the very big fan of turn-based strategies, RPG's but this one really worth a try. In general, the animations are smooth, sound effects are all just fine and gameplay is really one-mouse click simple. Surprisingly the very simple mechanics really does work in this game. Of course, there is not much of the story, I mean mostly whenever you encounter an enemy there will be some dialogue to read, but from my own experience after 5 battles I stopped reading them and just went from battle to battle while finishing additional quests and buying every supply which is better than the previous one. The battles are mostly not challenging at all on Medium difficulty, so I recommend to play campaign on a Hard (also it will give you the most important achievement to hunt 100% achievements for this game, so if you don't want to replay the game later, because technically, this game has no value to play it again, you better do it on hard from the very start.) Whoever, by myself I loved this game. It is simple, it has fun to offer and this game is just perfect time skipper. :)			"

 9/10  - Game mechanics (very simple but fun) 6/10  - Story (not much of a plot, but could be worse) Achievements  - Easy to get 100% completion (around 10 hours)This is a fun but very short and simplistic turn-based, casual game. The game mechanics are the best part of the game even as simple as they are. The story merely sets up a reason to fight and maybe an occasional chuckle. I'd suggest buying it on sale for a buck or two because it only took me around 2 hours or less to beat the story mode on easy difficulty. Even the highest difficulty really wasn't that challenging. There's a survival mode that I haven't played much yet, but it might give the game more replay value--would be better if there were more achievements.It's also an easy game to get 100% achievements for achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s--took me 10 hours to get all achievements with at least an hour or two being a result of me forgetting the game was on in the background. So while it could have been longer and more difficult, it was still tons of fun.Updated for formatting and mechanics.			"

												Braveland is a simple mobile strategy game that was ported to PC. For the price, this game is a winner! Overall, the turn-based battles are the classic type of battles that games like “Heroes of Might & Magic” uses. It follows a linear campaign where the main character is a poor farmer who sets out to find the evil king and gets revenge for losing his village and family. In addition, to the campaign mode, Braveland also has a survivor mode. Survivor mode provides a more challenging battle environment than the campaign mode. Also, survivor mode places healing and combat limitations on certain units so the battles get tricky as additional thinking is required to survive to the next battle.In conclusion, Braveland is nothing of a surprise, but it a good game to both beginners of turned-based strategy games and to veterans as well. Although it does lack replay value, the simple and easy gameplay is family friendly and it provides a few hours of quick enjoyable moments. Rating: 7.8/10 (78%)Achievements: 21/21 (100%)Game Done.

The game isn't too difficult as long as your cautious about how you move your squad around the playing field.  Braveland is gorgeous, the color palette is absolutely beautiful.  On top of that the characters are all quite cute and funny looking.  Combine the laid-back gameplay with the catchy tunes and you have yourself a very enjoyable, relaxing, game!			"

												Really easy, even on the hardest setting. I'm an hour into this game and wondering where the main hero is in every battle that I fight. It's like he tells everybody to go fight and he'll be right there. Except he never shows up. Then he comes back with all these cool buffs he found from leveling and not fighting. He's really awesome. I hope he grows some balls soon instead of hiding in the bushes while everybody else fights. Because then he would be the hero Braveland deserves, but not the one it needs right now. Because then he'd actually be brave...in the land of Braveland.All that being said, I think implementing an actual cover system with overwatch would easily place this game in the $10 range. Since it's $5 or less on sale, it's worth a look. Here's hoping that these same creative devs can add just a little more spice to an otherwise great game.Increase difficulty. Main character.

												Truth be told, I have a definate prejudice against games with ""cute"" cartoony characters with tiny bodies and big heads. I find that I just can't take them seriously. And Braveland falls comfortably into that category. - But that's okay. At $1.99 USD, I don't have to take it seriously. I was looking for something casual and cheap and it was both. It took me 3 hours to beat it on ""easy.""   It is vagely reminicent of Heroes of Might and Magic and of the King's Bounty series in that the Hero doesn't actually take part in the battles and the troops move around on hexes.  If you have played either (or probably even if you haven't) you will catch on quickly. The only things I didn't like were - 1- the Troop restriction that esentially forced you to keep peasants (called ""Farmers"") in your army throughout the game. But that turned out okay too. They aren't as worthless as in most games. And 2- the almost complete lack of re-playability. (Maybe in a couple years. I might try it again.) At this price, it was definately worth it. I'll watch for the others to go on sale too. (But I won't pay full price.) "

												I like to take little games and spend about one hour with them and then write a short review.  This is my first one! Braveland is a cartoony little game where you (mostly) travel a linear path of battles with the option to make a few adjustments and changes to your playthrough depending on choices you make for your ""squad"" and ""items"".  You have a few basic stats, (Attack, Physical Defense, Magic Defense, maybe one more?) and there are a half dozen different types of little ""squad"" members you have  that act as units for your battles which take place on a hex-grid in a turn based format. Braveland is an adorable little game, best suited for a quick few hours waiting at an airport or to let your son/daughter enjoy.  I would argue it's a good introduction to gaming for children, because it lacks the depth or complexity that can make most games like this frustrating.  Some see this as a reason not to recommend the game, and it could be, but it's also sometimes relaxing to do something completely mindless. I wouldn't recommend buying the game at full price, you should be able to catch it on sale for $1-$2, or in some kind of indie bundle.Have fun!			"

												Not a terrible game, but not a good one either. 4/10Pros: nice graphics and pretty easy to pick out, this game reviews well so I won't elaborate too much here.Cons:1) The PC price discrimination: See this time and time again, this game is $3.49 on Google/Apple store and almost double the price on Steam. When this title is on sale, it is about the same price as the normal price for the mobile version. 2) No PC optimizations: #1 would be ok if the developers actually put effort into the port, but as it stands there are little to no improvements. There are very basic features that the game lacks due to lack of will/laziness. One example is that you cannot find out the movement zone of enemy units - in typical strategy games you mouseover a unit to see how far it can move so you can stay outside the range, in this game, you need to look up its movement, and manually count squares. You cannot 'mouseover' on a phone, so why implement it on a PC? Right?3) Lack of strategy: This game, despite being a strategy game, has almost no strategy. The two small figments of strategy is that most enemies have only one counter, so double teaming them saves one counter hit; also, you can block enemies with your troops to prevent them attacking your back line. Staples such as combo attacks are non-existent. So most battles are just a slapfest where your troops and enemy troops will stand toe to toe slugging it out until one stack dies. Bottom line: Maybe acceptable for a kid, but for anyone who likes the strategic aspect, Braveland is a pass.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Turn based strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsGreat main menu Music!There are 5 music volume bars available.There are 5 sound volume bars available.There are many resolution sizes available.You are able to play this game fullscreen or windowed mode.There is survival mode.There is a difficulty settings available.They will offer you a tutorial.There are 3 different profile slots available.About the game.If you are familiar with ""heroes of might and magic series"" Then you will probaly like this one aswell. This is basically the same as the might and magic series but more cartoonish and ""mini"".Everytime you level up, you can buy more troops at the camps. If you lose troops during a battle, you will pay some gold (automaticaly) to revive them again. But you will always make a profit. You play on a ""world"" map, and move from level to level basically, you can travel back. The only thing what i dislike is the attack direction, You had this in the might and magic series however. Like - if there is an enemy in the front, and u want to attack from behind, you have to to that tile first and then click again to attack, instead of having a small sword icon that will it do for you.There is a story.It is Semi post apocalypse but totally worth reading because it contains some funny texts at times.You can the change the difficulty at all times.Level up system.The game is very calm and music is relaxing, graphics are not even hurting your eyes. Background is well done too.Custom mouse cursor ingame.Able to toggle the enemy health bar.Other things.I got this game during a discount, but the game is worth the full price in my eyes.-------------------I Give this game a 9/10			"

It somehow was fun... not sure why thoughPro:- Easy Achievements- Tradingcards- Beginning title for better strategic turnbased fighters like M&M, AoW, Advanced Wars and so on- Quickly getting the hang on the game- Some Jokes, not many though - Cutify animation, some faces look like herpa derp mode- Additional survivalmodeCon:- Story is quite dull... - Actually a cellphone game getting ported and with higher pricetag on steam- Once finished, you cant do anything on the savegame - Only 3 chests while you need all 3 for the Achievement.. annoying if you ignore the first one..- Pricetag (right now for 4€ in bundle it is worth, but regular price is not so worth it)- No terrain benefits other than block way- Linear pathing~5.5-6/10 as it was fun and is a game to play while waiting for someone as it does not need any time at all and you can simply quit the game where you want as it automatically saves for youIt has potential, but the game doesnt use it that efficiantPlaytime: ~2.5 - 3 hours a walkthroughNo replayability of story once you finished it on Hard.Replayability due to Survivalmode is given overallI recommend it only on saleprice the regular price is totaly not worth it			"

												Braveland is a simple, lightweight turn based strategy in the vein of Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics.  You play the role of the Commander of a small and motley crew of fighters seeking vengeance against an evil army that sacked your village.  The player starts with a pitchfork-weilding peasant and an archer, and eventuall unlocks 3 more melee fighters, one more archer, and a healer.  The healer is also able to cast magic bolts at enemies at any range.  The player's character doesn't appear in the battle directly but is able to cast attack and status effect spells during battle.  The tactics are generally pretty simple.  The largest force a player may bring into combat is 5 members but because there is cap on the sum of ranks of player units, the later, there is a choice as to whether to bring a lot of fast/low armor units or a smaller number of slow/heavily armored units.  Despite its apparent simplicity, there is just enough depth to keep the game interesting through its campaign.  The campaign isn't terribly long, with a full playthrough on Normal difficulty taking about 4 hours.  Muc longer than this, and there would need to be more depth to keep the game interesting.  The graphics are pleasant, with a hand-drawn motif thant is a bit more sophisticated than the retro-throwback style so many games employ these days.  The colors are bright, animations are smooth, and it is generally fairly clear what to expect from new units -- both friend and foe -- when you first enounter them.  The music is well produced and fits the game's art style to a T, with a somewhat medieval/fantasy feel and a nice mellow overworld theme and battle music that conveys tension but keeps with the smooth and relaxing feel of the rest of the game.  Bottom Line:  That ""smooth and relaxing"" feel is this game's draw.  It is not a super deep prove-your-mettle-as-a-general battle/war sim.  It's deep enough to be a little engaging but not so involved as to be distressing.  It is a diversion for a few minutes or hours getting away from the hectic and stressful beat of real life or a soothing distraction to pass the time on a bus or in a waiting room where your undivided focus for several hours simply isn't available.

I try it on hard (as always) and for this level game can be a little harder. I always got a lot of money for important stuff (like army, no items (only free stuff) ... items I buy later in game) and the difficulty of enemies also can be a little harder for the ""hardest"" level that game provides.This is a one afternoon game (on hardest difficulty, better to say 3 hours game). But still enjoying and playful and also reminds me about HOMAM III (HD I see like week ago).I also run it on easy difficulty, and with this settings game was easy for 1 hour play. This time I got a plenty of money and buy full stuff of any stuff (even artefacts).+ game type+ 2D turn-based strategy game+ RPG elements - difficulty (hard is not so much hard ... can be three times harder, but it's not)- game type- 2D turn-based strategy gameGraphics: 6/10Sounds/Music : 5/10Mechanics: 4/10Idea: 2/10Addicting: 5/10RPG elements: 3/10Story : 0/10----------------------Verdict: 5/10			"

												If you like King's Bounty, then you'll like this game because it has most of the same elements.  The main difference is that it automatically subtracts a small fee from the reward for winning a battle to replace units that were lost.  So you only need to head back to buy more units if you are below your leadership cap.  Units have a star ranking, which limits which units you can use together, which is only noticible close to the end of the game with one unit that it effectively prevents you from using.  You could remove two units to make room for this one, but it's not an even trade.  There is also a survival mode, where you have to beat 10 combats in a row, it's not hard to beat, and there is llittle reason to continue playing it once you have beat both modes.  This game was on the short side, but it was fun while it lasted.  If you haven't played King's Bounty, then I suggest getting that first.			"

												Brilliant little game, a simplified version of the Kings Bounty series. No clowning around, just turn based match after match with little in between. Humourous at times with a pleasing art style. A little short at around 5 hours to complete but there are other games in the series if you have'nt had enough. Good value for the price. Would definitely reccomend.			"

												This game is a tactics style turn-based RPG. I really liked how casual it was. All the characters and story were accessible. The story isn't anything to write home about, an evil overlord is amassing and army and we fight against them. Simple. Get the game on sale because it only takes about 3 hours to beat. Exactly what I want from a casual game. Braveland Pirates goes a little further in time, and is also worth picking up. Braveland Wizard is just awful....it's a terrible grind.			"

												More than a decade ago I was in love with the Heroes of Might and Magic series. 1 was great, 2 was the best; 3 was too hard  for me but I tried to enjoy it anyway. Time passed, I discovered the King's Bounty remakes by 1C (which is like a casualised HoMM) and loved those too - Armored Princess is my #1 singleplayer-only game in terms of hours spent at the time of writing. Time passed once again and the cycle continues. I discovered Braveland, which I consider a casualised King's Bounty. I want to believe this is the bottom and there is nowhere else to go, especially not downward.The world is explored along predetermined paths. There is no castle management. Hero stats and upgrades are next to meaningless. The writing is very generic. The combats (on a hexagonal grid) feel satisfying but lack depth. The look of the  interface makes me think it was designed for mobile devices first and ported to PC later.It might sound like there are many issues but those are relative, and visible mainly when compared to more complex representatives of the genre. Perceived alone, Braveland is decent and brought me quite a bit of fun. It's relaxing and I still enjoyed seeing the story to its conclusion, collecting gold for troops, figuring out efficient combat orders. The graphics are okay and the music fits the atmosphere. I also appreciated that it's possible to get all of the achievements in one playthrough, even when playing on Hard (which is barely hard). If you end up with a ""fun but shallow"" opinion of Braveland, check out the games I mentioned in the first paragraph.			"

												This is a Heroes of Might and Magic rip off (Hell, even the music in the trailer is one of the HOMM3 battle tracks). The battles are okay, but there is no exploration. There is a straight, almost-linear storyline filled with simple, childish dialogues that try to pass as humour.My biggest complain is the length. Damn, see my hours on record? It's the time it took me to finish the whole thing without skipping any dialogue or side-battles, and I also played several times on the other ""arcade battle"" game mode,  which doesn't have much to offer either.The game also prompts you to buy the sequel, which I guess will be another 3-4 hour campaign. Meh.All in all: I've played online flash games that are deeper than this. The gameplay itself is okay, but the game is really not worth it. You can say its low prize compensates for the lack of features, but you can also get a Heroes of Might and Magic OR King's Bounty game for similar prizes, especially during sales, and they're 20 times more replayable and deep than this.Skip this game, it has absolutely nothing to offer.

												Braveland Review. Total Score : 4/10Worth paying ? : meh Replay value : None The best characteristics of this game are that simplifies , concentrates and executes the Might and Magic and King's Bounty  formula very well. Turn based combat, with magic on a small / medium grid map. The game's art is good and overall productions values are correct. The execution of the game overall is good. What's the problem with the game then?. Well if you simplify the formula, limiting units,magic and RPG elements to the minimum extent, you need a lot of content to keep the user playing the game. On a tablet / mobile environment, the game has more sense than in the PC scenario,even for a casual strategy game (the lack of content is just absurd).It took me 4.1 hours on normal, to get 90% achievements and to finish the game. Price tag compared with other games like this, makes the final scenario score even lower.  "

Good game, a bit like heroes of might & magic (strategy, turn base oriented) but very simplistic without the heavy statistical info on your stacking armies abilities,and weaknesses penalties of having opposing armies in your squad. In saying that, it is also its downfall in encouraging re-playability, a game lacking the complexity that made the heroes series such a success. The game map is also way to linear, hard difficulty is too easy! All in all a good introduction to gamers who haven't played the heroes series.Game 9/10 !			"

												Standard, straightforward strategy game with turn-based squad battles in a cartoon presentation. Choose and upgrade several units, much like Might & Magic games. Leaders can equip enhancing gear as well. Nothing groundbreaking, but it certainly does the trick and has some close encounters.

												Super short and very repetative. I mostly made the same moves as I went through the game. Not many different classes. The artwork is not great, not a big deal there though. I have played many games with not-so-great graphics, but were crazy fun. This is not one of them. It is a nice idea poorly executed. Exteremely linear with no grinding to level. Beat one fight and then move on to the next and hope you made the right choices on where to spend your money. I don't know that I could really even call this an RPG. The element is barely there.If you catch this for super cheap... Like a couple of bucks, it will waste some time for you, but otherwise I would look eslewhere.

												A very light turn based strategy game, enjoyable but leaves you wanting more.  No units can lock enemies in place which makes tactical movement and positioning kind of pointless because the enemy just run past you to your back line, and even though some grid tiles have terrain/cover this in no way blocks line of sight for any ranged attacks and hence makes them redundant and makes tactical positioning even more pointless. It is completely linear and there are no random spawning mobs to fight, so the main campaign can never be longer than 3 hrs because once you have beaten a mob it never comes back. If you want a cute looking nice but basic turn based tactics game, which you can play with almost no thought this is for you, maybe good if you are new to the genre, but chances are you will be left wanting more.As i say, its about 3 hrs long, so make your mind up what you think 3 hrs of moderate entertainment is worth.

												A short, simple but engaging TRPG.Rating: 6/10Genre: Tactical Role Playing Game.Time to complete: About 6 hours for me to 100% the game.Braveland is a TRPG that comprises of fairly standard hiring of soldiers to do battle while collecting gear (for your main character only who doesn't fight but provides support buffs) and defeating enemies in a very linier final fantasy tactics styled map.Each unit you gain is comprised of a certain number of units in which you can hire more of in order to boost that units power / health.  In combat when you lose a health bar you lose 1 unit from that group and are forced to pay a penalty at the end of the mission. (The unit lose is temporary)The main issue I find with this game is the lack of depth and that gold can be very limited because there is no way to grind or farm anything.  When a battle is done it is over.  You can choose to lose fights in order to gain gold and xp but that is extremely tidious and often not worth it.Braveland is also very easy,  on the hardest setting I personally only ran into one small wall and that was trying to get the end game sword a bit early.Pros  -Simple, easy to pick up and play.  -Fun to kill a quick night and get a 100% game without a ton of effort. Cons  -Short and a bit to bare bones.  -No ability to grind for cash or exp other than losing fights.I had a blast playing it and will more than likely play the next game in the series.If you don't have a lot of time or just want a simple TRPG to kill a night of time this is a great buy.However if you want more depth or are looking for a new RPG to sink your teeth into this might be disapointing.Make up your own mind about it but it was worth my money.

												It's cheap and simple so I'd have to say it's worth buying at a low package deal price. A couple things to keep in mind though, there's really no replay value in it asit stands and it only takes a few hours to get through each game, is it worth $12 for all 3? well, I've seen better for cheaper so it's up to the buyer. If a person wants a HOMM or Kings Bounty type game, this isn't it, way to short.  I'd say under $5 - $10 (for all 3) Max just to help devs make something with more content.			"

												It's super linear with no sandbox or anything that I could find, so the replay is lower than normal for these types of games. The story is also pretty much nothing, there's a bad guy and you kill him that's it really. It's also not super long, I beat it in 4.5 hours, you could probably do it even quicker if you tried.Having said that, I got this for about a buck with a 75% off coupon, and for that price it's a really smooth little HoMM3-esque flash-type game. If you like moving mans around combat hexes, pick it up cheap and give it a spin. After I sold the cards I think this only cost about 50cent so honestly really easy to recommend at that price point.			"

												Braveland is a casual and fun little turn based strategy game. The plot is nothing original or too interesting, however the game play is fun, albeit a bit short. I'd recommend to start off the game with the hardest mode for more of a challenge. Nevertheless, the quaint music and bright artwork are also great aspects of the game itself. Some of the mechanics can be improved, such as healers being able to heal more than once, and being able to arrange units. Other than that, I did enjoy the game, though I'm not sure if I would recommend it at its full price (I got it on discount myself). It's a great little gem to play with during a reprieve from some more challenging games, or a tiring work week.			"

												The line between 'flash/casual game' and 'real game' is a blurred one, but Braveland clearly favors the first category.Taking 'King's Bounty' style tactical combat and party-building, Braveland simplifies the formula to its most basic components, and then presents it in a simple, colorful, node-based design.PROS* Easy to pick-up, play for a couple minutes, and put down.* Art style is simple, but appealing in its colorfulness* Very stable, didn't notice any bugs or issues*If you're looking for a palate cleanser between heavier fare, a mindless but well-presented time-killer, or an introduction to strategy games, this game is ideal.NEUTRAL* Very easy. Anyone with prior strategy experience ought be able to manage the hardest difficulty with no problems- in fact, even if you do suffer a lost battle, you suffer no penalties and get extra gold for your efforts. * Very short. This game won't take you more than 5 hours for a full run-through, and you can likely manage it in 3 if you're motivated.* There's a few 'wait till you're strong enough' side paths, but the game is essentially entirely linear.* Minimal character building (just straight stat level-ups that end up not being overly significant) and swapping army formation is incredibly limited due to a mix of limited unit selection and limited army building points.* Weird dialogue blurbs. This game has no story worth mentioning, but the developers did implement a basic plotline, with occasional npc dialogues. And each one of those comes across as an oddly mistranslated garble. * By its very nature of being a casual stripped down version of meatier titles, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre.* Game has a survival mode that benefits from being able to offer characters from the subsequent games, but really doesn't offer much reason to play it past initial novelty.CONS* The interface is often clunky and underdeveloped, making things more of a hassle than it ought be [or than is usual for more modern games in the genre]. And sometimes trying to get info on a game component isn't near as simple a matter as it ought be.* If you're looking for a strategy game of any depth, involvement, complexity, challenge, or a game with any story elements, this is not the game for you.Summary: If you go into this with the same mindset as playing a game of minesweeper, solitaire, etc, the game is quite enjoyable- and while it won't leave any lasting impression on you, it's a nice way to burn time when you've got no energy for anything too involved, or only have a few minutes to kill.If you go into this with the mindset of a typical strategy gamer, you're going to be itching to use that steam refund option.

												Braveland, fun enough game to keep you entertained for 5-10 hours. Certainly worth it's price at 4,99€ whilst at sale it seems like a bargain. Cute cartoonish graphics with a turn-based strategy system, it is very very basic and also repetitive but the short story makes time fly by before you get bored. However the survival mode is really tough to reach battle 10 and seems like a RNG battle, no matter how skillful you are you cant seem to win it with the wrong units given. I would like if they would implement to see how many units you entered with so you know what to heal to lose the least amount of gold. Also there is no information at all in survival, e.g. how much physical resist you have or physical damage.Pros: - Simple- Not too long- Addictive- Hard on insaneCons:- Limited information given.- ""Story""- No depth- Survival Mode impossibleTL;DR: If you are looking for a simple game to play for a day I recommend this game, it will keep your mind captivated on the game and time flies by.

A very short game to spend an evening playingThis is a nice cheap game that is meant to just have a fun little evening playing, it has little to no replay value, so if you're tight with your money, or expecting a long playthrough, I wouldnt suggest this game.However, if you're looking for some way to spend an evening, gain some easy achievements to add to your ""perfected games"" roster like I was, then this is definitely a good buy for you.Pros & Cons+/- Stragetic combat system, although easy, it is possible to challenge yourself with refusing the loss of any character // save on recovery costs.+/- Quick game- Lacking an evolved storyline, a pretty generic one of gaining an army for vengance on those who hurt you and those aorund you.

You have to click through a bunch of stuff that doesn't contribute to the game. The art was all right -- cartoonish, but OK. Sound was good but repetitive.  It's like a mobile port with little choices invoved. Luckily, I got the game on sale for $1.99 and used crediit to get it, so I paid nothing. The card drops are good, though, so I ought to have close to 25% return on it.			"

												Braveland is a casual strategy RPG which follows the incredibly standard plot of Dude's Village Is Pillaged -> Go Revenge It. I'm going to start off by saying that I played through the entire story campaign on Hard Mode; I recommend doing this because it feels like the best way to get a decent challenge out of this game.Combat in the game takes place as turn-based tactical skirmishes on small hexagonal battlefields, with a particular emphasis on troops. That is to say, each character on the battlefield is actually made up of multiple people of the same class, with their stats stacking on top of each other. As these troops take damage and lose bodies, so too do their stats dwindle, similar to Advance Wars, and probably a lot of other games I haven't played because I am a huge scrub. This creates an interesting dynamic where it's not always the correct option to focus damage on one enemy troop at a time, but rather spread damage out enough to make enemy attacks feeble rather than fatal. Additionally, there's a long-term concern in the form of gold: You have to pay a penalty out of your gold reward at the end of combat to recover lost allies, and there's no way to grind for extra gold, so keeping losses to a minimum is paramount.Progression is semi-linear. You go across a three-region map from skirmish to skirmish, picking up new allies and abilities along the way. There are short side paths to turn onto which end with treasure, stat upgrades, and shops to purchase additional units for troops as well as equipment to put on your main character — who inexplicably, despite being a warrior's son and built like such, doesn't have any actual presence in battle, instead preferring to radiate his stats onto his troops from the sidelines I guess. The early game can be pretty brutal due to the lack of troops and gold to enhance them with, though this gradually becomes less of an issue as income outpaces expenses. It isn't exactly clear how the stats on your main character affect your troops either, so to be honest I just didn't bother with equips until the best were available for purchase. Upgrading troops directly seems to be the best use of money anyhow — a massive clump of one-star Peasants can be surprisingly effective!Graphically, the game is colorful and the environments are nice enough to look at, though the character models are a bit too reminiscent of a high school Flash animation for my taste. On the other hand, the music, while inoffensive, only consists of two tracks: The one used for travel and the one used for combat. Not even the final boss gets a different song, which I found quite disappointing.Overall, Braveland was an enjoyable experience for a rather unassuming casual title. The campaign lasted around 4-5 hours for me to clear it 100%, which is a decent length for the $2 it tends to go for on sale. There's also a Survival mode where you just play battles and spend gold on upgrades in-between, which to be frank I didn't bother with too much. Unfortunately, I've heard that the sequel, Braveland Wizard, adds the ability to grind for gold and apparently makes it feel necessary to do. Kind of ruins the need for strategic planning at that point.			"

												Short and relatively easy, but don't let those two things put you off the game. The music goes well with the game and the graphics are decent. The game is also pretty relaxing, it auto-saves after every battle, so if you do somehow lose, you'll only miss a few minutes. It's a simple turn-based game that involves some tactical thinking when planning on what troops you want to use, but overall it doesn't really matter what people you use unless fighting one of the bosses. Being able to level up is a nice touch, even though you're unable to replay won battles.			"

												Braveland feels--and looks--a lot like a Facebook game, right down to the fact that there are a limited number of battles on the map, and therefore a limited amount of gold available to you. This means that you have to decide very carefully on what you will spend your gold on: troops, troop abilities, or equipment, and the wrong choice early on can ruin your chances later in the game.Other than this incredibly annoying fact, there are other, smaller annoyances: Units can only counter-attack the first unit to attack them.  You cannot view a numerical value of current health, even though damage is indicated numerically. No matter how much Fury you have, you can only use your Fury once per turn. Enemy units ALWAY target healers, then archers/crossbowmen, then melee units. Going so far as to cross the entire battlefield and surround themselves with melee units to get to them. Healers can only heal twice per battle. The story is the horribly cliche: ""Peasant in outlying village sees wrongdoing in the kingdom and embarks on a quest to kill the evil king""Overall, while the gameplay is sort of fun, and the pricetag is reasonable, I can't really recommend it.

			Phil gets himself in a lather about games criticism thanks to Braveland, which, incidentally, is a decent game! Feel free to subscribe:...		

It’s fairly standard fare for a fantasy turn-based strategy game. You make your way across a slowly expanding map with various vistas and nasties to kill. You hire on bigger and badder troops as you fight bigger and badder enemies. You gear up your general, you kill a few bosses, and BAM: the game’s over. Wham, bam, thank you Sam… Wise.			"

												So first off, I got a discount coupon for this game which brought it down to like $1.40 so I decided to try it out. After playing it for a couple hours I realized that this is a much simpler turn-based strategy game the most others in the genre. I, however, do not mean that in a negative way for two reasons: one, I feel this would be the perfect game to play if you are younger and wanted to try your hand at the strategy genre and two I feel this is a very casual game that would be a good stress releiver when you just need something simple.While I haven't played it all the way through just yet, I would still recommend it for the low price-tag of $5 for either of the two above reasons.

												Fun, but very short. Finished it in 3 hours, and I don't feel like there's much replay value. Not very challenging, but a good casual game. There was only a single battle that I couldn't win the first try. The graphics were cute and gameplay was easy to learn. Could be a lot deeper, but fun as it is.			"

												It isn't amazing, but by no means is it terrible and not worth recommending. If you know going into this game that you will be playing a casual, simple turn-based strategy game that can be finished around two hours for a cheap price then you will walk away happy.There's enough polish and overall appeal to keep you progressing through the game.

												Very simplistic and extremely short tablet/fone conversion, good fun while it lasts I suppose, leaves you wanting more (as in Braveland Wizard - but characters don't carry across).Reminds me mostly of Kings Bounty (though others say HOMM but that's heck of a lot more complex IMO).Worth 50p to a £1 (at most), certainly not at RRP (£5!  You're 'aving a giraffe m8)....PS Playtime says 4.8 hours.  For a completed game that's not great eh? :-(			"

Simple and Easy GameplayYou need four words to describe this game. Simple, Easy, Railed, Unexpected. Those four words describe perfectly what the game is.It's not a lot about decissions, which actually isn't all bad - especially for a casual strategy game... And it is as casual as you like it to be. The graphics are ok, the sound is nice, you selctionr of choices is limited, the story is deeper than I had actually expected, the gameplay isn't very original (you might call it a light Heroes of Might and Magic surrogate) and all this together makes a tasty mixture that is inviting to play.It might not be the best game around, but it has some merits that you probably would like a lot, special abilities have a time of cooldown, since combat is fully turn based there is no hectic clicking to be indulged in.Pro:It's easy to learn and as easy to master.The sound fits to the game.It has some addictive qualities, especially in endgame segment.Con:At times it is far too simple.It can get boring pretty fast.You actually feel like on a rail during the whole game!I recommend this gameIf graded in percents this game reaches a mellow 67 % or 3- or C- in grades. It's not the best of games, neither it's one of the worst games to buy. The time/money value is at 4,99 on a C+ or 72 % side. But I would wait till the game is cheaper, or buy it through bundles... or get it gifted.Some of the recycled jokes were barely sufferable. Thanks for giving me a headache ;-)			"

												Simple yet fun game with just enough story to entertain.  Play on any difficulty besides hard if you want to mindlessly breeze through the game.  Play on the most difficult level if you want to put some thought into your decisions before you steamroll the opposition.  This review is for the main campaign, as I have not tried the recently added Survival mode.  If the game is on sale I recommend buying it to keep yourself entertained for 6-8 hours.			"

												This is a fast-paced, casual game - perfect for a few hours of fun. The game mechanics are very simple, but at higher levels, battles require a little bit of thinking about strategy - just enough to feel like you're progressing without getting very frustrated. As an added bonus, the cartoon artwork (and lack of profanity and gore) allowed me to play it in front of my 9-year-old son, who immediately became intrigued with the turn-based tactical strategy genre (and, of course, took over my game). I just finished a campaign, and just downloaded the next game (Braveland Wizard) for more fun. Two thumbs up!			"

												I can't see the point to this. There's no real choices I can see, and barely any tactical decisions to be had. You have to click through a bunch of stuff that doesn't contribute to the game. The art was all right -- cartoonish, but OK. Sound was good but repetitive.  It's like a mobile port with little choices invoved. Luckily, I got the game on sale for $1.99 and used crediit to get it, so I paid nothing. The card drops are good, though, so I ought to have close to 25% return on it.			"

												This is blast to play. It has a silly story and cute graphics. The mechanics are basic, but solid and playable. There is nothing really bad or broken about the game, it's just a little basic. If you know this going into the experience, I think you will have a blast. It plays like a poor mans HOMM, in that you go through a map and fight encounters which take you to a tactical grid layout. You will have different unit stacks (7 types), areas to recruit more, a hero that levels (Max of about 10), and equipment (4 different slots). There is really only one direction to go in with some side paths that I highly recommend you go through for more money. Overall, a solid game, especially for the price.7/10 Basic but fun.			"

Pretty GoodOne euro for one hour. It's a fairly decent price. A very good bargain if you find this game on sale. You can also try a demo of this game to find out whether you like it or not.It's a simplistic Heroes -style strategy game, without the castle building. I guess that would mean it's more like King's Bounty than Heroes. You got cartoony troops and cartoony enemies, and you battle in a chess-like battlefield. It's simple enough that anyone can get into it, and challenging enough to amuse veteran players.+ Cartoony characters; Can't be taken seriously but they're fun enough to look at+ Light-hearted fun; The overall simplicity creates a pretty light-hearted atmosphere. You almost forget people die when they're killed.+ Tactics; Using your troops to the best of their abilities is pretty fun- Story; Don't expect much from the story.

												While this game is very short, as you can tell by my total play time of 6 hours, it's a nice little strategy game to play if you're either new to this hex-based strategy game, or if you just don't have the time or commitment to play other games like Blackguards. Very nice to play in short bursts.My gripes with Braveland is because it's too short. I suppose I was expecting some 20 hour game, more side-missions, or anything to prolong my play time, other than the Survival mode. Also, I'm not usually very good at strategy games, but I was able to beat Braveland on Hard my first time around, just to give a general idea how easy this game can be.My verdict: Check it out if you got some spare change and want a very casual strategy game to play. If you're looking for something with a bit of a challenge though, I'd try something else.			"

												An enjoyable little adventure, but don't expect too much of it. Basically, it is a short, kind, may be somewhat naive, fairy tale with not over-complicated tactical battles.It took me just three evenings to complete the game, and it doesn't make much sense to replay it as I played on the hard difficulty, and although there is a survival mode as well, the core game is just a one-time trip, during which one sees pretty much everything of it. Even though the game can't be technically called absolutely linear, there is not much real freedom of exploration or choice.I really liked the cute and positive art style (think HoMM1/2), although I would say that the interface is somewhat coarse and make one think about casual/mobile games. Oh, wait... it is a casual mobile game, after all.The story (which is presented via short dialogues) is simple and not particularly deep, but exactly suits the general style of the game.The global map reminds me of Puzzle Quest, where you travel between fixed points, to fight a fight or/and get the next piece of story, which is a fine format for me.The tactical battles can be obviously described like HoMM-lite, and it is clear, that the encounters were designed so that they don't last more than few minutes. Some might like it, yet some might find them lacking complexity and depth. But again, the game does not pretend to be hardcore strategic. Having said that, certain design choices are still rather strange, +1% troop defense for a hero attribute point, seriously?(you hardly have 10 by the end of the game, so, basically, neither your hero's 'build', nor equipment really matters).So, to sum up, Braveland offers an enjoyable relaxed experience for some 6 hours, maybe little more. It is a little game, but it is nice and fun.			"

It's just book ONE, and currenty there is no book 2 on steam :-(((- Nobody told me it's a an episodic game, but it is!!!- You can't save, it's fully automatic and no cloud save.In a bundle it worth a try, but for 5 euro for an episode 1? Nope.			"

												I had underestimated this game in principle. I bought it in a promotion just to kill some time thinking that the game would not offer any difficulties and that I would finish it in a few hours.But this is much more interesting that a kill-some-time game. And if you like battles in turns, you will like it do not be fooled by the cute characters.			"

												It's almost a good game, but...Most of the game is combat, and the combat just isn't very interesting. You have a (very) small set of units to play with, you only get one of each type, and you can't bring them all into the same battle.  The melee units are all on the same spectrum, with fast, weak units on one end and slow, strong units on the other.  The ranged units are similar, and it seems like the designers went out of their way to make the game completely balanced so that there are no wrong choices.Which means there are no right choices either; nothing you do deployment-wise or unit management-wise has any real effect on the battles.  I suppose you could decide to intentionally damage your chances (ie: not buying/equipping new items, not upgrading when you have the option), but there's no advantage to be had by making that choice.  So, for each choice you're presented with in the game, either all answers are equivalent (and therefore it doesn't matter what you decide) or one answer is clearly better than the others (at which point, why even ask the player?).Combat itself, the heart of the game, is similarly weak. There's no real tactical or strategic interest in the battle system. Melee characters bash things in the next hex, ranged characters are weak against melee, but can hit any hex on the map. There's no cover or line of sight, so there's nowhere to hide from the ranged units.  There's no zone of control, so there's no preventing the melee units from running straight up to the ranged units and pounding on them. None of the hexes has any intrinsic value (other than the occasional chest, of which I think there were two in the entire game?), so you almost never need to be anywhere in particular on the map.So really, it's just a brawl in an empty parking lot.  Over and over.There are some special abilities (one per unit), but there's no tradeoff for using them.  The crossbowman, for instance, gets a super shot.  He has to sacrifice a turn to use it, but does triple damage the next round. There is no reason not to use this power every time it comes available; the enemies aren't variable enough to make it worth banking (especially since there are no reinforcements), and it means that in two turns you do three turns worth of damage.  It's simply more effective than just using the regular attack.There's a global set of spells you can cast any time, but you accrue spell points by your units taking hits, so you can't really contrive to earn them more quickly.  They come in at the rate they come in, and you can spend them on (by the end) one of five spells.  Two of which are ""hit enemy"" and ""hit random enemies"", one of which makes a unit faster, and two of which I can't remember because I never needed them and they weren't interesting enough to try.  So, much like the unit powers, the spells wind up being an attack you get to throw for free once in a while. There's never a good reason not to do so when you have the chance.A total absence of interesting choices (tactically, strategically, plot-wise...) is the defining experience of the game.  With some minor changes to combat (ZOC!  How did they manage to make a hexmap game without zone of control?  What were they thinking?  And where are the tradeoffs for the specials?  Why isn't your hero on the field somewhere?) it could be really good, but as it stands it's weak and unsatisfying. "

												Short and relatively easy, but don't let those two things put you off the game. The music goes well with the game and the graphics are decent. The game is also pretty relaxing, it auto-saves after every battle, so if you do somehow lose, you'll only miss a few minutes. It's a simple turn-based game that involves some tactical thinking when planning on what troops you want to use, but overall it doesn't really matter what people you use unless fighting one of the bosses. Being able to level up is a nice touch, even though you're unable to replay won battles.			"

There are only 6 units, balanced but really nothing surprising - archer, better archer, healer, heavy armor, light armor infantry. Linear story, quite predictive but with a little humour along the way. Best part is just mechanics which are quite nice. Game lacks depth to be in par to Kings Bounty or Heroes, but is good starter to such games for less experienced players, and perhaps for mobile devices where it seems to originate from.

YouTube™ Video: Backlog Beatdown: Phil the Conquistadork Reviews BRAVELAND 

			Views: 28		

			Phil gets himself in a lather about games criticism thanks to Braveland, which, incidentally, is a decent game! Feel free to subscribe:...		

It’s fairly standard fare for a fantasy turn-based strategy game. You make your way across a slowly expanding map with various vistas and nasties to kill. You hire on bigger and badder troops as you fight bigger and badder enemies. You gear up your general, you kill a few bosses, and BAM: the game’s over. Wham, bam, thank you Sam… Wise.			"

												Braveland feels--and looks--a lot like a Facebook game, right down to the fact that there are a limited number of battles on the map, and therefore a limited amount of gold available to you. This means that you have to decide very carefully on what you will spend your gold on: troops, troop abilities, or equipment, and the wrong choice early on can ruin your chances later in the game.Other than this incredibly annoying fact, there are other, smaller annoyances: Units can only counter-attack the first unit to attack them.  You cannot view a numerical value of current health, even though damage is indicated numerically. No matter how much Fury you have, you can only use your Fury once per turn. Enemy units ALWAY target healers, then archers/crossbowmen, then melee units. Going so far as to cross the entire battlefield and surround themselves with melee units to get to them. Healers can only heal twice per battle. The story is the horribly cliche: ""Peasant in outlying village sees wrongdoing in the kingdom and embarks on a quest to kill the evil king""Overall, while the gameplay is sort of fun, and the pricetag is reasonable, I can't really recommend it.

												So first off, I got a discount coupon for this game which brought it down to like $1.40 so I decided to try it out. After playing it for a couple hours I realized that this is a much simpler turn-based strategy game the most others in the genre. I, however, do not mean that in a negative way for two reasons: one, I feel this would be the perfect game to play if you are younger and wanted to try your hand at the strategy genre and two I feel this is a very casual game that would be a good stress releiver when you just need something simple.While I haven't played it all the way through just yet, I would still recommend it for the low price-tag of $5 for either of the two above reasons.

												Braveland is a casual strategy RPG which follows the incredibly standard plot of Dude's Village Is Pillaged -> Go Revenge It. I'm going to start off by saying that I played through the entire story campaign on Hard Mode; I recommend doing this because it feels like the best way to get a decent challenge out of this game.Combat in the game takes place as turn-based tactical skirmishes on small hexagonal battlefields, with a particular emphasis on troops. That is to say, each character on the battlefield is actually made up of multiple people of the same class, with their stats stacking on top of each other. As these troops take damage and lose bodies, so too do their stats dwindle, similar to Advance Wars, and probably a lot of other games I haven't played because I am a huge scrub. This creates an interesting dynamic where it's not always the correct option to focus damage on one enemy troop at a time, but rather spread damage out enough to make enemy attacks feeble rather than fatal. Additionally, there's a long-term concern in the form of gold: You have to pay a penalty out of your gold reward at the end of combat to recover lost allies, and there's no way to grind for extra gold, so keeping losses to a minimum is paramount.Progression is semi-linear. You go across a three-region map from skirmish to skirmish, picking up new allies and abilities along the way. There are short side paths to turn onto which end with treasure, stat upgrades, and shops to purchase additional units for troops as well as equipment to put on your main character — who inexplicably, despite being a warrior's son and built like such, doesn't have any actual presence in battle, instead preferring to radiate his stats onto his troops from the sidelines I guess. The early game can be pretty brutal due to the lack of troops and gold to enhance them with, though this gradually becomes less of an issue as income outpaces expenses. It isn't exactly clear how the stats on your main character affect your troops either, so to be honest I just didn't bother with equips until the best were available for purchase. Upgrading troops directly seems to be the best use of money anyhow — a massive clump of one-star Peasants can be surprisingly effective!Graphically, the game is colorful and the environments are nice enough to look at, though the character models are a bit too reminiscent of a high school Flash animation for my taste. On the other hand, the music, while inoffensive, only consists of two tracks: The one used for travel and the one used for combat. Not even the final boss gets a different song, which I found quite disappointing.Overall, Braveland was an enjoyable experience for a rather unassuming casual title. The campaign lasted around 4-5 hours for me to clear it 100%, which is a decent length for the $2 it tends to go for on sale. There's also a Survival mode where you just play battles and spend gold on upgrades in-between, which to be frank I didn't bother with too much. Unfortunately, I've heard that the sequel, Braveland Wizard, adds the ability to grind for gold and apparently makes it feel necessary to do. Kind of ruins the need for strategic planning at that point.			"

A very short game to spend an evening playingThis is a nice cheap game that is meant to just have a fun little evening playing, it has little to no replay value, so if you're tight with your money, or expecting a long playthrough, I wouldnt suggest this game.However, if you're looking for some way to spend an evening, gain some easy achievements to add to your ""perfected games"" roster like I was, then this is definitely a good buy for you.Pros & Cons+/- Stragetic combat system, although easy, it is possible to challenge yourself with refusing the loss of any character // save on recovery costs.+/- Quick game- Lacking an evolved storyline, a pretty generic one of gaining an army for vengance on those who hurt you and those aorund you.
