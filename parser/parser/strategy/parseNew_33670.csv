												Disappointing.  Disciples 2 was an amazing game with everything good about turn-based games.  Disciples 3 falls very short with too much simplicity and a strange storyline, plus the voice acting is terrible.			"

												This game makes me sad. I loved Disciples II, and I really wanted to like the third version, but the longer I played the game the more I kept asking myself ""why?"" The story is drivel. You have to fully watch the 20 second animation for every spell you cast. The user interface is a completely overwraught, tangled mess. Worse there's no gameplay to speak of. See, all the difficulty is frontloaded. The first ~20 turns are just unreasonably hard, even to a veteran of the series on normal difficulty. Worse, after you level up basically once, you are just coasting on easy mode with an unstoppable army. Why bother playing?			"

												OK, let's say ""recommended"" because the dark fantasy universe is really nice and because that makes a good-looking tactical RPG catchy enough to stay stucked on it a few hours.For the rest, I would say that this game is far too easy if you are patient enough to do some levelling (to be started again at EACH of the game level from the beginning) thus making it awfully repeatitive, with  too few tactical possibilities. At the end, I was just leaving the computer resolving automatically the fights... well, that's not really what you expect from a game. So recommended for a short time and as a starter if you cannot bear teddy-bears high-fantasy worlds, but unfortunately quite fast boring.			"

												If you can get over that it's not like disciples 2, then you'll probably see that this game is nice. +Atmoshere (can say that's the best thing about the game)+Music+Battle (yes i liked it)+Solid gameplay-Voice acting. Seriously it's the worst voice acting i've ever heard. ever.-Gets repetitve after a while.-Not very good use of map design. Looks great, but gamplay-wise feels kinda empty.I've played worse and even more boring turn based strategy games than this. I wouldn't rate it a 10 that's for sure, but i think the ratings it received were a bit harsh. A solid 7.5/10 from me.			"

												Great game but it feels so different from Disciples 2 and took a while to get used to. Sadly the thing that bothered me the most was the fact that you couldn't play as the epic dwarves (the mountain clans). That was my favorite race of all time from Disciples 2 and it was basically left out in this game. Don't get me wrong you can still fight the random dwarf groups on the map but you weren't allowed to play as them. And I really wanted to own the enemy with my giants (Son of Ymir's)... but nope. They were going to make an expansion that added the dwarves as a playable class like they did with the undead. But sadly that's not gonna happen since they're going out of business and they released some remastered garbage of the previous Disciple 3 games.			"

												After playing previous games in the series, and finishing all the Heroes games but still wanting a fix of this sort of game, I ended up getting this on a bundle sale.  Started disappointing due to the clunky dialog and lacklustre gameplay, but I continued on if only to keep me visually stimulated whilst listening to audiobooks (the background musics alright, but not for over 50 hours of play).Midway the bugs started kicking in, including (but not limited to) units stacking inside each other, inventory screens and city screens remaining visible on the overworld, level ups not registering... but usually restarting the game would fix these and I figured I'd got halfway through so may as well finish.Then I reached the elf campaign.  I pride myself on not resorting to easy modes as a general rule, but this game makes it nigh-on impossible to get past the first couple of enemies on any higher difficulty.  After that point I was disappointed to find I couldn't raise the difficulty, meaning the rest of the game I was auto-battling every fight including bosses with little to no casualties.  The only input I had as a player was clicking from fight to fight, following a relatively linear path until completing the map.  But still, near the end of the game... I may as well see how the (bland and generic) story plays out.Final map.  I'm tired of this game now and just want it to be finished.  I level up my party to their highest ranks but then I ignore all treasure in favour of getting to the end.  I reach the final gate, get a cutscene preparing for the final boss, and...?  That's it.  A script error causes a new objective to come up to destroy the city you just destroyed.  Some say they fixed it by downloading a revised script, but no luck for me.  161 hours of gameplay (half of which was actual playing as I'm afk a lot), only to reach a brick wall at the very end.Nevertheless I'll be playing the expansion, as I paid for it as part of the bundle, but seriously- don't bother starting the same journey as me.

												Disciples III, is my first introduction to the series, so I have no basis for comparison with previous Disciples games. Disciples III is a turn-based strategy game, utilizing a combination of point and click movement when out of combat, and a turn-based game grid whenever combat is initatied, each featuring varied terrain. You can play as one of three races; The Elven Alliance, The Legion of the Damned, and The Empire. It seems like an interesting game. The visuals are not bad, and there appears to be a backstory, for those interested in an all around experience. It isn't a bad game by any means, but probably not one I would go out of my way to play. It feels generic to me, but that could be because I've seen dozens of other games all with a similar premise, and varying degrees of similarity in graphics, movement, and style. Disciples III is well done and deserved a thumbs up, but make sure before you buy it, that it is the kind of game you are going to enjoy.			"

The graphics are better (obviously) but that really REALLY doesn't make up for the multiple shortcomings found within this title. DO NOT BUY			"

												i would recommend this game to a friend or someone who likes the turn-based Strategy type games but there are a few problems i think with the game:- Mountain Clans and the Undead are not a playable race.- early in missions/scenarios enemies scale much higher then what you do but when you level up once your just over  poweredI am not sure what they did to the thief either whether they changed him so he can't do actions e.g.(infiltrate spy, poison party, duel leaders or a party, (or if you had chosen the guild master leader then you got extra actions like assassinate random unit in a party and steal gold or a spell from the enemy Base).the main pro of this game for me is:- the way battles are taken is more stratical then Disciples II:- part of map where you can do 2X magic, ranged or melee damage.- animations are much better as well.Personally on my opinion i say that Disciples II: galleen's return was much better in fact prob the best of the series if you bought this one over Disciples II  i would call you crazy unless  you haven't played number 2 yet			"

												I haven't played any of the previous Disciples titles. Maybe that's my advantage, because so far I like it.What you certainly should not expect is a challenging strategy game of the good old days. This is a dumbed down version with a lot less freedom and strategic variety and you possibly will play the campaign only once and possibly never touch multiplayer at all because the game does not really allow enough strategic options for that and the gameplay by itself is not as compelling.That said: what you should expect is up-to-date graphics (with a darker theme than the Heroes series), charming musical themes and a nice story with some twists. The story itself is not new I'm afraid: fallen angel trying to take over the world (again).  To do that the dark overlord needs a ""Mc Guffin"" that in turn everybody chases after. That's it.Same old story of the devil taking over the world that has been told so many times now that it's hard to tell which game is a rip-off of which. However: it's nicely told and has some compelling bells and whistles and twists.Three factions are available in three campaigns that build up on one another. Cutscenes (so far as I have seen any) are rare and are mostly zooming in and out of hand-drawn black and white still-images with (really good) voice-over.Over all the game will keep you busy for a few days.It's not brilliant, it's not perfect. But if you are looking for an entertaining, easy-going distraction with simple (not too complicated) gameplay, it is worth taking a look at. If you are a looking for any more than that, this game is not for you.			"

												I was a HUGE fan of the original franchise. Turn based, somewhat interesting combat, and all kinds of fun mechanics to learn and optimize. Disciples III seems to have precisely one thing in common with the previous games: the name. I guess the turn based combat is also shared, but is vastly different. Indeed, this entire game feels more like someone saw the gorgeous art of the first two, and thought, ""Hey, we own this franchise. Let's make more gorgeous art, and redo everything else! They'll come crawling for it!"" The only real positive I can say beyond how pretty it is is that I didn't pay full price. The engine is .... stupid. The world economies are 'smoothed out' to the point of being stupid. Now, suddenly, you can only control parts of the world with strategically placed control points: there are no 'holy person's to drop a control rod to annoy the opposition. The inventory system is atrocious (Really?? I have to scroll to the right one column at a time, after I select the right interface screen, just to consume the potion I just got??) as is the advancement system. I'm all for advancement trees, but this is just ludicrous. And the story is .... shallow, to say the least. Oh, and thank you soooooooooooooooooo much Game Designers and Developers for not allowing me to turn off the spell animations. Sure they're pretty once or twice, and I admire them for that. But EVERY TIME???? Come on!EDIT: Oh, and I entirely forgot! I've watched the CPU's heroes literally walk through encounters to take over resources. Walking through encounters applied to my own avatar, so they could just go about their thievery and bypass me completely. And let's also not forget that not only can the computer target you with offensive spells when there is Absolutely No Way It Could Know Where to Target the Spell, but their low level attack spell does damage AND removes my ability to cast a spell that turn as well. You know, because it's ""fun"" and ""challenging"".Trust me. Save your money and get Disciples 1 or 2. They're much better games.			"

												I was among those people who waited release of this game with excitement! However, as many other fans of Disciples II, I was disappointed.I completed the story with the Empire (Humans) and started to play with the Legions (Demons), hoping that I will find something that will get me going, however I didn't. Although the story is quite interesting and I wanted to find out what will happen next, the battles are so repetitive, that I just caught myself thinking: why do I even play this game?I guess it's faster to just watch the intro in Disciples 3: Resurrection - it gives a pretty good summary of what happened in Disciples 3: Renaissance.I feel too much influence from Heroes of Might and Magic V in this game, which, in my opinion, is not a good example of turn-based strategy. I think the developers should have sticked to their own principles as seen in Disciples II.This game is not all bad, there are also some good things and improvements, so to be fair I'll list both pros and cons.Pros:- Great graphics, although sometimes there are so many details, that it is hard to distinguish objects.- Zoom in/zoom out - missed that one in Disciples II.- The player has very specific choices about how one can develop his character. I particularly liked that you can develop your leadership up to 7 (and even 8 with specific items). Also transform, revive and other additional leader skills come quite handy.- It's much easier to conquer enemy capitals. In Disciples II you had to use whole arsenal of potions, artefacts and spells to atleast have a chance against defenders of the capital (and not always it was enough).- Node guardians is a good idea. They are strong and most of the time they are able to defend themselves, so you don't need to worry about loosing your resources and burdensome rod-planting character management as in Disciples II.- Achievements. Atleast for me they provide a bit of extra motivation.- Thief is a fully-functional leader with initial leadership of 3. In Disciples II, Thief had no leadership.- You can carry all you items to the next act. In Disciples II, you could only take five items with you.Cons:- Battle system is the worst aspect of this game. The battles are long and repetitive. After few level ups, when it's not possible to lose anymore, I think everyone finds himself pressing the Quick resolve button. Also I found the obstacles annoying. They needlessly limit the movement of units. Also I'd rather prefer the static battles without tactical map movement as in Disciples II. Thus the initiative actually had some meaning.- No shortcuts, except for Space (End turn)- Camera rotation and zoom level in battles also are far from perfect. It's not possible to rotate the battlefield 360 degrees and zoom level is not sufficient - all units look small. The lower corners are almost out of reach. If an enemy is hiding in the right lower corner, you have to turn camera to that corner on every attack to actually perform it. And that is annoying.- Sometimes it's hard to find the way, because there are trees or building covering the field of view.- Not only spells are limited to once per turn (twice for Archmage), but this limitation apply to whole of the spellbook. In Disciples II, this limitation applied only to a particular spell. So, spells are not actually that important for victory and it's not worth to research them all. Most of the time I used only healing and damage spells.- I never had a need to use a thief. I don't actually know what is his special trait. So Guild as a building is useless. Atleast for me.- Due to spell limitations and lack of Thief actions, it does not make that much of a difference which gameplay style you choose (Warlord, Archmage or Guildmaster).- Also the interface is not very intuitive. It took me about 45 minutes to understand how this game works.My overall rating is 5/10.I think I will return to this game just to enjoy the story and graphics, when I will have nothing better to play. And perhaps my opinion will change. But for now, I can't recommend this game to anyone.p.s. Disciples 3: Reincarnation is out, which is sort of a remake of Renaissance and Resurrection. Perhaps it is better. So if you are considering to try Disciples 3 afterall, perhaps you should buy Reincarnaction.			"

												I played through all 3 stories, but I got the worst bug ever on a computer game.  After I did everything to finish the last level, there was supposed to be a portal to enter to fight the final boss.  This portal did not appear, so the game just left me stuck on the map with nothing that could be done to finish the game.  I got this game in a bundle deal so it we very cheap, but it was a waste of time to play.  You play the same battle on the same battle map over and over as you walk down a 1 way path that has encounters closer together than the old RPGs and you can see the enemy on the map, but you have to fight almost every one since the path is too small to walk past them.  All they did was reskin the battle map and enemies and units on your team and they have you relevel your units each time you get to a new level even though it is super easy because they put in buildings you can click to buff your party and spells that basically let you cheat in game.  When you get to a certain point, you can buy unlimited stat raising items and make an invincible character.  I'm not sure if this was a glitch since on some levels the stat potions were limited, but others they were unlimited.  I also had a glitch on a few levels where the game would freeze if I ended my turn.  I could only play by using editting my movement points so I could complete the level without ending the turn that would freeze the game.  I liked the music and the artwork.  The story could have been good if it was fleshed out more and had longer cut scenes.  The game plays just like King's Bounty or HOMM, but you have single units instead of the moronic stacks that the other games have, so I had hoped this would be the first tactical game on the PC that is similar to the console games like FFT, Fire Emblem, or Shining Force.  All of those game had single units that you developed, maps to fight on that changed shape between levels instead of just randomly laying some rocks and bonuses on squares, and could be played through without a game breaking bug.  Maybe I should give up on ever having a game like that on the PC.  I just wish I had my time back.Do not buy this game on Steam.  If you get this game in a bundle, save yourself a disapointement, and just never play the game.  Maybe have Steam hide it or file it to your junk games group.			"

												A great game with turn based, isometric map movement set in a medieval fantastic, dark gothic world. I like the improvements over Disciples II such as having a bigger party, having skills for your heroes, attributes, levels and even a paperdoll to equip items. The art direction or style remains the same as in Disciples II; It's gothic medieval fantastic and epic. The map, the units and the battles are all in 3d. In the single player campaign (only thing I've played), there are about 24 maps (I might be wrong) divided in Legions (Chaos), Humans and Elves. So about 8 maps for each race and each map can take more than an hour to finish. You can hire multiple heroes and transfer units between your heroes (as well as items) at will once both heroes are next to each other. There are permanent stat and skills boosters available to purchase. You can hire mercenaries, capture towns, build your capital, reinforce your ""nodes"". The battles are now played on a bigger board than in Disciples II. Each of your unit can move around the map and some spots you can move to have random bonuses specific to a unit's class (ranged, melee, magic).Bad sides: I don't know why they removed the ""wait"" action. Sometimes, my hero would be surrounded at my first turn (by a rock in front of him and 2 units on each side plus a full rank behind). Since my hero has the highest initiative, he acts first and thus cannot just ""wait"" but ends up defending, which messes up everything regarding the deployment. The battles can be a bit long and repetitive, even with randomized terrain but I should check the options to skip animations at least.Overall a must-try for Disciples fans and well worth trying for newcomers in search of deep turn based strategy and tactics with stunning artistic presentation.

												70 hours in and all campaigns complete except Elven final. After first being disapointed when comparing to the classic D2 this game rocks and still brings on the table what made original Disciples II + expansions such classic games. 'Good ol' Disciples!' is what a scarred veteran would say. If you are experienced with the series you will dislike the tactical map and some bugs/balance issues as the game was rushed to production. Game contains some 'press button to win' -type of strategies but cranking up the difficutly and maybe using some iron man rules will ensure that the AI will beat you so hard your (unborn) kids will get bruises. As is normal to the series. Not kidding here: this game series is known to be unfair. ganking AI, tough fights, extremely hard boss fights is what made D2 a classic. D3 is on the same track but more accessible and easier - if user so wants so no more going through all missions and then getting stuck on the last boss. A very good thing actualy as this part was usualy the last straw before a rage quit in D2. What game newbies should play is harder to say. This game series is incredibly tough on newbies as this is not HOMM.  D2 has no bugs and is extremely streamlined and hard as hell. D3 is easier but with bugs/exploits and easier on the eyes. Nevertheless newbies should expect nothing but hard missions and a very, very unhappy ending once you finaly reach the end of a campaign. This is no happy-happy joy HOMM frolicking around collecting resources -game.			"

												Disciples III is a game that I ultimately expected more from. The Disciples series was something of a cult hit and Disciples II:Dark Prophecy was one of my favorite turn based games. The series has always been noted for its beautiful gothic art style that reminds you of Arthur Rackham's illustrations. That said the artwork in Disciples III is what one would expect from the franchise. The maps, units, buildings are all detailed well enough. However the gorgeous art design can't hide some of the game's shortcomings when it comes to gameplay. The story is ok but the narrator lacks the dark tone that the narrator in Disciples II had. And it ultimately feels like D3 drones on for far too long before you even get into the mission. There is also a distinct lack of the short animated cutscenes that punctuated each mission in Disciples II. One change that I do appreciate is that when you equip your hero with items those items are displayed on said hero. Its a small cosmetic change but it is appreciated. The new gameplay mechanics have you moving your units on a hex grid which is alright but ultimately does little to add any sort of meaningful depth to the series. Part of what made Disciples and Disciples II so appealing was that while simple; there was a surprising amount of depth in what unit types faced off, which units were in the front, which were in the back. Also curious is the omission of the Mountain clans and undead hordes as playable factions.Disciples III was terribly buggy upon its initital release and some may still be found now though I found it to be fairly stable from my playtime. In the end I would recommend the game if you are a fan of the series; but would suggest waiting for a steam sale as the price of admission is too high for what you may be expecting from the franchise. I can't help but feel part of that may stem from the change in developers from Strategy First to Akella.			"

												I own both this game and Disciples 2, I'm a bit surprised by all the negative reviews. Let's face it, both games are pretty clunky and unintuitive by today's standards. They do things a bit differently from each other but share most of the core mechanics and the unique dark fantasy aestethics that are the series main claims to fame.If you like Disciples 2 but haven't tried the third installment yet, I really think you should give it a try, play the tutorial, maybe pop into the campaign, keep it under 2 hours and refund if you don't like it.Personally I predict myself playing single scenarios for at least another 15-20 hours, and maybe some more of the campaign, all in all pretty good for its price tag.

Dunno if it should even count as ""Role Playing"" since the lore is same old elves/orcs bla bla nothing interesting. Maybe I could see this game a little more reasonable to buy if its price was a fair amount for what it offers, but sadly at this price there are a lot better alternatives to this.			"

												I like the game, I thought that I might like it but it has exceeded my expectations because the bad reviews really had me debating about if it was worth a try.. I bought if for $3.00 on sale and I have 11 hours in already when I'm writing this. I'm sure that I'll put many more hours into it as I try to finish the 3 campaigns and I already feel that I got my moneys worth from it.There are so many negative reviews that I felt that I had to give my opinion on this one. It's not the best of it's type but it's far from the worst. If you typically like games like this then I suggest that you give it a try and see for yourself, grab it in the next big sale or just try it at regular price and refund it if you don't like it.. I like it well enough that I added all of the other Disciple versions to my wishlist and I plan to grab them all during sales.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this one. And its so sad because the earlier games I loved! The darker tone in this game and in the old ones was what caught my attention. But this one is just messy. It forces you to watch all the animations. you cant skip some parts and the story isnt as good as in the older games. I have also had issuse where the angle during battle have just gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥and I have had to play the whole battle from underground. xD Total mess! I know that you shouldnt compare to much since this is another game, but its hard no to when Disciples 2 was so good.I guess I will give it a recommendation. I mean its not all♥♥♥♥♥♥but it not all sunshine and roses either. Wish there was an in between recommandation.			"

												Wow after 98hours of intense gameplay, I finally finished it. What an epic journey it was. Ofcourse it's not better than the disciples II but it's really worth it. I got it on a sale and I got so much fun for barely a couple of cents that I spent. How's the story? Not the greatest but still it lives upto the expectations. Gameplay? Gameplay is fun I miss the old interface(which was awesome) but still it's enjoyable. I hope they bring back the old disciples playstyle back and continue the saga.The only Major bug that I encountered was the one which was preventing me from doing the Third Act's(Elven Campaign) final quest. Fortunately I found a fix for it and Finished the game.Do I recommend this game ofcourse I do. Get it and do not forget to get a fix for the final chapter. Incase if you need any game related help just feel free and ask away.<3 Disciples Disciples Disciples <3			"

												A big disappointment compared to Disciples 2!Graphics looks worse, it seems that there was a large budget cut in voice acting and story-writing, the levelling system is weird, the game is imbalanced (you find youself attacked by lvl 8 creatures 5 turns into the game, but you fight lvl 5-10 creatures after 60 turns, when you've snowballed out of control).They've adopted a hexagonal grid (HoMaM style), which takes away so much of this series charm. Overall there are so many imbalanced features and an AI that's not very bright, the only way that it will beat you is by bruteforce, before you get a few lvls under your belt.			"

												If you have a ton of time to burn and you want a strategic RPG in the vein of Might n Magic and you've already played Might n Magic and King's Quest and literally everything else in this genre, this would be a good way to spend your time. otherwise, play a better game. it has: nice graphics. a setting I could actually probably care about, maybe. it does not have: polish, sophistication, an appropriate sense of strategy other than grinding levels, good voice acting, good music, or anything else that might make this an diamond in the rough.

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. But I just couldn't. The tutorial its a joke, you'll just have to learn almost everything by clicking and trying things. If that's not enough, the game by itself sucks. The battle system suck hard, and there's not much of a choice to make in-battle, its simply run and beat, pretty obviously. The XP leveling its crappy (XP divided among the group, even to those caracters that did not participate a little bit with the fight), and you gain almost no xp after killing enemys much, much higher leveled than you.The graphics its OK... and thats about it. Congrats to the team that did that. But to those ppl responsible for the gameplay... dead just wouldn't be enough.The worst part its that I boughted also the sequel - ressurection, and I think I just dont have the guts to try... at least, I didn't get reincarnation like I wished... and (tks to God) failed to trade.Botton of line, if you're thinking to buy this game, forget that and go do something more fun, like get shoted in the knee, or rapped.Just write this down to avoid more ppl, like myself, get iluded by this game.

												Honestly? Like others said. Save your money and buy the Disciples 2 set.  The maps were a series of linear paths, the campaign was pretty tedious for me and the difficult curve pretty damn crazy.  The first two scenarios were not particularly tough even at the highest difficulty.  The last one I found brutal even on easy.Oh and the magic? Pretty worthless and unimaginative.  Pretty much all of the sides have carbon copy spells, the only difference is how much it heals or damages.  Which for any veterans of the series know that all four of the original races had clear advantages in one area or another with some overlap between the respective good or evil sides.I'm sure I can think of other negatives but I really don't want to.  The positives was the fancy graphics and the music... which actually still pales in comparison to the previous games in my opinion.Which reminds me of citys/capitals... you might as well not bother leaving your people at them because they do not function as effective fall back points or R&R sites. Partly because the basic units are so weak and the other side because any stationed armies can still get blasted back into the stone-age.  All in all I found the game to be deeply disappointing, to say nothing of the node guardians or lord bonuses... Don't play anything other than a warlord.  The mage is pretty pointless and so is the guildmaster.			"

												It feels like it wants to be among Heroes of Might and Magic and Kings bounty. Although I only managed to play through half the human campaign before giving up out of boredom it felt just lazy and boring.You get only one Choice of units for each scenarioas you got only 1 city to upgrade, and although you can recruit more heroes, there is really no point. You can also get permanent stat icreases from potions and money is not a problem as long as you can wait some turns and since there is nothing else to buy, why not.Speaking of turns... They are nigh irrelevant as most of the turns you're the only one active.The only good thing about the game I saw so far was the theme of the humans. It's the rabid theocratical one that is very close to the one in Warhammer 40K and that brought me a big smile.All in all a bland repetetive game. 3/10			"

												I'd just like to say that the artstyle/ art direction in this game in wonderful and unique compared to many other fantasy games. The designs are crazy detailed and the character and loading screen art is beautiful.That said. To make this an AMAZING game gameplay wise, it needs to have an option to speed it up a bit. When casting a global spell you can pretty much afk and the spell MIGHT be finished casting byt the time you come back (you can't do anything in game while it's being casted). That's crazy and should never happen. ALSO battles. Why is there not a combat speed option like almost every other game of this genre? Sure you can kill the camera zoom but that doesn't do much for speed. I dunno about anyone else, but during battles I would definitely be ok if units could move and attack at least 50% faster. No, I don't like quick combat.Why do I recommend this game?Because this kind of game is hard to come by these days, It's not the best but it's beautiful and functional enough to get you by if you're looking for a turn based strategy to waste some time with.

												Disciples III is one of the ♥♥♥♥♥iest HOMM clone I have ever played in my entire life. The storyline is a cluster-♥♥♥♥ of confusion that left me giving zero ♥♥♥♥s about any of the characters or plot. The dubbing combined with the equally terrible and unenthusiastic voice acting killed any possible enjoyment I could have from this game. The enemy A.I is the embodiment of retardation, I literally build an army hit auto combat and win EVERYTIME. World design and graphics are super repetitive. There are three campaigns; the only differences between them are these insignificant storyline and your party minions. The world map design doesn’t change much, and the storyline is so pointless that you probably won’t even notice a difference in plot. Want to play old school strategy RPG? Go play HOMM. Want to play New School RPG? Go play Kings Bounty Cross-worlds. Skip this turd.			"

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #48 - Disciples III: RenaissanceI'll start with a disclaimer that I've never played any of the other Disciples games, so I didn't have any particular expectations coming into this game.   But, having played some turn based fantasy strategy games before, I kind of had an idea what to expect.I can't say my immediate first impression was that great, as the game opens up with a narrated cutscene that sounded like they just asked someone in the office to record rather than spending the money on an actual voice actor.The game offered a choice of game modes when I started a new game.  For my review, I stuck to the Campaign game mode, and started with the tutorial, which acts as an introductory mission to the overall campaign.  Gameplay seems pretty similar to the other turn based games I've played, with my party moving around on an overland map gathering resources.  When running into encounters, the game will then switch to a tactical hex based map where turn based combat takes place.  It didn't seem like there were a lot of options in the actual fight.  Each of the party members has a basic ""attack"" which varies based on the type of character it is.  For instance my main character did a melee attack.  But other character types can shoot arrows, cast an offensive spell, or heal other party members.  Characters can also go into a defensive stance rather than attacking.Another hallmark of these types of games are the towns that you can upgrade to add other building types, which in turn unlock other types of characters that can be recruited into your party.There is some customization you can do with your main character.  As you progress and get experience, you will end up getting skill points which you can spend to buy skills.  You also get attribute points which you can use to up your main attributes.  Treasure can be found on the overland map and certain items will be equippable by your main character, which generally serve to upgrade stats.I got through the tutorial and played about 30 minutes into the first mission.  It never seemed difficult to me at all, but I was playing on easy, so that is a reasonable expectation.  I'm just not sure if it's supposed to ramp up in difficulty in later missions.The UI is servicable but felt a little clunky at times.  I didn't like the fact that I couldn't hit Escape to bring up the options menu.  Instead you have to click the gear icon at the top right.  In fact pretty much all of the menus in the game are accessed by clicking a particular icon, but it wasn't always obvious from looking what icon did what.  It took some getting used to.I did like how right clicking on anything of interest would give you a popup with details on whatever you clicked on.  At a minimum the popup will tell you what the item is and what it does.  I also liked how if the item was 'recharging' (such as a well that you can drink from every 4 turns), it would tell you how many turns left until it could be used again.Overall I found the game to be a bit simplistic for a strategy game, but reasonably easy to pick up.  I do think there are much better turn based strategy games out there that I would recommend instead of this.  Still, I had fun in the time I played so I can give this a lukewarm recommendation.			"

												Although this game is like HOMM series, I believe that this game could use a bit more troops. I like the idea of leveling up your troops, but the it starts to get boring after awhile and easy. I never played the Disciples series, but it has so much potential, that the developers just decide to not add. There is a few bugs, but needs more replayability. 6/10 for appealing graphics.			"

												if you're going to make a blatant clone of an existing game format (Heroes of Might And Magic) then you might as well pull out all the stops and make a better game.  And that's what they've done here.  A grown-up clone, without the My Little Pony and Tinkerbell stuff.  They've focused on the good bits -- movong your player piece across the board, entering into staged battles with enemies you encounter -- and dumped the junk -- all those dancing elves and glittery stuff.  The learning curve is steep at first as you have to work out the magic system -- different systems for on the board and in staged battles -- but once you know what you're doing it flows really nicely.  Can get a little repetitive, but then what game doesn't?  Lovely graphics, ambient music, altogether an absorbing game.  Don't get too attached to Lambert, as you lose him at the end of the ""human"" interest story, no matter how you play it.  Bit nasty of the authors to do that really....The ""achievements"" aren't much, you win them during the normal course of the game, the only ones you need to look out for are the ones where you deliberately have to under-achieve, like using no magic, or finishing a level with no gold (spend it on teams in your capital or on upgrades from the veteran), or not building parts of your city that won't be used...only a perfectionist would want to do any of that.

												I've played the whole game & it's a total garbage compared to previous series.TLDR; Don't play it, if you don't want to waste your time. If you're interested in the boring story, then just read the summary. And even that is an absolute waste of time.Good things:- the graphics- long gameplay (something truly rare nowadays)- stats & skills of the heroes (+ the playful upgrade mechanism)- the final battle (absolutely epic!)- the second chapter is quite interesting :)- the story teller has a really great voice (+ the truth behind the character is a nice surprise)Neutral- battlesystem (90% copy of homam battlestyle)- the design of the races & units (some designs are spectacular & inovating, some are just plain copypasta or, compared to previous series, totally downgrading)- side-quests (mostly the same, but still better than nothing)- the first chapter (eeehhh… kinda boring, but it's fine for getting used to the mechanics 'n stuff)Bad things:- plain characters (3 main heroes, who are all swordsmen? annoying simple villain? a damsel in distress with superpowers? one of the main heroes is actually bad & interesting, but you have to FORCIBLY turn him into a good guy? are you even trying??)- shallow & unnecessarily long story (15 chapters of obvious & cliche tropes)- uninteresting plot-twists- not so surprising ending- the same neverending soundtrack (I seriously had to switch to my own music after a few hours… it was incredibly annoying)- where the dwarves at?? (hopefully in another dlc, if it ever comes out)- unit quotes (absolutely uninteresting, underwhelming & mostly boring; only some of the characters have good quotes, otherwise they're totally lame. Example: a unit gets cursed: ""THIS IS A CURSE?!1!"" or ""THIS is a SPELL!!!"")- the third chapter (don't even get me started about this…)- the ♥♥♥♥ing glitches… (I had technical problems with the last battle, thus I had to browse for hours to find help & fix it)The game & the ideas had a really great potential → the cliche beginning was actually fine & could have been really nicely thought out through the following gameplay, the way the plot was passed from a race to race, the heroes skills, even the battlesystem (although totally copied). But goddammit, it was absolutely wasted & killed by the cliche story, characters, missions etc. The gameplay is like ""OMG! This thing is absolutely SERIOUS!! We gotta save the world!!1!"", so you get pumped about doing the♥♥♥♥♥♥ following the side-quests, building your army, leveling your heroes & then BAM! The cliche stuff totally kills the mood. I've never felt so demotivated about finishing a game in my life. I've wasted 70 hours on this garbage…So please, be wise & don't repeat the same mistake. It truly isn't worth it.			"

												The graphics are surprisingly good for a non-blockbuster with a few years on it. I enjoyed the movement mixed in with the turn based combat. For some reason, the games enemies were scaling much faster than my own characters. I never quite got the hang of this game and how it's meant to be played. I think the tutorial fell short and the game just never explained much thoroughly...that's why I can't reccommend it.			"

												This game seems to have changed since release. I remember playing it when it first came out and I was really not enjoying it, but apparently it has gotten some updates since then to smooth things out. I really really am liking it now. If you play it, you WILL have a bit of a learning curve because the UI isn't extremely obvious on how to do some things, but if you read a little on the online wiki about the game it will tell you how to do everything. It's just a matter of getting accustomed to the way it works. Other than that It is well worth a try if you can find it for a price you feel is good. It's great that this game had its early issues resolved because now it is on par with disciples 2, save for only having 3 races (missing undead which was my fave)			"

												I haven't played the other Disciplines games so I can't give you a comparison; however, if you judge Disciples III on its own or if you are new to the series, it is really a fun turn-based strategy/tactics game. Similar games that come to mind are King's Bounty or Heroes of Might and Magic VI. Personally I enjoyed this game more than those, and one of the features I really liked about Disciples III is that instead of just having 'stacks' of units like those other games, you create squads of units (you can hire multiple leaders) that will stay with you and level up, advance in ranks, and learn new skills. If you are familiar with the Ogre Battle series then this has some more similar aspects to that. There is a fair amount of depth to this game as you build up your castle, learn new spells, level up and choose your skill and class advancement paths, explore the world, and get involved in the story that spans 3 campaigns.There are some minor bugs that I ran into quickly such as the right-click tooltip system not always working properly (only happened once or twice and restarting fixed it) and the Esc key not always bringing up the game menu (you can use the mouse to click the menu button instead), but these were not enough to hinder my enjoyment of the game.

TL;DR: >> Go play Disciples III: Reincarnation instead! << Detailed:I played Disciples 2 through the whole of 2014, and loved it. Disciples 3 is a modernised, but overall worse game than its prequel.The Good:+ The core gameplay elements are the same as the previous game, aside of learning the 3D controls and upgraded battle mechanics, it's fairly easy to get back into the game if you played D2.+ The graphics have been updated for the current decade, everything is ""shinier"", the capitals look awesome.+ Very atmospheric and catchy background music.+ The new interactive objects slightly enrich the experience.+ The battles are more interesting with the added tactical movement map, though with manually controlling the movement of each unit they also take longer.+ You carry over most items in the leader's inventory between campaign acts. Also the shop in the capital is quite handy for selling all the junk from the previous act to boost the starting budget.The Mixed:~ Removing the rod-bearer unit is an interesting choice. Being able to conquer territory with the main team certainly makes the game flow smoother. On the other hand the vulnerable but essential rod-bearers added an extra tactical layer to D2.~ The times of the day alternating each turn is interesting, though I wish there was an option to just leave it on daylight. The others add atmosphere, but make the various items and enemies on the map harder to see. This leads to...~ Tons of achievements, but quite a few are unlockable without editing files or even with that. (x)The Bad:- The movement map is prioritising looks to the detriment of usability. Often interactive objects are only noticeable if you highlight them with the Alt key. Similarly the enemy units are mostly unnoticeable on the main map, and not even get highlighted by Alt.- Inconsistent stat names, eg. a potion says it gives extra Dexterity, but when used it actually increases Agility instead of Dexterity and vice versa.- The inventory feels a lot more cluttered than in D2 with the huge icons and no way to sort the items.- Only 2 hotkeys (for passing turn and highlighting map objects), even though many functions would sorely need it.- Buggy and not-user-friendly UI.- You can only carry over your beginning Leader between campaign acts, and most plot triggers only unlock with him. This basically forces you to play the whole campaign with a melee leader :(- You can only cast 1-2 spells in total per turn, instead of being able to cast 1-2 of each types of spell per turn as in D2.- Each time the players casts a spell, they have to wait for the whole 10-11 sec animation to finish before the game becomes responsive again. This makes the spells giving extra movement mostly useless, as passing a turn takes a fragment of the time compared to the spell's animation.- The Dwarf and Undead nations are missing. (Though at least they added the Undeads in the Resurrection edition, but we never get to play the Dwarves again.)- When you type a space in Steam overlay mode, the game passes a turn.- Way more so than the maps in D2, there's no feeling of open spaces, the maps feel very linear and railroad-like, robbing the sense of exploration.- The tactical maps are randomly generated, and their layout can significantly affect the battle.- The game doesn't show any more what percentage of land is controlled by the various factions, instead it shows the resource incomes in two different places. Also it's hard to tell apart the Empire territory from the Neutral lands, it was a lot better in D2.- Clichéd story and mostly badly written dialogues.- The narrator's voice acting is quite bad, he's trying, but his voice has no power or majesty to it, instead sounds like a slightly bored office worker. Also the elven unit voiceovers are horrible, instead of the previous game's ""elven language"", they speak English with a cheap ""metallic"" effect to distort their voice. Ew.- Some pointlessly sexualised female outfits.- Some of the sound effects are quite funny and unfitting. (eg. Peasant & Acolyte attacks)Verdict:I wanted to love this game, but I have strongly mixed feelings about it. It still provides some fun, but that's probably due to me loving the basic gameplay concept and its prequel. For someone else, who is not that much in love with these, it's probably a more frustrating than enjoyable experience.			"

												It's an interesting game but don't expect a lot of variety... Everything you do on the first map you will do again and again though each campaign. And that is ok, but it doesn't make for the most riveting game if you don't try something different with your units each map. While to two other factions do have different units and spells it only changes the wrapping not the mechanics. All that being said however it is a very detailed, mature, and polished game that I did like playing, though I had to play it in spurts.While it is not one of my favorite games I did enjoy it.			"

												I've been playing Disciples II for a long time before I found some good offer on the following chapter: I've played Renaissance, Reincarnation and Resurrection.Although Reincarnation was the one I enjoyed the most (but also the first I played), I have to admit I found Renaissance to be quite easier. And that appears quite strange and opposite compared to all the reviews I read on Steam.The big flaws of the game, in my opinion, are three:1. the fact you can't decide whether to attack or retire from a battle when you come across an enemy;2. you can't use shortcuts (at least, I'm not able to use them on Renaissance while I used them all the time on Reincarnation);3. battles can be a bit confusing if you don't pay attention when deciding every move: for example, if you click on an hex too far from your player he will go there on the next turn, but you can't set him on defensive status.Moreover, I didn't like the fact that range attacks can hit everywhere on the map, even on most distan hexes. I way prefer Reincarnation battle mode on this sight.Also, it's never clear which charachter got a level up, there's no sign to notify your hero can learn new abilities and so on.All in all, I'd surely suggest Disciples III - Renaissance to anyone fond of the Disciples trilogy, but if you want a more challenging, refined and precise game experience then you should definitely go for Reincarnation.

Tooltips when you hover over the buttons sometimes fail to appear, so if you don't understand what the stupid artwork means, you're on your own. Crashes when you alt+tab to another screen. Uneven volume levels. Vague objectives. Despite being a medieval fantasy game, characters speak with American accents (though usually there's no voice acting at all) and say things like ""what's up?"" Comical levels of incompetence.			"

The difference with the previous title is a minimum graphical update perhaps, but it offers not a thing more than what the old title offered. I'de say go and grab Disciples II - Gold, and you have a much more faster combat system, and really awesome music. For Disciples veterans, purchase this if you must when it is on sale.			"

												The words that I want to express in dismay about this game betrays the younger version of me that loved the two first installments of this series so dearly.. I say this with a bleeding heart - Do not buy this game in its current form, if ever!Many years ago I spent a vast amount of time loosing myself in the first installment of the series that was the cartoony, yet fantastic “Disciples – Sacred Lands” that really opened my eyes for turn-based RPG strategy.Years later I fell in love all over again with the dark fantasy driven Disciples II with enhanced game-play and a more grownup mentality – feeling as if the game had developed alongside me, capturing my attention with its new and developed sentiments. Leading to the present when I saw this game available on steam. I could not wait to get my hands on it and experience it, but little did I know what was in store.This game is the biggest gaming experience let-down I have had in years!!Not only is the game bugged beyond belief, bugs you can find in almost every aspect of the game-play; after countless hours of tedious grinding your way through an only semi-engrossing and ill-conceived plot, you find yourself at the end of the line, braced and ready for the final confrontation in a pitched battle only to find it missing.  MISSING!!!! Leaving you to run around purposelessly on the final map, feeling like a chump. I feel betrayed and there is only one thing to say and I repeat:Do not buy this game in its current form, if ever! "

												Disciples 3 Renaissance tries to improve over D2 in several ways, and it succeed to a certain extent+ you'll find dens with low level enemies to gain experience+ you can lead an army of 8 units+ combat maps are well thought out with strategic haxagons which do double damage+ all sort of buildings to improve your stats temporarily are scattered over the map+ an immersive and very detailed 3D environment+ each unit comes with a detailed background story+ magnificent animations and special effects: sorts are a sight, trees move under the wind, each units walks differently+ Inquisition, Angels and Demons, Dwarfs, Elves !+ day and night cycle+ the environment changes according to the owner (humans, elves or demons) as soon as you conquer or lose territoryIt also has the same defects of its predecessor- an army of level one units can be defeated by a couple of level 2 units, stats double from level 1 to level 2, you have no chance- as a consequence combat is frustrating at the beginning of a game- once your units have gained two levels through the corresponding buildings, your army is virtually unstoppable- ""Normal"" difficulty is punishing- units have only one line to say, which gets on your nerves rapidly- the game has a chilly pace, animations slow down the game immensely and become rapidly repetitive- bugs are plentifulTL; DRgraphics and environment 10/10units 10/10story 7/10 (nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition)combat 7/10 (from frustratingly difficult to quite satisfaying)music 6/10 (meh)Try it, it deserves your time.

Product received for free
												I played until the fifth Empire mission and decided it was enough, the story is boring and the combat is like that of the Heroes series with added RPG elements to heroes like stats (STR, END, AGI, DEX, INT) and items which feel unnecessary.The graphics in Disciples 2 looked better and the campaign was actually voiced which makes a huge difference.Pros It got me in the mood for Disciples 2. Cons Only the description at the beginning of the mission is voiced. Same units as Disciples 2 but without description and the units attack no longer has a name (i.e. Phantom Strike, Light Lance). Spell animations are generic and cannot be skipped. Game crashes often, a session can last between 5 and 45 minutes. "

												I'm not familiar with the Disciples series, mostly got this because a friend wanted to play the multiplayer. We never played multiplayer.Since I was very new to this series, I thought this was a turn based strategy game with a campaign and such. So I started as the human general.Completed the first leg of the campaign after searching the map and finding everything I could find, and figured I could finish upgrading my city in the next chapter. I was wrong.I'm not a fan of having to basically start from scratch at the beginning of each chapter. It feels too much like an RTS (like StarCraft), I did not see an RTS tag or any mention of such elements. Figured I'd progress through the campaign, upgrading cities and units while fighting turn based battles.I may have givin up a little too early, I don't know. It was a pretty crushing blow to see that my effort in finding loot and upgrading things was basically for nothing.			"

												(The majority of my gameplay was on my old computer, soooo steam dosnt have my 67 hours from my previous install @-@)As a Huge Disciples II fan i was sadly dissapointed with this tital.Leader export and a multitude of items and maps to use were not present in this game.Bugs and glitches were also very apparent such as the abyssial devil not having his trademark petrification attack.There were only 3 playable factions the Legions, Elves, and Holy Empire with no sign of the Undead of Mortis or the Mountain clans.What i will say though is that this game overall was beutiful, its overall artwork was great although there were some questionable design decisions about some characters.A sub par tital in the franchise that had alot more potential			"

												 Disciples Sacred Lands and Disciples II .. are some of the best turned based strategy games out there to date and they are .. old.. almost as old as Tactics Ogre, FF tactics, or Kingdom Under Fire. Not a lot of game companies can completly screw themselves out of a winning formula.. but they did it.. boy did they do it. If you ever played Koudelka another turned based game also made in 1999. You will see how they flip flopped the entirety of the battle machanic to something less desirable than the 2 original games from 99 and 02. I personally considered the static grittiness and archaic battle system far greater than most others.  And where's my flags? The genius of simplicity in the originals far outweighed the more advanced or presentable offerings than most current turn based games at that time. However the Hex design is done quite well. Even better than most Heroes games. What really irks me is the way the combatants hit eachother.. and theres no blood and guts.. like it was in the old game. When the enemies struck eachother..  it almost felt as if you were being struck or shot or blasted.. this just has a very poor way of illustrating a strike to an enemies body compared to the old game. A Town a TOWN my kingdom FOR A TOWN .. where is it? .. i could barely stomache 15 minutes before quitting on the second mission. I'll just hold it down and play through it.. but wheres my towns?.. I guess that's the price we pay for such stunning graphics.. oh well.. I really hope this game series.. GOES BACK .. to the original design that won them praises from even the most hardcore turned based strategies.. guess I'll just go play Xcom.. or Massive Chalice.. or maybe even reload that old campaign from Disciples 1 or 2.

												The game is lot of fun. Game is graphically better than disciples 2 and storyline is also fine. The worst thing is the ending :)At the end my game has a bug and i cant complete this game. Looked on lot of chats but only thing that helps is rewriting .exe file with a cracked one. I will not do this but it really pisses me off when autors didnt fixed this bug already cause the game is a few years old. But altogeter  the game was fun.			"

												Gameplay not too different from the previous the second game. The graphics is amazing! A little less gloomy than the previous one, but still amazing. My favourite fraction - the Elven aliance is in very similar style as before.			"

												Not as bad as online rreviewers claim. It's actually rather addictive like the previous installments albeit a bit on the generic side. There's also a bit more to the combat then fomer disciples games but it doesn't require more strategy.			"

												I had high hopes for this game but was sorely dissapointed. This game is actual doo doo.The main problem with Disciples III is that the game assumes you're already a pro who knows the ins and outs of the series. Unfortunately, if you're like me and this is the first Disciples game you've played, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. The AI will stomp you to the ground and kick you while you're down! Not worth buying except for the most fanatical of turn-based strategy fiends.			"

												The game plays like a heroes of might and magic /king bounty, you explore the map with your hero and when you have to fight it's a tactical turn by turn on a map  with hexagons.  Everything looks good, nice animation, art, background stuff, the tutorial being extremely boring you start playing the first campaign in normal mode. First, it's hard to say what you can click on or not, what are dungeons, what are bonus , you have to move the mouse pointer around to see it change so you know you can interact here with a building or a collectable but that's not the main problem I have with this game.This game is stupidly hard , it's borderline unplayable, I started the human campaign on normal, I've played a few turns, fought some easy beginning battles against weak mobs , started to upgrade my castle, then  some ennemies hunted me down and then attacked me.  I lost the battle, had a game over , started the game again healed my units just before the same fight and managed to survive, so yeah it's manageable, right? No , a few turns later the game sent another party of ennemies after me and after many tries I found this battle to be not winnable with the units I had. So I searched a bit on the net and apparently if you want to survive in the beginning you have to go straight to the strongest units you can train because the difficulty setting of the game is useless, you can meet hard fights as well as easy fights even if you play in easy mode.I don't see the point of that, in this kind of game you're supposed to have the choice between many strategic ways to win and in this game you have to minimax since the beginning, there is no discovery , no learning of what you can do or not, just go the uber units or die?
