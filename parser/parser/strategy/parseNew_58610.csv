												Fantastic game. Why?1. zoom system means that you can scale what you see from the entire battlefield to the regimental markings on a single tank - vast improvements over the RUSE system as well, the funny counters no longer appear2. each battle escalates as it progresses BUT unlike RUSE which had a semi Age of Empres resource system, units appear appear from off of the board3. the whole meta-game, for the first battle you play you actually only have a few units available, you need to unlock others as you complete the campaigns, play other people e.c.t. - your strategy will therefore be reflected in your army, did you unlock the artillery, or the helicopters?4. I am actually a miniature wargamer, this game is like an epic version of my favourite game in real life - 'Battlegroup:Kursk' - there is a whole supply mechanic which means you have to really plan your offensives, and defensive moves.If you like strategy, real strategy, then you may just be looking at the best game ever, I cannot praise it enough. If you are not so sure then I have had friends who have played this game and not enjoyed it so much: it can be confusing, complicated and annoying at first, but getting past the learning curve is well worth it.

												For MP, go to the latest game in series. For SP - here comes longer story.Many people claim that WG:EE have best SP campaigns. They are story driven and thus appears more interesting than skirmish-like ones. But there is one, massive problem existing - balance. Campaigns were not easy and thats good, since challange is part of having fun. But they are no longer just hard - many got elevated to ""impossible"" level due to patches, nerfs and, more importantly - massive AI buffs.AI simply cheats, as the last try to make it ""challange"". It dont need recon, ignore ""line of sight"" rules, can replenish ammunition and fuel before your very eyes, spawn units out of thin air, stay invisible next to your own recon units and so on. Performance was boosted in latest patches, making SP campaign missions unbalanced and nearly all old guides obsolete.There is no fun in that anymore, just frustration, abusing the system and beding the rules, simply to compete with cheating AI.I managed to beat the game but was it something to be proud of? No, I just felt glad that this is over.Dont believe the lies about SP campaigns. Get Red Dragon, if you want multiplayer but stay away from EE.			"

												As someone who played R.U.S.E for around 200~ hours, I adore this game. It is everything ruse was, but far far better.1. very very good stat cards tell you exactly how a unit will perform.2. Big open maps that allow you to move around and attack/defend from a number of locations.3. Standard unit selection and order process makes it easy to pick up for any RTS gamer.4. A exceptionally pretty game that also runs smoothly-----------------------------------------------------This game isnt without flaw, there are a few things that annoy me.1. Camera doesn't always want to pitch up as far as I want2. terrain details are not always blatent, which means you will sometimes mispostion your units.3. Kind of confusing for the first 1-2 hours.

												Against popular opinion, I will state mine. Wargame: European Escalation, is the BEST title in the Wargame series IF you are a fan of old-school RTS like I am. This game stays truer to its roots than any other game in the series. Missing only the base building.+Good graphics that hold up even today.+/-A campaign mode that allows you to mission-by-mission test new units and get the hang of the game mechanics. Unfortunately this campaign isn't very interesting.+Truly competitive up to 4v4 RTS battles.+Strategic environments where marching tanks into cities is suicide, marching infantry through fields is suicide, and approaching any forest can lead to instant death from what tricky enemy awaits within. Helicopters are a powerful tool indeed, but be careful or else anti-air will take your prized Apache.+The sounds of the weapons are something you can feel, they hold up quite nicely.+/- PvE is present as you can have matches versus bots that hold up in fun. However just as the campaign was lackluster, the AI is as well. It becomes very predictable and boring without the dynamic of a real player.-There's an annoying blue line on the screen that never goes away.I give this game a 9/10 and will personally deem it the best game in the entire Wargame Franchise. Wheras the newer games really changed how they view ""RTS"", this game keeps the classic tactical gameplay many of us are used to, minus the base building. My friends all wanted me to play Airland battle (The sequel) though this one kept me hooked. It's so much more of a classic, and I'd definitely recommend anyone play this. Make sure you bring friends though, as this multiplayer is abandoned and dead for the most part.			"

												This really feels like the strategic war game we were waiting for since the invention of the genre. (Actually, it's like most other RTS's, played on a tactical level of warfare).This game has a very realistic feel to it. At all times, all your actions are truly part of the road to the final result of the mission.If anything surprising happens which sets you back, it's because you didn't prepare for it. And surprises will happen, you will be off guard, the AI will hit you hard at some point.There are some unfortunate flaws to make it a truly brilliant game. Win or defeat is not permanent, missions are replayable to improve your score. This game lends itself to make results more permanent. So that win or defeat would influence the war instead of a pre-determined sequence of missions. Unfortunately, Eugen Systems didn't implement that.Still, it feels like the Real Time Strategy game we all have been waiting for. After playing it, we are simply waiting for the improvement on it.8/10 very good game, a must play for fans of the genre, but still a lot of room for improvement			"

												One of the best RTS games that i've ever played. Wargame: European Escalation is set in the cold war around the 1970's in a Nato vs Pact conflict. This game makes you think, such as what units you will need to use in battle. Sure, having a strong group of tanks is nice but you will also need anit-aircraft artillary in case of an oppenent launching an air attack. From what I have seen, there's always a counter unit to a unit. So basically if your oppenent does things right, he could destroy any of your units and you could destroy any of his. It all depends on the strategy you use. The single player has an interesting campaign and is challenging even on the easiest difficulty. There are not many people playing multiplayer, but you can find at least 1-2 matches a day. You are awarded command stars after completing tasks in mission or leveling up in muliplayer. Command stars allow you to purchase new vehicles for your armies. This will leave you playing for hours so you can unlock the tanks you want or a helicopter that looks cool. This game has a friendly community and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in RTS games, or just strategy games in general.			"

												Anyone who whines about the single player difficulty is frankly just not trying hard enough. I completed the first and seconds campaigns (for the second time), today. That's May 17th, after the supposed patches that made the campaigns impossible? Yeah no they're easy if you just think ahead. There's only one single secondary objective I haven't completed so far and it was to finish the mission in under 20 minutes. And this isn't the kind of game you rush. Ever. Those 3 extra command points aren't worth it. That mission that it told me to do in 20 minutes to me  an hour  and twenty minutes. And it went perfectly. Just take your time and the campaigns are interesting, challenging, and fun. And if you're looking for multiplayer, pick up the latest in the series. It's all the amazing gameplay of this but with planes, ships, and twice as many nations, all the way to the Far East.			"

												This game is really good, you have total freedom in the battle field, not preestablished commands like in Company of Heroes 2. Have to say it is quite difficult, specially the Warsaw Pact missions. Pros:RTS game with not the tipical isometric perspective, you can zoom in and out from the meters scale to the entire battlefield.Sandbox, total freedom inside the battlefield, it focuses in tactics, not microscale fights.Quite cheap, and if you like it there are the two sequels: airland battle and red dragon.Conts:Some missions are frustrating, very difficult, especially the ones in Poland, but saving the game regularly it can be done.A bit messy when you have all the factions mixed in the battlefield.I miss some military soviet music like in CoH2, btw the only good thing in CoH2.

												Quite realistic real time tactic game.But playing against the AI is no fun because it can see all units especially the command units. While you are busy protecting your command units the AI is collecting points because you can not find it's.The AI also needs no fuel, ammo or research\experience.The rules of the game are incompleatly available so unit selection is left to feelings.The successor to this game ""Wargame: Red Dragon"" might be better but is still (2015) expensive.The engine is great though.

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Wargame: European EscalationDeveloper:  Eugen SystemsPublisher:  Focus Home InteractiveGenre:  Real Time StrategyGeneral ImpressionThe first part in the Wargame series of tactical RTS’ had to leave a good impression. Fortunately for it, the dev team behind the game I’m reviewing today, are industry veterans which specialize in the Real Time Strategy genre and particularly the subgenre I’m most found of, when strategic titles come into discussion. The type of strategy that eschews traditional base building and management, for pure unit combat. This subgenre relies however on a lot more patience, studying of the terrain and even your foes, to know precisely what weapons or tactics to use upon. It’s a lot more static than the fast-paced RTS’ so popular today. Starcraft, C&C, Dawn of War, Cossacks, Age of Empires and many other franchises, are as dynamic as they come, with players scrambling to meet their opponents in the open as soon as possible and the infrastructure needed to sustain your army, has to be built fast and efficiently while being maintained at all times with a  various degree of attention.By  contrast, franchises like: Sudden Strike, Blitzkrieg, Men of War, World in Conflict and Wargame, all focus on the skill of your unit placement, use and knowledge of the battlefield. There is no emphasis placed on a base since you rely on a steady or less, supply of reinforcements. Many times, you even get to choose those new units to enter the fray. It is far more realistic than building a barracks and watching troops march from it. And when you can no longer count on a near infinite number of units recruited through resource gathering, you begin to appreciate them far more and do your best as to limit the casualties sustained by your army.Wargame: European Escalation is by no means, an easy game. For some new players to this type of RTS, it may come as a nasty surprise, but even your most advanced tanks can fall prey to a well placed squad of rocket launcher-carrying infantry, hidden in a forest. Scouting ahead and before you send your mechanized units, is paramount. Even the falsely portrayed in the media, “death from above” type of assault helicopters, seem fragile and vulnerable if you don’t plan ahead accordingly. There is no “Rock Paper Scissors” ruleset in Wargame. This potential vulnerability of your units can also tip the odds in your favor since the enemy is also subject to the same tactics he might use against you. Alas, the Artificial Intelligence in this game, is quite capable and will not hesitate to flank you instead of just rushing towards the center of the battle. During some missions, it demonstrates full defensive skills and taking over sectors from the enemy shall not prove an easy task. I will not spoil details regarding the single player campaigns, even if I was pleased by the use of an alternative Cold War era in which the conflicts heat up faster than an ICBM heading for a capital city. That’s an abbreviation for “Intercontinental ballistic missile” by the way. The true “city busters” of our contemporary times.Unto the gameplay aspects I didn’t enjoy as much (and which ultimately stopped me from giving this title a perfect 10 rating). Besides being a difficult strategic game, you also have to babysit your units a lot more than in the aforementioned dynamic RTS types. Also, you can’t afford to lose too many units since they have a finite number for the entire campaign and unlocking new ones requires a lot of grinding (multiplayer matches are a must, in this case). You won’t be able to unlock all the units for both the NATO and the Warsaw Pact factions, just by completing the single player campaigns, no matter how many secondary objectives you might accomplish. I understand that far better than the already tough AI, would be a real mind, a human player to spar within an MP mode. I just don’t appreciate being forced down this road, in order to unlock a full roster of troops I might actually need during the SP missions.All things considered, European Escalation is the start of a great strategic series, in the vein of old school classics that can’t be found on the Steam Store (I’m looking at you, Sudden Strike!). And if you are searching for a derivative Cold War scenario about to get warmer than Hell itself, you’re in for a treat. Wargame doesn’t fail to provide a most challenging and fun experience. Once you’re used to the turtle pacing and battlefield unpredictability, you will really feel like an armchair general!Strong Points+ Gorgeous graphics.+ Excellent level design and AI.+ Steam Achievements.Weak Points- Micromanaging the entire battlefield is a necessity.- No Steam Trading Cards.- Unlocking all the units requires too much grinding.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews and Cubbes, through the generous contribution of Cubë.

												I really hate that I have to call this game terrible, but sadly I do.  For me, it is almost unplayably bad, and I wish I had never wasted my money on it.The gameplay mechanics are good; it is sometimes difficult to micromanage the orientation of platoons to keep them facing the enemy, and my recon helicopters have an annoying tendency to land whenever they're not actively moving, while I may want them to stay airborne to keep enemy units visible; the inability to set stances, and the rather awkward method of turning off individual weapons on individual units to keep control of who fires what, can be annoying, but I can generally get my units to do what I want.  The graphics are fantastic, making each unit distinct and identifiable.  The music fits the scene nicely, and the single player campaign storyline is nicely plausible.So why do I call it terrible?  Becuase of the awful, terrible, abysmal AI.  In single player, the game becomes almost unplayable, all thanks to the AI's absolute omniscience.  Don't get me wrong, AIs have been able to see all the units on the field right back to the dawn of the RTS era, but it was generally not that big a deal.  In Wargame, however, recon is a central element of any army's tactics.  It requires careful attention to the type of recon vehicle, and equally careful scouting of suspected enemy strong points to avoid putting your recon vehicle in harms way.  The AI does none of that.  It just drops a full attack force directly on top of you, knowing exactly where all of your forces are at all times.  it is even worse in the campaign, where the AI will face you with overwhelming numbers in every mission, often pre-positioned in ambush sites that you can take no advantage of.  This severely reduces the tactics available, and ends up in a situation where the only way to make any sensible progress is by spamming the Quicksave key every time something doesn't go horribly wrong.I play single player.  I enjoy playing single player so I can take my time and explore my options.  But this game makes single player a horrible, crippled experience that is more like a chore than a game.  For your own sanity, Avoid at all costs.			"

												Ok, so coming as a fan of the RTS genre I enjoyed the game.  It was good, not great, but good. I liked that it required a certain degree of strategy aside from ""make more tanks, blow people away."" which is good.  I disliked the fact that the AI doesnt really change up its beginning round movements at all so that if you replay something you know where everything is going to be from the start. Secondly, I HATE that the AI somehow knows all about my position and troop movements and has acts in turn to counter everything I try to do.  In strategy games that is probably the biggest mistake a developer can make. That doesnt add challenge, it just pisses people off because they're not as clairvoyant as the AI. The player actually needs those scouts and recon units to see jack, while the AI somehow just knows these things and picks off your units making it frustrating to get good scores without playing level over and over. Overall, I would recommend the game, but only to those who already enjoy tough strategy games.			"

I wish you could get xp and command stars by playing A.I. skirmish mode. but over all great game, this is a MUST for any RTS fan or Cold war enthusiast. Great game Eugen!!!!!			"

												Insanely difficult and insanely addictive.There is only one difficulty in this game. Really hard and realistic. It is almost like a puzzle game with military units. You have a really hard task to achieve, and very often limited time to achieve it. Most of the time you are outnumbered by a superior enemy and must use the advantages of each unit to complete the task.This is really hard core rts simulation with units created to be as close to the real thing as possible. The tactics that the AI opponent uses are also supposed to be realistic, probing etc. But mostly you are outnumbered and have to use the scarce resources at your disposal to win.The command and control system, like all rts games are to some degree lacking. You have to both have the overview of the battlefield and also micro-manage units. This can lead to losing control and oversight, and you have to make sure to keep your flanks covered. There is a reason why all (functional) armies have ranks of officers to handle different levels of command. Mostly the units handles themselves intelligently and uses the most effective weapon at the time. This game is not for everyone since it is a hard-core simulation game. It is not a casual game. Think of it as ARMA only as a RTS. However if you really like strategy games/rts games or are a military ""buff"", I would recommend it. It is periodically on sale for 50-75% off since it is a few years old, so I would reccomend buying it on sale or trying a demo or seeing some youtube videos before buying since it is a game that you will either love or hate.I don´t think there is MP in this game anymore. I think that the SP is good enough. There is newer games which might have MP (Red Dragon is the latest).			"

												Excellent game. This is, in my view, the best of the Wargame series, despite being the oldest. The reason is that this is the only entry in the series with a proper single-player campaign.The seuqels, Airland battle and Red Dragon, dropped the scripted campaign in favour of a dynamic campaign. On the face of it, a synamic campaign sounds great—it's different every time so you get infinite replayability, right? The problem is that the campaign battles in those games are little more than glorified skirmishes against AI bots. European Escalation, on the other hand, has a fully-scripted campaign where a real, human designer has taken the time to think carefully about the narative that links the missions together, the design of the maps to support the specific missions that take place there, and the placement of each individual enemy unit. The result is a much tighter, more compelling single-player experience. in fact, I would say that this game is one of the top three single-player RTS games of all time.A key draw for the Wargame series is the multiplayer. European Escalation's multiplayer is good, but Airland Battle and Red Dragon are probably the better multiplayer games—they have more unit variety and more active communities. Multiplayer in Wargame is fantastic, so you should definitely check those two sequels. But anyone interested in a single-player RTS experience could do much much worse than giving European Escalation a shot.			"

												Wonderful strategy game. Unlike most RTS tactical use of terrain is crucial, and an ambush can easily take out the most powerful units. All units you'll find in the game are real-world units from the cold war era, and there's an incredible amount of them! Just learn to read their stats and their basic role and you shouldn't be overwhelmed though.Graphics are both impressive (smooth strategic zoom like R.U.S.E. or Supreme Commander, very detailed units and ground) and a bit bland (maps look all alike and very generic... at least it makes them easy to read).Campaign is a bit generic but is a very good challenge, you definitely won't breeze through the missions. Multiplayer was still alive last time I checked, but if that's your main interest you'd better buy the latest game in the series (Wargame: Red Dragon at the time of writing this) as that's where most of the community is.

												Dispicable AI, good game at its core, also if they've got AGM's prepare to loose most of your tanks due to the horrible balance issues with them. I remember when A whole wing of AGM helo's attacked my army because the AI can see every unit on the battlefield it struck them exatcly where they where (In a forrest) and they devasted my infrantry with AA missiles (this is with AGM's as the helicopters only weapon too) and my AA tanks where destroyed before the enemy got in range of their cannons. Don't get me wrong its a good game that I do enjoy, however it can be very fustrating when the AI launches a all out assault on your army when you know they have no recon units nearby, also AI get more reinforcment points than you so they swarm you with numbers. and better tanks e.c.t most of the time.

												This game is meant for people who not only enjoy RTS but also enjoy extreme realism, if you are not a fan of either of these then wargame is not for you, that being said I myself loved this game it is not only an amazing RTS but also the most realistic RTS I have had the pleasure of playing and I would highly reccomend it.10 out of 10 stars			"

												The campaign for me alone was enough to buy this game. The first Wargame from Eugen boasts many units, a compleate multiplayer experience, and campaign that is very well developed and quickly challenges you in very fun and well developed scenariosSome missions will have some daunting secondary objectives which will challenge completionists while not making the campaign fustratingly hard. Not making it into Air land battle's dynamic campaign system. Grab it if you enjoy any realistic Rts game, No base building here all about your units and how you use them. Not as pretty as Air land battle but More grit, and lacks Close air support from jets. However this is why it's refeshing and will remain one of my favorite games, even after the Eugen brings around the Third Wargame. This RTS is iconic, does what most developers havn't come close too. The Iris Zoom engine makes for impressive visuals, working very well providing a unique gameplay.			"

												9/10 a very fun game to play. grab some friends and start up a server. its easy to host a multiplayer server and ping and response time is great. with two sides to play on ( PACT and NATO) this game can suit someone who still wishes the soviet union was a thing and someone who loves thier good ol' democracy.Pros:-hundreds of units-level up quickly-thousands of stratagys to adopt-good multiplayer mechanics-lots of maps and game modes (game modes are usually quite similar)-great campagn missions and lots of emCons:-its hard to get a start at level 1. as most people are lvl 70+-some guys on multiplayer dont talk- the B-T clan. these guys are really bad. they just rush. dont play with them at all-sometimes there isnt a server running (or its just a B-T server)other then that i dont got many things bad to say about this game. over all great game.

												Woww,This game is a RTS in all its essence. Ok you don't need to come from Harvard to get to understand basic unit movement and functions. Although understanding how all units can be strategized and played through for minimum casualty or maximum efficiency is really what makes this game shine through and through. The AI is really decent, more in tune with trigger functions and time base functions but one in all the solo game gets really freaking intense as you progress through solo modes and requires you to develop new strategy and so understand how the game is played as well as developing deeper understanding and meaning for each type of unit you can use and in what situation.Do you get kicked or asked to leave public MPs because you are a low level, yes you are. But you can always open your own public game and you will get to play MP games regardless. Although I strongly suggest to finish all Solo games mode first. It is like a pre-ambule to what is asked in MP mode and really far from easy to grasp a total win at firt sight.I am not a RTS fan per se, yet, I am enjoying this game. Perhaps I enjoy the gameplay mechanics and strategy deepens the game overall to the point where winning is THE greatest reward long time not seen in a vast majority of video games?!?!			"

Posted: September 9, 2014
												So, after many different strategies and tactics, I have finally come to an unsatisfying conclusion. This game is a trainwreck.Let me start off with the good parts about the game.THE GOOD THINGS:So, the graphics for a game on a scale such as this are amazing. The overall look of every unit is pretty good and you can clearly see that the developers did try to optimize the game as well.There is a decent tutorial system in the game as well. From the first mission, it tells you what you must do and so on, and after the first few missions, the game lets your hand go and lets you think on your own.That's just about it for the good things. Time for a good spank.THE BAD THINGS:So, let me start off with the enemy AI. In the Singleplayer Campaign, the AI seems to be an all-seeing entity that knows your every move, every tactic and attempted strategy, and immediately counters it, or makes it useless by annihilating your heaviest armored units. It's just impossible to fool this AI, no matter how hard I try, unless I guess where his line is the weakest and blast through there with whatever I can. This kills the overall fun of a fictional conflict RTS for me.Next up: BALANCEThere are some serious balancing issues between units of similar roles in the game, like, the M60 Patton being unable to stand up to a T-60 or a T-72 whatsoever. As an example, I had four M60 Patton's engage against three T-60's, both stock versions and at full HP, however, the T-60's somehow, magically, one-shotted my Patton's, even though both groups had their frontal armor aimed at one another, AND to top it all off, my tanks never managed to hit them, despite the distance being probably optimal for late 20th century tank battles - 500 meters.Third point: COMPUTER GETS AN UPPER HANDAt the start of every defense mission, the computer seems to have at least fifteen times more points that it can use to call upon reinforcements than the player. As an example, I was playing ABLE ARCHER's second mission, Ramstein Airbase or something like that, and I was able to call upon only three full squads of my finest armored units, M1 Abrams tanks. I placed them strategically where they were needed the most, but then the AI picked them all off almost 10 minutes after the start of the battle. The tanks were at full health, all of them had Corporal's stripes, but, they were just swarmed over by T-72's with missiles. I couldn't summon any other units because I didn't have a magical point income rate that the AI seemingly has.Fourth: MAGIC INFANTRYAs the title says, the game has magic infantry units that can fire hand-held AT rockets on the move. No weapon that I know of is capable of being fired on the move. The result of this on-the-move shot should would fly away from its intended target, really far. And then Infantry is overpowered, by being able to one shot even heavy Main Battle Tanks.Fifth point:All the tanks are horribly underrated or overrated. The M1 Abrams seemingly has really bad equipment, while, to my knowledge, the Abrams was one of the best and most technologically advanced tanks of its time when it first came out. And the T-80 seems to be the single most capable tank of the game, able to utterly annihilate squads of Abrams and Leopard 2 tanks that are even outflanking it. Yes, this actually happened to me.Sixth: TACTICS? I THINK NOT!So, this game promotes a lot of thinking, but this clearly isn't a thinking man's game. It's a cheating man's game. What I mean is, no tactic has any value on the battlefield whatsoever. For example, I set my batallion in a formation where my flanks are stronger than my middle, to make sure that I can outflank my enemy and surround him in a powerful pincer move. But that doesn't work because the AI can do whatever the hell it wants and summon units out of nowhere to outflank my tanks and one-shot them all with incredible accuracy.Seventh: ACCURACYSo, why do all of the player units suddenly have godawful accuracy and spotting range? I counted that at least 83% of all of my shots missed while they were in optimal engagement range, but for the AI - 67% was a miss at long range. The statistic is clearly showing how the AI wins in this and I am fully aware that the statistics for both factions are more or less balanced. It's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Eighth: MICRO- AND MACRO-MANAGEMENTThis game supports management on a small and massive scale, and it's applaudable. Games like this are a rarity and ones that execute it perfectly are a luxury among the rare ones, but Wargame isn't that luxury. The management is a huge distraction because your units have no versatility and they can't think for themselves. They're literally civilians given a gun and then shooting anything that moves, not trained soldiers that must do what they're told to do.My personal verdict:Don't waste your money on Wargame, get RUSE instead. Or better yet, if you want a Cold War-era game, get World in Conflict. It is a far better game, executed masterfully, unlike this poor excuse for a ''Wargame'' where everything is out of place.NOTE: Don't give me that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I must suck in this game. I've been playing RTS games for ages, and this game simply does NOT in ANY DARN WAY reward tactical/strategic thinking. It's all RNG.			"

												One of my favorite RTS games. In this RTS game, instead of focusing on resource gathering and management or building up a base, you have a ""deck"" of units to work with. You can customize these decks with units you have unlocked. And once you start a match with a deck you can only use those units in the fight. You only have a limited number of each unit so don't just spam tanks or artillery units because you will run out very fast. In order to win you have to achieve a certain amount of points (ex:3500pts). You get points by destroying enemy units. Don't spam units and expect to win. You can't win with only tanks. You have to flank, use combined units to force your way into enemy controlled areas. Does the enemy have a heavily defended sector? Bombard them with artillery to dwindle there force and then move your garrisons in. You also have to worry about fuel and ammo. You will need a constant supply of ammo trucks to keep your units functional.Some cons I do have with the game are in fact the decks. It can be kind of tedious or grindy to have to unlock all of the units. It would be much easier to have them all unlocked at the start and just let you build it. But instead you are constantly playing matches to get stars to unlock better units. Another slight issue would be the learning curve. The game doesn't really explain itself well so trying to figure out what is what and what does what can be confusing at first and may be a turn off for some players. Over all I would rate this game 8/10. Very fun.			"

												One of the best modern RTS / RTT games I've ever played. It has a bit of a learning curve and not much in the way of a tutorial, but it's well worth persevering.The mechanics are quite deep. Your units need constanst resupply since they run out of ammo, fuel, and armor. You must always be aware of your surroundings; scouting is one of the most important aspects of the game. You need to learn to both micro and macro-manage which can be challenging.Both singleplayer and multiplayer modes are fun. The game lacks some polish and is a bit rough around the edges, but it is well worth it.			"

												Wargame:EE is a mostly realistic RTS of which the setting is Europe during 1965-1975. You play as either a PACT or NATO country during the Cold War when all hell brakes loose. You use everything but Navy and Air Force in this game, to control strategic points, control high ground and set up ambushes on your enemy. You need to strategically place everything from ATGM's to recon units to almost every significant tank variant in the world at that time (T-55, T-62, T-72, T-80, M48 Super, M1 Abrams, Leopard 2A1) or you will lose. This isn't the type of RTS you can spam factories and a single unit and win, there are no factories and you need strategy. You also have to worry about logistics, for example, a ATGM soldier only carries from 6-12 rockets, you will need supply trucks close by to keep him full on ammo. All in all they created a pretty good game 8/10, my only quarrel with it is the command stars system, It takes entirely way too long unlock your multiplayer ""deck"" so you suffer with low level tanks as others still playing mp are running full decks, that, and the units you unlock in the difficult campaign do not carry over, but still very minor annoyances.

												I really enjoy this game, despite the sometimes insane difficulty. I've had a really hard time playing Warsaw Pact. The AI is merciless and relentless. The graphics work well for it and the game plays quite speedy on a modern PC. I've had no technical problems playing on Windows 10 x64 (or Windows 7 x64).I'm an old school wargamer and this satisfies that enjoyment and has a modern feel being RTS. So, buy this if: You like semi-realistic RTS, modern warfare, a real challenge, an excellent set of single player campaigns. You may not like this if high-difficulty is off-putting or you are expecting more of a game-style RTS with base building and such.			"

												Waited probably a year or something before buying the game. It was on sale  for 2,40Euro, which is cheap :) Bought 3 copies for my boys and me. Had some problems with language settings in the begining - everything in Polish :) The game itself will be fun I am sure, once we master the VERY EAST BLOC UI. The UI is moderately horrible, only surpassed by Chinese programmers trying to sell software to Eurpeans. Its really poorly constructed.The game engine however is ok I think, and there is a lot of equipment available for os - I am pretty sure we have a good time.Ran the first training mission- was fun, easily overcome, and easily understood.Got my boys into a 3 vs 1 moderate computer - AFTER LOTS of struggling with the UI - we never got to actually purchase anything, not even a footman. The UI SUCKS so bad. All of us frantically clicked everywhere but we just couldnt figure out where to buy a tank or something. There are some strange ""star points"" which is not really calcable, recognizable or understandable - so we just had a jeep each - we got pretty blasted away by russian (AI) combat helicoptors.There is MUCH too MUCH MYSTERY meat in that HORRIBLE UI - but the game is gonna be fun once we crack the Polish UI I am sure.UI:♥♥♥♥♥♥poorEngine: Moderate acceptableMusic: OKOverall: Will be fun once we master it, I am sure.

												I think the issue that bugs me the most is that units usually don't do what you tell them.This game models unit morale: units will freak out and run if they come under heavy fire (or somebody stubs their toe on a rock), or become stunned and stuck in place when saturated with rockets. I'm not talking about that. I'll have perfectly healthy, calm units near a FOB or maneuvering across empty terrain and they can't follow simple instructions. I've had infantry refuse to get in transports right next to them, infantry refuse to move out of cover, units deciding to stand out in an open field when I've explicitly clicked on cover, tanks turn around and move in the opposite direction I wanted them to for no apparent reason, and units just simply not responding to move orders at all.Speaking of moving and cover, apparently there is supposed to be some kind of automated snap-to-cover system in place. I've seen it work once or twice, but usually I end up with half the troops in a given unit hanging out in an open field as the rest of them hunker down in a tree line. The game lacks any way to tell units which direction to face or what kind of a formation to take; a major oversight given that the game seems to be designed to explicitly discourage unit micromanagement.Which is frustrating because the AI is terrible. Units will fire on anything that gets within eyesight, regardless if they can hit it or not. I remember one instance where I told half a dozen helos to sweep an area. They moved about one hundred feet, saw a single T-55 tank way off in the distance, came to a screeching halt, and unloaded every single rocket at it. They did little, if any, damage to it and I had to empty out most of a FOB to rearm them. Anti-tank infantry will fire off every missile they have at anything even remotely in range, and given the computers indecisiveness this usually means they expend every single rocket (with zero effect) before the opfor vehicles get into a more reasonable range. (I know the player can 'turn off' the weapons of the units, but then it's just back to micromanaging everything again.)That isn't to say the computer is smart - it's not, it's as dumb as a brick. The developers seem to have known this, so they compenstated (in the singleplayer campaign at least) by putting an absolute metric fudge ton of enemy units on the maps. Players are easily outnumbered four to one, by my estimate. The only counter to this is just throw massive groups of units at the computer - the enemy can't call in new units, you can - but this mostly ruins the entire 'strategy' element of the game. Your units are as dumb as the computers (see above), so any attempt to set up kill zones or perform interesting maneuvers is usually thwarted by some IFVs or tanks or something deciding to wander off on their own, or charge in, or just plain not move.To add to the problem the enemy tend to be super-human. One particularly notable example I can recall: I was moving into a small town and a single enemy infantry squad had set up in a house on an outer corner. Nothing special; just some rifles, grenades, and some RPGs spread among about twenty soldiers. Ten minutes later I had lost sixteen Leopard 2 tanks, and managed to whittle the unit (which had been under direct fire from the tanks the entire time) down to two guys. I sent in four Huey gunships to clean up and lost them all within five seconds to two guys with rifles who were hunkered down in a pile of gravel and splintered 2x4's. I shelled it a bit with artillery and ran away. I don't know if I ever actually cleaned them out.Oh yeah, and the maps are heavily scripted. It varies from map to map, of course, but usually there is a massive attack wave or reinforcements, or something that will spawn when the player invades a given objective or moves past a specific point. One of the early missions the player is supposed to secure a collapsed bridge with a command unit early on. Thing is, if you never capture that objective the reenforcement wave never comes in, which leaves the player with as much time as they like to build up a massive force or just bypassing the objective entirely. It feels like cheating, but in some cases it seems like the only way to complete the map.This game tries to sell itself as the ultimate strategy game but fails miserably. It seems like the developers couldn't decide if the player should micromanage their army or not, and as a result the units are stupid and the controls are frustratingly incomplete. The graphics are pretty good but given that this is the second game they made with this engine (R.U.S.E. being the first) I'm not surprised. I am extremely impressed by the level of unit detail they've built in, which makes the badly designed controls and pitiful AI seem all the more vexing.Not recommended. I suggest World in Conflict as an alternative, if you're a fan of 198X-era wargaming. It's not nearly as detailed in terms of units but the singleplayer plays a lot better. In my opinion anyway.			"

												The learning curve is pretty harsh, and I gave up after the 1st campaign, but one of my friends wanted this for Christmas, and since then we've been having a blast together. Multiplayer isn't as dead as you think, and if you're willing to wait 2 minutes for a match to appear, you won't be sorry. After all, you're waiting 2 minutes for a 40 minute game (unless the other guy's running a NATO heli deck, because he'll either wreck you, or you'll wreck him pretty fast).			"

												Having only played this for a short time, here's what I know so far:  The learning curve is STEEP.   The first missions will try to teach you how to play the game, but it's really going to require alot of guessing and clicking on your part to figure out what's actually going on.  The game basically has so much information in the form of detailed stats on each class, nation, and type of vehicle that you will have to meticulously study it to get any kind of proficiency when planning your battles. This game requires you to actually resupply and refuel your units with logistics and this is every bit as painstaking as it sounds.  Terrain matters,  unit optics matter, armor matters, weapon range matters, weapon types matter.  It's very complicated, but the satisfaction of success on the field is worth the mind boggling scope of what you have to keep track of, which is why you shouldn't play this alone.  You can team up with 3 other people on one side and work together and this makes it alot easier.			"

												A Solid RTS and probably my favorite strategy game serie (beside Civ)One of the best strategy games I've played so far. Balanced, Fun and Thrilling this is a one of its kind RTS set in a relativley unexplored histrical context when it comes to gaming. It requires great skill and the learning curve is steep but you will no be bored in this game. The Campaign (except for the first missions) is known for being hard and the AI is annoying. Beware, this game is exceptionally realistic. It's one of the few games I've played where morale, ammo and cover play such a great role. It really adds depth to the game making it's less about have more troops and more about strategy. The graphics are pretty impressive for a game that old and I was amazed to see the astonishing details devs put on the game's models. That's definitvely a game you want to buy if you have friends enjoying RTS's since the multiplayer community consists of a few hundred players. However, you WILL have the occasion to play a lot of multi and meet friendly people. Don't let the difficulty discourage you, This is a wonderful and quite cheap RTS though its successor are more complete.Solid 9/10 "

												Its a very good game, very addicitive, very challenging and i recommend it to all the RTS fans. The only bad thing i consider is  the realism, which is set too high, making the battles too slow some times or almost impossible to win. If the creators added a little arcade tone to the game, it would be a 10/10 for my taste. On the other hand, it is the best real war simulator i 've ever played.The SP scenario was very interesting too and especially for someone of my age (over 40) who knows who is Lech Wałęsa  and General Jaruzelski. The hours you see above, were spent to beat the SP only.... (i am not a very good gamer i suppose)			"

												Don't buy this game for the poorly made single-player. The rest is written only for the multiplayer part.This is easily the best release in the Wargame series. Featuring the most tactical and slow-paced gameplay of the three games. The diferent unit types here are very well-balanced, and together with the great map design every match will leave you at the tip of your chair. The only con is the steap learning curve, but it's well worth the time invested once you figure out how to compete in multiplayer.Sadly the multiplayer community has pretty much died out, meaning you're only going find full matches on peak hours.

												Even if multiplayer is dead, the single player campaign is well worth it.If you like realistic RTS games, or would like to know how a confrontation between NATO and the Soviet Union might have looked like, definitely give this game a try.The game's scenario is set in the late 1980's. There's a large variety of units included. From the last T-34 tanks of WW2 up to modern high tech units like the M4A1 Abrams or AH-64 Apache and the Soviet counterparts to them.Also worth noting: There are no aircraft in this game. The only air units are helicopters. I liked this because it puts the focus even more on the ground war. If you want aircraft included and a slightly more modern setting go for Airland Battle.I had a lot of fun with this game.PS: If you're interested in this scenario look up the book 'Red Storm Rising' by Tom Clancy. It also deals with this specific topic and is a good read.			"

Do yourself a favor and spend your money on an inflatable sheep, youll spend your nights less lonely than if you buy this hunk of garbage.  DELETE PROGRAM FROM COMPUTER			"

												this game was poorly marketed, in that every patch is being sold as a seperate game, add air strikes give me 40 dollars , add ships give forty dollars, hello capcom tactics. they make you hate buying their game becuase they then  drop the price when they get desperate. Ill wait until red dragon drops to a sad fall on your face becuase you were greedy price, like this is now 3.39 soon to be part on the monday sale.			"

												I always wanted to try this game, but never got around to it. Life was just to hectic for me at the time so I unfortunately never got to experience the massive scale combat of Wargame. That was until my good friend Bishop so generously through the kindness of his faggidy♥♥♥♥♥heart so graciously provided a digital copy of this glorious and underrated video game. I had once imagined what would happen if the Cold War had changed temperature. With previous titles like World in Conflict (which has very similar gameplay mechanics) I thought I had experienced WW3 as it could of happened on U.S. Soil. But lets get realistic here guys, they arn't just gunna walts right through Europe without a ♥♥♥♥in fight! (Shout out to my boi's in Germany, Britain, and France I guess) When I played my first round of this ingeniusly developed war simulation I had truly felt like I was there. This was the the most accurate depiction of a Cold War Era conflict I have ever experienced. I had PTSD for a week.			"

												A very detailed, quite haedcore, but engrossing RTS. No base building here, it's all strategy. The only negative is the unit pathfinding. Try getting a column of your tanks across a bridge without tearing your hair out!The different types of units is vast and the more experience you get, the more you can unloock. You also get experience in the multiplayer and the units you unlock there are carried over into the sibgleplayer. I thought this was a nice touch which encourages you to play both single and multiplayer sides of the game. If you can overlook the unforgiveable pathfinding problems, this is up there with the best of the RTS genre. "

												I want to see this features in the next Wargame series.I wish that they have a features in multiplayer like; player can able to ""choose role"" function  if the player wish to command units like:Infantry role infantry with combat transport vehicles, recon vehicles & squad of course (for the players who wish to command infantry soldiers in multiplayer)Armor role (for the players who wish to command tanks and recon vehicles)Support role (for the players who wish to command Artillery vehicles, and Anti Air cover & recon vehicles)Air role (for the players who wish to command Attack helicopter, Recon Attack helicopter and Fighter aircraft)Not confusing isn't? this is what you called: Tactical Team Strategy game, World in Conflict style in Multiplayer. (anyway RIP world in conflict online)The purpose of this is that; if your teammates commanding tanks or Infantry and they busy on killing the enemy hostile, capturing command points in the battle ground, As teammate, your job is to protect or support them with Artillery, Attack helicopter and Fighter Aircraft for air strike fire support.player able to used ""symbol communication"" (Requests Menu)The Requests Menu contains a number of requests that can be sent to your teammates. Many of the requests require the player to select a location, for example; select the position where the artillery should be placed. The other players will then see an icon on that specific location.Requests Menu is an extremely powerful and effective way of communicating with other teammates.TO:Developer: Eugen Systems Publisher: Focus Home Interactive	please include this features next time you make a new series of wargame.I wish that you read my suggestion.That's all Thanks			"

												OK I have been playing Wargame: European Escalations for about 35 hours so have a a good understanding of the game, system and all that stuff. Having played Wargames, and simulations, and Ground combat operations from the days of rock, pebble, fist I have a better then normal understanding then most that walk the halls or the face of the blue ball. 1, I like the game. I dont like the light speed of it or the fact that you can not slow it down. The fast pace has nothing to do with the scale of the game. At squad, and personal level yes. Things get very fast after contact in the real world.2. I like the presentation of the units. They are a little messed up as to weapons, and capabilities. Case in point is the M-60 shot just as well as the M-60A3 for the most part. What made it different was firing on the move, and successive rounds after about 6-8. The M-60 had to stop as did all the pre-M-60A1 Rise tanks. I speak in generalities but for the most part this a fact. The M-60 could out shoot any tank from a stand still with the exception of the A2. Even then the A2 was dead on at 0 to xxx range. Missing a shot at anything under 1600 meters was almost impossible. Wear as hitting anything with any Russia/East Block tank at 1200+ was almost impossible with anything other then the T-55/54, and even then with the crews they had that was an issue. I could go on in greater detail but the bottom line was I was there.3. Position in Units. Well they do not always go to the tree line like they would in real life etc. More options should be given for the defender.4. Unlocking units is just crack baby stuff. People pay for the game, not part of the game, or a bit, they pay for the game, give them the dam game.5. Better crews/teams/units. FIRST OFF the BOAR had the most professional at the start of the 70s along with the Canadians. No draft per say. In fact the Canadians had the highest paid troops for many years, they just had last decades equipment, and gear. So for the US. UK , Canadians the cost of better crews should be one point from one to another. The Germans and French should be 2, the East Germans 3 and the USSR just keep as is.6. No editor. ? Come on. Give users an Editor.7. Smoke round would be nice, I even had a few for my tanks.8. Missiles. Basic rule is the East had crap, and the SS-11 was better then most of what they had. Also the ones the west had, did have had a vast range of effectiveness. The TOW was at the top, HOT was fast behind and so on. Redeye was the best of the hand held, and they had a system that gave them even more of a edge. TacFire was in use by most most units by 1976. Even the Brits had it by then.9. Oh the most glaring issue. The computer cheating thing is way, way, way overboard. NWIFH am I going to be fighting the full 3rd Shock Army with a fireteam. Yes I understand that makers playing the game over and over , and over x500000 think they need to do this, but no, and We the people have no idea as to what the computer iis going to do, and the Average person should be able to win 99.9% of the time in baby mode.I have real issue about not getting the full game, and the computer player overmatch issue (oovermatch is way to soft of a term for what these guys did). These kind of thing make me questioning of any design group that does it, and all products they have, or will have.In Short a nice game that needs a few updates in a few areas before it is something I would say needs to be part of your kit.

												This game a BIG disappointment for me. The graphics are terrific, and the game play could become addictive if there were not so many faults.  It appears to me that the designers either were not gamers them selves, or did not use (or pay attention to) beta players to improve this release.  After the first couple of levels the game uses foes (Usually russian) that are way beyond the level of units you are able to aquire. Also, the numbers of enemy units are several times what yours are. For instance: During a recent game, the axis sent 24 Mi24v Helo's against ONE small group of my attackers.  That does not include the other Helo's of the same type that I had already seen and shot down.  It is EASY to get lost in this...meaning, if you have to jump around some of the larger maps, it's easy to forget where a particular unit is located. (Easily fixed by allowing players to view a list of currently used units) Also, there is no access to play as the axis side that i could find.    With a little more thought about the player and his/her experience, this could easily be avoided or corrected. An excersize in frustration.....			"

												Its hard to gauge wargame ee.  Overall its a fun game, but its mainly a multiplayer game and that multiplayer community has gone on to the newer games.The single player campaign is just kind of tedius and not fun and it really feels out of order as well.  You can only play against one ai opponent so not much entertainment as far as playing the ai etc.  Overall i hate to say it but i have to give a good game here a thumbs down recommendation.Which is a real shame.  This game has an impressive and realistic unit and weapon selection, the maps have a nice natural look to them, and the game makes you resupply your vehicles as weapons/fuel are depleted which gives you a feel for the nightmare of logistics for a modern army, and i think that is a very cool angle to go after.Im sure it was great when it was new, and you might try the new games, but i wouldnt recommend old games in the wargame series.  Theres just not all that much to do in them now that the community is playing the newer games.			"

Aside from the tedious micromanagement which may appeal to some hard core sim fans out there, the sound effects are simple and copied from unit to unit and the game is unimmersive and bland. Hardcore war-sim fans may like it, however, I refuse to believe that a tank driving for a single mile and depleting all of it's fuel is ""realistic"".			"

This game really is a lot of fun -- It did a fantastic job in immersing the player, making them feel like they were actually a commander in a Cold War fictional conflict.This game is also really hard... After the first campaign, any other progress became frusturatingly difficult to push through. I love this game and occasionally go back to try again. I would definitely suggest this to anyone, but especially those of you who are pro at tactics style gaming (AoE, XCOM, StarCraft, etc...)			"

												Sadly, I really want to like this game, but I can't do so out of good heart. It looks fine, sounds fine, plays fine, controls fine, but I found it extremely hard and unfair. I play a lot of stragegy games and I like a good challange, but this game for me was very hard to play because you have little to no chance. Your units seem to be worse than the enemies' units, which would be fine, except they out number you about 10 to one. No matter how many units I call in, they always seem to have ten times as many units, and plus they have air support often when you don't, and captuing and holding an objective is hard enough, and gets even harder when you have to defend three points, while outnumbered, out gunned, and out maneuvered. I nveer got past level three or so, and I gave this game MANY tries, but I could never pull through, as misions can last for hours, with little to no progress made. As much as I want to like this game, I can't, and I have to recommend somehting like ""Men of War: Assault Squad 2"" or ""Star Wars Empire at War""  or ""World in Conflict"" as opposed to this when suggesting a good RTS. Maybe I'm just REALLY bad at this, but I've played a LOT of RTS games, some of which can be very punishing (Men of War on veteran difficulty) and in those I still felt that I had a chance and could make progress and win, but in this I fight for hours and gain nothing but keep losing everything...

												If you have a micromanagement fetish, you will love this game. There is no way, you will ever -in one game- be immediately able to select the unit you want to select. Also, the number of different units is sheer infinite. THis might sound like heaps of fun at first, however, this also means, that there is no way, that you'll ever be able to understand every unit's abilities and counter abilities in detail. Plus the toolbar, or whatever the heck you would call this thing on the site of the screen is way too useless, and lacks many abilities that are only reachable through hot keys. Thus, learning the bloody hot keys before playing is obligatory. Or you're gonna have a BAAAD time. I thought of it as the advanced version of RUSE, but this game stands to RUSE, like a rhino stands to a dolphin: They're both mammals, but looking closer, you might as well see, that their evolution spread paths ages ago.

												Im not to impressed. Which was sad becuase when I 1st loaded it up I was very excited after playing through the 1st mission.I would love the hard LOS rules and need for recon if the AI seemed to play by the same rules. Early in the second mission I got swept by some tanks from my 4 o clock, who seemed to have no problems shooting through areas that completly blocked my tanks LOS. Later in the mission My units seems to be utterly incapable of lining up with cover. I had a tank plt where one tank on one end insisted in hanging out in the open while the far tank refused to leave the woods and none of them seemed interested in engaing the fricken T-34s from there max range who were in the open. which leads me to another gripe. Why cant I give orders as to when my units will open fire? If im playing an arcade RTS that doesnt track ammo I dont care if every one blows through ammo. However in a game that tracks ever single round it maddening to watch a line of tanks blow half there ammo at max range shooting at a 5% hit chance aginst units who are no where near being able to fire back. A few minutes later the same unit justs decides to watch a few ancinet T-34s as they waltz across an open field and actualy get a hit on my Cheiften before my guys decide to return fire.The resupply system is just horrible. Nothing like watching your recon elements run out of fuel over and over and over. And if your going to make resupply a critical aspect of the game you need to give me control over it. Its kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to tell me I have to hold a line aginst tanks and then watch my tanks get ammo starved becuase other units are buring resupply to refuel. Resupply also hoses combined arms. I wanted to use my IFV to suppres infantry so my tanks could kill tanks. Except my IFV were hell bent on blowing 20mm rounds on T-62s which blew through my resupply which starved my tanks. In the end I either had to ""turnoff"" my IFV or send them to the rear. Most of this crap wouldent be that annoying IF the computer followed the same rules. but watching a T-55 hold off 3 Cheiften IIs becuase of the ""magic of resupply insta repair"" pretty much tanks the illusion of realism			"

												The AI is spamming inbound units constantly from every possible direction. So you have nothing but to react. No time for strategy at all, you are busy with counterspamming units all the time. Whatever plan you make up in your mind, it gets ruined within seconds because your brain will never be able to counter the speed and the situational awareness of a computer. Besides you suffer from fog of war, not so the AI.Being grown old and slow must feel similar to what you are experiencing in this game.Unfortunately this kills most of the fun. Too bad, setup and graphics are pretty good.			"

												Pretty much a multiplayer only game as the campaign is very hard (not to mention the first campaign you have to deal with getting nuked, no literally). In single player you're dealing with an Ai with perfect reaction times that is all seeing (as far as fog of war allows it to). This makes a strong opponent and for challenging matches... too challenging. Add to that you can't restart fully setup with your units emplaced, you have to do that every time as well, which is a good five or ten minutes (but does strongly puch you to change tactics, which may help). Makes the campagin just too much of a slog imo. Lastly, your vital weapons shots like AA missiles are entirely chance rolls which will make you frustrated the longer you play. This is a game of tactics, strategy, and random chance. A slow down button would have been appreciated as well as a pause screen to assess the scene, but no. Pretty brutal if you ask me!It just could have been so much fun had they toned down the difficulty a bit.			"

												While I appreciate the realism (persistent army between levels, level-up for survivors, fuel, ammo, logistics supply and command centers, lots of hide and seek), which is very nice and made me quite addicted for a while, I eventually quit playing for two basic reasons:1. At the campaign, you have very limited troops and resources, while the CPU can spawn units forever as long as they have the reinforcements points. So you either rush or die. I don't appreciate STRATEGY when you have to rush.2. Multiplayer, well ... you know how RTS multiplayer go, but in wargame it is worse because of the limited everything, so only the hardcore players will do anything, a casual player like me have no chance.3. There are zillions of bugs on the border areas. For instance, enemy units that retreat (rout) outside the map cannot be easilly target, and worse yet, they might just stay there. I lost a couple of cames because some stupid enemy unit retreated near a reinforcement point and any/all supply truck I called in was immediatly captured, but since they spawn outside the map, I could not send troops to capture them back. Some enemy units go to far outside the map you can't even scout/see to try and siege them, wtfSo: campaign: you are infinitelly capped against an infinite oponent, so you have to win while you have troops; multiplayer: hardcore made even more hardcore. No, thanks.			"

												They took a GREAT concept like World in Conflict and TOTALLY ****ED it up.  Outside of some very vanilla news clips, why do I care?  Where is the guidance in the first mission or 2? IF World in conflict was a stellar game (and it was) this is the bargain basement equivalen with ZERO emotional attachment whatsoever.The gameplay is VERY slow, the music quite lackluster and at BEST you have to fumble through the controls to make units do what you want.  RTS? maybe... fun? Absolutely NOT.			"

												A-MAZING and hard lolThis game reminds me of Tom Clancy's endwar in many ways. its also slightly like a SUPER LARGE XXL Company of Heroes 2 sandwich.one thing to note on this game, played it on my Lenovo Yoga 2 Tablet, and the touch controls are on Fleek...or something similary awesome.Supply Lines are Real, DLC Added Content Is Real(And Much Needed IMO)If you even consider this you should just by the latest in the installment Wargame: Red Dragon, it includes boats and planes. but this is a wonderful series to start out with and i have had so so results playing Red Dragon on my tablet(slightly added video req's make it slightly glitchy, im sure it works fine and its just my own personal hardware)			"

												- Tanks drive straight through tank traps- No individual control of tanks (even though they individually bug out when moving)- No alignment of tanks (face this way)- The UI is unnecessarily complex- Playing the game requires me to create an external account after manually typing in the CD key I got from Steam. What year is it?Someone mentioned that this is a great game hidden behind a bad tutorial, and that may well be true, but everything I've seen so far just tells me this is a worse version of World in Conflict.

												WarGame: European Escalation. Here is a game that has what I wanted in a strategy game. Unit formations, experianced units that carry over and a touch of thinking on how to complele a mission. here is the problem. You have no advanage what-so-ever. yes you may have a unit of heavy tanks supported by anti air and either gunships or artillery. But when that really means something your units don't use the initiative thats been given them. such as 10-1 odds where you have ten units firing at four, the out com should be opfor loss. No the same four vehicle unit rides right up to you one and only command unit holding open your reenforcement window and takes it out with a guided missile at point black right infront of all your heavy tanks, anti- armor and and duel purpose anti air artillery. There goes the reenforcements needed to resupply and and other command you its you wanted to purchace. As for supplies thats the hardest thing to use sence every thing runds on supplies, there isn't enough of it to utilize to either complete all the objectives in the time alloted or to hold out with. AI is horrible when you have a hardden veteran who panics at the first initial contact and routs right but the command unit it was protecting thus exposing it. I would think a unit that's been through so much fighting would realize that I've survived this long in this heavy tank that my crew can it a flea at three miles away while it is moving wouldn't panic when the action starts. And lets not forget the coversystem for vehicles. You can hole them up in a forest or a town but the element of surprize seemes to be the trade off for range. Once in cover the range is reduced for some silly reason. and when the enemy spots you with recon a tank unit can roll right up and shell you at the same distance you could normally fire. Don't get me wrong. This game has a tutorial, the first campaign under the west germans allows you to learn how to use units. But when you get to gunships, they just don't seem to hack it when fighting softer targets. lets also not forget to mention units sitting OFF MAP and still controlling territory and firing away at your units WHO CANNOT FIRE BACK. Really? I lost a whole heavy tank unit to a tin can APC who just so happenes to be sitting at the edge of the map and I cannot kill them? Who test played this game? Ignored the indications where you set the objectives and FOB next to these out of reach tangos? If the Developers would take alook at these flaws and probably patch them maybe this game would have a chance? I'm not recomending this game to those who want a game where they can sit back and relax. this has all the qualities for Rage quitting. Which I've been doing for four days straight since buying it and the whole collection. For Fast play and russhing with no strategy. I recomend it because if you don't care about your losses or the chance to carry over experianced units. then build all your tanks and rush them. the russian AI does it.			"

												It infuriates me to no end that the division (a theater level organizational group) doles out the stupid command points as if it were a parent in a candy store telling a child ""Alright, here's $5. You can get whatever you want but only if it's less than this"". A theater level deployment strategy doesn't work that way. The general draws a battlefield plan to detirmine how many of what is needed to ensure that the frontline can't be outflanked, and executes. Nobody was every stupid enough to deploy 20 tanks, 4 antitanks, and 4 antipersonnels across an area that was several thousand acres and expect them to clear it. Maybe you get enough points to get another 4 tanks in 10 minutes or so. Big deal.Be prepared to rage quit constantly. Mostly I know why what happened, happened. Usually the problem can be solved by deploying more forces, which you rarely have though.And just in case it wasn't clear, I have a love / hate relationship with this series.			"

After a few initial hours of thinking this game was a poorly designed RTS i started to see the magic emerge in the nuances of unit management, supply line management, recon, understanding weapon types, cover and the plethora of other aspects that makes this game a solid RTS. Thoroughly enjoyed and highly reccomend!8/10			"

												War Game RTS with strategic command points to unlock units as you progress through the SP campaign and deployment points within each scenario that allow you to create and deploy those units.  For MP you create a ""deck"" of 25 units which you then take into MP / skirmish games.Graphics are great: you can zoom from way out at ""Sat View"" all the way in to individual units.  The GUI is well designed.  The action is hectic and the AI is pretty good.  One negative for me (and plenty of others looking at the game's msg boards) is the lack of a ""Pause"" that allows the player to choose their units and issue orders in SP scenarios.  I tend towards TBS, so this was a major pain until I used ""Cheat Engine"" to allow me to slow the SP game down.  Obviously the lack of a pause isn't an issue in MP.If you like war strategy then definitely give this title a go. "

												Started playing a year after i bought it, in general, it's a great game, and extremely challenging for starters. I like how certain units do better in certain surroundings, like tanks are great in open areas or hedges, helicopters dominate in open areas, infantry rule the cities/towns/buildings, ATGM and other anti-tank units do well when behind woods on an open field.  My only problem is that sometimes the game becomes too challenging to the point where no matter what you do(brings in 10000 tanks to hold alpha objective) you can't seem to win(all the tanks die from one helicopter that they cannot seem to hit ever). Still graphics are extremely good and no unit rules all of them(unless its a helicopter and you don't have AA guns). Oh and btw storming a city with tanks will never work for you but works most of the time for the enemy.			"

Well balanced, with excellent gameplay mechanics and a variety of strategies and play styles to chose from, unlike many RTS which favour specific build orders or tactics. Wargame also provides a challenging single player campaign that is relatively difficult to complete. This game is also very in depth and is far from mundane. Cheap units, if used correctly and positioned well can turn the tide of battle against far stronger and more expensive units. Honestly a great game, 9/10 from me!			"

												What a breath of fresh air. To someone who has inhaled a LD50 dose of carbon monoxide of course. Because the real-time tactics genre has been all but moribund the last ... decade or so? And 99% of what we got were substandard SC2 clones or even more laughably, Facebook/mobile/browser games that were sold to us as ""strategy"".But this isn't only a title of grand vision to create an *actual* wargaming video game, it's simply an extremely well-made and thorough RTT/RTS as well. Too often real-time tactics depends on overwhelming your opponent with your superior build order, to then overwhelm him with your superior unit composition, and last but not least to overwhelm him with your superior numbers (particularly egregious). All of this is a science in itself, a kind of meta-tactics, but not exactly what I am looking for nowadays when I want to play an actual war tactics/strategy game. Which is also why I think that while SC2 is an extremely good game, it's not an extremely good strategy game in the truest sense of the word.Wargame exchanges this meta-tactics for true operational scale gameplay (the step between small-scale tactical engagements like in most RTT, and grand strategy, as in a Paradox title) that I haven't yet seen in a video game. Perhaps the last such was Rise of Nations? My memory is hazy honestly. I was 16 when I last played that. In any case, Wargame satisfies that completely. Definitely worth a play for anyone into strategy or mil simulators.			"

												Fast, mean, unforgiving, put your tactical brains on overdrive and go to it. For me this is one game that delivers. Forget massing units and just pummelling a weaker foe. Try that approach and the AI will spank you severely on easy setting as well. I've always been a casual player of wargames so multi player has never really interested me, this game fills that hole up. The AI likes to surprise you and wont come at you in vast armadas of tanks. But if your daft enough not to use your recon units it'll teach you a lesson in pain.			"

												This depends what you're looking for.  If you're looking for another Company of Heroes style arcade top-down action game with NATO/Warsaw Pact units, a larger scale and some plausible alternative-history scenarios, but with a fiddly UI, go for it.  Similarly, the game would be decent in MP, where the numerous issues with the SP campaign wouldn't apply.But if you're looking for ""an intense and spectacular Real Time Strategy game, where realism and strategy are brought to the front lines."", as per the marketing spin on the Steam store page, try somewhere else.  This is barely more realistic than the latest Command and Conquer: Red Alert (indeed, the infantry in C&C behave more realistically than the stunned mullets in Wargame:EE).  Command and control, deployment, force mix, it's all over the shop.  A fun top-down action game it may make, but a quality, realistic RTS it most definitely isn't, and as I picked it up based on what the developers said it was, I'm rating it accordingly.Some really promising individual unit combat mechanics let down by horrendous level design in single player (ridiculously unrealistic force layouts, spawning at the start of levels with nothing but command units and a couple of choppers with the enemy within a couple of kilometres, and mission objectives that wouldn't have passed the common sense test with anyone with any military knowledge higher than a passing familiarity with Hogan's Heroes).  All being well Eugen improved with their sequels, but European Escalation was a hue step back from RUSE.Which is another point - the UI is appaling.  It was easy to play RUSE with a gamepad than it is to play Wargame:EE with a mouse and keyboard.  While RUSE's pad controls were well designed, an RTS should _always_ be better with a mouse/kb.And then there's unit behaviour.  Infantry suddenly come across an enemy strongpoint in town?  They'll sit in the middle of the street getting slaughtered, rather than take cover.  Clearly the NATO and Warsaw Pact troops selected as AI models for Wargame: EE hadn't actually done any military training yet ;).All is not lost, however - while Eugen still hadn't quite got it right with Wargame: AirLand Battle (Better UI but still no time control), Wargame: Red Dragon has an improved UI and allows you to slow to a very slow speed, enabling appropriate single-player command over a varied force on a large map, and lets you deploy a force of your choice before the battle kicks off, and is well worth a look for SP RTS fans with an eye for realism.

												""Deeply disappointing, I wish I could return it.""I hate to have to say that about any game that I spent so much time looking into before buying, but this would be one of them. I have a history with RTS games, and while not my favorite genere, I was looking forward to a 1980's Cold War game that would allow me to move units around and let the computer do all the math for me. I also spent a number of hours watching the Youtube videos about this game and none of the issues that I found are in the vidoes or comments.Pro'sIts pretty if you zoom in and watch the units, of course to do that you lose contact with the rest of the map.Con'sThe manual holds only the basic functions and does not explain the Deck, Reinforcements, Stars or Points.The scenarios allow you to gain points which allow you to unlock types of units. From there you should be able to add them to a battle. However when you are in a battle, you get points, but you are limited to a certain number of units, which appear to be a secret cap number. When you unlock the units, yo only seem to get a certain number and they do not seem to be adjustable.Controls are managble but not easy and often you click a unit assign it and then when you think you are assigning another unit, you are actually redirecting the first unit.This game is also very hard. Even through the five starter scenarios, it was hair pulling hard. When I tried the AI play at easy, I would continually lose. More importantly, there does not seem to be an improvement each time I play it.I know that many of these complaints mark me as the fault, but this game does seem to be enjoyable to a very close niche of people. So make sure that you are one of those.Overall, if you think this will be any type of Cold War simulation type game, you will be disappointed. This is a poorer grade C&C with a Cold War skin. I strongly do not recommend this game, even for the $9.99 that I paid.			"

												Wargame European Escalation could of been alot better, if for instance you could select the tank e.g Lepord IA3 you wish to use unlimeted times without having to destroy the tank or wating for the numbers to go up in the top right hand corner, and if the second mission was not so hard. Also the menu layout of the game is terrible. i would not recomend this game for caslual players, who thinks that thay can go in this game and immediately fight another tank.Also anyone who is thinking of runing this game with an Intel 5000 GPU you wont be able to see the enemy tank even in lowest settings.

												This game has great concept but is poorly executed in some parts. Graphics are nice but where it fails is gameplay, it's just tedious and no fun at all. It was intended as a mixture beetween macro and micro managing your troops on the battlefield but the big problem is they can't effectively fight without your constant surveillance. I.e.  infantry won't take cover in nearby woods if engaged by tanks by itself, you have to tell them to. You have to tell your troops every small detail what to do and how to do it and in real time with so many troops it's simply not possible. Also the troops often execute your orders clumsily what only adds to the problem. The lack of any ai behaviour (beyond starting to fire and fleeing) in your troops is what ruins the game for me. Non-armed infantry transport and supply trucks are a major nuisance as well since you can't order them to leave the battlefield once they have fulfilled their function. You should be able to tell them to leave the battlefield via access routes. Also the armory is not easy to navigate and find troops you need, and having so many type of infantry cards with different transport is also clumsy execution imo. They should have put only infantry by type and then ask you to join desired transport card to them. This would make that part of armory much more clear and less messy.Command vehicle model for controling sector is not good either imo, you can spend plenty of time searching for a single hidden command vehicle while you have many troops stationed in the sector yourself, they should have stuck to the control point capping other game use.I do like some aspects of the game like having to supply your troops, limited number of troops ,access points, terrain effects etc however altogether they don't make a satisfactory game experience in a single player campaign... In multiplayer all players have the same hendicap and problems so I guess most of the problem are nullified however if you're looking for a good single player experience like I did I would advise you to steer clear from this one.

												We just bought this Game because its from the same Developers as RUSE, but we where more than frustrated.In RUSE you can see over all the Time what your Opponents are doing, even if the exact Type of Tank or Planes are unknown until you use a Spy. But you can at least see where they move and how much your Opponents are Building. Also its Perfect that the Tanks and Troops get Bigger when you Zoom out of the Map so you always see them PerfectlyIn WARGAME you see Nothing. This means you and your friends are spamming the Troops out of nowhere waiting that 20 Minutes later the PC attacks and you finally see his Troops. Also the Troops are  too small when you zoom out so that you see NOTHING.IF YOU DONT HAVE RUSE ... BUY RUSE AND FORGET THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!			"

Because the game requires a lot of thinking, element of suprise, flanking and so forth it can be frustrating.It's pretty obvious if you want to be good at this game you have to play a loooong time, as it also features an unlock system of units and so on.Very difficult game, if you are going to buy this you've been warned.

It seemed fun, and it seemed to have basic strategy elements to the game. But, I would not recommend it simply because it is not noob-friendly. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out how to play this game because there is no tutorial. It throws you into the game as if you are supposed to know what you are doing and what the controls are. And personally, I did not enjoy the 30 minutes I spent trying to learn basic controls, and I do not think most people would as well.			"

I am saying this game felt slow, after having played Total War and Civilization games. I did not like the lack of construction.

If you have all those games then yeah, by all means pick this one up but i would rather spend my time playing a better game. Visuals are nice and has a great selection of cold war era weaponry, but in the end the gameplay gets abit boring, theres no excitement, the cover system for your infantry just doesnt feel right and i prob wont be installing it again as theres nothing here that which makes me want to return, sure theres unlockables like new units, choppers are fun to mess around with but after one play through i had had my fun and moved on to the next game and havnt been back since, thats strange for an RTS. People will disagree, but this is my honest opinion and like i said theres just better games out there so on that basis i cant really recommend it. Its not the worst RTS i have played but its def not the greatest, Overall 6/10			"

												This game is allright, saying allright meaning it's right but somewhat overall....okay. The trickiest thing for a new player to over come the menu looking like a christmas light show with lots of annoying people stood in the way whilst everything confusingly flashes above. I payed the game and realised it didn't auto save, so i played the game again and the menu being confusing as it is, didn't save. so third time lucky I finished the first two missions for a third time. I realised that hiding anything that moves in a forrested area means it can fire again and live another day as tanks, aircraft and men can fire several kilometers across fields and have an accuracy of a German pornstar on an American beach. Eventually the game started to get rather complex and I bought some shiny new vehicles are recieving the special stars for being a good boy and taking time to move some of my units from A to B. Several minutes of watching an anti aircraft vehicle take many accurate but pointless potshots at a meerely observing enemy chopper I realised the wooded areas are like training wheels on a bicycle. Moving away from them makes all your units run away, yes run away and the poor men feeling ""worried"" and ""doubtful"" it's good to know the men are worried as I send 15 tanks towards an enemy fuel truck whilst infantry fire from miles away with incredible accuracy. Or that they all run out of fuel and sit there defending the same field for the rest of the game whilst I call in extra troops because the supply trucks loose their supplies within seconds of leaving the deopt because they supply practically every squirrel with nuts and every mole with fresh contact lenses and you find your trucks moving back and forwards like a tetris game gone wrong when you place a long piece at the side of a 3 block and it dosen't quite fit. Over all the game is interesting and the voice overs are amusing, if anything the maps are too big for the units and it becomes a pain to hunt for enemies and you find yourself out of fuel in various parts of the map. There are newer games but people are talking about them like they are out of date milk and are looking for somone to come and find the lumps in it like enemy units on this game.Bravo! 6/10 because I like how the chinooks land when you don't use them for a while!

												Do not buy.  The game is insidiously terrible on game mechanics.Just plain awful to play.  Not fun, if I am 100% honest, it is a ♥♥♥♥ing wind up merchant of a  game that must have been designed by a bunch of down sydromes.2/10, meaning rubbish.Stay away from a EUGEN made game.  RUSE which is the best game the frogs EUGEN ever made has bugs and annoyances in it, that only the French would do.I know of no other game maker in the world that makes a game like RUSE or this Wargame: European Escalation only to put in the French way of doing things.Like their cars, they are rubbish when they change things that do not need to be changed.We have a prime example of this in their game RUSE.  Brilliant game, but it has some of the most annoying and aggravating issues that constantly plague that game.  Wargame: European Escalation is not a real strategic game, due to its inept game mechanics that make it an almost impossible game to play unless you want to learn from some geek who has worked everything out.  I would rather learn my way and via a basic tutorial, which we all know European Escalation does not have a tutorial worth a carrot because the French think they know how to produce a game.  Dumb asses.			"

												I played this a bunch, but it was really a bit too hardcore of an RTS for my liking. The control mechanisms felt a bit clunky as well. I can see that RTS fans will probably lap this up, but for me it was too realistic and too slowly paced.I wouldn't recommend it personally, but if it's cheap and you're up for a fairly hardcore RTS experience, this could still be something you want to try out.

												Before I start I should mention that I am a huge RTS fan.The campaign is far too hard. I like that fact that there is a narrative; but what is the point when I can’t get past the first 4-5 missions. At no point does the campaign explain how to properly play the game.  You are basicly left out for the wolves.People are not downloading a 5 year old game for its online community; and its single player is far too brutal. Stay the ♥♥♥♥ away!!!I would have gotten a refund; but the long missions made it so that I broke the first 3 hours before hitting the brick wall.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME			"

												Meh... Some people will like this game but for me it's just too steep a learning curve and it's too hard. It is a lot more intricate than other RTS games. Don't expect one unit to beat another unit, like anti-tank beats tank, and tank beats infantry, you really have to look at the unit's weapons and stats. Good infantry with the right anti-tank weapon can kill a whole tank core.			"

												A game made by people who want real war but know nothing about it which is compounded by the utter lack of a proper UI units that are insanely unresponsive and controls that are completely lacking in way possible.  The game gives you zero tutorial so you are expected to not only get on the ground running with no proper training, you are expected to be ""pro"" at it the exact moment that you start playing the first ""mission"".  I akin the ""training and tutorial campaign"" to holding a new born child under water and expecting it to sprout lungs in order to compensate; that is not an exaggeration you will be hard pressed to enjoy this....experience.  The game touts realism but delivers none of it, it expects you to understand every single nuance about the game's mechanics right out of the gate and best yet, you have to ""earn"" the ability to call in units to even compete with the painfully obvious cheating AI and its superior units.  Mean while you are forced to defend significant portions of land with some of the most basic and painfully weak units in the entire game yet you are lead to believe that since this is the Cold War going hot that the East and West would be on relatively equal terms as far as preparedness and technology, but no by level two you learn very quickly that the developers know very little about the weapons of war during the time period.  This all carries over into multiplayer which by now is devoid of players, who have since moved on to greener pastures, so have fun playing against either max level players with all of their decks properly filled or....no one, or a friend who you tricked into buying this garbage in order to have someone to play with.    The general consensus even on this game's FORUMS is to miss this game unless you want the ""story', which is the most forgettable thing about this entire game, and buy Airland Battles or Red Dragon.  They both are a vastly improved version of this…lovely package and there is no need to grind for command points in order to play the game.			"

And the other 2 (If you unlock the 3rd theater you're a god) Are just as hard if not worse. 90% of the time you're Outgunned, Outmanned, Outmatched, Out of Resources, Out of hope and ready to smash your keyboard over the level dev's skull, And thats just the start of the mission. Multi-player is alright but it's still fustrating beyond belife and you don't get any good stuff because it would just so happen you can't get anymore command stars to buy new units.It's well built but your hair will be grey and covered in bald spots by the end of it. 6/10 I literally cried twice while playing it.

They made hti sgame way more complicated then it needs to be. I tried playing it and I realized ""oh hey, there is a learning curve. Alright I'll try to understand the game"". One hour later... ""Nah, it's just a piece of s**t. No learning curve, just bad mechanics."" For everyone that has played this game and doesn't like the mechanics, you will undertsand what I mean. Why would I want the management of my troops be that complicated?!?!?Also, an enemy helicopter took down: 1 AA Gun, 4 tanks, 3 Rifleman, and 2 Recon units. I had to call in 2 more AA guns and 3 anti-air infantry units to take down the enemy helicopter. Balanced much? And finally, the hidden units. Really f****** annoying when I'm just going along and then BAM! 3 enemy units appear out of now where and take down half my strike force in the area. And ya, I had recon units with me but enemy still hidden far enough away that it didn't matter.3/10, could be a lot better but the dev's must have skipped community testing.P.S. I forgot to mention this but the tutorial during the first mission sucks. Hard. Taught basically nothing considering how in-depth the game goes.			"

												Has terrible graphics even at high, you cant control the time, which gives the AI advantage since the speed of processing their tactics extremly fast (go to Red Dragon and play with an AI versus 2 AI's and you'll see what i mean).

												i would like to recommend it. and i enjoy parts of it. But its just not fun when you have next to no resources and the enemy has infinite resources and infinite reinforcements. When i barely have any starting resources in a campaign, and its one of the hated timed missions, its just not fun. I try to flank and take the not obvious route because the direct route is so heavily guarded and my russian tanks are utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Still fail because the enemy has reinforcements that come from nearly every edge of the map. The non-timed missions take so long and are just exhausting so i frequently just save and play something else because it becomes so tedious. "

												I bought this game a while back when it was on sale, hoping it would be similar to R.U.S.E. It is to some degree but this game kinda kicks itself in the behind by forgetting the basics of an open world RTS. The game is terribly restrictive despite being an open map RTS, your troops are goverened by 4 factors - Physchological state, ammo, fuel, repair status. Fuel runs out within mere minutes, you cant traverse  the map without having to refuel once or twice. Most missions do not even give you the ability to refuel your army unless you are lucky enough to capture a suply depot. So far it makes sense doesnt it, but here is the restrictive part. As expected the A.I. is automatically in control of these supply depots and so they are heavily reinforced, making you use tactical moves to beat the A.I. However you run out of fuel in doing so, so you are forced to go in head on. Ta Da problem is here. The A.I. being a computer some how has 100% accuracy with their weapons so the only way is to outgun them in order to win...oh dear, you are always out gunned in the first place so here is 1st catch 22 situation. Secdonly you do not really have the choice of what units to deploy, there is a pre-determined list of which you can select (unlock) units or not. Its a tediout game, not worth the time and trouble. Buy R.U.S.E which is absolutely fantastic, and is extremely similar to this game in terms of game interface and strategy requirements. Finally one aspect which really didnt make sense to me...you are play as part of NATO...a group of countries whos military power and resources easily rivals that of the USSR and its allies...why on earth is the game giving you only 5 tanks to take on 40 tanks?? It would have been a far better game if there was some way of obtaining more units, maybe in the style of World In Conflict or even R.U.S.E. Instead cant help but feel this game suffers from COD syndrome...one man army against the world. AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE!!I understand that i may have only played this game for 1.5 hours on record...however it has been much longer, and being an RTS fantatic...do understand the difference between good ones and bad ones as have experienced them.

												I thought this game looked cool, so I bought it. The first time I bought it, it was fun, but ran like crap. It shouldn't do that, because my PC can handle most other games at Max settings at at least 60 fps. I tried to fix it, but couldn't. I decided to refund it. About a month later, I had some money and decided to try it again. I downloaded it, and launched it. The graphics were super bugged out, so I closed out and relaunched. Same thing happened. I verified game files, then launched. SAME THING HAPPENED. The game was unplayable like this, so I deleted it and reinstalled, to see if it was just not verifying the files correctly, and the SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I am trying to see if there is something I missed, but right now don't buy this game.			"

												I can tell if i love or hate this game, it can be so difficult to understand at times that you feel like you should stop playing. But then when you win you find yourself in a sitation that you cannot help but to move on. Im not going to tell people not to get it however, This game is to good for that.What i will say is if you do then be prepared to think about it, you mess up and this game can be extremly harsh.

												 fuuuuuuuun! this game is really fun. it is an RTS so some people may not like it because you have to be always watching an stuff but i enjoy it quite a bit. it takes place in the cold war era and you play inbetween NATO and PACT (the warsaw pact). the campaign can be quite difficult even on easy(at least on my experiance) but it is still very enjoying. a lot of people conplain that the AI cheats but really it just deploys most of its units in its main base. usually you have to draw out some things so you can ambush them. so great game!!!pros:very funlots of unitsgood strategyveriety of units (helis, tanks ,support, ect.)keeps you thinkingcons:hard campaignhard AIgets boring somtimesoverall 7/10althogh my complaints i still support the series and will definatly get the other titles in the series when i get the chance "

												Wargame: EE is what RUSE should have been in the first place: a game that focuses on massive, accurate-to-scale battlefields, a diverse roster of units to choose from, and realistic tactics.  There's no basebuilding, no offsite artillery or airstrikes, no fancy RUSE cards - all you get are the units you spawn in and what you call in as reinforcements.  The units handle rather realistically too - many of the units have the strengths and weaknesses they have in real-life.Keep in mind though, it's not completely realistic.  Some abstractions were made for the sake of balance, a good example being the supply units.  Any type of supply unit and repair, refuel, and rearm anything on the field, until it runs out of supply points.  Overall, if you're tired of the typical base-building RTSes or games that are more about your APM/ build orders, then you'd definately find the game to be a fun change of pace.			"

												Wargame: European Escalation is an absolutely amazing game that breathes new life into the RTS genre. Pros:+ It has a very unique style of gameplay, and, in my opinion, the best campaign of all the Wargames (though the co-op aspects of the sequels are nice, the actual content and feel of those campaigns is lackluster). + I enjoy the feel of progression in the sense that you have to unlock command stars in order to buy the units used to build up your ideal deck, this also gives you the feeling that the deck represents your very own army.+ The game is visually stunning, the terrain looks beautiful and the chaos is immersive.Cons:- The A.I. in Skirmish mode tends to favour mass helicopter rushes at the beginning of the round, which leads to a fair deal of repetition and a significant amount of points spent on AA capabilities.- Being able to play the campaign missions with a friend would be super cool!- You rank up painfully slowly unless you play against other humans (which can make it slightly difficult to create solid decks for both NATO and PACT).Oh yeah, I think the multiplayer portion of this game is best enjoyed with a friend or three! Overall, I highly recommend this game. It's definitely one of my favourites!			"

												This game contains an impresive amount of troops,tanks,helicopters and artillery units.This gives you many options to own your opponent from sending an overwhelimg amount of tanks,troops etc or be ""fine and hard"" and care for quality over quanity.Maps are the most importent thing,depending on it you could go slow and worry about the small forest line to your left or worry about your troops being slaughtered in an open feild.The missions will require you to stop think go slow or even grab a pen and paper and plan out your operation BEFORE you even touvh the thing.Now this game has allite amount of problamos.Multiplayer,after you finish campain you will be dependent on this.Now the problem with this is that sometimes you will meet those trolls who will start a game with you then just surrender and leave (at least the developer team saw this and gave you the points that they had).The game isn't so noob freindly (the community is good) and you will get murdered by the level 100's 40's or even 10's.The rest are small and won't bother you to much			"

												This is a great game where you micromanage units to win strategic battles. I really like it because of the variety of units and maps to choose from, and the easy to learn hard to master concept of the game has left me amazed as my opponents do things I'd never think of, and imagining the looks  on their faces as i do the same to them. Though the campaign could be improved, as it is just attacking other units with no real planing involved. I'm excited to get the latest game in the franchise, red dragon, and I hope the reader feels the same way.			"

												The game brings large scale battlefields (up to 150 km²), 300+ more or less historical Cold War era units and features good looking and well optimized graphics. While the gameplay is nice, the game's main shortcoming is ill unit balance and the fact that units aren't realistic enough. This all can be easily changed with mod tools which are yet to come. All things considered, the game is a good fresh experience for any 3D RTS player and it has the potential of being even better.			"

												Great fun for the price it is and the experiance nothing like it.I did a skirmish after learning the basics and I decided to send out a recon team to see where the enemy was and to mine and tha ai surprise both our recon teams found each other and engaged the ai won that but as they where fighting I sent out a couple of choppers in support who came to the area and mowed down the recon team. Then my battery died but besides that it was amazing fun so get this and you wont be dissapointed.			"

												Wargame: European Escalation is a really complicated and sometimes frustrating version of World in Conflict...essentially.You need to think about troop deployment in this game. You can't just spam tanks. Tanks are expensive.For a rookie who doesn't know how to command an army, I would not recommend playing this game.For someone who will catch on...sure, go ahead.Be ready to play extensively and be ready to retry individual levels repeatedly.

												            I got the game and it was a good buy, I have to admit. There are a few thinks I dont like though. For starters, I like infantry. On war games I head staright for infantry units. In the modern times I guess they might be less important, but still. After playing the game for a total of around 5 or 6 hours I have concluded it was a good game, but the infantry in my opinion was too under powerd compared to the other units. AI and other players just spammed units, Usually, helicopters or tanks, but me, as liking infantry for the love of God, couldn't do the same with my infantry. I guess it makes some scince, but I personally wish I could have done more with my beloved grunts and air cavalry. As for the graphics, they were good for the size of the game, and the game era is a good choice, alot to play off of. I recommend it to those who don't have a over resounding attachment to infantry soldiers, and are good with mechanized and air mobile assults.			"

												Really well worked out and fresh RTS.Wich diserves more attention in my eyes.The game play's diffrent then any rts out there.Its a crossbree of games like ruse/totalwar/world in conflict but also adds extra realism in it, you have to keep an eye on the ammo and feul of your army and resuply if nessisary. if you do'n your fighting force will just come to a halt.the multiplayer scoring system is really fun ( it doesn't matter how much you controll of the map but what does matter is the damage you inflict.example "" of the enemy sends an expansive apache of about 175 points and you can destroy it you earn 175 points. the 1st side/team that reaches the set number of points win the match.this also forces tyou to play safe with the more advanced expensive unitts ( a t80 is a though tank but can still be destroyed if it runs in an ambush of relativly cheap units)the game has more then 360 difrent units all with difrent stats  you can unlock units by leveling up or finishing			"

												Where do I begin. This game is amazing. Simple as that. It's complicated, very complicated, but a wonderful representation of the Cold War and it rewards people who play strategy games with real military thinking. That is of course, until the time to think is over and time to act begins. Once the shooting starts, things get very chaotic very fast just like a real battlefield. Prepare all you want, and once the battle begins hope your men don't rout from terror and that they can shoot straighter than their enemy regardless if that's NATO or the Warsaw Pact. This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥the first 100 games, then you might be able to survive a tiny bit, so take is slow and learn. This game is quite the adventure...			"

												OK, this game is not for everyone.I've bought it yesterday and I've started the single player campaign. After playing the first mission I was pleased but not C&C Generals pleased. Then I've played the second.Damn this thing is hard. One wrong move and you've lost all your units. And no, compared to Ground Control or War in Conflict, it is rather hard to get your units back. Right now I'm still at level 2 in the middle of the mission.Then I've tried the multiplayer.Damn, that was awesome and intense! I've never played anything like it. After wasting half of my units in a stupid rush, the other player told me to stand down. He gave me some instructions and it seemed like no one was doing anything.He told me ""wait and defend"".Then I've got the idea of getting 8 artillery guns. He gave me some targets and the feeling of crushing entire battalions with every salvo is amazing! We were lead by 1000 points and soon, after I've leveled every enemy position with artillery we were ahead. In the last minutes of the game, the other team made a final desperate attack using choppers. In the last two minutes I've bought anti-air, sent it to the target (it is amazing how far anti-air can shoot in this game) and seen all his airforce down. The end?A tie but this was the most intense multiplayer match in my life and believe me, I've played a few.  For hardcore strategy gamers who also have a lot of patience, this game rocks.PS: I'm playing it on a ultrabook with integrated graphics. I'm getting 30 fps with DX 11 and medium to low settings. On DX 9 It's smoother than ever.			"

												I was one of the last minute buyers of the steam holiday sale 2015. I had the hardest decision to make it was buy the franchise of wargame or buy The Forest. I realized that the Forest was only 2 bucks off while the franchise with all 3 games and dlc was 75-80 percent off. TWAS A GLORIOUS DAY TO CHOOSE THIS GAME AND ITS FRANCHISE PACK!!! It's really good. The AI will not wait for you to build your units THEY WILL come after you. IMO i made it a common strategy to put tanks and infantry as well as AA to go clear the ground and skies then let the Command armour come to the zone when it is clear. Overall good game for me so far.			"

												Overall this is a good, fast paced RTS with great graphics and a realistic feeling to it. However it has major shortcomings when it comes to controlling units and visualizing commands that makes it too easy to have unnecessary mistakes that cannot be corrected due to the pace of the game. That in itself is an interesting feature of the game that separates the experts from the average player. However in order to truly enjoy the game play you need to sink a lot of time into it for the aforementioned reason.Single playerGood campaign and interesting progression with some replay ability.An unholy amount of micro if you are not careful.Multiplayer [if there is anyone who has not moved on yet]Great community.Unfortunate progression requirement but not game breaking to have certain units.Wait for a sale			"

												A good game in my opinion.  The maps are large and very well done, the units are accurate and are very detailed, the AI works well enough in my opinion, limiting the need for constant baby sitting, though at times you will find yourself closely watching one or two groups of units because you cant rely on the AI to use them properly.The only problem I've ever had with the game is that at times it just becomes too big to warrant a 1v1 game, hell even in the campaign I find myself starring at a giant map that really serves to discourage me.   While not a problem, I find that the overall size of the game can be daunting to people, and is a reason why I don't play W:EE all that much.  Still it is possible to get past the size of the map, and a few other problems in the game (in my own opinion) and enjoy it.  Still, if you're an RTS fan, you'll enjoy this game, it offers some cool features, such as spending command stars to unlock new units for you to use, allowing for different combinations, especially in the campaign. Not to mention that the campaign isn't all that bad itself. "

												Where do I begin. This game is amazing. Simple as that. It's complicated, very complicated, but a wonderful representation of the Cold War and it rewards people who play strategy games with real military thinking. That is of course, until the time to think is over and time to act begins. Once the shooting starts, things get very chaotic very fast just like a real battlefield. Prepare all you want, and once the battle begins hope your men don't rout from terror and that they can shoot straighter than their enemy regardless if that's NATO or the Warsaw Pact. This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥the first 100 games, then you might be able to survive a tiny bit, so take is slow and learn. This game is quite the adventure...			"

												oh well... what to say... what to say...I LOVED THIS GAME!!!!seriously, if you are an addicted or just an RTS fan, you'll love this game, I suggest you to buy this game first before buying the other 2 games of Wargame, (the airland battles and the red dragon), cuz the mechanics are complex, and you need to handle the land battles first before coordnating bombing missions while trapping the enemy troops inside a city for complete obliteration.The game is good in almost all the aspects... BUTthe AI just SUCKS, and that's why i like to play against the Commie AI, cuz it is the closest thing that i can get from reality.Check this out:i was playing against an Medium AI on the Siege mode, i was defending, and the AI Attacking.Fine.Set all my men into a city and started to gather positions ASAPAAs...ATs...those kind of things.OK! good so far uh?but then, when the match started i had to wait for about... 20 minutes to the AI to find where my troops where. and when they did find...i think the AI commander was like:""PUT ZEM CHOPPAHS ON ZE CITY!""and about 15-16 MI stormed the city.2 min later they where all dead...but, as i was fighting the commies, i think the game creators went back to the WWII tatics and created an AI with the ""FOR THE MOTHERLAND"" ""tatics""so then.30 tanks and a hell of a human wave, stormed the city from some hill i had left unprotected (my mistake...)and just started running and driving straight into the city.I though it was dumb. but i paniked when i saw that more than a half of my men had died from that♥♥♥♥♥♥..but the commies paid the price and the AI retreated to its initial positions and the rest of the match was a boring game of ""cat-and-rat"" when i was hunting the commies down...WELL!thats my review!But for real, DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF YOU ARE AN RTS FAN!really.I LOVED THIS GAME11/10			"

												World in Conflict + SupremeCommander + RUSE + RealismWith all the simplified games coming out nowadays, this game is pretty refreshing with a few complex features in its gameplay and the fact that it's not another FPS game. Wargame is a realistic RTS game with large scale battles and a huge list of units to choose from.Gameplay: Choose units that you want to deploy (from a list of units that is customizable) and choose there locations. Start by capturing sectors for a slow income for reinforcements (sometimes sectors can reinforce too). The team who destroys the most points of units wins.Few notes: Maps are huge, unit travel can take a while and requires smart positioning. Their isnt much microing and speed involved in this game compared to games like Starcraft but rather involves more strategy in position and right timed attacks.I'd say this RTS game is great and if you liked any of the games listed above, this game may be worth checking out.

												This is probably the best RTS game I've ever had the joy of playing.It has a murderously steep learning curve, you'll spend your first dozen games being wiped off the map by the communist hordes or being crushed by the gears of capitalism - but once you adapt and get the hang of it, you'll feel like the most accomplished tactician ever. You'll sit with a wily grin as your mortal enemy is lured into your traps, you'll applaud yourself for having had the cunning to have anticipated his next move.This is not a micromanager's game - you don't need to mash your keyboard like you're having a siezure to get things done. You don't need to open up the inventory of some piddling little pissant infantryman to give him more ammo. You're just a cold, calculating, scheming mastermind with a whole front to play war in.			"

												Set in the rarely explored period of 1975-1985, Wargame: European Escalation pits NATO (USA and Western Europe) against the Warsaw Pact (Soviet and Eastern European countries) in battles that explore “what could have been.” The specter of nuclear warfare loomed large over the real Cold War, but this catastrophic outcome was the ultimate last resort. Large, armored offensives through Europe would certainly have been the core of this hypothetical war; and this is what the game’s explosive campaign takes you through!			"

												Wargame European Escalation is a very unique RTS starter. You do not build bases but what you do have is many units at your disposal. This game involves more strategy then most especially later on in campaign. The realism reacts quiet well with your vehicles getting stucked in the mud because tires delaying their travel or your army being frightened because their tank is about to explode and them running away.The game gives you optional objectives in campaign which will give you more stars. Stars are used to unlock various units from tanks,foot troops,supply units and high ranged things. The game has kept me playing hours and I feel a sense of getting better as if I was playing dark souls and had gotten better. With that said I give this game a 10/10 for realism and the amount of strategy it takes.			"

												Pleasantly surprised with how enjoyable this sucker is. A nice mix of RTS, with light touch resource management. A lot of replayablility in this, which I wouldn't have expected at first...but I find I keep playing the same maps over and over again trying different strategies and different mixes of units. That is the blats of it, is that the units are relatively simple...but pretty varied and fun to mix and match up for different battle groups. Anywho thumbs up, check it out if you like RTS.			"

												This is a game for strategy lovers, not those CoH 2 small scale type strategies, but real actual war strategy. Be prepared though to spend some time (30-60 mins to understand the details and how they shape your platoon)  learning the game and understanding the unit tech info. This is a game about war. The beauty of it and the death. Oh yeas once you loose units through campaign they are gone, permadeath. Oh and you will need to think of supplies.The game is a grand scale RTS in that you are on a real battlefield where you can zoom out to tactical view of the whole map or on the shoulder of your infantry. The game has very accurate description of military equipment and units (with some that are a bit changed for game balance purposes).Pros:RealisticBig scalePermadeath that requires you to be responsible in leading your troopsAbility to customize your platoon, i.e. choose which units to unlockFree DLC'sConsUnderstanding the game takes timeNot that many people in multiplayer now (as there are now two sequls to the game, but I recommend this one as it is a good intro into the series)Sometimes you are forced to quick save/quick load as some missions are really difficult and loosing precious units hurtsOverall score 8/10 and a must have for any strategy loverMore reviews at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												By far the most detailed and realistic real time strategy game I've ever played. Any hardcore RTS fan should defintely try this out. However, the realism can be a double-edged sword; when deploying your army you have to take into consideration things like fuel capacity, ammunition, morale, weapon specs, ect. Despite the complexity, this game is geared towards the RTS enthusiast and does not dissapoint. "

												Overall this is a good, fast paced RTS with great graphics and a realistic feeling to it. However it has major shortcomings when it comes to controlling units and visualizing commands that makes it too easy to have unnecessary mistakes that cannot be corrected due to the pace of the game. That in itself is an interesting feature of the game that separates the experts from the average player. However in order to truly enjoy the game play you need to sink a lot of time into it for the aforementioned reason.Single playerGood campaign and interesting progression with some replay ability.An unholy amount of micro if you are not careful.Multiplayer [if there is anyone who has not moved on yet]Great community.Unfortunate progression requirement but not game breaking to have certain units.Wait for a sale			"

												I bought this game when the price droped as I did not have the time to invest to play this against other players.The more modern equipment made me want this game as I like the cold war military stuff.But the game seems to have a pretty steep learning curve and I get the idea you must exacly do what the developer wants while playing the campaign or you are not going to make it.The realism is nice but I would have prefered some player preference options like showing the visibility range of a selected unit like we could in Ruse or weapons ranges would also have made the game a bit more enjoyable for me.For example I was playing on a level with a hill and the units  hidden in the trees would not engage a command unit sitting at the base of the hill for no clear reason , but i suspect there was an issue with visibility.Another improvement would have been some clarification of weapons, unless your are really into military equipment you have no idea what the weapon does except for what you can make from its name and picture.The campaign missions can easily take you an hour and more to complete.You also must try to loose as few units as possible because those units can not be ""bought"" in next campaigns when lost.Here too I would have liked to see a player preference option as it can suck the fun out of the game.But these cons are not enough to give up so I keep trying to complete the campaign levels.Thats why I would recommend this game but only to players who are looking for a more complex micromanagement heavy game in a cold war setting.

												Similar to Wargame Airland Battle.  RTS.  If you have played the Wargame Airland Battle, this will all seem pretty similar.  This too has a steep learning curve for those new players but if you are willing to invest, it all will be worth it.  I originally started with this and then went to Wargame Airland Battles.  The campaign is fun and fast paced.  Multiplayer gives any player a strong challenge.			"

												RTT (Real Time Tactics) with visuals and tactical gaming at its finest. Its all about picking your units, placing them at chokepoints etc and using them strategically, as what you pick is vital on the battlefield. Fully recommended for any strategy gamers. Only negative complaint I have, is the rubbish user interface.WARNING: Campaign is ridiculously hard with no signs of changing difficulty to make it easier. However, its not impossible and it feels so good once you beat each mission. "

												Just got this a few weeks ago, and it's a good game. I can see why it spawned 2 sequels which I'll probably get at some point. That being said, the learning curve is insanely difficult (at least for me) and the single-player campaigns feel designed to screw you over at every possible turn. There are still some people playing multiplayer, and it's more fun than single-player, and fairer (strangely) than the AI.Definitely still worth getting, although the sequels are probably better at this point.

												This is a game for strategy lovers, not those CoH 2 small scale type strategies, but real actual war strategy. Be prepared though to spend some time (30-60 mins to understand the details and how they shape your platoon)  learning the game and understanding the unit tech info. This is a game about war. The beauty of it and the death. Oh yeas once you loose units through campaign they are gone, permadeath. Oh and you will need to think of supplies.The game is a grand scale RTS in that you are on a real battlefield where you can zoom out to tactical view of the whole map or on the shoulder of your infantry. The game has very accurate description of military equipment and units (with some that are a bit changed for game balance purposes).Pros:RealisticBig scalePermadeath that requires you to be responsible in leading your troopsAbility to customize your platoon, i.e. choose which units to unlockFree DLC'sConsUnderstanding the game takes timeNot that many people in multiplayer now (as there are now two sequls to the game, but I recommend this one as it is a good intro into the series)Sometimes you are forced to quick save/quick load as some missions are really difficult and loosing precious units hurtsOverall score 8/10 and a must have for any strategy loverMore reviews at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												Set in the rarely explored period of 1975-1985, Wargame: European Escalation pits NATO (USA and Western Europe) against the Warsaw Pact (Soviet and Eastern European countries) in battles that explore “what could have been.” The specter of nuclear warfare loomed large over the real Cold War, but this catastrophic outcome was the ultimate last resort. Large, armored offensives through Europe would certainly have been the core of this hypothetical war; and this is what the game’s explosive campaign takes you through!			"

												Wargame European Escalation is a very unique RTS starter. You do not build bases but what you do have is many units at your disposal. This game involves more strategy then most especially later on in campaign. The realism reacts quiet well with your vehicles getting stucked in the mud because tires delaying their travel or your army being frightened because their tank is about to explode and them running away.The game gives you optional objectives in campaign which will give you more stars. Stars are used to unlock various units from tanks,foot troops,supply units and high ranged things. The game has kept me playing hours and I feel a sense of getting better as if I was playing dark souls and had gotten better. With that said I give this game a 10/10 for realism and the amount of strategy it takes.			"

												Smart RTS with litterally hundreds of units to choose from; it caters to a wide range of strategies for every arm chair general.  The graphics are top notch; missiles fire off rails, turrets turn, guns recoil, terrain burns, etc.  Helicopter in troops to set up ambushes inside buildings or carefully maneuver a group of tanks across a narrow bridge to surprise the enemy in a flanking maneuver!  As you play, you gain xp both for yourself and your units.  Units are persistant through the single player campaigns, and there's a finite number of them, so the game emphasises on limited casualties.  As you gain in level, you pick up unlock points which you can use to unlock more advanced units of your choosing to customize your forces significantly.  The DLC's added a powerful Co-op mode to fight the AI, which is amongst the best I've faced in an RTS.  Great fun for up to 8 players!			"

												This game is very decent. It isn't what i would call the perfect strategy game but it does have nice graphics and good action and destuction between units. I would recommend getting this game if you have been waiting for a modern combat RTS that looks real. For anyone who remembers Command & Conquer generals, this has some of the same things. It doesn't have the economic part like the C&C so if you are buying this to replace and you are expecting everything that C&C has then you will be dissappointed. But for those that don't mind a little change, it is good. I would have to say that the controls are a whole lot easier to use than the old C&C series. Remember this isn't what you would call a campaign. This is a multiplayer focus RTS with a high intensity of combat.			"

												Buy Company of Heroes instead.  Based on all the supiciously postive revies, I must be missing something, but I could not get into this game.  In fact, I hated it so much I'm going to write a review which I never ever do.  I read the reviews and though, ""Great, a nice graphic strategy game.  I like and am good at strategy games, and it's $2!  What a steal!""  I want my money back.  As someone else pointed out, there's a reason they don't offer a demo for this game. The user starting interface looks like it came chronologically before Command and Conquer, and built on a budget.  It's so bad there's a tutorial in the game for how to use it.  As for strategy, I tried using my light vehicles for recon like they instructed, but learned the hard way that rushing is always better.  Honestly, there is more strategy in tic-tac-toe.  Touching on pacing, ""slow and strategic""?  Are we playing different games?  One review sums it up when they wrote that the tanks would have to be doing 200mph to do the speeds they do in the game.  It's like controlling a million little racecars that all blend into the terrian and all have spec sheets that are longer than your arm.    And the tutorial throws things at you so fast and so poorly that your eyes will go cross trying to figure it all out.  ""Press this button to group units""?  Why don't we send every enemy unit at you while you sort through our complicated menu screen to find that button.  I just gave up trying to find it, not that it mattered as rushing seems to be the better strategy anyway.  The learning curve on this game is more like a right angle!  As an example of how bad the tutorial is, I don't normally use tutorials as I can just figure out the game on my own, but the tutorial is preprogramed so I thought I'd give it it's go.  It took me almost 6 minutes into the first mission before I found my troops and were able to move them as the tutorial kept trying to point out ally units that were totally pointless to the whole mission, and my units blended in so well I couldn't see them.Additionally, the mini-map is by far the worst I've ever seen.  I felt like I needed a mini-map to understand what I was looking at on the mini-map!  It kept trying to show me what I can only imagine is the angle that my camera was rotated to in such a way to show what my field of vision would be if I was looking at the main map.  If that made sense to you, you might like this game, but I kept having to furiously scroll around on the mini-map to get it to go over the red blobs that were attacking me that I just gave up on the whole mini-map. Now, I love strategy games, and I have played MANY of them, both new and old.  But this game doesn't even rank in my top 50.  Want a good strategy game with realism and a myriad units?  I suggest Company of Heroes, and I would wager that CoH2 will also be good.  Can't be worse than this.			"

												A beautiful RTS game with a wonderful, user friendly interface and very simple controls.The game is easy to learn, but difficult to master, which is in my opinion-perfect.With literally hundreds of units to choose from, creating a deck (which determine what units you bring to the battlefield) is a game in itself.The graphics are excellent, and the ability to seamlessly zoom in and out of the battlefield at any given moment makes this that much easier, and funner to play.Also, unlike many other RTS games, the units aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.They unleash thier firepower without holding back.You see the true effectiveness of tank shells, rockets and flamethrowers as you would expect in real life.No bullcrap 10 shots from a tank to kill a single infantry unit.No. Infact, a single High Explosive Shell can easily knock out an entire platoon of Infantry.The game has a very nice random factor added to it.From accuracy, to firing archs, to critical hits of all kinds-It really does keep you on your toes.Although the gameplay is a bit slow-I might find it in myself to say that is a good thing.Considering the large scale of the battlefields availble to you, it makes it much easier to manage things, even micro manage if you have a quick hand.All in all this is a great game with many things for you to discover on your own.Hope this helps to make up your mind! :)-Jenna <3-			"

												Brilliant and challanging tactical real time game. I do not think it is a strategy as such as you do not have much of a resourse managment. Great realism and  number of different types of units is one of the strongest points. The single player is challanging and the hypotetical cold war scenarios turining into real war are really fun. My only negatives are somehow odd feeling UI (the maps are big and I personally do not like to mouse cursor) and the lack of more diverse terain (lack of proper mountains, deserts and jungle).			"

Looks cool and is fun to play. Play the first 5 solo missions first to get a feel for it. Multiplayer is fun, but you'll need some unlocks first, so tackle the singleplayer first.			"

												Definitely one of the sickest Real Time Strategy titles out there. Much MUCH larger than other RTSs, it feels like Arma from the Commander's seat. Simple yet complicated as hell. If you loved RUSE, Wargame is pretty much the sequal.  Uses the IrisZoom engine that RUSE used.  Set in the time period after Vietnam, the Cold War becomes a Hot War and you are put in command of NATO forces and PACT forces.  NATO includes the USA, Great Britain, West Germany and France.  PACT includes East Germany, Czech, Poland and of course the USSR.  Most notable is the scale of Wargame.  Be prepared to track hundreds of miles using Light and Heavy Armour, Recon units, Infantry, Artillery, Helicopters, and more.			"

Perfect balance between realism and playability, and admit it, we really lacked  a good realist RTS game on modern warfare!			"

												This is a game for strategy lovers, not those CoH 2 small scale type strategies, but real actual war strategy. Be prepared though to spend some time (30-60 mins to understand the details and how they shape your platoon)  learning the game and understanding the unit tech info. This is a game about war. The beauty of it and the death. Oh yeas once you loose units through campaign they are gone, permadeath. Oh and you will need to think of supplies.The game is a grand scale RTS in that you are on a real battlefield where you can zoom out to tactical view of the whole map or on the shoulder of your infantry. The game has very accurate description of military equipment and units (with some that are a bit changed for game balance purposes).Pros:RealisticBig scalePermadeath that requires you to be responsible in leading your troopsAbility to customize your platoon, i.e. choose which units to unlockFree DLC'sConsUnderstanding the game takes timeNot that many people in multiplayer now (as there are now two sequls to the game, but I recommend this one as it is a good intro into the series)Sometimes you are forced to quick save/quick load as some missions are really difficult and loosing precious units hurtsOverall score 8/10 and a must have for any strategy loverMore reviews at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

You'll sit with a wily grin as your mortal enemy is lured into your traps, you'll applaud yourself for having had the cunning to have anticipated his next move.This is not a micromanager's game - you don't need to mash your keyboard like you're having a siezure to get things done. You don't need to open up the inventory of some piddling little pissant infantryman to give him more ammo. You're just a cold, calculating, scheming mastermind with a whole front to play war in.			"

This is like playing Ground Control, where you are given few units. You must think tactically to outsmart enemies. Terrain and environment, along w/ untis' abilitys play HUGE role in combat. A pure tactical RTS game!Bad:1. Horrendous tutorial that will make your fingers cratch your head more than they will be used to click on mouse. If you can get over it, you'll be fine.2. The GUI is odd looking. 3. Need high end pc to get the best gfx quality.OVERALL: If you've played R.U.S.E or Ground Control or similar RTS game, then this will be your cup of tea.

												Coming from the same developers as R.U.S.E., Wargame: European Escalation may feel familiar in its large scale. Fully real-time, Wargame is a RTS game focusing on a fictional escalation of the Cold War into a full-scale war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. This game features zero base-building. Positioning (flanking, cover, ambushes) is everything: several well-placed infantry units in a forest can wreck enemy tanks, and a pair of hidden heavy tanks can tear up targets from long range. Deployment of units is handled with command points, gained through control of sectors. The starting allocation of units is determined by your active deck- one deck for the NATO player, and one deck for the PACT player. Decks are expanded through Command Stars, gained through campaign progress and multiplayer EXP. New units, such as the T-80 tank or the ubiquitous M1 Abrams, are purchased with Command Stars. The game is tough and has a steep learning curve, but few games are more satisfying to master.			"

												This game can be a bit frustrating/confusing at first, but once you get the hang of things it is incredible.  The main plus is the INCREDIBLE number of vehichles and units, hundreds of them.  Building up points, customizing your deck of units, and watching them gain experince over time is really rewarding.  The one down side is a lack of any campaign  a la Total War.  All you get are battles here.			"

												This game is very decent. It isn't what i would call the perfect strategy game but it does have nice graphics and good action and destuction between units. I would recommend getting this game if you have been waiting for a modern combat RTS that looks real. For anyone who remembers Command & Conquer generals, this has some of the same things. It doesn't have the economic part like the C&C so if you are buying this to replace and you are expecting everything that C&C has then you will be dissappointed. But for those that don't mind a little change, it is good. I would have to say that the controls are a whole lot easier to use than the old C&C series. Remember this isn't what you would call a campaign. This is a multiplayer focus RTS with a high intensity of combat.			"

												Requires you to play through an annoying champain to unlock any units. Most of which seem to be an annoying tutorial which will drag your cam all over in the worst of times, preventing you from reaching points of cover before your enemy. If you go to the forum to complain about this fact, be ready to scroll through a page of BS excuses as to why you should love the flaws such as these, complete with ""gtfo""s and fanboy praise of the general crappyness.It feels thrown together on an engine that wasnt intended for an RTS in anyway, and plays more like an RPG-RTS than a wargame. lacks a real UI, and feels like it was coded by a collage student.Im sure if you give it a chance, you too could hate it as much as I do.

												Buy Company of Heroes instead.  Based on all the supiciously postive revies, I must be missing something, but I could not get into this game.  In fact, I hated it so much I'm going to write a review which I never ever do.  I read the reviews and though, ""Great, a nice graphic strategy game.  I like and am good at strategy games, and it's $2!  What a steal!""  I want my money back.  As someone else pointed out, there's a reason they don't offer a demo for this game. The user starting interface looks like it came chronologically before Command and Conquer, and built on a budget.  It's so bad there's a tutorial in the game for how to use it.  As for strategy, I tried using my light vehicles for recon like they instructed, but learned the hard way that rushing is always better.  Honestly, there is more strategy in tic-tac-toe.  Touching on pacing, ""slow and strategic""?  Are we playing different games?  One review sums it up when they wrote that the tanks would have to be doing 200mph to do the speeds they do in the game.  It's like controlling a million little racecars that all blend into the terrian and all have spec sheets that are longer than your arm.    And the tutorial throws things at you so fast and so poorly that your eyes will go cross trying to figure it all out.  ""Press this button to group units""?  Why don't we send every enemy unit at you while you sort through our complicated menu screen to find that button.  I just gave up trying to find it, not that it mattered as rushing seems to be the better strategy anyway.  The learning curve on this game is more like a right angle!  As an example of how bad the tutorial is, I don't normally use tutorials as I can just figure out the game on my own, but the tutorial is preprogramed so I thought I'd give it it's go.  It took me almost 6 minutes into the first mission before I found my troops and were able to move them as the tutorial kept trying to point out ally units that were totally pointless to the whole mission, and my units blended in so well I couldn't see them.Additionally, the mini-map is by far the worst I've ever seen.  I felt like I needed a mini-map to understand what I was looking at on the mini-map!  It kept trying to show me what I can only imagine is the angle that my camera was rotated to in such a way to show what my field of vision would be if I was looking at the main map.  If that made sense to you, you might like this game, but I kept having to furiously scroll around on the mini-map to get it to go over the red blobs that were attacking me that I just gave up on the whole mini-map. Now, I love strategy games, and I have played MANY of them, both new and old.  But this game doesn't even rank in my top 50.  Want a good strategy game with realism and a myriad units?  I suggest Company of Heroes, and I would wager that CoH2 will also be good.  Can't be worse than this.			"

The time period is amazing as is the gameplay and events in it.You organize all of your units in a ""deck"" and you can custimize and choose which decks you want before a match. For example I have a USA and USSR deck for both factions in the game.You use command points earned from leveling up to buy new units to put in your deck which makes your armies more effective and powerful.10/10			"

The graphic and sound design in this game are awesome, and you can easily expect intense battles playout with half a dozen macros, that turn the tide of the battle.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys tactic strategies, such as Company of Heroes, RUSE, Total War series, Dawn of War series etc.			"

												World in Conflict + SupremeCommander + RUSE + RealismWith all the simplified games coming out nowadays, this game is pretty refreshing with a few complex features in its gameplay and the fact that it's not another FPS game. Wargame is a realistic RTS game with large scale battles and a huge list of units to choose from.Gameplay: Choose units that you want to deploy (from a list of units that is customizable) and choose there locations. Start by capturing sectors for a slow income for reinforcements (sometimes sectors can reinforce too). The team who destroys the most points of units wins.Few notes: Maps are huge, unit travel can take a while and requires smart positioning. Their isnt much microing and speed involved in this game compared to games like Starcraft but rather involves more strategy in position and right timed attacks.I'd say this RTS game is great and if you liked any of the games listed above, this game may be worth checking out.

												Coming from the same developers as R.U.S.E., Wargame: European Escalation may feel familiar in its large scale. Fully real-time, Wargame is a RTS game focusing on a fictional escalation of the Cold War into a full-scale war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. This game features zero base-building. Positioning (flanking, cover, ambushes) is everything: several well-placed infantry units in a forest can wreck enemy tanks, and a pair of hidden heavy tanks can tear up targets from long range. Deployment of units is handled with command points, gained through control of sectors. The starting allocation of units is determined by your active deck- one deck for the NATO player, and one deck for the PACT player. Decks are expanded through Command Stars, gained through campaign progress and multiplayer EXP. New units, such as the T-80 tank or the ubiquitous M1 Abrams, are purchased with Command Stars. The game is tough and has a steep learning curve, but few games are more satisfying to master.			"

It's good old tank warfare with all the trimmings. The game offers an astounding number of total units, and some fantastic graphics and sound modelling. There is a lot here to like. The single-player campaign is not as involved as RUSE was, but they at least give a reason the fight is happening, and drop you in with more interesting objectives than just building a huge mass of tanks and rolling over some geography.

												            I got the game and it was a good buy, I have to admit. There are a few thinks I dont like though. For starters, I like infantry. On war games I head staright for infantry units. In the modern times I guess they might be less important, but still. After playing the game for a total of around 5 or 6 hours I have concluded it was a good game, but the infantry in my opinion was too under powerd compared to the other units. AI and other players just spammed units, Usually, helicopters or tanks, but me, as liking infantry for the love of God, couldn't do the same with my infantry. I guess it makes some scince, but I personally wish I could have done more with my beloved grunts and air cavalry. As for the graphics, they were good for the size of the game, and the game era is a good choice, alot to play off of. I recommend it to those who don't have a over resounding attachment to infantry soldiers, and are good with mechanized and air mobile assults.			"

												OK, this game is not for everyone.I've bought it yesterday and I've started the single player campaign. After playing the first mission I was pleased but not C&C Generals pleased. Then I've played the second.Damn this thing is hard. One wrong move and you've lost all your units. And no, compared to Ground Control or War in Conflict, it is rather hard to get your units back. Right now I'm still at level 2 in the middle of the mission.Then I've tried the multiplayer.Damn, that was awesome and intense! I've never played anything like it. After wasting half of my units in a stupid rush, the other player told me to stand down. He gave me some instructions and it seemed like no one was doing anything.He told me ""wait and defend"".Then I've got the idea of getting 8 artillery guns. He gave me some targets and the feeling of crushing entire battalions with every salvo is amazing! We were lead by 1000 points and soon, after I've leveled every enemy position with artillery we were ahead. In the last minutes of the game, the other team made a final desperate attack using choppers. In the last two minutes I've bought anti-air, sent it to the target (it is amazing how far anti-air can shoot in this game) and seen all his airforce down. The end?A tie but this was the most intense multiplayer match in my life and believe me, I've played a few.  For hardcore strategy gamers who also have a lot of patience, this game rocks.PS: I'm playing it on a ultrabook with integrated graphics. I'm getting 30 fps with DX 11 and medium to low settings. On DX 9 It's smoother than ever.			"

												Two years after releasing R.U.S.E,  Eugen Systems made a new strategy game, this time set in a what if alternate timeline set during the Cold War.The story follows that the Russians along with its Eastern European allies have begun an invasion of the rest of Europe following several high tension situations, including a real life event where a East German guard escaped to the West and killed two guards who were in his way.Like in R.U.S.E, you will be looking at things from above, but unlike that game you can actually zoom in and see all the details on the vehicles and infantry.During the missions, your units will gain combat experience from the battles they will be engaged in and if you lose them, they're gone and you can't use them for the next mission.The AI can be a little stupid at times, but it offers plenty of challenges that strategy gamers will enjoy.

												World in Conflict + SupremeCommander + RUSE + RealismWith all the simplified games coming out nowadays, this game is pretty refreshing with a few complex features in its gameplay and the fact that it's not another FPS game. Wargame is a realistic RTS game with large scale battles and a huge list of units to choose from.Gameplay: Choose units that you want to deploy (from a list of units that is customizable) and choose there locations. Start by capturing sectors for a slow income for reinforcements (sometimes sectors can reinforce too). The team who destroys the most points of units wins.Few notes: Maps are huge, unit travel can take a while and requires smart positioning. Their isnt much microing and speed involved in this game compared to games like Starcraft but rather involves more strategy in position and right timed attacks.I'd say this RTS game is great and if you liked any of the games listed above, this game may be worth checking out.

The graphic and sound design in this game are awesome, and you can easily expect intense battles playout with half a dozen macros, that turn the tide of the battle.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys tactic strategies, such as Company of Heroes, RUSE, Total War series, Dawn of War series etc.			"

												Very fun, although I've only owned the game for a bit, I have a very good feel for the gameplay and a grasp on the whole of the single/multiplayer content. If you want a hard game, this game is for you. A lot of people talk about the cheating AI. It is likely that it does, but personally I enjoy the added difficulty. I have a feeling (from many of the negative reviews) that a lot of people don't know how to play this game properly. There is not too much to it, and the tutorial is there. It's called campaign missions 1 and 2. Play and you will learn. The landscape is beautiful, and the military units even more so.I do have one major gripe with this game. It requires you to get command stars through multiplayer battles in order to unlock all of the units. This seems like a pretty ridiculous requirement, since there are rarely any games going on anymore. You can also earn them by leveling up, but leveling up through playing single-player skirmish takes ages.I'd recommend this game to any RTS player looking for a challenge. You WILL be frustrated, just be prepared for that.			"

												Overall this is a good, fast paced RTS with great graphics and a realistic feeling to it. However it has major shortcomings when it comes to controlling units and visualizing commands that makes it too easy to have unnecessary mistakes that cannot be corrected due to the pace of the game. That in itself is an interesting feature of the game that separates the experts from the average player. However in order to truly enjoy the game play you need to sink a lot of time into it for the aforementioned reason.Single playerGood campaign and interesting progression with some replay ability.An unholy amount of micro if you are not careful.Multiplayer [if there is anyone who has not moved on yet]Great community.Unfortunate progression requirement but not game breaking to have certain units.Wait for a sale			"

												A great must-have RTS game for anyone looking to start RTS gaming or for experienced RTS gamers. The units are very well balanced and the system works perfectly. However, the AI gets annoying with its cinstant spamming when playing skirmish vs AI			"

												Just got this a few weeks ago, and it's a good game. I can see why it spawned 2 sequels which I'll probably get at some point. That being said, the learning curve is insanely difficult (at least for me) and the single-player campaigns feel designed to screw you over at every possible turn. There are still some people playing multiplayer, and it's more fun than single-player, and fairer (strangely) than the AI.Definitely still worth getting, although the sequels are probably better at this point.

												Very fun, although I've only owned the game for a bit, I have a very good feel for the gameplay and a grasp on the whole of the single/multiplayer content. If you want a hard game, this game is for you. A lot of people talk about the cheating AI. It is likely that it does, but personally I enjoy the added difficulty. I have a feeling (from many of the negative reviews) that a lot of people don't know how to play this game properly. There is not too much to it, and the tutorial is there. It's called campaign missions 1 and 2. Play and you will learn. The landscape is beautiful, and the military units even more so.I do have one major gripe with this game. It requires you to get command stars through multiplayer battles in order to unlock all of the units. This seems like a pretty ridiculous requirement, since there are rarely any games going on anymore. You can also earn them by leveling up, but leveling up through playing single-player skirmish takes ages.I'd recommend this game to any RTS player looking for a challenge. You WILL be frustrated, just be prepared for that.			"

												I had heard some positive things about Wargame, so in the often dangerous to the bank account Steam sales I picked it up. Really not what I was expecting straight from the off, perhaps I should have read some more reviews!  But Wargame is not a game for me, it's to clinical in it's approach & from mission one it was just a snooze fest of relatively pretty but oh so boring units moving around the screen. It lacks the playability & fun of games like the aging Command & Conquer Generals or the brilliiant Company of Heroes, or the future fantasy alternative the Warhammer 40k franchise. Instead Wargame strips away the enjoyment & leaves you with a relatively real but soulless husk of a game to yawn your way through. If however you are in to playing detailed & pretty modern battlefield simulators then maybe this ticks the box for you, but for me it's a 5 out of 10 max and that's solely for the graphics.			"

												Wargame: European Escalation and its later game Wargame: Red Dragon are shining examples of what RTS games should be. Well designed and masterfully researched, these games are a must own for an RTS fan. If you want to recreate what the cold war played out would be like.... Wargame. If you want to learn about the capabilities of different military vehicals from both sides of the cold war....Wargame. On a gameplay front, the game has a short, but steep learning curve, and only minimal tutorials. The difficulty curve on the other hand is rather....monolithic. The single player campaign is challenging and fun, rewarding those that really invest time in the game. Mechanically, the game is very functional. I wish some of the AI were a tad sharper or more clear, but it all works very well. While later games add new mechanics and refinements to the Wargame system, European Escalation is still the most functional of the games and the best way to begin a Wargame experience (Aircraft in Red Dragon operate by some sort of gypsy targeting, difficult to use well). Don't be discouraged by the difficulty of the campaign, or the initially confusing combat; once you understand how to play this game it is one of the goodies!			"

The community seems to be realyl friendly, and the MP games are awesome!Tonnes of maps, and over 300 units this game has some bang for its buck!Drawback: You need to level to open up units and build a personalized army.. Level up through SP or winning games. I personally am getting sick of games where you need to level up. So when making a MP game, stipulate the levels and kick people outsode of that range!Frag on!

												oh well... what to say... what to say...I LOVED THIS GAME!!!!seriously, if you are an addicted or just an RTS fan, you'll love this game, I suggest you to buy this game first before buying the other 2 games of Wargame, (the airland battles and the red dragon), cuz the mechanics are complex, and you need to handle the land battles first before coordnating bombing missions while trapping the enemy troops inside a city for complete obliteration.The game is good in almost all the aspects... BUTthe AI just SUCKS, and that's why i like to play against the Commie AI, cuz it is the closest thing that i can get from reality.Check this out:i was playing against an Medium AI on the Siege mode, i was defending, and the AI Attacking.Fine.Set all my men into a city and started to gather positions ASAPAAs...ATs...those kind of things.OK! good so far uh?but then, when the match started i had to wait for about... 20 minutes to the AI to find where my troops where. and when they did find...i think the AI commander was like:""PUT ZEM CHOPPAHS ON ZE CITY!""and about 15-16 MI stormed the city.2 min later they where all dead...but, as i was fighting the commies, i think the game creators went back to the WWII tatics and created an AI with the ""FOR THE MOTHERLAND"" ""tatics""so then.30 tanks and a hell of a human wave, stormed the city from some hill i had left unprotected (my mistake...)and just started running and driving straight into the city.I though it was dumb. but i paniked when i saw that more than a half of my men had died from that♥♥♥♥♥♥..but the commies paid the price and the AI retreated to its initial positions and the rest of the match was a boring game of ""cat-and-rat"" when i was hunting the commies down...WELL!thats my review!But for real, DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF YOU ARE AN RTS FAN!really.I LOVED THIS GAME11/10			"

												Erm, what the ♥♥♥♥ do I do? What? What is tutorial? I have no idea what i'm doing.EDIT: Alright, I came back to this game after finally deciding to give the mission another shot.What I realized is that I, in fact, am a massive tard. I played it at first at like 1 in the morning so I didn't see the small rectangle that allows you to call in reinforcements. Regardless, I still find it a bit odd that not all of the tutorial messages are shown directly to the viewer (I mean the ones where you have to click a few times which reveals new chunks of info one by one before you're allowed to proceed). Any other tutorial messages are only shown on certain parts of the map or where a certain unit is, and they disappear fairly quickly making them easy to miss. There are some things I feel could be better explained, like how exaclty ranks work. There didnt really seem to be much of a difference (from what I saw) between ranks when I played. They're just kinda like ""waow, u kild 4 HOLE tenks!! u ged a gol starr"" :/ But it probably does have SOME use, I just haven't been able to determine it yet. All I really remember is the game saying that they're more effective in combat. Maybe something to do with reload speed or accuracy? Spotting? I don't know.Another thing is how -exactly- detection works. I had 3 british recon infantry units located in the   -exact same- forest when one unit was spotted by tanks and was promptly used to wipe the floor. Said tanks then moved into the -EXACT SAME FOREST- and my men couldn't spot them. Like what the ♥♥♥♥? Who TRAINED these guys?? Some blind/deaf/mute mother ♥♥♥♥er??anyways.The game is pretty easy to learn, hard to master. It's quite fun and realistic in the sense of weaponry distance limitations, visibility etc and the fact that I can damn well guarentee you that infantry will get ♥♥♥♥ing atomized by most full vehicle squads if they are not supported properly, as opposed to other strategy games where only anti-armor weaponry is effective against armor, and not say, a flesh and blood ♥♥♥♥ing soldier. In this game, if an explosian occurs 2 feets from a soldier, that guy is toast.Nay, BURNT toast. He's gone man. GONE.Which is a bit refreshing to see tbh. Though infantry do lack proper 3d models (On my settings they do. I have yet to get a good pc :[ ) Which was a tad disappointing, but ultimately meaningless as you should be spending most of your time zoomed out to keep track of your troops. Battle groups in singleplayer are also persistent throughout each mini-campaign (There's a bunch of little campaigns where you play as different factions in different operations which all touch into the over-arching conflict) so if you lose a unit in one battle, then you'll permanantly have 1 less unit of that type to call in in battles (within that operation) afterwards.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I feel lazy. I'm gonna end the review here. So yeah, if you like a good strategy game then this is a pretty solid choice, though I can't really give you my opinion on multiplayer, the singleplayer thus far is nice.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------have a good day.

												I really like the game. It sucks to start of because of how little weapons you get. My reason for saying this is because I have very little experience with wargame. If you are better at wargame then abut who can barely play the recruit difficulty on any black ops game then you are good.			"

												This can be changed/deleted later!This is a very cool game and I just started, but now after 10 hours playtime and at the 5th mission the game freezes after playing for 1min (in other missions too). I just redownloaded the game and it freezed again, so its unplayable, thumbs down....My i5 6600k, R9 390X and 16 GB of RAM shouldn't be the problem.			"

												The game realistic adaptation of modern weapons is the main reason I know and come to love about Wargame series.Although it is a little fustration when you have to get stars to unlock new vehicles. The campaign is good, from easiest to most difficult but very entertain, as well as the skirmish.Nice texture on the vehicles. The expression of the soldiers are.....kinda lifeless. but it's still great.Good job Focus! "

												I have had many hours of fun on this game, very tactical... you really need to think about waht you wanna do, I found a defense way of the game can be a good idea as long as you push at the same time, or the other way round, you need to think about both as you play this game.........

												The RTS is unique, the units are well developed and the game takes real strategy in unit/deck selection and deployment. But the truth is it gets boring and repetitive fairly quickly. Easily worth 10$ "

												I sort of love the game and would probably think it fantastic if I did multiplyer, but I don't. I stopped playing because I was really only intersted in the campaigns but they are ruined for me by horrible difficulty spikes. I even went to a cheats website to even things up a bit so I could win 1 seemingly impossible scenario, but they don't work on steam.  If you want to play the campaigns, you are better off buying elsewhere so  you can get cheats for when you are totally stuck and cannot progress.			"

												For the wargame franchise, this seems to be a good place to start.Compared to other RTS-games and other games considering modern warfare, I think this game depicts it very well. It's giving me the feeling of Steel Panthers Modern Warfare, but real time instead of turns. I started out trying this one, and went on to pick up Red Dragon afterwards, but soon realized I wasn't proficient enough for RD quite yet. This game though offers sort of a step-by-step introduction through the missions in the single player campaign, and that can be very useful, since all game concepts aren't really explained fully. The lack of introduction to all game concepts is a drawback, but can be handled in this game with the mentioned missions. So if you consider this franchise, but are unsure about it and haven't tried anything like this before, I'd say this game is a good start. If it's on sale it's a very good pick, but the current price (€10) is worth it as well in my opinion.			"

												I fully recommend buying this game.for what it is it's surprisingly cheap, NOTE:there is a steep learning curve for this game but if you have good tactics and a deck with good vehicles and troops you can get the hang of it fairly quickly...Also if you look at the other titles in the wargame series this one is a cheapie but iz still gud stuff!(considiring that airland batle and red dragon are over $20.00)And it runs on a soviet-era computer (or do I have a good laptop?)I gib game 10/10, gud cheap game.Also:TANKS!
