												Triple Town makes an excellent first impression. It’s a unique take on the match-3 genre that also gives it a colony/city building twist (only in flavour, though. It plays nothing like a city simulation). The graphics are super-ultra-kawaii-cutie-koochy-koochy-boo-boo. And while it has no music, Triple Town is also host to mega-adorable sound effects: bears make little grunts and citizens will come out of their buildings to talk gibberish with each other.On Mobiles, these great impressions don’t last. On those platforms, the game advertises itself as free-to-play, but is actually not. If you want to play more than a limited number of turns per day, you have to pay a one-time fee of about $4. Triple Town developers have also devised other means to suck your money, by selling in-game currency, or cosmetic improvements. For what is ultimately a simple match-3 game disguised as free-to-play entertainment, the bill can therefore quickly inflate. Especially as the game is designed to make you want to trade your real cash against the in-game currency. For you see, the in-game currency you earn at the end of a session, or from your meta-game buildings, is incredibly small when compared to the costs of the items from the in-game shop. It can literally take several hours before you can buy anything remotely useful.On PC, where the game will cost you money upfront ($10, outside of sales), you of course get unlimited turns from the start, and there is no built-in real money micro-transaction. That doesn't mean that you get everything the mobile version has to offer against your initial investment. Oooh no… Instead, many things are forever out of your reach: no cosmetic upgrade and no graphical themes for you! And you’d be wrong to think that the absence of real-money micro-transaction means a better balance between rewards and item costs.I know that all those optional extras (graphical themes, in-game shop…) can be ignored, no matter how distastefully they serve the developer’s business model. But the fact is that the core game quickly shows its limits too. There is just not enough variety to sustain lasting fun. Game after game, you’ll be doing the same things with the same elements. Getting better only means that a game lasts more turns, not that you reach a further stage. There are several levels to select at the start of the game, but the difference is limited to the size of the starting grid or the frequency of bear appearances. Depending on your tolerance for repetitiveness, Triple Town will start feeling tiresome after two to five hours.Conclusion: Triple Town is built on a promising twist of the match-3 formula, with limited but cute audio-visual assets. Its mechanisms are however too limited to provide lasting appeal. Add to that a misleading and greedy micro-transaction scheme on the mobile versions, or limitations to the PC version features, and you get a casual game that is very hard to recommend. There are many match-3 games on the market that are polished, provide variety and are honest about how they want your money, like “Bejeweled 3” and “4 Elements”, to name just a few. You should play those instead.			"

 Triple Town Damed if I do damed if I dont, this game is ever so addictive and fun and some of you will not agree I do understand this greatly. But sadly I could never get my last 3 achievements. Been a while since I played this game, and well it was the only game I had at the time to play for well over a month until I found another game that got my interest, then I got more and now I just drown in them.I really am reminded to get back and play this game some more, should I or should'nt I is the question, as I DO REMEMBER enjoying this game ever so much. While I can't discribe the game as such, I am more a visual person anyway so my explanations are not so great, but the store page does do a great job visually, so as I always say what you see, hear and read is what you get. Price wise well at 80% off why complain I got this game for 50% off with a coupon when those trading cards first got introduced and so I was a gluten for punishment and or MORE FUN. ;)Look this is a fun little game, never the  less give it a go, what do you have to loose a dime in a dozen. ;DForgot it has Trading cards and I already mentioned Achievements somewhere, or am I missing something ?I Understand if my review is lousy ok, but thank you for taking the time to look and read anyway. You all have a right to your opinions, thats why we need a thumb in the middle, to show people have looked and  given it some time and thought. We need the traffic light thumbs. Anyway thank you. This game to me was worth the time i spent on it, maybe I will go back 1 day, and try for the last 3 acheviements that I have missed :)			"

												First of all, i 've never thought i will have this many hours on that game but i need to say it is HIGHLY ADDICTIVE! Once you stepped into the world of this Game, you can't get out again. And i know you'll try to beat yourself over and over again and you won't stop even your hand is starting to hurt you go on playing. Maybe you'll be like ""awww look how cute"", till you get to the point where these little fluffy 'rude' Bears and especially those Ninjabears run you over and you just start silently raging but before you can end your rage, you managed to take them all and shove them into a church :pWhat i wanna say is, it looks hella cute and it is but don't underestimate this game, it can be damn hard... but it's still fun to play over and over again also you can spend all your Boredom on it 'yay' and you won't notice how fast 10 hours past while you played :D At least i know i won't stop playing this so fast. Personally, i think it's for sure worth the price. Well done Devs, good job. *continues playing*			"

												Triple Town is a devilishly addictive puzzle game, masquerading as a town builder. Players place objects like grass, bushes and trees in a 6x6 grid. When three of the same object touch, they merge into a single new ""leveled up"" structure, earning players more points and freeing up valuable real estate. Three trees become a house, three houses an estate, three estates a mansion, and so-on.The better a player plans, the longer their round will last. Play it right and you'll perfectly line up three mansions & wrack up big points. But one mistake can lead to churches, houses and other structures littered around the field, making it tough to progress.Triple Town is perfectly tuned – any time things are beginning to look too dire a wild card crystal or object-deleting robot comes up, allowing the round to continue.Triple Town's core matching gameplay is extremely addictive, but the package itself is brought down by its lack of depth and options.Triple Town would be better off if it were sold like a standard puzzle game and included a few more options. However, if you are a casual gamer, looking for something easy to play when idle, which doesn't require fast reflexes or a lot of thought, this is a game you should try.			"

												This game is pretty dang fun, with a classic easy-to-learn, hard-to-master match-three game mechanic. But instead of items disappearing when you get a match, they merge into a single new higher quality or bigger item, e.g. from bushes to trees, and thus you build up your town from a few scattered plants to castles and cathedrals. There's also a permanent capital city you can work on over many games, adding some replay value from the desire to upgrade that as much as possible. This is a great game to play while you're doing something else on your PC like watching a movie. To be clear, it's a good game, but I can't recommend it for ten dollars, when it's basically a casual mobile game. I got it in a bundle and paid very little for it. It's worth getting during a big sale, maybe for a buck or two. So I recommend it, just not at this price.			"

												What is with our predisposition for match 3? What purpose does it serve our primordial lizard brains to delight us when we put three of something together and watch it disappear? Whatever the reason may be, the game industry has seized upon this weakness with terrible force, compelling us to crush candies and swap orbs and do all sorts of ridiculous things to rack up points. Triple Town would be no different, save for one additional level of complexity that adds a unique hint of progression to the formula.Rounds in Triple Town take place on small islands, gridded off for you to set your plants and buildings on. You're given something to place, anything from a tuft of grass to a sturdy oak to an entire house, which you can put on any open square. If three of the same thing end up adjacent to each other, such as three bushes, they combine on the spot of the last one placed into the next level of thing, such as a tree. In this way you can work your way up from grass to bush to tree to house to mansion to castle and on. Most of the time you'll be placing grass but you occassionally get higher-level objects straightaway, which you can use to your advantage or store in your single storage spot for later.There are other factors at play, such as bears you must place that move about and block your construction, or crystals that act as wildcards, combining with any two other things to complete the set. Your goal is to amass points and reach certain milestones like Settlement and City, and the simple challenge of trying to finagle everything into place is honestly enough to keep you going. You'll slowly start puzzling out how to plan your grasses ahead to get the bushes in the right places to get trees where you want, and then realize you need to plan even further for the houses that the trees become. There's a remarkable amount of planning and strategizing involved, as well as the challenges of unexpected bear or crystal appearances.All this would make for a fine coffee-break puzzle game, at least for awhile, but there's thankfully more to it than that. As you play, you obtain special items like farms and ores that cannot be used in normal maps. In between rounds, you travel to your capital city where you can place these to grant you additional resources periodically. These resources come in the form of items that can be used during rounds to place certain clutch objects when you need them most. The capital follows the same match-3 rules as well, meaning placing your special items intelligently can yield much greater returns. Triple Town basically gives you a hub city to develop which provides resources that makes the individual puzzles easier, allowing you to earn more items to develop your hub. It's a brilliant little gameplay loop that can keep you hooked for want of one more upgrade to your city.It's almost a perfect package, but I must admit the presentation drags it down a little. The actual feel of Triple Town is like that of a Flash game, trapped in a static windowed mode with simple vector graphics and animation. There's almost no polish to the menus or buttons, either, which makes them feel more like developer placeholders than finished products. The sound is adequate for what it is but does nothing to alleviate the otherwise cheap feel of the game. Coming off of titles like Mini Metro that manage to be simple AND stylish, Triple Town can feel a bit disappointing. Still, the core mechanics are plenty solid and the progression systems are very addictive, so if you can look past the presentation you'll have a lovely little timesink to enjoy here.			"

												I've waited to buy this game for quite some time after i have seen it on some video. I like ""connecting three items in a row"" games (7 wonders, puzzle quest, etc.). And in this one you connect 3 and create something new. Cool. It is. And it is very addicting, nice cartoony looking game, with funny, anime-ish bears roaming wild :) But, it has no end game. So, after completing a few of sane achievements (some are just way out of average player league) you have nothing to do and you have no campaign or challenges to complete. You can just play the same game over and over again. Though it is addictive and you start to feel an itch to play one more time (maybe this time i will be able to reach some advanced buildings or even castles.. no, same sh*t, cornered by ninja bears, no items you need, etc.). But after playing for 15-20 minutes you just start to feel you are wasting your time. It is just another time killing junky from the mobile world. Nice looking. But it doesn't give you some sort of achievement or completion feeling, which i usually want from a game.			"

												Blatantly an iOS game with little done to remodel the UI, but despite feeling like I should be playing this on a phone the game is surprisingly addictive. Gameplay consists of dropping down items on a playing field to build up match-3 combos and get bigger and bigger chunks of points. Good combos can be rewarded with items to use in the overworld, where you again match things to get combos and build more and more...for no reason other than to do it, really. Like I said, blatantly an iOS game designed to addict you into doing things and dropping money to make doing that easier, though the PC port features no microtransactions.The game also features a few presets of modifiers like field size, lakes, and the presence of types of bears (which try to block you from placing blocks but can be trapped and combined to make large amounts of points) to mix things up, though I feel it would be much more fun to have control over each individual modifier as well and build your own custom game types. Overall I enjoyed it, though I think it'd be a stretch to call it a good game. Pick it up for 75% off sometime and you can probably get your money's worth out of it.			"

Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're well done. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. The visual and audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu.Gameplay""Triple Town"" is your typical match 3 game by Spry Fox. Instead of match like tokens to clear the board. The individual is tasked to match building structure and plant foliage to build a town from scratch. Most of the matches that are made is rewarded with  two or five coins. In most cases there are treasure chests with random resources.The coins that are earned from the gameplay are used to make purchases in the main island area. The items are very expensive it will require the individual to save up enough coins to purchase that particular item. Since there is no option of selling off extra resources. Saving up coins can turn into a mundane task to complete.The main island, building structures only available to make, they give out certain amount of resources for earning certain amount of points during gameplay. And their max upgrade is tier ten.MiscellaneousThere are total of twelve different trading cards. You only get the six of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, the game it's enjoyable to certain extent, even though it comes with a mundane task to complete. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price. "

												I wish there was a way of saying this game is ""surprisingly addicting"" without sounding like some pretentious game snob, but there isn't.This game is surprisingly addicting.Triple Town will turn you into an obsessive compulsive mess, and task you with making your little settlements as neat and clean as you can, the novelty leads flawlessly into obsession and before you know it, you've marathonned a whole two seasons of your favourite show in your second monitor and it's 4:30 am and you hate yourself just a little bit more and yet YOU DON'T STOP PLAYING CHRIST WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?It roots itself firmly in the casual phone game mindset, but since it isn't trying to sell me something I can play it without feeling like I'm contributing to the problem.666/10 would have soul stolen again.

												I have a few hours into this  game, so I guess I should review it. I don't really think of it as a ""match 3"" game, because even though you do match 3 things to create a better a thing that takes up less space so that you can create more bigger things, there is more strategy than luck involved, since you choose where to place each thing. It's simple to understand and get into, and I find it pretty soothing. I enjoy it, and at the same time, it's something I can sort of mindlessly play while I'm on the phone, or while I'm getting ready to go to sleep, etc. I'm not especially good at it, mind you, but I do enjoy it a lot. It's currently my go-to game when I'm not sure what I really want to do, and I wind up sticking with it longer than planned every time, but it's also fine for when I'm only going to have a very few minutes to play, because I can exit the game super quickly and it's saved automatically.

												Although this game kinda feels like it was designed to be a pay-to-win Facebook game, the puzzle mechanics are brilliant. It takes a bit too long to progress but if you get into it you start to devise great little strategies to build the biggest city you can. If the meta-game was better and there were more levels I would recommend this game to everyone, but the content does fall a bit short. So be advised. All this game really has to offer is a solid core mechanic.So, if you are the type of person who likes to play Tetris constantly trying to beat your own high score (like me) then this game is for you. Otherwise, maybe not.			"

												Addictive puzzler with neat graphics. Triple Town is a match-three game paired with simplistic city building elements which requires more strategic thinking than games in this genre usually do as the ""luck-component"" slips in more with wandering bears and jumping ninja-bears. You can play four different modes (here: islands) besides building and improving your capital on your main island which farms some bonus objects for the next levels. My personal opinion: Best game in the genre so far (could need some more different sizes of levels) - 9/10			"

												There's a tl;dr at the end for those who just want a quick synopsis.Games like this make me wish Steam had a number system for reviews, like 1-10, instead of just positive or negative.  Because I do like this game but it does have some limitations which make it difficult to make a positive review.  Especially since this was originally a mobile phone game with microtransactions.  No, don't stop reading!  It's not as bad as the typical phone game ported to Steam.From the screenshots you might think this is a typical match 3 casual game.  And it is, but not like Bejeweled or other games like that.  Triple Town is all about the strategy of placement.   The main playing field (there are several variations, not just one field) is a big grid with some items already placed.  Each turn you get an item like grass or bush and you have to place it somewhere on the grid.  When you place a grass next to two other grasses they instantly combine to form a bush.  Get three bushes together and they form a tree.  Three trees form a small red house.  Three red houses form a bigger house.  3 of those form a mansion.  3 mansions form a castle.  3 castles form a sky castle.  So you can see how you can quickly run out of room.  The items you get are not totally random, there must be a variable to give a greater chance for grass and bushes since you get those the most.  You do get random items to help, like the blue crystal which acts like a wild card to instantly make a match of any 2 items you already have on the grid.  And you can buy items with the gold coins you get (this is where the microtransactions were in the mobile version).  Like buy a bush or tree for a few coins.  But I like to save my coins for the other part of the game: your town.When you run out of room on the game field you go back to your town.  It's actually an island.  You build items here that use the same match 3 thing as the field but for buildings.  Like, 3 fields make a big field, 3 of those make a bale of wheat (or whatever it is), 3 of those make a store house, 3 of those make something else (I've forgotten).  There's farming, gold mining, and defense (cannons, towers, etc), Though you don't get attacked, it's just for show.  This is where I choose to use the coins I earn in the matching fields.  You can buy extra squares of land to add on to your island, extra matching items like fields or fences.  Or even a crane to move an item to a different location.  And once you're rolling in the dough (have lots of coins to spare) you can even buy decorations like letters, statues, and stuff like that to personalize your town.  I'm sure by now you can imagine the microtransactions and how much money could be spent (wasted!) on stuff in this game.  Which brings me to my point in the beginning, why I hesitate to write a positive review.  Normally I am against microtransactions.  But I love the cute graphics in this game and the strategy involved.  The bears are especially cute and the way the villagers go ""eek"" and run when the bears growl.tldr:Ported mobile game that had microtransactionsCute graphicsDeep strategy in placing itemsBuild your town, lots of personalization availableBut it takes forever to get enough coins Get it on sale			"

												Cutesy art, simple mechanics, and its origins as a mobile title will lull people into thinking this is an easy game.  And while it may be easy to play, it is incredibly hard to net high scores in the game.You have a basic grid on which a randomized series of items are situated, the items you place are randomized.  You must link together at least three items of a kind in a vertical or horizontal chain, these chains can zig-zag and connect together a great many items, merging them into the next item up in quality of the same item base.  The three base unit types you have are Rocks, Bears, and Plants.  These three base units cannot be merged together, this leads to a conflict in placing each item as you must try to set up future placements without any foreknowledge of items to come,The puzzle element itself is enjoyable and challenging, it will function as an enjoyable time sink if you let it.  There is also an external element of resource collection and island build up.  This is all to obtain game altering items which can allow you to place whatever you need whenever you need it in a pinch - generally not worth doing until you have a great many of them and are going to attempt a long game.It is fun, but it is frustrating how you can often end up with a string of items you don't want which will end up killing you.

												Well, I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  To be honest I  purchased it over the Christmas period  (I think it may have been in  one of the Flash Sales)  without even  bothering to  read the   description;  relying instead  on  its looks.  I scanned the  piccies and thought it looked interesting in a cute sort of way.   I don't play that many match three games nowaday's; perhaps  the odd level of Puzzle Quest for the RPG elements and  maybe one of the Atlantis  games (e.g. Call of Atlantis), Bejewelled, Zuma or 4 Elements for more basic game play.  I really didn't expect another   original take on  a casual Match 3,  with city building  elements and   strategy included,.  This  game  turned out to be a  nice little brain teaser  as well and   kept my attention  far longer than most  casual arcade games do these days.   I usually play these games as fillers in between  the big boys or if I need a break  from shooting zombies or digital  OpFor but I can see myself spending hours playing this game.   I highly recommend Triple Town,  especially if you like casual   games with  a pitch of originality  sprinkled in.  :)			"

												The game on PC is not being update, and will never be updated again, according to developers.The Android/ios platforms do get updates occasionally (as far as i heard) however those updates are not reaching nor will reach the pc version.This game itself feels like ""something is missing"" it always feels a bit empty, and lacks more resolution options for the window (wich on my case is very uncomfortable and small)But the game is still cute, i like it, is a nice passtime.If only we could get updates at par with the Android version, it would be more known steamwide and better, even more fun to play, however that will not be happening anytime soon, it's truly sad to hear and know that, but i still like this cute game.Please give the PC users and players, the chance of getting new content sometime "

												♥ Extremely addicting.I've used this game to pass the time for just a ""few"" minutes yet it always turns into at least a half hour or more of playtime. It's easy to get sucked into wanting to get the highest score...build the biggest castle...snag all the achievements.♥ Very cute.This is one game that I don't have to worry about my parents or my pets seeing me play. If you want a family friendly game, this one absolutely fits. Even as annoying as the ninja bears are, they're still adorable. I appreciate pretty graphics! ♥ Wonderful way to relax.For me this game, though it can be challenging, always helps to relax me. You can play the map for just a few moments or a few hours, it's up to you how seriously you want to play the game. That is a virtue I love since I don't want to invest myself in a game all the time yet I can challenge myself if I want to. ✘ It can be frustrating.This game relies heavily on random items that you get and have to put on the map/level. If you get a bad combo, it can potentially end the round. You can buy items in the store however they can be expensive (with in-game coins, not real currency) and there's a limit to how many of each item you can buy per round. ✘  There isn't diversity in level design.The game is still cute however the maps are all pretty much the same. Though some have lakes while others have none, they can all look alike, and thus appear fairly bland. ✘ I do wish there were maps of different sizes.All the maps/levels are the same size, though some have less space with lakes and rivers in the way. If this game were ever updated or a sequel made, I would appreciate if there were more diversity in the size of the towns. It would be fun to have some huge, some small, etc. Overall this is a wonderful game and all flaws aside, I think it would make a lovely game for any gamer.			"

												The basic principle of Triple Town is nice, you have a limited area and have to put three objects of the same kind next to each other to create a single upgraded version of those objects, that can again be upgraded by putting two more objects of the same type next to it - and so on. This can become quite tricky the more items you have on a map since once you run out of space to place objects the level is over. When you upgrade an object you get points for it, naturally the more advanced an upgrade is, the more points you get. You can use those points to upgrade your town, which is the hub from where you access the randomly generated levels. The town's buildings generate items that will help you during the regular levels. The bigger and better your town becomes, the more and better items you will get.The problem with the game is that there is no goal. No special challenges, nothing to achieve other than endlessly upgrading your town. It's the same thing over and over, and that felt rather pointless to me. You could try to get the best possible upgrade of an object (there is even a Steam achievement for it), but for that you need a lot of special items, and you can only obtain those by upgrading your town and collecting more money. That means you need to grind for dozens, if not hundreds of hours and all you get for it is a Steam achievement.Imo this would be a decent time killer for mobile platforms, but there are simply far better puzzle games on PC to waste your time with Triple Town.

												For a casual time waster game, this one is suprisingly addicting. I can easily play this game and watch videos or movies at the same time compared to other games that require a lot more attention. Building the main town can take a long time but I would still recommend it, especially for the ferocioulsy cute bears.			"

												It's the easiest of puzzle games, really, with an excellent learning curve. The formula behind it is genius, the gameplay is addicting and the bears are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Triple Town is brilliant is in simplicity.I've been playing Triple Town for years now, starting on iOS. This game has sucked up chunks of my life (especially weekends, now that they offer world wide tournaments on mobile) and I regret none of it. I will say that my favorite game mode (in which you have 2 minutes to build as big of a city as possible) is missing from the PC version yet available in mobile, which seems rather odd. If you're coming to this game without previous experience on your iOS device than you won't miss it but man, what's up with that developers? 9/10. Give us our missing game mode and you'll deservingly get your 10/10, guys.			"

												This is a nice game, sadly it's also dosn't do anything when you level up your town building. No new modes seem to unlock when you upgrade tears, and all you are doing is endlessly trying to get better and better scores, on the same 5 modes. Each mode is differnt enough, but the lack of a multiplyer or an ablity of some kind (besides one time use ietms) leave this game feeling like it's a time grinder. The end game is the real question, as in ""Will anything happen"" and the time required to find out is NOT worth the investment. (not that I've found what's at ""the end"") The reward of expanding the town and building higher level teirs dosn't seem to reward other then basic building blocks to get to higher teirs. The limit in the stores on buying items is annoying, and you'll play for a few days just to afford the crystals and wait for them to re stock.The graphics and sound fit the game well, and there is nothing wrong with the game, I just don't think the end game is worth it.

												Buy? Maybe. At first, I was satisfied that a traditionally free to play, pay to win style Facebook game was for sale as a standalone, so you wouldn't be limited but stupid time or energy constraint mechanics. I also originally enjoyed the game for a few hours, with it's charming art style, and it's simple, but strategically challenging gameplay - it's immensely smarter than ""click here to harvest resources and place objects"". You of course, place objects and harvest resources in your main kingdom, but mostly for the sake of progression and isn't the meat of the gameplay . My problem with the game is that the dev didn't qute address the fact that this game was purchased - now your only source of coin income is constantly replaying towns, which make it an EXTREME grind to improve, grow, and customize your kingdom. It also feels that tthe game is stingy with giving you higher level placables (trees, huts, churches) and gives you a ton of grass and the occasional bush that more often than not, comes at a bad time. This game could really use a placable that lets you move objects and/or make the undo button less expensive and have more or unlimited uses...after all, the whole point of limited uses was to force players to pay for coins, but I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME!!! I do have a respect and fondness for TripleTown, but the stingy randomness of placables and no compensation for the fact that players paid for the game versus paying peacemeal (HOW ABOUT A HUGE COIN REWARD OR SOMETHING?!) made me uninstall this.

												Triple Town is an excellent match-3+ game with a small twist. Combine three bushes and they'll turn into a tree. Create and match three trees and it'll become a house and so on and so forth. It's all about the points and the coins. It's quite addictive, trust me.The coins can be used to upgrade your hub, a place where you can pick a gameplay mode (sort of) before playing/ Or it can be used to buy items, like extra houses or bushes. Unfortunately, items are limited so you have to choose wisely. The items are also quite expensive, so buying an item isn't always a good choice.The hub is all about creating farms, mines and other buildings. See it as some sort of mini-game. Except you can't really mess things up here. You'll be able to collect rewards from your buildings every couple of hours. Rewards that'll help you when playing the 'real' game. The developers haven't thought things through with the time limit though, because earning coins is kind of slow and tedious and waiting for several hours before being able to collect a reward could make people lose interest (more quickly than intended).But I heard it might be changed in the near future, so let's just hope for the best.Anyway, Triple Town is easily one of the my favorite casual games.[Rating: 79/100]			"

												""Triple Town"" is a unique Match 3 game where you build as big a colony town as possible by matching three or more objects. These objects can evolve into others by making appropriate matches (e.g. three Grasses make a Bush, three Bushes make a Tree...three Trees make a Hut...and there's more after that! ;-D). Matching more than three items, or mathcing certain high-end items will gift you different goodies that improve your score or other parts of the game! What you're given to place each time is random, but you can place these objects in any free space you want (with the objects melding where you place the last item in the cluster), so there's more strategy involved than the average Match 3.Besides building materials, there are helpful items, like the Crystal, which is a wild card that completes matches (often important for much easier matching of high-end items!), but placing them without a Match makes a Boulder. Match three Boulders with the Crystals, however, and you'll get a Mountain that contains a Treasure Chest that contains a random prize. To get the Chest you need the Imperial Robot, which also lets you get rid of an unwanted item (most items penalize your score when destroyed, though...keep that in mind).But watch out, there are Bears and Ninja Bears who'll try to impede your building! If you can trap a Bear or use an Imperial Robot on him, he turns into a Tombstone, and if you can trap three or more bears, the resulting Tombstones turn into a Church, and three of those make a Cathedral, and three of those make a Treasure Chest. Ninja Bears jump around and mostly can only be stopped by the Imperial Robot.There are more items such as Fortune Cookies (which tell you the next five items that you'll be given to use), and Crates (which let you temporarily stash an item on the map), but these are gotten through the Shop and the Captiol City (more on those later!).If you can't place something in a good spot right away, there's a little space set aside on each level where you can save an item, hopefully for a better use later in your game.When you do run out of space (hopefully later rather than sooner!), your score is finalized, and you win some Coins and Capitol City materials (more on those in a bit!). If you need to stop playing a level, you can pick up where you left off later. There is no limit to how many times you can play a level; if you start a new level after finishing one, a new one is rolled for you!There are six different kinds of levels: ""Standard colony"" (self-explainitory), ""City on a lake"" (actually, it's a ""Standard colony"" with a small lake in the center), ""Peaceful Valley"" (island with no Bears!), ""A dangerous forest"" (island with lots of Bears!), ""City on an island"" (small island). You can also revisit the Tutorials that you play the first time you launch the game, if you wish. You visit these from the Capitol City hub, which you build and improve mainly by making matches, too! You'll mainly get the materials from playing the game. The highest level buildings in your town will gift you materials and items everytime you earn so many points at a time in levels!There is also a shop system that lets you buy building objects and helpful items with coins that you win in-game, mainly by completing levels. There are two different shops; one for the colonies, and one for the Capitol City. The colony shop lets you buy materials and items, but they're limited in supply, and replenish after so many turns. But if you've got the money, they can help you keep building for longer! The Capitol Shop lets you buy materials, Decorations, Expansion Tiles, and a Crane that lets you pick up and move an item to a better spot. These will cost you, though, so build some colonies!There are personal High Score lists for each level, and 10 Achievements to earn. Recently, support for Steam's new Trading Card program has been added, too.Overall, this is a great and different Match 3 game! Definitely check it out! :-D			"

												Triple Town is a game I've gotten a lot of value and fun out of, so the short answer is: yes, I would recommend this game.There is something oddly addictive and yet very relaxing about playing this game. It is simple match three turn-based game, but the last item you place becomes the next tier up. So three bushes = 1 tree, 3 trees = 1 house, so on and so forth. It becomes a game about managing the precious space you have, and there is something very satisfactory and rewarding about putting in that one last piece and watching your board transform into a new thing you haven't seen before.Except the elusive Triple Castle. Curse you! I always lose before I get to that stage.So, there are several maps to the game. There’s the main town, were the buildings you place give you resources for the other maps - little extra things you can place down to match three when you're in a tight spot. Then there are a few maps with different flavours - one where there are lots of aggressive bears who walk around and get in the way of your plans, smaller maps with no bears where you can test your building skills. It's nice to be able to switch between them when you get stuck, and also nice to pop into your town and see what's up there.You also gain currency when you 'complete' a map which can go towards buying things to help you in future runs, so that's pretty cool.All in all a deceptively cute casual game that can be a little hard at times. If you're looking to play something relaxing when you have a little down time, this is perhaps my favourite puzzle game to recommend. It's very much like Combine or 2048 but more in-depth, lovable, and appealing to the eye.			"

												The core gameplay is a fine twist on match-3 games but the metagame surrounding it absolutely ruins it with an economy that betrays the game's free-to-play roots by requiring you to grind out dozens of games to earn enough gold to purchase one-time use items. You'll get tired of the game long before you get anywhere close to earning enough gold to reach the higher levels.			"

												Playing somewhat like a Match-3 game in reverse, TripleTown has a lot more depth and strategy than many would expect from a casual game. Wrapped in a super cute art style, it is one of the most clever and surprising games I've played in a long time.Easy to learn, hard to master is the best way to describe the gameplay. Instead of the traditional removal of gems, stones, or Chuzzles, TripleTown has you placing various tiles in order to advance up the food chain so to speak. Though this sounds simple on paper, once the board starts filling it becomes an incredible challenge to keep the game going, and really makes you have to think with every move you make.It only took one round for the uncomplicated, but all the same engadging mechanics to have me completely addicted to building my towns, beating my hi-score, and getting rid of those horrid Ninja Bears! Don't let the casual label turn you off, TripleTown is much more than at first meets the eye, and any puzzle fan should absolutely check it out.			"

												This is a rather quaint game in my opinion. It feels like it should be either a phone or facebook game, due to its simple game style and addictiveness.  As for details of the Gameplay, I feel I would be regurgitating what others have already said. However, it is a nice game and I would reccommend this to anyone looking to kill some time.			"

												Well this game was addicting. For those who think of it as a casual and simple match 3 game, think again. This game requires planning and strategy in order to make the most of the space and to build  complex structures. It's fun and simple and quite easy to waste hours playing it without realizing ( erm, like someone who played 33 hours of it...).  Some levels can be difficult, as they are randomly generated and you do not know what type of material you get (LIKE NINJA BEARS). If you like puzzles and want to kill some time with something simple, give this game a shot. Just don't blame me if you get  addicted to it.			"

												Triple Town is one of the best puzzle games on iOS, and the Steam version brings a few differences. The time attack mode is replaced with a capital city where you can build farms, mines, and military structures for bonuses and cash. You also have a persistent inventory now, instead of using tiles as soon as you buy them. Overall, it feels like a slightly more PC-oriented game. My verdict: buy it, but wait for a sale. $10 is a bit too much for an (admittedly robust) match-three game.			"

												This game is a fun little puzzle game to pass the time with. I highly recommend it for its quirky artwork and puzzles. Pros:- The game auto-saves your progress so it is easy to start and quit as convenient. - Can decorate the player's Bear Island with in game items, thus encouraging the player to continue playing to earn the in game coins to furnish the island. - Multiple islands with different puzzle rules to play on- Addicting game playCons:- This is a light weight puzzle game, and it can get tedious after long periods of play time.I highly recommend this game for 5 dollars or less. :)			"

												Triple Town is a port of a Facebook/Mobile game. It's a match 3 game where you have the goal of building a small settlement in a new land. Other than that there's not much more story to speak of. You can play for a few minutes or an hour, however long you like. Being a port of a Facebook/Mobile game, my first fear was that it would retain certain freemium or free 2 play features like grinding or paying for in-game currency. This fear really doesn't hold and I found myself really enjoying this small joyful timewaister.It's a match three game. So say you start off by matching three Grass pieces together, which forms a bush. If you then get three bushes together it forms into a tree, three trees into a house, three houses into a town hall and so on. If you combine more than three you gain bonus points and a chance or higher chance for a structure for your hub world. Placement takes place on a grid system, the main antagonists being rocks, water and bears. Rocks can be removed by an item you can be given a turn like you can be given a grass or a bush or a tree. Water is there to stay and bears will hop to open spaces adjacent to them each turn and turn into tombstones when there are no open spaces for them to migrate to. Three tombstones turns into a church, three churches to a chapel, I think you get the idea!Making matches and completing levels/settlements earns you coins. Coins can be used to buy items to be used in levels or in your hub world. The hub world follows the same rules as the levels. You gain resources that you place, match three and they become a better version of that resource. You use the hub world to embark on different level types like levels without bears or without water. The hubworld also allows you to personalize it a little. It's clear on the facebook and mobile versions this is where it would cost you actual money, but here it is just based on your actual progress, not income. And it is not necessary or made in a way where you are forced to grind.Triple Town is not completely devoid of strategy, letting you save at least one ""piece"" for later use, allowing special items that remove rocks or other structures on the level. But This never gets stressful with its adorable art style. It can be as casual or as in depth as you want, with the only limiter being the luck of the draw each turn and how far you plan ahead.If you want an adorable, uplifting time-relief, you can't find a much better game than this. I've normally played this before heading out somewhere, played this on my laptop, played while I was downloading something or while watching TV. "

												The word for this game would be 'underwhelming'. The idea of the 'match3 kawai settlers' sounds cool. And the design is decent, and the very first impression is rather good, but.... there's nothing going on. Like literally. No sense of progression whatsoever, no story, no new levels, zones and themes\settings to aim for. The mobile version had themes, by the way. But here it's just the same old tiles to combine on the same few tiny zones in order to grind coins. And then grind for more coins. Oh, and have I mentioned grind for coins? The only reward for that grinding are the extra tiles for the 'permanent city', grind for 3 woods - get a tile of fence, or go for 'aesthetics' and put yourself a giant(=tile-sized) bear statue or a 'F'-shaped bush.Don't get me wrong, I was not expecting  miracles from a match3 mobile port. I don't have anything against raw and pure timekillers. Hell, my playtime for Bejeweled or Zuma are actually significantly higher than I would care to admit.  But this game? It just...pretended to be something more, that's it. It was never meant to be a stand-alone PC game.			"

												The bears are come to remind us that all is chaos. All will be left to the bears, and to the shrubs, as empires fall, each in its time.It is a somnambulant and disquieting reality, this Triple Town. Unknowable Lovecraftian horrors await at every turn. Quake at your smallness! Madness slathers with hunger and claws at your door. Yes, in the gaping maw of madness lies your perdition.Your perdition is Triple Town.This seems impossible, you say. Impossible! But all things are possible through Triple Town. All that becomes impossible beneath the great and terrible gaze of Triple Town, all that shall not linger—cannot linger!—in this dismal, eternal city......is you.You say that you have come to conquer and dismantle Triple Town. I tell you that your heroism is the buzzing of a gnat amid a tempest. I tell you that your endeavor is doomed before it has begun. I tell you, for I pity you, that your eternity is but the blink of an eye to Triple Town. Therefore tremble, and depart.Depart, while there still is life in you, though your retreat, like your bravery, means nothing. Triple Town will find you, wherever you may run. And should you live a thousand thousand lifetimes, your happiness will turn to ash as you hear the bears approaching, their growls crisp and icy and immutable.And then, darkness.8/10			"

												If you have played this game then 16 hours of playtime may alarm you. And you should be alarmed. Through the sheer agonizing elegance of simplicity this game will lure you out of Bejeweled's bed and into something more...algorithmic. There is a nice reward system - you have a little home town you develop as you earn points in the levels, and the home town structures reward you with items to help you out back in the levels - and the more you play, the more you realize you need to plan each game in advance, as same-typed items can only collapse together in certain configurations... But above all, the game is extremely calm and soothing. Top recommend.I still haven't got the 10th achievement. I dare you to beat me there.			"

												Triple Town is very cute and great to play when you have only a few minutes to spare. This game is incredibly tiny thus in my opinion not worth the assigned price and therefore I cannot recommend it. It has 4 map layouts (with/without bears/lakes) and there are no ""levels"". The more you play the more money you earn so eventually you can buy single-time-use items to help yourself on these four layouts. You can strive to master this game but it will require a lot of time. If you look at the forums you can find the developers post announcing that there will be no future updates (unlike the mobile version of this game) because of their limited resources.			"

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   ""Just one more turn"" games   Ruthlessly murdering bears   Thinking multiple steps ahead   Mobile gaming I was first exposed to Triple Town as a mobile game on the iPhone where I must have racked up an ungodly amount of hours. It really is one of those one more turn games - easy to pick up from where you left off and leaves you with an overwhelming desire to beat your best score.It is a match 3 game at it's core, but with a very clever aspect to it. You match 3 building blocks to create a single block that is ""one up"". For example combine 3 grass tiles to make a bush and then combine 3 bushes to make a tree and so on. There is also the added difficulty of bears spawning on your grid which, put simply you need to kill. That's right, a cutesy game where you need to block in animals, which converts them to gravestones, which, staying with the theme of the game can be combined into a church.The only downside of this game is that it is probably more suited to a mobile platform as a bit of the ""pick up and play"" aspect is lost on PC. That's not to say that you won't sink hours into it, just simply that your gaming sessions will likely be a bit longer (which is no bad thing) and you won't be sat on the toilet as you match 3.Definitely a game I'd recommend but watch out for the ninja bears.

												It looks cutesy, but there are underlying political messages throughout the game. You start out in a barren kingdom with few people to govern. The whole time, you are invading savage lands which may house natives or their animal gods. Your job is to forcefully remove the natives and replace them with citizens of your own. Unfortunately, the lands are unable to support large populations, so a lottery system is put in place to force those who are unable to pay the rising rent, to swim to other lands and risk drowning. The fearsome wargods are hellbent on keeping you from developing the island that sends supplies back home. They can be dealt with by mechanized infantry or by crushing them. Doing so enables the spread of a proper religion, which provides growth and materials to be sent home.			"

												This game is very addictive! I played it on facebook until it became to creepy stalky to friends - like facebook games tend to do. I regretted having to give up this game until I saw it on Steam.This is a game for people who like match 3 games. It's slow paced, and you really have to think about your moves. Personally I'm not entirely sure it's worth the 10 euro's (or equivalent amount in your currency) but when it's on sale I'd definitely buy it if I were you.			"

												This is a little cute game consisting of puzzles in that you try building cities. You get a random amount of items as you play, and with these and ingame money you can build larger and larger.The gameplay is enough for small instances of gaming, not for larger chunks. Its okey fun at best, but beats many other games in its originality and cuteness.If your looking for a pleasant and easy game, this might be what you need. And on top of that its pretty cheap too.

												One of my more favorite phone-games. Although the PC version has more content, it feels underwhelming for Steam (and the price). This is a puzzle game with a fairly-addicting mechanic. Easy to learn, impossible to master. I don't know if I would pay full price for this, but certainly pick it up if you like slider-puzzle games. More importantly - check out the devs new game Road Not Taken - now this one appears to be worth it.			"

												A deceptively challenging puzzle game where you have to match three like items (hence the name) to create one better item, then match three of those, and so on, until you finally achieve your dream of building floating castles in the sky.  Several different maps allow you to choose what kind of challenge you want to play next.  It's a great way to kill time as you work on planning several moves ahead to build as much as possible.			"

												Triple Town is an incredibly simple, easy to pick up match 3 game. This game has consumed a pretty fair amount of my time. It isn't like a typical steam game though, because this game is best when played for short bursts. This is because the game was originally designed for mobile. Overall, this is a very fun game, but don't expect it to be something that you can sit down and play for more than a couple hours at a time.			"

												The 80 hours I have on record for this game is deceptive, because I'm lazy and have left it running on my computer constantly for 2-3 days this week, even when not playing. That said, I'd say that since buying it, I've probably sunk 10-15 hours into actually playing this game. I played for a good 5-10 hours after purchasing it two and a half years ago. Got caught up in a bunch of other games, and came back to it last week, determined to get the last 2 or 3 achievements, and put in at least another 5 hours.That might seem like a lot for what deceptively looks like such a simple game, but the crux of the matter is as follows: 1) I was determined to beat it. For neurotic achievement hunter me, that meant, another perfect game. 2) It takes a lot of planning, like playing a chess game and trying to think a dozen moves ahead. I sometimes found a scratch pad and pencil helpful for planning things out. 3) The effing bears! And lastly, 4) This game is more than a little bit addictive. You tell yourself, nope, just going to finish this building and I'm done for the night. And some bear gets in the way of a building you've been working on for the past 5 minutes, and somehow, you've got a new game going because you know you can beat it this time.I don't know that it's something that I would have shelled out $10 for. But I'm stingy like that. Having paid 3.99 for it, I find I'm okay with the price to time played/enjoyment ratio. The last couple of achievments are hard, but there's a pretty great guide in the community hub for it. In the end, I probably won't play this game again, or at least not any time soon, but I don't by any means regret the purchase.			"

												My Steam play time may be short but I assure you that I sunk a hefty amount of time into this when it first came out on Facebook. I got a Steam Key because I bought $20 worth of gold coins. Yes, I'm well aware that this is more than the purchase price here. I don't begrudge giving money to smart and deserving developers. This really is a fantastic and innovative game at heart. As much as I love this game, it's got some very irritating flaws. It's fun as it is frustrating. The biggest irritation by far is the fact that you need to grind for gold to get good scores. I've finally accumilated 10K gold, the minimum needed to try for a top score. This is really insane. Just let the store reset every time you play. Spryfox, if you'll ditch the gold grind, I'll re-do this review from a NO to a YES.			"

												As casual games go, this is one of the best. A bit like a turn-based version of Tetris, hence strategic and not dependent at all on reflexes. I played it previously on Android, but was put off by the in-game purchase mechanism. The version on Steam seems free of that annoyance, and includes a number of enhancements I hadn't seen last time I played on my tablet. The game is simple but with almost painfully deep strategy. With no time pressure, you can rack your brains as long as you like. A worthwhile purchase at full price, for casual gamers, and a no-brainer for anyone when it goes on sale.			"

												Some of us aren't hard core gamers; we don't have a ton of time for gaming or the energy to keep track of some giant, overblown story arc.  I actually am one of those people, but even I can enjoy the simple genious of a game like Triple Town.  There are few challenges other than those you place on yourself, you can stop whenever you like (though often you won't want to) and pick up where you left off, and your personal kingdom will grow and evolve as you play along.  If games are a passtime and not a passion for you, you will find many hours of bliss in this charming little game.			"

												I've played MANY better flash games in the same genre, which were FREE, and required no download.  This lacks depth and relies a little too much on incessantly nitpicking strategy.  Perhaps it'd be more fun if the timer were less aggressive.  As it is, the time limits imposed are a little too stiff, and you never really make it up into the higher tiers, unless you're just one of those savant-type people who is naturally good at these, no practice required.  The important factor here, is that you can get games of this type, for absolutely 100% free, on kong or armor games.  This does not have enough content beyond one of those types of games, to actually recommend PURCHASE of it, much less at a $10 price point.PS- Stop saying my review isn't helpful, just because you like the game.  It's not a ""do you agree with this person"" button.  It's a ""helpful"" button.  My point about this game should help many people not waste their money.  -_-			"

Unlike the Facebook version, there's no ridiculous micro-transactions here.  This looks like a rushed port, though.  I don't think it sold well.  They're trying to release it on every known platform in an effort to maximise profit.  I think it's coming out on the Dreamcast next.

												A fun little puzzle game that started on Facebook and came on here where the unlimited moves make the game a much more enjoyable, engrossing experience.Seven modes of fun from the dangerous forests to the calm clearing and even a lake or island, each providing different challenges to keep your mind active as you try to create your town. A great little game definatly worth a buy when in the sales. Good for picking up and putting down when you are in the mood for a little distraction. "

												I was Triple Town App player first. Then came the Facebook app, which brought the Capital City... Whoa! When this came to Steam, I bought before the words ""Triple Town"" could be said. I am sad that the Facebook app is no longer. I'm even more sad that the phone App version doesn't have a Capital City. ""...our management has since decided to take the mobile and non-mobile versions of the game in two different directions."" -- from Spry Fox response to my Google App review.But this is a review for the Steam game.... and I LOVE it. When I have to be on hold for a long time, it's a great boredom-buster. Just one more game!!!My only ""negative"" is the cost of extra tiles... It takes FOREVER to earn coins. Can the Steam version have the ""Pets DLC"" that the mobile app has? (The pets earn gold faster.)			"

												Neat little Puzzle/Board Game . There doesnt seem to be much of a goal aside from scoring as high as you can in a single run. I guess you can make a town but it doesnt apear the town does much but give you more materials to keep making your town bigger. There should be like a boss battle or something incorparated into it and you can only fight bosses when your town has a big enough castle from upgrading your town or something along those lines. That would make it a much better game. In its current state it is a nice time waster , but I wouldnt spend a lot on it.			"

												At its core, Triple Town is one of those games with one simple mechanic that keeps unfolding with ramifications. Each turn is built on every turn you've played up to that one. The Steam version loses all the free to play BS you get with the Facebook and mobile versions of the game and just lets the mechanics shine. They're actually great game mechanics!For such a simple game with so little that changes over time, it sure stays fun for a long time.			"

												I actually like the puzzle mechanic, and it's fairly satisfying to play and try to get better at it. I can understand why people like it and it got so popular. However, even though the PC version has no microtransactions (praise Gaben), the free-to-play roots still show through in the structure of the game, and it's worse for it. In a puzzle game based on skill, where your goal is to see how long you can survive/how far you can progress/how many points you can score in a single run, having an inventory of items you can (literally) farm that carry over between runs feels...dirty.Unless you want to play a self-enforced challenge of willfully ignoring that part of the game, the optimal strategy is not to have the most skill at the game (or at least not JUST to have the most skill), but to spend x number of hours grinding to fill your inventory, THEN to wait until you're having a good run and burn through all your items to keep it going as long as possible. Want to try again? Waste another day. Why does this make the game better? It doesn't, because they're not making any money off you in this version. It's the taint of something that was originally designed to be a money siphon and not to play off its strengths, which it does have plenty of in terms of good design.It's like if someone came up with Tetris today, and you could win spare pieces after each game you play if you do well, which you could stock up on. It would completely change the flow of the game from, ""Gee, I did pretty well. I bet I can do better next time!"" to, ""Dang it. I just blew through all my straight pieces. Now I have to spend four hours farming more of them if I'm ever going to get a score like that again."" And some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would let you buy more for 10 cents each or 12 for a dollar, just so you could always have one to swap into your ""next"" slot when you really needed it. I bet there's already a mobile or Facebook version like that out there somewhere. Now I'm sad.			"

												Triple Town is a very simple, match-3-based puzzle strategy game in which you (obviously) match three various resources to build a town, which will award you points as you continue to increase your city. I enjoyed this game very much, as it is easy to pick up, start playing, and hard to put down. It does not get boring after a few hours, which is another reason why I loved it. However, I do not believe that it is worth the full price of $10, and would instead to try to purchase this game while it is on sale, for a few bucks cheaper. The graphics in this game are well done, with a cute, cartoonish style. So overall, I would definitely give Triple Town an 8.5/10, for its casual, strategic and highly addictive nature.			"

												Aaah Triple Town!I was first introduced to this game on Android in 2012. I loved it so much I bought it for PC. The PC version has no micro-transactions, which makes it far more enjoyable for me.The goal is to create the best city possible by combining three of the same piece - three small houses make one bigger house, three bushes make a tree etc.When all the spaces in your city have been filled, this part of the game ends and you can go back to this same area later on to try and better your score.It's a fairly laid back game, although you do have some pretty angry bears trying to get in your way. There is one city area which is bear-free, meaning you can play without fear of being taken over by bears!It's a nice, basic match-three game, and great for wasting a few hours here and there.			"

												It's a fun strategy game, a different take on the Match 3 genre. You match up 3 patches a grass to make a bush(it appears where the last patch of grass was placed), 3 bushes make a tree, 3 trees make a house, 3 houses make a large house, etc. There are many other mechanics that  I don't want to spoil, and there's in-game store to buy items with in-game currency.There's also a home island, called your Capital, where you can place industries like farms and mines like you would in the normal game, but as you score points these industries give you items. A nice little meta game. I definitely recommend Triple Town.			"

												It's a great game to begin with but building up coins can be very frustrating. Compared to the free mobile version. You can buy coins if you're desperate for coins. But with this full version. Building up coins is very limiting. Especially if you bought this version. My advice for the developers is to implement each successful combination from 3x Grass to 3x Shrubs and the coins doubles up. If you combine 3 grass that upgrades to a shrub. You get 3 coins. If you get 3 shrubs and it combines it into a tree. The coins doubles. That's how the game is supposed to be for this full version. As the current coins income is very little and very long.In my opinion I don't feel that the developers had adjusted this full version features. Which needs to be balanced.			"

												I do like this game, but with a disclaimer: I can only recommend it if you're not a completionist.The pros: It's adorable beyond reason, it's light-hearted, amusing and easy to learn. It rewards you for getting better at it, with achievements and in-game rewards for scoring higher points. It makes you want to get good at it, because everything is easier: you get more points, more money, more assets and so forth. And sure, it's a Match 3 but you have an open grid to do whatever you want. Pretty neat. There are even little enemy bears (adorable mean fluffballs) to give you some amount of challenge.The cons: It's likely never going to see another update again, so this is the final product - and it's kind of a small shell and a basic game. Is there a quirk of the gameplay you dislike? Too bad. My personal axe to grind, is that it takes wayyy too long to feel like you're making progress in the game. There's a little map you can customize as you earn more points: you build things, and those little buildings generate rewards and points for you. The map is its own ongoing mini-game, the actual 'objective' of Triple Town. It's a neat little system: if it didn't take a thousand years to earn enough money to buy and build anything. I'm at over 100 hours on this thing (don't judge me). I'd expect to be rolling in dough right now, but I'm lucky if I can save up to 10K before having to spend it on something for my little map. So sometimes this map's progress feels like watching paint dry.It's a really cute game, though. If you don't get obsessive about these kinds of things, it's super cute to just pick it up for a few minutes at a time as you wish.			"

I won't go into much detail as you can just watch some youtube vids to see what I mean. But I will say it's very addictive as a single round type game, BUT you add in the meta game of building your own city with rewards from each match, which is in itself another puzzle type all together, and it's impossible to put down.  And it has ninja bears, you CANNOT go wrong with ninja bears.... ever...			"

In a puzzle game based on skill, where your goal is to see how long you can survive/how far you can progress/how many points you can score in a single run, having an inventory of items you can (literally) farm that carry over between runs feels...dirty.Unless you want to play a self-enforced challenge of willfully ignoring that part of the game, the optimal strategy is not to have the most skill at the game (or at least not JUST to have the most skill), but to spend x number of hours grinding to fill your inventory, THEN to wait until you're having a good run and burn through all your items to keep it going as long as possible. Want to try again? Waste another day. Why does this make the game better? It doesn't, because they're not making any money off you in this version. It's the taint of something that was originally designed to be a money siphon and not to play off its strengths, which it does have plenty of in terms of good design.It's like if someone came up with Tetris today, and you could win spare pieces after each game you play if you do well, which you could stock up on. It would completely change the flow of the game from, ""Gee, I did pretty well. I bet I can do better next time!"" to, ""Dang it. I just blew through all my straight pieces. Now I have to spend four hours farming more of them if I'm ever going to get a score like that again."" And some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ would let you buy more for 10 cents each or 12 for a dollar, just so you could always have one to swap into your ""next"" slot when you really needed it. I bet there's already a mobile or Facebook version like that out there somewhere. Now I'm sad.			"

												As far as match three games go this has got to be the best.  The game has a strategic map which works similar to the individual levels.  In the levels you can earn money which you can spend on stuff for your strategic world or spend on stuff to help you in the levels.  There are a few dirrenrent types of levels and if you have a game going in one and run out of money you can leave it go into a different level earn money there and then take it back to the level you were originally playing on so you can take it further.  It's addictive and fun.  I like it very much.			"

On the other hand, it's simple, has nice sounds and graphics and it's addictive, like a casual game.I started playing it on the iPhone and got hooked up, I now ditched it for the desktop version. This one has a persistent city which makes you want to play more once you finish a regular city.I strongly recommend this game.			"

												Neat little Puzzle/Board Game . There doesnt seem to be much of a goal aside from scoring as high as you can in a single run. I guess you can make a town but it doesnt apear the town does much but give you more materials to keep making your town bigger. There should be like a boss battle or something incorparated into it and you can only fight bosses when your town has a big enough castle from upgrading your town or something along those lines. That would make it a much better game. In its current state it is a nice time waster , but I wouldnt spend a lot on it.			"

												This is just one of those fun little games where you can sit down during an evening, open it up and relax while playing. It isn't intense gameplay. It's very simple. Match three of one object to make another one. Match three of those. And so on.  Yet, the simplicity doesn't take anything away from the game. However, if you want a high enough score, you have to be strategic in your placements of every object. But if you just want to put things in random places and see what happens, it is possible to get through the game that way too. So if you really don't want to put any effort in, you don't have to.Triple Town is designed in a way that makes it look a lot like many Facebook games that people get addicted to (or annoyed by). Yet, it separates itself from them because you are not compelled to fork out your hard earned cash to keep playing... because there are no in-game transactions, which makes it aces in my book.What I really like most about the game in addition to the simplicity factor is the soundtrack. The sound of birds. It's like you're sitting out in the middle of a garden on a summer afternoon.In short, if you want a game that requires minimal brain power (but rewards you if you put more in) that you can wind down while playing, give Triple Town a go. Just be careful. It's addictive.			"

												So this game used to be free, but that version had all of the advertisments and that one mechanic where you could only do so many turns a day. but this is a new age. The developers have wiped all that away. This is the full game, none of that bad stuff exists in this one. It is entirely its own package worth paying for in full. Triple Town's simple and unique gameplay is just as addictive as it was on the mobile or facebook, but even better you get the whole game, The Capital City part makes you want to keep playing so you can keep adding onto it with every completed town. Triple Town on steam is hands-down one of the best indie casuals out there.			"

												Triple Town is a very unique take on the ""match 3"" premise. You are given random resources, that when placed together with other similar pieces, ""upgrade"" into the next resource type. Grass becomes bushes; bushes become trees; trees become houses, and so on. Impeding your strategic placement of vegetaion are Bears which will wander around and block your way, unless you find a way to deal with them.The Steam edition of this game has a really cool feature. You have a base town that you can build up and get bonuses from. Seriously I keep hoping they will add this feature to my iOS version, it's a very fun little ""side game"". "

												Honestly it is a fun game. There is quite a bit of thought that goes into placement. One of the things I found is to only use money during your levels. You get so much more to build with if you do that. But it is a very grindy game, so be prepared to play for hours on end.			"

												From my short time with the game so far, it seems pretty good, albeit rather grindy? I never played the free2play model version, so I'm not sure of the differences, or whether there's anything deeper than building your own town after earning money and resources from repeatable stages.Regardless, it's good for the price at 75% discount. Not sure I would pay full-price, even if it is a fair compromise after a payment model change.			"

												Played this game on FB. Steam version is pretty much the same but no annoying P2W stuff on Steam. Also on FB and mobile you have a limited number of moves that recharge every so often, whereas the Steam version has unlimited moves. A big plus, tbh the only reason I'm playing it again. It's a fun, addictive little game where you match 3 of pretty much everything and anything to make something bigger and better in it's place.Except bears. You kill those and make graveyards from their corpses.			"

												I first played Tripletown as a free mobile game a few years back- and couldn't resist buying it again on steam when I saw it in the sales. Tripletown is an extremely addictive miniature logic/mathematical strategy puzzle game, with extremely cute elements. This Steam version adds new modes to play in, as well as a home ""island"" that you build up with points gained from your individual mini city games. Definitely a fun game to kill some time, the sort of thing I play when I realise I have half an hour of boredom before work to kill.Definitely recommend this game, though would advise buyers wait for a sale to bring it closer to the £3-4 mark.

												I really love this game.  If you like match 3, and want a different twist on it, then this is it.  Mathing 3 (or more) combines into 1 higher rank item.  Match 3 (or more) of those, and yet another higher rank item, until you run out of space to place things then game over.  It has a little challenge to get higher and higher levels because managing the placement of the last piece is where the combined item appears, and makes it not trivial to get higher level items next to each other, until you learn some tricks, rely on luck, buy or use higher level items to complete a match, etc.  Plus you get a home base that you can also lay down plots that generate you rewards and can also be combined for higher reward generation.  I am really happy I got this. [4/5 stars]Ran great on my Windows 10 alienware alpha, full screen, no issues whatsoever.			"

												It is so addictive to join 3 of the same things. I even see it in my dreams or when I close my eyes already! I think I have burned it in my eyes now! I have so many games to choose from and I still keep playing this one. It is so nice and cute and easy and nonviolent that it is just relaxing to play this. :) I adore the bears too, they are so cuddly!			"

												This game has the exact right amount of joy and frustration that you want from a puzzle based game. Combining it with cute graphics and a unique twist on the match 3 classic is just the icing on the cake. It's highly addictive, you have been warned!			"

												Triple Town is a very relaxing puzzle with cute and colourful graphics. The rules of the game are pretty simple, but you won't get the best scores without careful thought and strategy. I recommend this game for people who enjoy puzzles and strategy, or even for those who want to enjoy a relaxing game.			"

												Fun. Shallow. You'll feel bad for draining your time down it, but you got to make you capital island bigger! It is worth it. Somehow a timesink, but very surface level time killer, not what my favorite games are. Feel bad after spending hours with it.			"

												02/14/2016A classic example of multi-layered strategy that introduces itself as an adorable exercise in match-three-and-win gameplay and ends up leading you into complex and carefully planned out choices that will often make or break the entire experience.That's what it was like for me, anyway. Having already taken a good go at the Android version of this, I'm happy to see different content in this version - though not happy enough to want to play it through just yet.			"

												GRRRR. I am a bear! I will eat your little peoples and so they run away screaming!Triple Town is the game I play when my mind needs a break. It's adorable and mindless and still puzzletastic. I love the different options of games. I also have this game on my mobile phone and tablet.Overall a fantastic waste of time, but not that horrible waste of time like Titanic. I'll never get those four hours back.			"
