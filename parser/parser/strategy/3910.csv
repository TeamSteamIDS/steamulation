												I played this game when I was younger, and enjoyed it to the point that by the time I burnt the CD out - it was around the year 5000AD and me [Germany], America, Egypt, India were all that was left - Super states having had numerous nuclear wars. Europe had turned into a desert thanks to the global warming, America had conquered the entire Western Hemisphere, Egypt - all of Africa. Our militaries had become so large, so advanced, and the nuclear wars so constant that we eventually found ourselves in a deadlock - slowly starving, rotting away with the time. Our capitals had long been wiped away - eventually, wars were no longer profitable, the resources had run out. I played that game until the CD had finally quit on me, determined to see the end of the world. Compared to today, it may not be as flashy anymore - but Civilization III is the best of the series, Civilization IV comes at a close second, but things were removed and added in the later installments that made one feel like they had lost  a bit of the original game. I've since rebought it, and I'm already at 1,797.6 hours.			"

												Having played Civilization 2-5, as well as the games made by the original team of Civilization : Call to Power 1&2,I would say ANY Civilization game so far is a buyer and a keeper, if you are into turn based strategy games.The only reason Civilization 1 is missing from my collection is the rareness of finding someone having and willing to sell his/her copy, I woud jump at the change;)every Civ Game adds a little and removes a little, the one that you like most is personal flavour.To me this one certainly ranks higher than the later Civ 4 and 5.This game was and is the height of ""classic"" Civilization games.For you people ariving at this from Civ 2 : you only will miss the old advisors (civ 5 and they still not have returned them sadly enough)For you people ariving at this from Civ 4 and 5 : no religion, but instead you will love the stacks of doom, army units, and other things that were removed in later game.This game is also somewhat older and a lot lighter on system requirements than later civ games, making it great to play on any device you want to. Also for a mere 4.99 (and it's often on sale for 2.49, and more rare for 1.25) you have an asolute bargain!			"

												I played this when I was like... really young I had no Idea what I was doing. I loved it.I played this in school for social studies. I had the upper hand having played this before. I dominated everyone. I loved it.I got it on steam. I played it for a day straight. I loved it still.This game will last forever, however my love for this game is a mixture of honest nostalgia and fanstastic gameplay that does not ruin fond memories. Get Civ 5, or 6 or whatever it's at, and leave me to play my civ 3.Story: 7/10 (Very linear but thats ok. Historic.)Gameplay: 9/10 (Repetitive sometimes.)Presentation: 6/10 (Old, and not really great.)Soundtrack: X/10 (Hmm?)Replayability: 10/10 (Keeps me coming back.)			"

												This game. This bloody game. This game has.. it.. it means so very much to me. I still have the original deluxe box set from 2001. This game has taught me about history, military command, creativity, humbleness, frustration and so much more. I cannot begin to imagine the true hours I have off of steam. Over a thousand, surely by now. This game brought me and my new stepfather together almost 15 years ago. This game shaped my brain and how I see the world and history. I have made and submitted maps to the Civfanatics forums, contributed to full overhaul mods, and spent countless hours making faithful recreations of real geography in the glorious editor. All the Civilization games that came after pale in comparison. This game was probably more of a parent and guide than my parents. Taught me about cooperation and systematic destruction of the god forsaken Aztecs. A true 10/10, if you have the time to sit down for a 16 hour slugfest on Sid difficulty. From the music to the graphics to the civilopedia to all the content out there made lovingly by loving fans, this game has captivated me like no other in my entire life. The online community might be a little lacking these days, but the AI, in my opinion, does just fine. I cannot express enough how thoroughly I have and still do enjoy this game. From humble beginnings, this game has risen to stand the test of time. I will play it until the very day that I die. Hats off, gents. A masterpiece reigns.			"

												One of the best games of all time for Strategy genre fans. The interface is not as streamlined as Civ 5, nor is the game play as intuitive as Civ 4, but it is the best of the Civ series to operate on an old computer. Bear in mind that the AI is not as sophisticated as most would like - the computer controlled opponents will gang up on you for no reason. However, this game is well worth the low price of $5. A physical copy at Wal-Mart will still set you back $10.			"

												I played this game way back in 2001. The problem I faced was at that time, I had an ancient Pentium II 300Mhz PC. So you can imagine how I felt as the game was nearly unplayable for me.Coming into the present time of 2014, I was glad that Steam offered Civilization III for sale. I quickly bought it and played on my modern top of the line laptop. It sure brought back the memories. This game can be considered a classic in the turn based strategy (TBS) genre. TBS fans would most definitely love this game despite the dated graphics. I must also like to add that the Steam version of the game works perfectly fine in Windows 8.1. A TBS haven to say the least!			"

												While it may not be able to compete graphically with newer Civilization games, it still keeps it's charm after all these years.Because it is a Voxel/Sprite based game, making models is simple enough(and I say that due to me seeing a good 8-10 models pumped out a month compared to Civ IV and CIv V's model sections on Civ Fanatics)the scenario editor is where all the fun is though, want to make a scenario based on a Colonial Marine Invasion of Xenomorph Prime? DO IT!, want to have Skynet and the Resistance fight a war ALL OVER THE GLOBE?! do it! ever wondered how the UNSC would fare against the Imperium of Man or the Galactic Empire? you can do it!there is so much can be done with the scenario editor, and if that's not enough for you, some wonderful programmers at CivFanatics have made an expanded Civ scenario editor.new note:""I'm going to conquer Russia before I go to bed!"" 3 hours later:""two more turns and I'll have conquered Rome and China!"" 1 hour later:""my clock says 3AM... oh well, time to finish my conquest of the world, MONTEZUMA YOU WILL BURN!""

												Civ III is an apogee of the former ""Civilization"" games focus. Why play it now, when Civ V is tuned, fixed, updated so many times - and even price looks fine for almost every pocket? Well, it's all for that focus I'm talking about.First three of Civilization games were taking the player back at the dawn of the known history - and to help to notice the flow of time, there was some borderlines across that mighty river of the so-called ""4th dimension"". Starting with the Civ IV this process of moving through timeline were ""smoothed"", to the point where player gliding from the start to the end of the game without any noticable delay. I'm not saying that's bad - I like Civ V myself - but sometimes you don't want simple transfer from A to B, from the stone to electric age - you want to see cornerstones of each specific era. And with that - Civ III is giving you the better experience.All that I said in the previous passage, is arguable, of course. But here is another trait of Civ III which was intentionally cutted off (in favor of balance, of course): the size of armies and all warfare business.With all complexity of the game mechanics in the Civ V, armed conquests there looking as they performed by 10-20 people at best. In Civ III, we have totally another scale. So, when I want to win a game of Civilization by assault strategy, I start Civ III.The third volume of Civilization is dated, but still deep, still challenging, still holding the billion of possibilities to build your Nation. Make Your Way. So I'll mark the game as 9/10 - not ideal, but so much enjoyable.			"

												The third installment in the Civilization series which is getting pretty old these days, with it's successor Civilization IV and V.  This is another one of those titles that you might have grown up with as a kid and have had nostalgic value to you. This is at least the case for me. I remember that the game took a chocking 700 MB of space on my hard disk and it was generally tanking my late 90's computer. I have sunk a huge amount of hours into this game and for me this is the best game in the series.Civilization is probably the most dominating Turn-based strategy game in the gaming industry. The Total Wars games for example are RTS/TBS hybrids, while CIV is completely TBS. True Civilization enthusiasts probably rank Civ3 pretty low, compared to Civ2, Civ4 and Civ5 which were very well received for their times. For me however, Civilization 3 is the favorite among the ones I've played (Civ3, Civ4 and Civ5). Again - because of it's nostalgic value.All Civ games start out the same way unless you play a scenario or campaign. You start off with a settler and a warrior of some sorts. The settler can build a city, and as you find a suitable location for your capital - let your Civilization begin! Beware though, once you have started a game you won't be able to leave for at least 4 hours. This game is honestly best played during the night and is mostly a single-player experience.There is a Campaign/Scenario mode, where you play historical events or just silly settings. As well as a multiplayer mode, but I have never enjoyed these ones at all. Nothing beats that random map mode, select the terrain, the climate, map size and your opponents/allies. Let the history get rewritten as you choose the path of the righteous, or the path of the tyrant. Through exploding expansion, racing technology, crushing warfare and cunning diplomacy you must stand victor as the one and only dominating superpower.I only recommend picking this up if you have a personal connection to it, or if you are entirely out of gameplay from modern titles.Note: You might want to check out Civilization V (Review) as it's a modern take to the genre and series.

												A good game to waste countless hours of strategical planning and destroying other civilizations. If you get bored of the vanilla textures you can go and search googles for different ones. This by far got me right into the Civilization series and others. If you want to play multiplayer good luck finding a host. You can host your own but no one will play so the best is just host a hotseat or a lan party. I give this game a 10/10.			"

												I'm new to Civilization games, and pretty new to turn based strategy games in general. However, I still enjoyed this game a lot. I'm awful, I lose pretty much every time, and I still have fun. This game has you building a civilization from scratch, trying to expand city by city to become the best civilization possible. At the start, you are given TONS of options. Picking what civilization you want to be to determine your starting perks, climate, weather, the age of the world, difficulty, barbarian options, AI agreesiveness, the ratio of water to land, and a whole bunch of customizable options for the rules and game limits. It's a lot to take in. And once you start, you can work towards whatever kind of civilization you want, from city structures to your units to your research... there's just a lot of options. But, what makes this game so cool is that there are not only a lot of options for starting and working your way through the game, there are also multiple ways to win the game as well. So you can replay lots of times trying to win in all the different ways available. If you are being severely outmatched in one area by another civilization, perhaps you can salvage your game by switching to another goal for victory. It's really very clever.However, there ARE some issues with this game. It can be a lot to take in at first, especially since the tutorial mode is defaulted to off. I learned everything by winging it but not everyone will have the patience or luck for it. It'll take a while just to get used to what everything does and understanding how to navigate the game. Also, games tend to take hours to complete, which can also be rough if you don't have much time to play. It'll take A LOT of time to get acquainted with the game and to play in general so it's a HUGE time suck. I just wanted to get that point clearly across. Also... it's really hard... or I just suck... or both. Also... the online has been shut down, making this single player only. There ARE some complicated and iffy ways of working around it to play online, but they aren't worth the risk or hassle. The online is supposedly coming to Steamworks in the future, but until it comes, online is not a viable options, which is the whole reason I got it in the first place and that's diappointing, but it's my own fault for not looking into it more I guess.Despite the issues, this game is VERY cheap. Five bucks for hours and hours of gameplay, including the two expansions to the game. Easily worth it, especially if you're looking to get into the Civilization series or TBS game in general. Just be aware of the time it will take to enjoy the game.			"

												Building on the classic Civilization II, Civ III introduces several new game mechanics including expanding City borders & also for the first time animated units. The player starts off in the year 4000 BC with a small group of settlers and some basic knowledge of road building, irrigation & farming. After choosing the site of their first City the player then has to explore and expand their empire to other locations. The ideal placement of a City would be close to natural resources & luxuries, this will help increase trade, production & happiness of the citizens. Connecting City's via roads also increases trade and the sharing of resources / luxuries across your empire. During the early game roaming Barbarians may cause problems along your borders and any unprotected units or land will be either captured or pillaged. As you progress through the centuries you will eventually meet other Civilizations. Some of these will be friendly and willing to trade, others more hostile and may attack you completely unprovoked. You have the opportunity to influence the opinions of other empires by your actions towards them, giving them gifts or trading technology is usually a way to get on their good side. Later in the game you can also forge an alliance with certain empires in the form of a mutual protection pact. This is especially useful during times of War to help seal victory over your enemies. The game ends in one of six ways, the most traditional being conquest (destroying all opponents). The Space race victory occurs when any Civilization completes and launches a Space Ship to Alpha Centauri. Other victory types are Cultural, Diplomatic & Domination. If the game ends and no one is victorious by any of these, the game uses a ""histograph"" to determine the winner by points.This is one of my all time favourite games, though Civ IV has more depth by adding religion, unit promotions and other special abilities. I still prefer this version to any other.There are no in game options for changing to widescreen resolutions but if you do the following: goto your Steam/SteamApps/Common/Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete/Conquests folder then find the file called conquests.ini. Right click to edit the file then goto the bottom and add the line Keepres=1 this will force the game to your monitors resolution.			"

												Personal Experience: This is the first Civilization game I've ever played and before I knew it I was getting angry sitting at school thinking about how the Mayans were advancing on Moscow. I finally get home and load it up to push the attack to get flaked and then have Moscow taken. 10/10 Would buy for loads of fun.			"

												This is the game that started my love of the Civilization series, and strategy games in general.   I have fond memories sitting down and spending hours playing this game, even though I didn't fully understand it's mechanics at the time.  As I grew older, this was my favorite game for a number of years.  This game holds it's own in just about every key aspect, even compared to the newer installments of the Civilization series.  Online multiplayer? You bet!  Unique mechanics and smart AI for it's age? Yup! Good graphics for a game made in 2001? Heck yes!  The replay value of this game makes even Civ 5 blush.  I've been playing this game since 2006, and I still never get bored of it.  Every scenario pans out differently, and no two games are ever quite the same.  Even to this day, I prefer this over Civ 5.  Maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but this is definitely my favorite Civ game of the lot.			"

												I have played this game since it came out brand new back in the day (my hours don't reflect the amount of time I've put into it) and I still believe that it's one of the best games ever made.  Out of everything I've played, I come back to this game over and over again and am constantly amazed at the replayability it brings.  It's always different and interesting to see how the enemy will attack you and what it takes to defend yourself/territory.  Taking over the world is my favorite, but may take days.  If you blow it then just start a whole different one.  It's easy to understand and learn but very complicated to master.  It's right up there with Chess and Axis and Allies in my book of classics. I've found nothing else quite as great........			"

												For my money this is still the best Civilization game in the franchise (I have played every one extensively, with the exception of Civ V brave new world). After this entry the focus became less on society building simulation and more on micromanging increasingly Byzantine (pun intended) resources and minmaxing to hit various win conditions. Civ III is the last one you can really just chill and play however you like without regards to whether you win or lose and still have fun with. Complete is required, the vanilla Civ III had tons of balance issues. I also like how in III the civilizations have a hint of individual flavor without being locked into an identity. After this game the wrong combination of civilization and starting position could be really killer, in this game it just means you don't have as much of an edge. There are some unique units that can be really game changing depending on the situation you are in when you hit them, but ultimately it's still very situational. I recommend playing around Monarch level for a good mix of challenge and relaxation, below this level enemy civs don't develop enough to make decent trading partners, above it they start with such an advantage you're scrambling to play catch up until late in the game. For fans of old school civ, this is the game you want.(Note I probably have played several hundred hours of this game, but mostly before Steam even existed).			"

												I will start this review in two seperate forms, one for interested newcomers and then the Old Guard.I will list off the pros first before the cons of this game, Civilization 3 is a different twist of the game than you may be familar with 4 and 5. Go in understanding this switch:     -Its an old game, if you can run the actual game, there should be no real issues.     -Graphically, it's a sound experience and not many real issues, the modding community can find you bug fixes or new skins. Its pleasing regardless and you won't really be let down by this game.     -Combat is similar to Civ 4, simple dice combat where units have health bars going between 3-6, strength and defense stats play their parts and very simple to understand. There are Offensive Units, Defensive Units and Manovuer units, no exceptions and combat is based on these theorectical roles.     -31 Civs that each have 1 unique unit, unless mods are involved. Civ bonuses are general in that they have two traits which give them bonuses which are shared by others, Militaristic, Religious, Industrists, etc.     -Diplomacy is sound and reliable, techs can be traded directly as well as maps, I will faults soon     -Happiness is based per city, with simple factors involved including conscription     -Civfanatics Community and its modding community are lovely and its still alive and well, just no WorkshopThe Cons:     -Civ 5 has a prediction based combat, units do no die with one attack on even matches. Not the case for this game, they fight till they die unless they are manovuer units against inf. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can and will happen, don't cry.     -The AI Diplomacy is very defensive and almost always cautious, wary or spiteful towards you, no exceptions.     -Its really easy to find yourself fighting half the world because of one war, tech trading is enabled so you can find yourself backwater as they maintain amiable relations and trade those tech with one another while they fight you.      -Multiplayer is old, the members are not exactly nub-friendly, I myself was 3 years old when this game came out.     -Game doesn't work for you, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, not much anyone can do for you.     -In my opinion, the hardest Civilization I have every played, it will humble you many times over.In the end it is a Civ-game, you can't really go wrong with trying. It is the game that personally got me into Civilization and its unique-ness will likely find you some memorable gameplay. Hey and if you get the game and love it, I'd always be willing to play with you by e-mail or I might even try GameRanger. Good luck on your adventure To Stand The Test of TimeReturning Civ 3, should you get it on steam? Yes and no, while digital copies are nice, its not any different from the disk. That being said, I prefer it on Steam. I have purchased this game three times, one the authentic Civ III Gold Version, which was outstanding and I loved it. However, eventually I got a new computer and it turns out the disc was ruined. I got the game a third time over E-bay, the only source I could find which remains, this time the Complete. Features were missing and I couldn't even access them no matter what I tried, the conquest files corrupted and Play the World missing. I got a new computer, my current, running Windows 8.1, 4GB RAM and Integrated Graphics. The disc would not load the game, but viola, I found the steam version was the cheapest to begin with. Its the same game as you know, and for me everything was working well. Underneath I will discuss the major steam issues:     -For me at least, Steam Overlay does not appear to work and I wouldn't know how to fix it, it could be a personal issue, I don't know.      -There are serious issues people have with getting this dinosaur game to work on new computers. Win 7 tends to have more compatiability issues with the game than Win 8(.1). Your at risk here, but this is usually the cheapest alternative     -Modding is simple but remember, access the files through the properties tab by right-click the game in the Library Tab     -Multiplayer is not run by Steam servers, nor GameSpy Arcade, it shut down if you haven't followed the game. It is now accessible over GameRanger. I do not know how that works or even attempted to access multiplayer.			"

AUDIOCatchyVISUALSimplisticDIFFICULTYAdjustableVIBEAddictiveCRAVINGBoard GamesON SALEFrequentlyPROS: On Mar 16, this game received a much-needed update to get rid of the nonfunctioning Gamespy multiplayer! Ugh, what a relief! This is my favorite installment of the Civ series. The game has a slew of nice preferences to choose from, even including an aid for the color blind.CONS:  New to the game? Go into the options and turn the tutorial on. It's starts as off, for some reason. The cutscenes look horrible because of age and stretching. Resolutions are rough. Compared to modern installments, the opponent civs act rather erratically, to the point of being nonsensical. There is no balancing, so some Civs are OP and others you would ideally never play.WORTH: This is my favorite installment of the series, of course I think it's worth full-price. You may want to consider a discount though, if you're used to later installments. To the average player that lacks nostalgia, this is just the game you know and love but with less features.OVERALL:  It's very easy to lose track of time with this game. It's great fun and I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good ""board game"" style game on Steam, since there aren't many. It's certainly more simple than four or five, but has been my favorite installment of the series.SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Originally I had some crashes with this game version (Steam), but managed to fix it. The info is at the end of the review. Civilization III Complete was one of the games I spent the most time with, and really enjoyed it. For me, it's easily one of the best 4X games ever made (at least in the time I type it).If you did not play Civilization 3 in the past and are wondering if you should buy it - below is some basic info that should encourage you to do that.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The pluses:+ Lots of civilizations, each plays differently+ Lots of different units + special military unit for each civilization+ The AI scripts are demanding (unlike in most modern games)+ Resources on map force you to play strategically+ Depending on the size and type of the maps, games might differ quite a lot+ You can play in really big maps+ The game has fine mods that you can find on the internet+ It's hard to stop playing it------------------------------------------------------The minuses:- It's hard to stop playing it- At higher difficulties the military victory is the most viable option (only)- When you control most of the map it's just boring killing of the remaining weaklings- At the industrial age, you probably control most of the map- At higher difficulties AI is cheating- Civilizations are not balanced (some are really good, some - really bad)- After you learn to use workers and diplomacy, it's not that hard (but still fun)- Old 2D game, so in native desktop resolution units and fonts might be too small- Old 2D game, so in native game resolution units might be too big (and no widescreen)======================================For native desktop resolution in game:1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder conquests.ini2. Put ""keepRes=1"" in conquests.ini file (without """")======================================Those settings should fix crashes in Windows 7 64 bit.1. Go to the Conquests folder in your Civ 3 folder2. Rename LSANS.FOT to -LSANS.FOTIf that does not help:Set Windows compatibility to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and run program as administrator.If the game runs too slow delete keepRes=1 from ini file (in Windows XP mode the game is slower)======================================That's it. You can now go buy the game.			"

												Three Civ games later and this one is still the best.Admittedly, I would recommend Civ V for than this just because has much more content and is overall better looking and running, also for the most part people tend to enjoy Civ V more as well.So first off to really enjoy it you must be willing to sit down for a looooong time, this game takes a long time to progress so be patient. With that out of the way lets discuss why this game is more favorable than Civ V1) Bigger armies, Bigger BattlesCiv III allows HUGE armies to battle. This means war is actually dangerous and you need to have a war plan if your are gonna beef with another Civ. Along with massive armies you can stack units, something you cannot do in Civ V, normally this would ruin the flow of gameplay when you have 60 units on one tile, but somehow it doesn't. Also, Civ V's fighting mechanics are straight up garbage, and some units are overpowered and too hard to fight.2) Governments, Сове́тский Сою́з!What the hell Sid, why would you remove an amazing part of the Civ experience? :(Governments are what allow you to determine how much money you make, how fast you produce things, how much millitia you can have, and some others. Without governments, Civ V has a laughably bad Social policies and World congress type deal that can basically screw you over depending on who has control over it.3) Trading tech, Who got the Wheel?Why was this removed. Trading tech was a central part of the Civ III experience, you could make some mad cheese, or skip entire halves of an age with this. Maybe it was too easy to get tech from the AI or something, but this needs to come back.4) Advisors aren't annoying and useless.In Civ V advisors are stupid and useless, simple.In Civ III advisors maintain your civ and keep things nice and tidy, simple.Now these were just some of the things that I think make Civ III great, but as I said, you might just want to buy Civ V instead, it has much more content and is better looking and running.Maybe it's nostalgia, Maybe it really is butter. Who won? You decide. "

												A flat out brilliant game.A classic in the making, Civilization 3 once again serves up a big plate of turn based gameplay covered in gobs of strategy and tons of choices, this is one that will keep you coming back for another helping over and over again.The game is still frighteningly addictive, constantly dangling new accomplishments in front of players who are still planning on playing ""just one more turn.""A worthy and immersive extension of the series, and comes close to perfection in terms of strategy.Complex combat, climbing the tech tree and resource management make Civ III a deep strategy game – far beyond a simple simulation game.The changes mostly seem to increase your options for trying new strategies, without altering the core game. And actually, that’s a brilliant approach.This is most likely the biggest, deepest and most spectacular strategy game ever made.			"

												Don't understand what people are whining about.Of course this game is old, so what? Old is gold (generally, not always, but certainly most of the time).Would I say that it is better than Civilization V? Yes and no, both has their forces and their weakness and I am certainly not talking about the graphics because I do love the graphics in this game, call me crazy, I prefer the graphics you find in this game than those in Civilization V, it's simple but beautiful, old school some would say.In my opinion, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, Civization III and Civilization IV are the best in the Civilization series.Then you have Civilization V and Civilization II.Beyond Earth isn't that good, far too little content.If you love Civilization but haven't played this one, you'll probably love it!If you're looking for a fantasy civilization then you should give a look at Warlock and Eador which are the closer ones to this series, there are some other such as Age of Wonders but it has its differences, lot of them.9.2/10 "

												Here's what I think of this game, I'll compare it to Civ 5 since most people consider that to be the best Civ game.Music: Both Civ 5 and Civ III have fantastic soundtracks as with pretty much all Civ games. CIV 5's soundtrack is better, but that doesn't mean this soundtrack isn't worth listening to. Diplomacy: The diplomacy here in Civ III, in my opinion is better. You can trade maps technologies, change how agressive the AI is. The AI does get quite a bit agressive once you get to medium agressiveness although.Scenarios: The scenarios here in Civ III are quite interesting. We have Rise of Rome, Fall of Rome, Napoleanic Europe, WW2 in the pacific, etc. I honestly can't choose between Civ 5 and 3 in terms of which had better scenarios.War: And here is where we start to see the flaws of Civ III. There are certain units made for attacking, defending, and seige units. The seige units must be protected otherwise they will be either captured or destroyed immediately, and the attacking units are vulnerable to counterattack. Defending units ensure your cities are protected and your attacking armies. This part of war, I liked, It made sure I don't just build completely one type of unit. Cities are instantly captured if there is no unit inside. I wasn't as fond of this as the unit diversity, but it was tolerable at least.But then their's the battle system. It's luck based, which I have a burning hatred for. I could attack a spearman one time with an archer and not take any damage, while another time, a defending spearmen exactly the same as the other one could take out my archer, without taking any damage. How does that make any sense? I get it it's an old game an all, but come on.Also the AI seem way too powerful. I met Scandinavia on turn 2 and it already said his forces outnumbered mine.CIv 5 definetly, has better war mechanics.Barbarian encampment and ruins/friendly encampments: Whether you love 'em or hat 'em these guys are around, some encampment are friendly and will give you something like gold or a settler to give you a huge early game boost. and of course the hostile. You can make the hostile encampments non existant, sedentary, normal, roaming or raging. Since there is more option than Civ 5, I'd say these are slightly better.Civilization balance: Civilization 5 isn't exactly balanced, (Babylon is much better, is pretty much better every aspect compared to let's say the Iroqouis). Civ's are more balanced here. Each Civ have a unique unit, 2 free technologies and 2 bonus'. Military bonus' allow you to build stronger armies faster, science allows you to build science buildings faster, religious allows you to build cultural building faster, etc. In my opinion the two best are science and religious (Which Babylon ironically has both XD). Besides that Civ's are quite balanced besides early game Unique units (I'm looking at you bowmen)Victory types: Time victory is always on here, which I don't like (although you can push back the counter for time victory to kick in) cultural victoy revolves around how much culture you can get in either one city or your entire empire, dominatuion requires you to own at certain percentage of the world's population or land area, conquest is to eliminate all rival civilizations., wonder is to build a certain amount of wonders, diplomatic is to get people to vote for you once the UN is built, and space race to leave this filthy planet. All good, although most of the time you will win by either cultural or time.Graphic: I don't really care for graphics much, but the graphic here are at best, pleasing to the eye and at worst, tolerable.Conclusion: CIV 5 is obviously better, but Civ 3 is extremely enjoyable also, I have many hours into this, and many more will be put into playing this. I know the flaws I listed here aren't going to be changed unless everyone at Firaxis gets high. I haven't seen any bugs, just a great game.I rate this 9/10- Aged beautifully, like a gem.			"

												Sid Meier's Civilization III, the sequel to the great Civilization II, a game that by some is still to this day considered to be the best of the series, has the heavy duty challenge of not only living up to the standards set by it's predecessors but also to innovate the franchise enough that players of the previous installment can be bothered to upgrade.It starts out with a somewhat mixed feeling. Some of the great ideas from Alpha Centauri has been brought over creating a much more versatile playing field with a living map and more unique factions but many of Alpha Centauri's greatest assets, such as the ability to build your own units and terrain elevations are notably absent. and others, such as unique factions, are only half implemented.These improvements however do still manage to increase the interactivity of the game substantially particularly when combined with the many new features, such as culture, that Civ III brings to the table.Factions are not longer defined simply by their city names but now have a few unique units of little consequence and civilization traits of great consequence. Unique units are simply beefed up versions of regular units that give a faction a small military advantage during the time period in which the unit is present, this can be a nice boost if you happen to go to war in that time but it can also be ignored completely if the time for war is not right. The traits each faction receives now however are of a much greater importance and can range from getting a free technology every age to a half off cost on religious buildings. These traits are big enough in effect that they tend to define your entire game.A new and important feature in Civ III is culture. Each city generates culture through it's various buildings and the culture in turn defines the size of it's borders. A heavily cultured city can even envelop the city of an opponent and flip it to your side. While the realism or historical accuracy of such a device is laughable at best it does provide players with a new means of expansion and a way to deal with those pesky resource stealing late game cities that the AI is so fond of placing in whatever unoccupied corner of your empire it can find.Graphically Civilization III is passable as always, the city view is pleasant but the rest of the game gives only a mediocre visual experience. Nothing pretty but nothing that'll ruin your gaming experience either. The soundtrack is still mostly orchestral epics and works very well although the rest of the sound effects in the game are pretty forgettable.All in all Sid Meier's Civilization III is a good sequel. It doesn't create quite the same feeling of amazement and enjoyment that going from Civ I to Civ II does but it manages to provide a good solid experience with enough innovation to justify the purchase.

												Civilization III is the first 4X game I've seriously tried and I must say it was a surprise! At first the game wasn't likeable to me because my civilization was considered the worst at the easiest difficulty. I learned with some time (in multiplayer) the basics, I would say that it was a fun way to learn things.The feeling you get when the first game's over is unique, on both victory and defeat circumstances, you learn lots of things seeing the enemies' play on the summary.I want to say to all the new players to not get discouraged by the brutality that CPUs have in this game and I recommend to try it out with a person in multiplayer like I did and also to read the informations found on the civilopedia.

												My Dad thinks that games are a waste of time and that one can have much more fun and growth from reading Thackery or Trollope. That being said, he must have put in several thousand hours into this game since he bought it for me around my 6th-odd birthday in 2001. Our primay form of bonding is talking Civ strategy. He has no interest in 4, 5, BE or anything like that. Says they're not interesting like this one is. I'm inclined to agree. I think that Civ 3 is the essence of 4X, and that any designer wanting to know what makes 4x games great,  should play this obsessively. There are a few things here and there that I think could have been expanded on- such as plague- and the fact that some civilizations simply have uninspired Unique Units with bland mechanics. Nevertheless, one of my favourite games ever. Now that Civ 6 is happening, I do hope that Meier et al look back to this one, for inspiration, on how a truly grand 4X should be.  "

												Civ 3 Complete on sale for $1.24 so I buy it since I recall how great it was years ago.  I am a big fan of Civ 4 & Civ 5 with all the expansions.  And I am delaying getting a new PC until I know the system requirements for Civ 6.  Still I realize that there was a lot I missed from Civ 3:  Artillery that doesn't suffer damage.  The people's portraits in the city display (I liked Civ I's  full figurines even better).  The fashion progression for world leaders and the population.  (Nineteenth Century attire looks good on everybody; I don't know why).  Single figure unit graphics.  And extremely good graphics for the system requirements.     And the world is massive.  Civ 5, by giving every unit at least 2mp, really shrank the world.       Units simply gain more hits points on promotion; no decision on how to specialize.     Music that expresses the time frame of the turn.  Civ 5's music is just as varied but seems      designed as background music.Of course it all depends on what one wants from a Civ game.  But if it goes on sale again for $1.24 that's not much of a gamble.			"

												The game is old. The game is definetly recomented from my part.I had to lower the screen resolution to avoid the 'tiny-litle-units' making my ayes go into pain. :-) But after all these years, I really enjoyed again the struggle to build a sivilization. There are newer versions of the same game nowdays. But I really believe that each of the Civilization games has its unique satisfaction to offer the strategy gamer, even if Civ IV is my prefered one.I definetly recoment CIV III, especially moded with mods like ""Rise And Rule"", which add many new units, technologies etc.  The problem is, I can not clearly identify what is this 'different gameplay aspects' that kept me playing CIV II all these hous and not starting a CIV IV or CIV V campain... The differenses on units, wonders, railway inprovements etc, should not be enouph to get me playing a game as old as this one... On the other hand, I got myself missing the real-movie councelors of CIV-II, but I don't think I will play that old love again :-)In any case. Considering the very low price that you can purchse this old game (Civilization III), especially in a bountle together with the newet versions, I definetly believe that any gamer that likes turn -base build-expand strategies should give it a try. Even for the shenarios of the 'complete' edition, a CIV-V fun could find in CIV-III a way to further expand his Civilization gamepleasure.Have a good game everyone :-)			"

You'll most definitely have a fun time, with all these hilarious moments appearing left and right.The advisors actually have a use, and they have expressions, unlike Civ 4 and 5. (The Science Advisor is literally Sid Meier btw)There's whole government systems as opposed to civics. Means you can't fine-tune your government, but it takes a bit of load off your shoulders if you're not into figuring out what civics you want.Also, spearman vs. tank scenarios don't happen *that* often. 118 hours in at the time of writing, and RNG hasn't pulled any serious BS on me.The only real downside that sticks out to me is the loading lag between each turn that builds up late-game when you play multiplayer matches. That isn't too significant, though, since if you can sit through 2 minutes straight of nothing but an AI doing carpet bombing runs on your capital, you can survive an extra 4 seconds of loading time.This was a wonderful Christmas gift I got from a good friend of mine. I would most definitely buy the game for someone else, too.I mean, come on -- hours of endless entertainment for only $1.24? How could you resist?			"

												Not without its bugs and problems, but still a very fun game to play. Civ3 is easily of the best civilization games made (in my opinion). Even better than civ5. While newcomers from later civs may have trouble adapting to this game, if given time, it will grow on you. After playing out the main game, mods and scenarios will continue to take up your time and amaze how much can be accomplished with just a simple and easy to use editor.If you have problems installing and playing this game, dont worry the game works great even with steam. I see other users having problems with steam installation and modern operating systems, but the game does actually work fine it just may need a few tweaks depending on the issue. I myself have never had a single issue on Windows 7 (apart from if in a long session for several hours, like 3+, there's a possibility of it crashing, but this is minor and can be quite common on other games as well) using the steam version (I also have the disc version which works fine being on the same computer with the steam copy).

												Personally this is my favorite turn based strategy. The game is playable for anybody and is very addicting if a person likes to be in control of things. What I like the most, is ability to grow really big, to name stuff as one wants and to play on real World maps. Editor is really simple btw. AI is kind of not really good, but it's challenging on high levels due to bonuses to AI. Also, there is a city count limit on a map which is 512 I think and the game has kind of built in minimal turn waiting time. I have tested this with some members on the community, and it seems that game code doesn't allow for faster operation, regardless of PC hardware one is using. No matter what CPU/RAM/GPU one has, two very powerful cores or 8 core CPU (since the game utilizes only one core by default), the speed of the slowest turn will be the same. Which is considerable, when you have full map of civs, dip relations and modern units.			"

												All Civilization games are awesome. This is my own personal favourite (i have not played 1 or 2).Each one takes something away and adds something new.I prefer this one because there are less factors you have to worry about, 4 is just missing something 'MAGIC'. I do love 5 but 3 is just slightly better (for me).If you're new to Civilization games, it may be worth you starting with 5 because I imagine peoples personal favourites are the first ones they try.A full game of civilization (3,4, or 5) can take several days. Obviously you can save and come back to it later. You need to play this game for at least 4 hours before you can learn to like it			"

												Civ III may not hold up to Civ IV or Civ V, but Civ III is a great game regardless. It has a wealth of customization that the series is known for, and is my personal favorite in the series. I spent so many hours in this game when it wasn't on Steam. I'd play the same world for what would be milleniums in game time, creating an absolutely massive empire only for Gandhi to nuke it all to dust. It's five dollars, so it's definitely worth the price now.			"

			Yet again I'm playing another game I can't seem to get my steam overlay working, so I can't screenshot the conventional way.		


-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The ""Story"" is more so in the individual experience you have playing these types of games. You're put into a random world with random NPC's (unless you try to determine the world and nations by selecting them...) the key defining elements are how you interact with the game's NPC's.My personal story is I kept to myself, and then people started threatening me, and I'm not going to take any of that from easy difficulty NPC's, so they declared war on me and I fought them until the game ended. (Maybe this is why other Nations always think I'm a war monger... but I swear the other guys almost always starts it! ..I just finish it.)Gameplay: I've played Civilization Call to power, and I've played Civilization 4... Civilization 3 is different then both, but difficult to articulate how it's different... the game feels slower paced, I can't wage war as effectively by bombardment as I can in civ call to power or civ4.The game just hasn't clicked with me in the way Civ5 did immediately. the User interface has a serious case of the 2000's (by that, I mean overly complicated, overly difficult, rather confusing.)There are scenarios and tons of special mod or DLC packs which are included in Civ3. If you're looking to burn some time playing a strategy game, Civilization 3 can easily eat up that time with the crazy amounts of content it has.Conclusion: The dilemma I have with Civ3, is that I prefer Civ5, and Civ call to power... but that doesn't mean Civ3 is bad... it's quite good and chalk full of content. Especially for the low price... But while playing I just find myself thinking ""man, I'd rather be playing Civ5"".I think it's nice to have Civ3 as a backup for my laptop when I'm on trips, or for a new/old challenge. (It's a new challenge because I haven't played it as much, but it's an older game... BAH, don't think about it) "

												Still as good of a game as I remember it from my childhood, it's age shows a little, but for $5 (and potentially even less) it still provides that ""one more turn"" mentality. I probably sunk at least 200 hours into my local libraries copy, so when I saw it was on steam, it was a no brainer purchase.Having played Civ 5, I have to say that the portraits of the rulers convey far more emotion, at least in my eyes, than the full set pieces of Civ 5. The barbarians have multiple AI options and can be absolutly brutal. Certain civilzations have certain traits which affect what actions trigger golden ages. You get to upgrade your palace in a way that actually changes the way it looks on the city screen. Also there is a city screen where you get a detailed overview of your city and all the wonders you built. As opposed to Civ 5's jam packed 3D model of your city.Age helps, in a way, since with todays operating systems the turns are lightning fast, even with troop movement.I know I have my nostagia blinders on, but I really like this game, despite whatever flaws I cannot see. I suspect that anyone who likes these kinds of games and doesn't mind the lack of 4k graphics, will definitely get their money's worth. "

												Having been a Civilization player since Civnet (yes I am old) this game was a surprise to me when it was first released by infogames in 2000 mind you we had just seen a year of 3 civ games due to legal work arounds etc etc. those being Civilization: call to power (Don't recommend at all) Civilization II Test of Time (pretty much a upped graphics version of Sid Meier's Civilization II with additional scenarios which I still recommend) and Sid Meier's Alpha Centari (AMAZING GAME)but back to CIv III. The game was a nice upping the ante of Civ II and hitting all of its marks it aimed for including its amazing play the world expansion which allowed a relatively stable way to play multiplayer that CivNet tried and failed to do and Civilization II attempted with its Multiplayer gold expansion)While I have poured countless hours in to my Disk copy I haven't really touched it since mid way through the life span of Civ IV. but I do still get requests to play multiplayer so it still does have a decent following.10/10			"

												Man this game. This was the 3rd or 4th video game I ever played after Hotwheels MicroRacers and LegoRacers. I started playing it at 5 years old and dude, I spent so many hours on that Windows 98 playing this game.10/10 would get grounded again for this gamePros:-the fricking sounds, not only the soundtrack (which changes from era to era and man is it the best ambient music ever) but the sound effects are so percussionistic and beautiful too-the uncomparable depth to the game; the vast amount of different things you have to pay attention to and manage: most games require only a linear train of thought like hey shoot the bad guys, maintain your health, upgrade weapons. Not Civilizations. Build Cities, Create armies to protect and expand your empire, research technology, explore the world, fend off barbarians, build roads, find resources, build farms to speed up your city growth, build settlers to build new cities, I could go on for hours.-educational, yeah it is. As a young kid I learned about Samurai, the Immortal Guard of the Persians, The Hanging Gardens, The Great Lighthouse, Names of Leaders of Nations like Hannibal and Elizabeth, etc. Proof that games can be subtly educational-definitely best of the Civilization series, Civ IV was ok, religion was the only noticeably cool aspect. Civ V was better but the lack of stackable units and limited resources was a pain to get used to. Civ V did have nice expansions and I very enjoyed their City Defense aspect but Civ III had much simpler everything without giving up anything. XP, technology, interactions with other civs are a few of the things both III and V but III had it much simpler and efficient.Cons-um I guess it looks really old now and the highest resolution is really low lol.-i guess i could see it being hard to get into these games for many people due to how old it is now			"

												Are you looking for a Time sink?Here you are!This is a basic turned based Real Time Strategy game based around building a civilation from a tribal state to a modern age.The Charm of this game really comes from your opponates, how they'll mock you, or try to threaten you to give them what they want. You can completely civil, or you can be a thorn in everyone's side, which can get to the point of the entire planet trying to destroy you.A problem is that the mechanics can be confusing, heck it took me a solid three hours of reading to get a basic grasp on the game. but once you learn it, it's down, and it become second nature.Another problem, if you can call it one, is that this game will burn hours of your life without your consent, seriously, you will play 4 hours stright and swear it was maybe 30 minutes.8/10 PROS:Great RTS game playAged nicelygreat freedom to chooseCONS:Quite a few things to learn to even start playingWill sink hours without you knowing it.

												Absolutely amazing game. I've played all linear Civilization games save for Civ 2 and this has by far been my favourite. I really wish they didn't stray from the feel of the first 3 Civ games, I'm really not a fan of the feel of Civ 5, but alas the masses seem to disagree with me. I don't want the bland interface of the fourth and fifth games, I want character, and my loyal advisors to guide me.I don't want to set my political civic 'Police State' and my economic civic to 'Central Planning'; I don't want to take whatever 'social policy' tree (with permanent effects + no drawbacks) or adopt the 'Order' ideology.I want to use the 'Communism' government and have my advisors refer to me as 'Comrade' as I free to the proletariat of the world from the bourgeosie and the 'Fascist' Aztecs!The character of the game, the way events and history play out, managing your empire and waging war, etc. is simply really something and it really seems to have been lost with the new Civ games. And the sad thing is, it has so much potential for future games with more fleshed-out content, features, etc.Definite 9/10			"

												This game is everything I want out of the Civilization series. It's not too easy (unlike Civ 5), but not too hard, either. The graphics remind me of a map of an empire, as if you were the actual leader of an empire looking at a map of said empire (I love that effect by the way, it just gives that much more immersion). Also, do you think you've heard good video game music? Yeah, this game's OST is one of the best to be created. I love nuking the living hell out of every other nation while the Modern Era's awesome guitar music plays in the background. The only flaws I find are the amount of corruption in cities (it gets pretty high, but that's why the game has COURTHOUSES) and the fact that a spearman can kill a tank (but that could happen IRL, the spearman just has to shove its spear down the tank barrel).

												The game is price worthy.If you have alot of extra time on your hands, this game is for you.The music, although limited, is great.Scenarios are fun to play.I've played Civ III off steam alot, so the hours on the Sid Meiers games is actually quite inaccurate. I had bought Civ III previously off of steam- then I hoped that buying it off steam I could find other civ III fanatics who I could play with online. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find one. There are some things in Civ III that compare better than do civ II, III, IV, and V. Civ III has no cheating console- so you can't exatly put warriors all over the map and destroy everyone before they found their first city. This forces the player to actually play the game- it took me a little while to get used to it, about an hour or so, but eventually it got better, and I got used to the fact that I couldn't cheat and I actually had to play a fair game. This game tought me that cheating is less fun than is actually playing the game. I'd actually like to thank this game, because without it, I would have taken a while longer to realize cheating is not as fun as I thought.Also, friend me if you would like to play a little good game of Civ III sometime. ^			"

												The Steam edition of Civilization III does not work correctly on Windows 7, which kind of defeats the purpose I had in getting it to begin with. Unlike the retail CD version of the game from years ago, it installs without hassle. What it doesn't do without hassle is run correctly. Every time I've started a game, I've encountered audio bugs where the music stops and the sound effects run an in endless loop like crickets. Heaven forbid you ever try to quit the game, either, because it will not only crash, but lock up your entire monitor and not let task manager launch over it.If a game is going to be sold on steam, I expect some kind of work to be done to make it compatible with current operating systems. If Gog.com can do it, so can Valve.			"

												There pretty much isn't a bad game in this strategy franchise. The concept is simple: Pick your civ, play through history, win... But the execution is VERY complex. You win in different ways depending on which country you are and which does what. If you try to dominate the world as a civ that specializes in researching technology, Well you're gonna have a bad time. You could be doing amazing for a few hours and a few hundred turns into the game, but make one bad decision or one bad move and you could cripple your empire. This game has hours among hours of replayability and content, and it's relatively cheap. If you get it on sale it's dirt cheap.

												From a humble start, hunting and gathering and establishing a small town.To a vast empire, mighty armies, establishing diplomatic ties, building great wonder of time, and lunching a ship into deep space.Civ 3 is a great game, and has aged relatively well. The game can seem a little overwhelming for a new comer, but once learned can be played easily. It certainly brings me back.The combat system can cause problems. It’s based of attack and defense, so occasionally a unit with a weak defense will defeat a unit with a strong attack (spearman vs. tank and wins!).Overall a great game! Totally worth the price!   "

												I don't understand why modern game developers (and a large portion of modern gamers) are so hell-bent on graphical perfection at the expense of actual content. Part of the beauty of this game for me has always been its balance of graphics,  being easy to navigate, and its underlying mechanics. To me, this will always be the pinnacle of the Civilization series. I don't know how many hours of my life went into playing this game since I started out with the CD version before buying a copy on steam when I lost the orginal disc, but I doubt I'll find another game that can entertain me for as long as this one did.

												Prabally one of the best turn based games out there. I remember pleading to my father as a child to give up his computer for a few hours so that i could make the Roman Tanks slaughter Aztec pikemen. I must have had four to five hundred hours into that game. Now, i am 14, have my own computer, and the disk seems to not support Windows 10. I went to Humble Bundle and got this for $1.25 and it works almost perfectly. I did have a crash for a custom game, and when i finished a nine hour game at the congradulations screen it crashed, BUT it plays just fine all the rest. One of the best parts of this game is the World War 2 built in mod. It is really well done. If you have played any of the newer Civilization games and you want to see the earlier titles, go for this one. In my opinion Civ 3 is the best Civ game in the series, followed closely by Civ 4			"

												This is an amazing game. It's difficult to pick up, but once you understand how everything works, it comes together beautifully. The graphics aren't very good, but considering it was released in 2001, it's quite impressive. The music is not even as close to good as Civ 4, but it's still a very worthwhile game, especially if you only want to spend $5 instead of $30. The best part is, all the stratgies you used in one difficulty, may fail you in the next. There are also interesting scenarios, such as World War II in the Pacific. The game mechanics make everything so interesting. The game is well balanced, so you have to consider what each action you take may cost you. (Like nuking your neighbors.) If you want a cheap, good game that you can play for hours, Civ 3 is for you.			"

												13 years after it's original release, heavily outdated in every technical aspect, Civilization III manages to keep being a very challengenling and fun game to play. The premise of the game is the same as in the first title back in 1990: Control a civilization, manage every aspect of it such as economy, military, foreign relations, production, culture and take it to glory by dominating the world by whatever means you want (or can). Of course, graphics are very bad as per today standards, but those doesn't interfere with the game pace and point at all.This game stands the test of time, 8.5/10			"

												Prabally one of the best turn based games out there. I remember pleading to my father as a child to give up his computer for a few hours so that i could make the Roman Tanks slaughter Aztec pikemen. I must have had four to five hundred hours into that game. Now, i am 14, have my own computer, and the disk seems to not support Windows 10. I went to Humble Bundle and got this for $1.25 and it works almost perfectly. I did have a crash for a custom game, and when i finished a nine hour game at the congradulations screen it crashed, BUT it plays just fine all the rest. One of the best parts of this game is the World War 2 built in mod. It is really well done. If you have played any of the newer Civilization games and you want to see the earlier titles, go for this one. In my opinion Civ 3 is the best Civ game in the series, followed closely by Civ 4			"

												A fantastic game that I wanted on my new netbook but could not play my CD version on it due to the need for a disk to launch. I've been tempted to get this on steam for a while when it is on sale and finally decided to when a lot of people online claim to have it working on Windows 7 even though the page states it is not compatible (I have 7 32bit starter on my netbook). It seems to work without any issues for me though I cannot guarantee it works on all Windows 7 computers of course.			"

												If you like turn-based strategies you can't go wrong with Civ III, especially if your hardware can't handle new Civilization games or you just want to feel nostalgic.It's a great game that is playable even on new hardware, but if graphics are your priority you should probably check out Civ IV or V.Still, it definitely gets a thumbs up!

												So many many many years ago I played the first CIV game. I loved it. Barely understood it as I was too young but I loved it. Lost the game at some point and didn't play the other CIV games until I bought CIV4 during a Steam sale. While the graphics improved a lot from the first game I did not enjoy the game as much. It was rather simple and straight forward. So now during another sale I decided to buy CIV3 as a lot of people are saying it's the  best version. A few hours in and I have to say I like this one better then 4. The game is a bit more challenging even on easy mode and I am just having a fun time creating my own civilizations. That however doesn't mean there aren't any downsides. Some things do not make sense like older units being stronger then newer units. Then there is the little glitch that you will constantly be aware of and that is that it looks like the game is freezing at the end of every turn. It just freezes for a few seconds and then continues but it is a bit of a pain. So far I have no had it shut down on me completely like I am reading in other peoples reviews but who knows it might just happen at some point. Honestly for the money I paid for it I won't complain much. It would have cost me more to get the cd version though I wouldn't have the glitch. My opinion? Totally worth playing and if you don't mind waiting a few seconds at the end of every turn get the steam version. If you do then buy the cd version. Have a lot of fun with it! P.S. having the chance to build your own castle is something I missed in CIV 4 glad to see it in CIV 3 :)			"

												I understand, it's just not for me. When I was a child, I played this on and off constantly and never figuring out what I was doing. I played Diablo 2 around the same time and also didn't know what I was doing. This complicated empire micromanaging game is an old classic that many people remember, be it from watching one of your relatives playing or being that relative playing. You must manage large armies and cities while trying to expand your kingdom across the world. Disease, famine, civil unrest and poverty are just some of the factors you will have to deal with with trying to be the greatest empire. Doing things all the time is what will get you ahead, and failing over and over learning what does and doesn't work is the tutorial. Hardcore RTS is defined by the Civilization franchise.I never really understood this game and I still don't. I never really enjoyed micromanage games as they posed too much stress for me to correctly enjoy them. This is personal and won't sway the game itself. This game is for people who love watching massive amounts of action going on at the same time with rediculous difficulty options and really good customization for world generation. For being this old, it holds its complication and difficulty really well. If you love this kind of stuff, then it's a no brainer and if you have never heard of this or just faintly remember it from long ago, make sure you Youtube some videos to make sure its your type of game.It's not my kinda game, but it might be yours.Personal Rating 1/5			"

												This is my favorite civ game by far. Civ V is great and all, but my biggest complaint about it is that you can only have like 20 nukes tops. Civ III lets you have as many as you so desire. Plus, you get ICBMs (as many as you want)! Civ V doesn't let you have ICBMs. However, in Civ III, I've got ICBMs in at least 20-30 cities, tactical nukes everywhere, subs (with tacticals) spread all across the map targeting all coastal and inner coastal cities. I can start WWIII any time I want, and I can be sure that I will have no shortage of nukes. Plus just painting some island in that b, e, a, utiful orange coat is just a pleasure. Get Civ III, don't waiste your money on Civ V.			"

												All right. I got this game from a friend sometime around 2012, I think. I played it for a bit but honestly, I had trouble getting into it. A lot had changed from Civilization II and I never really caught on to all the differences.Picked it up during the Steam Black Friday sale on Thanksgiving. I gave it a whirl. At first, I had the same feelings I did last time I played all those years ago. It wasn't CivII, and the strategies that worked for me then were failing me now. It didn't help that there wasn't a tutorial or a manual of any kind, and the Civilopedia is not the most user-friendly interface, although it's critical to understanding all of the game mechanics the AI employs.I played on Chieftain for a while, just trying to get a handle on the game mechanics, but now I'm bored of chieftain. Too easy. Once you learn and begin to understand the game mechanics, this is a pretty great game. That said, it's virtually impossible to win if you don't constantly expand and build one city after another. I mean, that is all you will do. Build and build and build. If you don't, the AI will and you'll lose. Pretty much the only way to win is to begin building a ton of cities in the early parts of the game.I did like the implementation of cultural borders, and how borders clash against one another. The cultural conversion tool was also pretty cool, where cities could rebel and join your forces because they realized that their own culture was lifeless. So it's a pretty good game, and definitely worth the price for my 46 hours (and growing).I do have to say, though, that a couple of the leader choices are really dumb. Mahatma Gandhi was not a leader of the Indian nation. Although he championed the move for India's independence, making him the face of India is weird, because he was a guru and not a general. And Jeanne d'Arc leading the French? She was a teenager and a peasant who, by her own confession, never even used her sword in combat. They could have chosen Charlemagne or Napoleon Bonaparte, but Joan! Kinda silly!			"

The gameplay has a sharp learning curve and can be very simple or complicated depending on difficulty and what outcome you want to achieve.  You can destroy those that oppose you and wipe them from the face of the earth or you can be a man of peace.  It's up to you.  Compared the previous titles,  It has improved dramitically,  I have played some of the newer titles, have gone back to this one from time to time for a more simplistic gameplay.  Even if you own the newer titles honestly I would highly reccomend buying this one,  If you want a change of pace from the newer ones, or just want to see how things have changed.Like other Civ games be careful you don't Lose track of time, because sometimes  you can get lost in the empire building.

I've played Civ 5 - Brave New World for possibly thousands of hours, and i still go back to Civ 3, another game i've probably played for thousands of hours. Still highly addictive, incredibly difficult and a lot of fun. Very crude, in relation to the newer iterations of the game, but also, stripped for bull like annoying audio readings (""The meek shall inherit the earth but not it's mineral rights"" - yes, i've heard you before! - and what does that even mean?!). You still get a sense of a fully realized game by the end of each game, as is the same with other iterations.			"

												I didn't give this game a fair try back in the days when it was new.  The game was visually an improvement over Civ II, and the interface was actually functional.  I just felt the combat system was poorly done, diplomacy didn't feel right, and the game has a few design quirks.  Fast forward to now, I decided to buy the complete edition, which updates the game.  What I find now is a game that truly stands between the majesty of Civ II and Civ IV.  The Civ experience is there, and it's well represented.  The graphics haven't aged all that well, and the interface isn't as nice as the later games, but the gameplay remains classic Civ.  The complete edition adds the feature of customizing the game in ways never seen before or again in a Civ game, such as turning down (or up) AI aggression.  It is a good, cheaper entry into the world of Civ.			"

												Many believe this to be the best Civilization game in the series, and I have to agree. No other Civ has the same amount of sheer content as this one: From civs to leaders, buildings, wonders, scenarios, you name it. Also, the leader's personalities shine, and the diplomacy system is much deeper than in the newer iterations, you can basically tell Ghandi to go ♥♥♥♥ himself if he pisses you off. In general, the game is deeper than both its successors, but the tutorial does a good job of teaching you the basics. The rest can be learned through experience. The only thing that I feel could turn someone off is the graphics, which look a bit outdated by now, but if you're willing to look past the surface, hours upon hours of fun await.			"

I built towns, By towns I mean 2, I fought barbarians, I claimed my own mini island... From... Barbarians... , I mined mountains till they were hollow and my towns were rich with resource but...

												I bought this game because of my experience with the newer Civ 5 series. I thought that I could give it a try for the very low price. I am still on the fence about this game because of its learning curve but I do love this type of simulation genre. The AI  is impossible to please, yet they relentlessly want all they can take from you. I am not a fan of the save point & retry strategy but sometime you got to do what you got to do. Overall, if you're familiar with the Civilization Series try this game a very low price. If you aren't familiar try it at a very low price. FYI I bought this game for less than a dollar. Manuals the are more detailed than the game manual are online. The version I brought did not have an activated tutorial either. Cheers.			"

												Vincent Price's most helpful reviews: Sid Meier's Civilization III Complete. Civilization III (or Civ III for short) is an argricultural war simulator, in which you build wheat, farm iron, and thresh people in a significant battle over land and cities.Should you take too long to murder your foes, the game may decide to just let you win by saying you're so cultural that there's no way they can challenge you, and they automatically forefeit. Which is stupid, because a rich culture like that is not as likely to have the vast killing potential an uncultured brutish army nation would, but alas, not everything in life, or Civ, is logical.10/10 with a friend, 6/10 by yourself, 2/10 when you spend hours trying to port forward to get it to work properly on multiplayer. Recommended for people who want their lives consumed entirely.			"

												This game has, by far, taken more of time than any other.  In fact I am on my fourth, hopefully final, copy of it.  I orignally was gifted a 3 part CD version of the game from a neighbor who never was into computer games and did not want it.  I played CIV3 nonstop, I would sit in class fantasizing about the game, I would go to sleep dreaming about the game and I still to this day reminisce about specific games I had played close to ten years ago.  I was so hooked that my father took the discs and snapped them in half.  Months of stellar behavior later I managed to earn another copy on my birthday, which was quickly destroyed a month later due to an average of ten hours a day, and 16 hours on the weekend.  I was able to get another disc copy without my parents knowing but I could not control my addiction, causing them to find out about my new copy and promptly destorying it.  Now, able to do things on my own, I bought my latest version on steam for no other reason that I do not feel complete without knowing I have it.  Honestly, this game does not play as well as CIV5 but if you are looking for a changeup, buy it.			"

												As you proceed in this game if you haven't played a single Civ game before you might be like me aka wondering how to get gold so just start building cities really close to your starting city and don't allow your Civilization to get too many troops or it will lower your gold also recommend checking if you're on a island to see if you're all alone or their are others.

												I love this game because the theme the choice every move counts moving this one regular spearmen (while in the future tech research) here could effect the game nine turns later resulting in the fall of your country/nation so every choice counts and the maps you can play the units the ""mods"" (air qotations) or sonarios installed with the game adds research from the fan commitie when this game first game out and they were on websites so i give this game a 8.2/10			"
