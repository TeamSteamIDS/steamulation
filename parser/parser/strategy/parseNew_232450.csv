Early Access Review
								It's finally time to redo this review. After over three years of having this game positively reviewed, I just can't justify it anymore.You know those girls that are with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys that cheat on them all the time and don't have a job and are basically just terrible people, but the girl talks about how she loves him and she can change him and all her friends tell her she can do better but she just won't listen to them? You know what I'm talking about? Well, I've been in a three year relationship with SolForge and it's been terrible. I kept hoping it would get better. They kept telling me they were going to be better and they were going to fix everything wrong with our relationship. Even now, I'm going back through Kickstarter updates. ""Animated Card Preview!"" dated February 17th, 2013. ""Next Game button!"" dated October 1st, 2013. ""The future of SolForge including full release this fall"" dated May 2015. So many promises, so many hopes. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I wanted to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. And I waited... and I waited.Well, it came. A few weeks ago, we made it to the end of the rainbow. The new client which was supposed to be developed in a few months and ended up taking over a year dropped. But it wasn't a pot of gold. It was a steaming pot full of festering crap. So poor was the new client release that they basically had to do an ""Oops, can't put the rabbit back in the hat, so this week just won't count while we work out our server issues that we 'couldn't have anticipated.'"" Turned out to be a couple weeks, but they worked out their server issues and the game is now actually playable.So what did we get with the new client? Well, I mean I guess it works. A lot of functionality that was in the old client is now gone, such as the next game button, deck sorting when deck building or drafting, the game log now clears if you exit to menu and come back, you can't click on Solbind cards in the card text to see what he solbound card actually does... I mean, I guess the menus look pretty. But the rest is terrible. Like... really terrible. We got a new client that is slightly prettier, but is worse in basically every other way to the old client. Nice.But let's say that's all fine. Annoying, but fine. What is the actual gameplay like? Well, it too has gotten worse. Much worse. Now, to be perfectly honest, I've had a problem with certain RNG aspects of this game since the very beginning. I mean, it's a CCG so obviously RNG is going to factor into every game, but my problem is that this game frequently hands the game to one player or the other based completely on RNG. Again, I understand that happens sometimes in CCGs, but it seems far too frequent when I look back at a game and realize that there is absolutely nothing I could have done to pull out a win because my opponent drew all his leveled cards and I drew none of mine. Now I said things have gotten worse and everything I've just talked about have been a part of the game since day 1, so what exactly has gotten worse about RNG? Well... it's how many cards are ""I win"" or ""I lose"" based purely on RNG. In alpha, there was Everflame Phoenix. It was a very polarizing card due to the pure RNG aspect of it but even then, it wasn't a straight out ""I win."" Now, there is Othra which features the exact same infuriating mechanic and really, the exact same card design (huge level 1, useless level 2 that can flip on 2.4 into a game-winning level 3) which is like Everflame Phoenix only significantly more powerful. It's the power-creep version of the same card. The thing is, they keep making more and more cards that are incredibly good based on RNG. In the newest set, Indomitable Fiend is an amazing RNG card. The whole concept of the card is that you can't really direct what lane it ends up in, but it's so powerful you don't really care. In fact, I'm playing an Indomitable Fiend deck right now because it's so powerful, but the thing is I don't really have to play it. The deck plays itself. If I draw Indomitable Fiend into multiple Immortal Echoes, I win. Otherwise, I lose. The actual decision making in the deck is barely a decision most of the time. And the reason I'm playing this braindead deck is that it's actually one of the most powerful decks playable, which I think really gets to the underlying problem with this whole game. For several iterations and several expansions, SolForge is slowly stepping away from decision making and interactivity and more toward purely RNG based games from start to finish. Players have talked about this and written articles about it for a long time, but it doesn't seem like it's by mistake at this point.And finally there's the power creep. Now you could argue that cards are constantly being rebalanced, new cards are being tuned down and old cards are being tuned up, but the thing is... every new expansion has at least one or two cards that are clearly overpowered. Every time. Sure, after a month or two they tune them down, but I don't think it's a mistake that they come out of the gate overpowered. It encourages players to spend money to buy cards in the new set if they want to be competitive until the obviously overpowered cards are finally tuned down. Coincidentally, it's usually shortly after their forging costs have been reduced.So after my three year abusive relationship... SolForge... I'm breaking up with you. I'm tired. I'm tired of your crap. I'm tired of your broken promises, broken clients, and broken game. I'm tired of being frustrated about losing games that I never had any chance of winning. I'm tired of winning games that I never actually had to make a decision from start to finish. I'm tired of ""alternate art"" cards that are just recolored versions of the old cards. I'm tired of a mobile client that hasn't worked in over a year despite it working initially. I'm tired of seeing cards that are stupidly overpowered every single expansion when you can't not realize how overpowered those cards are. I'm over it. I trusted you, I backed you, and you failed me.			"

												Do not play this game. The devs completely ruined it with a new client undated. As you can see I have many hours of play under the hood and I can assure you its now a big pile of crap. In order to make the new client possible the devs had to remove more then 60% of the game feature. They are really amateurish and unprofessional they can't even change screen shots on the store page that are misleading. The true release was the 6/3/2016 but it took 2 months for the devs to remove the EA tag....			"

								SolForge beta had grown to become one of the games I most enjoyed.  And I'd been eagerly awaiting the full release for a while.What did I expect?* Some bugs removed.* A way to manually sort decks.  It used to auto-sort A-Z, so you had to number your decks to sort any other way.* Better card search options.  Especially across levels.  That is, you were only able to search for the wordings on the level 1 versions of cards.  This meant you couldn't search for, for example, the cards that are 'free' at level 2 or 3, because those cards have no text at level 1.* Larger 'at a glance' cards or an option for at a glance text overlays, so you could easily read what several cards do, side by side.What did I hope for but not really expect?* Extra stats for cards.  Especially stats for which decks they're used in.  I love having multiple decks (essential for solo play), with as much variety as possible across decks.  Ideally, I like each deck to have entirely different cards from each other deck.  This is almost impossible if you have 10 or more decks, because there's no way to remember which of the hundreds of cards you've already used in another deck.* More solo options.  At the very least, developer designed decks to play against (some of which could be based on previous community decks or tournament winning decks).* Better AI.What did we actually get?NONE of either my hopes or expectations.  In fact, quite the opposite in most cases:* Loss of even the automatic A-Z sorting.  So now my decks are just a random jumble.* Loss of the ability to even VIEW the level 2 or higher versions of cards at a glance.  So now you can't even skim across the cards to try to spot which are, for example, 'free'.  You have to click on each, one by one... yeah, through hundreds of cards.* Not that that point matters now, because in addition to that, the text has been removed from the cards entirely.  The only way to see the text is to click on them and have a pop-up tell you what it says.  So there is now no way to compare cards at a glance.* AND the cards are actually SMALLER!  Most of the screen space has been given over to the background/playmat, with the cards as tiny, shrunken little things in a small section in the middle!* The random deck options and 'quick play' option for solo battles have both been removed.  Now the only solo option is to choose two of your own decks, one to play with and one to play against.  Not nearly as fun as randomised choices.On top of all that:* MORE bugs, not less.* Slow loading times.* Slow in other ways too (eg. it goes through a series of mini-freezes when opening new packs)* Multiple other problems just for iPad versions, that aren't a problem on PC (eg. right-click options; and scrolling that doesn't work).So... what was it all for then?* Shiny silver background.* New card format.  Shiny, sci-fi style.  Bright lines around the edges.  (All negatives for me: The sci-fi style doesn't suit the more fantasy oriented setting.  The bright lines distract from the art.)* Over the top special effects, like packs blowing up instead of opening; and the whole deck flying around the screen when it's time to level up.In sum, the only 'improvements' are all flash and no substance; the game is now frustrating on PC, almost unplayable on iPad, and certainly unplayable on anything smaller than a standard sized iPad.  Major disappointment, for a game with so much promise.			"

												Solforge was an amazing game. The mechanics remain awesome, but all the features that made it worth playing instead of something else are gone. 1650 hours on record, and if the UI stays this way, that number will not be going up. I played it because it was both mechanically awesome AND streamlined, easy, and fun to play. I could previously play multiple matches at once, while having a match against a friend in another country going for a whole week. The UI used to help you pay attention to all of the important parts of the, now it's flashy and slow. Mechanics: 8/10 The mechanics in this game remain awesome.  Cards that level within each match, cards that scale with your rank as it increases within each match, single-use cards, as well as the usual gamut of keywords. Playability: 2/10 Recent game patch (Summer 2016) resulted in a massively reduced playability in the game. Features lostAbility to play untimed games (such as with friends, over hours or days)Ability to view library as a text-based list of cards (must use picture-based now)""Next Game"" button (while not directly restricting you from playing multiple matches, this change made it Quality of Life DowngradesMassively slow changes from match list to match to deck builder to store. This game used to have the quickest, most streamlined UI. Now there's loading animations for everything. The amount of space the cards take up in a match on your screen was reduced. The formerly prominent art is now much smaller and less striking.			"

								Coming from a long time MTG Player and Hearthstone player I really enjoy this game. I got turned on to it because I found out a long time MTG pro named Brian Kibler was one of the driving forces of this game. This game seems to be one of the best games to limit the amount of randomness that can happen in games that have a resource system. You get to play 2 cards a turn (as long as they have targets when applicable), discard your hand at end of turn and draw 5 again. Whenever you play a card a leveled up version goes into your discard pile which gets reshuffled into your deck every 4 turns. So there's a neat strategy in which cards you play and when. Most cards have 3 different levels (with some having 4 and some that are just 1 but that get buffed based on what turn it is). All combat takes place in lanes (5 of them) which creates some interesting strategy.You can buy packs and gold in the game but you don't have to. You only need to win 3 games a day to get all the special bonuses (which include packs/cards and silver) and you also get tickets for tournaments. My favorite game mode is there version of draft. You start off with 6 cards that are figured out based on a logarithm of which cards get picked higher. No waiting on other players to choose their cards as yours are all generated just for you. It's a nice approximation of a traditional magic drafting but without having to get 8 players gathered and without waiting for others to choose their cards,			"

								Lazy game design, rather little skill compared to other CCGs.Edit: I'll go further into detail as to why I don't support the game anymore. The company behind it is rather high on themselves because they had a few big names behind their game, and so they charge outrageous prices for things, and have little value for customers because the entire game was kickstarted, meaning all of the money they make afterwards is more or less entirely profit due to the low maintenance cost of digital card games, and most of it being data being pulled from a database. They don't do any form of maintenance between large updates. Most games have a weekly downtime for a few hours to fix bugs, and add improvements to interfaces, or make the game flow more smoothly, not this. They only update when they have content that they can monetize, such as a new handful of cards, which leaves existing bugs present in the game for months. They have a difficult time managing the iPad version with the PC version, and both appear to be neglected at times because of it, though personally I can not speak for the mobile (phone) version. They had closed beta last for the better part of 8 months, the first six of which involved literally nothing for the player, you had the same demo decks for six months. It was technically longer than that, since it came out shortly before Christmas, but i'll round down because I don't have the exact dates, and frankly don't care enough to get them. Then, in the summer following the closed beta, they come out with their first set of cards, and go into open beta, but they give a brief window of just a few days for any of the closed beta participants and kickstarter backers to spend their store credit after having nothing to do with it for the past six months, and post it in an obscure section of their forums to even announce that it was happening. Nothing on steam, nothing in the client, nothing in the announcement section of their forums, and nothing on their homepage of their website. They did announce it on twitter once or twice, though. So if they happened to be the only people you follow, you may have seen it after having no reason to look at their page for six months. Personally, I chose to read that as trying to squeeze what value they could out of even the players who backed them before the game was even a demo, but read what you will into it.Gameplay: If you have ever played Magic: The Gathering before, this game is incredibly simple to pick up. The mechanics in the game are outrageously simple; and many of them actually exist in Magic under other names. That being said, imagine one of the game rules in Magic being changed so that a Wheel of Fortune was cast every turn. All of the multiple-turn decision trees, and all of the long-term strategy would be removed; and that is exactly what SolForge did. You get a new hand every turn, and with no resource system, you are instead limited to how many cards per turn you can play (two, aside from a few cards enabling other cards to be free here and there, but two is the default by game rules). So you have a hand of five cards, and can play two of them, every turn, forever. With a new hand every turn. Which basically equates to you have five cards to choose from, but the game state usually dictates which of them are the best to play (if you're behind on board, or if your opponent has a creature you have to kill or you lose, that sort of thing) which leads to very few decisions actually being made by the player. Early game, of course, you have the options of what cards to play in order to level them, sure. But you have a relatively high chance of never seeing the leveled version when it matters again, which happens far more frequently than you'd think.What the mechanics equate to, at this point is: Level your important cards, and level answers to your opponent's important cards. If you draw your answers to your opponent's cards, while they don't draw answer's to your cards, you win. The opposite is true, as well of course, but it creates for very little interesting gameplay, without ever having any complex board states, or very many things you can due since you can (almost) always only play two cards per turn. All of that being said, I didn't mention their failure to balance anything outside of a large update, and even then, there is rather little of it going on. They don't do any balance changes until they have their large updates (which has averaged once every four months or so, thus far). Which means if something is overpowered, it is overpowered for a while. And if something is garbage and unplayable, it is that way for a while. The game is stagnant, and in a bad place, and it won't get better for a very, very long time, if at all. They couldn't even balance for draft, as everyone who has drafted more than twice can tell you exactly what the best factions are in order, and what cards among them matter. And once you know what cards you have to draft to win, it boils down to who draws what cards, and when they draw them. There is no concept of: ""First turn, i'll play Dude A, and then the next turn i'll play Dude B that goes really well with Dude A"" because you have a high chance of not even drawing Dude B, and in the next combat phase, Dude A is dead. And then you have the lazy game design. All sorts of RNG where it really isn't needed. Not just in the Wheel of Fortune every turn. Not just in whether or not you drew a leveled version of a card. It is a huge factor in draft, as you aren't guaranteed any cards of any specific rarity, and once you choose two factions, you have no say in what you get beyond that. It gets even worse; though, because they have it literally invade their cards. There are currently 10 cards that have built-in randomized effects (random amount of damage, random movement, etc); which to me, is just lazy design. And that's not counting cards that only have things happen at certain times (upon leveling, for example) which is - in a way - pseudo RNG in the sense of it's much stronger on certain turns than others (An example of this would be one card that if you draw it the turn before you level, you can play it and have it end the turn with twice as much attack and health as on any other turn). Even better games implement some RNG on their cards, Magic for example has cards like Mana Clash, but the percentage of the total card pool is much lower, and it is almost never on very relevant cards (due to the whole future future league testing a set for two years before it's released publically). All in all, the game itself is okay. But if you play it as strictly free-to-play, you're going to have a highly negative experience, as there is no built-in way for you to not be paired up against someone who has played for over a year and has every card, as opposed to you with just starter cards. And if you play against their AI, you miss out on the most relevant reward for the daily system, which is only given for an online win. All in all, I can't very well advise anyone to get into this game. There are better alternatives for your money and time, but this is just one person's opinion.			"

								This could really be a great game if not for some pretty major issues. I'm not talking technical issues either (allthough it has those), I'm talking major design flaws in the game itself. I've been playing Solforge for some time now, over 200 hours so far, and while this game has the usual balance issues, and other minor technicalities associated with an early release game, the real killer (and why i no longer play) is the rediculous tedium of having to wait...and wait....and wait...and wait some more just to take each of your turns. For some ungodly reason your given 20 min per game each for a total of 40 min, but no time limit on each individual move, so you find yourself quite often que'ing for a game, about 20-40 sec, loading the game screen, about 5-10 sec, THEN STARING AT YOUR MONITOR FOR LITERALLY 15 MINUTES WHILE YOU WAIT FOR YOUR OPONENT TO MAKE THEIR FIRST MOVE!!! But here's the real pinch, the game also allows you to create what seems to be an unlimited amount of games running at the same time. So not only do you get people who enjoy letting the timer run from 20 min down to 3 min before they make their first move, or people who ""give up"" by simply moving to another game and letting what remains of their 20 min timer run to 0, but you also have to contend with the fact that in 95% of all Solforge games, your opponent will without a doubt have at least 3-4, maybe even 7-8 other games running at the same time, which means while your making moves in 10-20 seconds, your opponent is take 4-5 minutes per move because they're jumping from game to game, and not actually even in your game looking at the same screen you are. This to me is a MAJOR design flaw, and a source of a lot of complaint and debate on the Solforge forums. When you actually get lucky, and happen across another player who seems to only have the one game open like you, and moves are happening in usually less than 30 seconds or so, then the game is actually quite fluid and enjoyable, to the extent I'd even spend real money on it to bolster my collection and ""finish off"" a few of my decks. But as it stands you spend far to much time doing nothing but staring and waiting. Not cool. In fact its just plain boring and quite frustrating. The Dev's say the official release is on the horizon, and i pray they dont leave the game the way it is, because the ""influx of people"" they're hope'ing for wont stay for long i can assure you. Which would be a real shame, this could be such a great little game, but for now, ill be off playing something else.			"

												The developers of this game are simply awful. Some of the worst around. SolForge was released on Steam in March of 2013 as an Early Access title and its current development status is still very close to what it was back then, despite the newly released client. There is usually only one update per year. Sometimes two updates per year if we're lucky and those updates improve very little to not at all. The developers care more about releasing new cards than patching and fixing the game client and user interface, which is currently unusable. Due to the developers' decisions and unbelievably slow progress, the playerbase has been getting smaller and smaller. The death of this game is near and the developers have practically abandoned any prospect of a positive future as the updates come rarely, slowly, and completely lacking in improvements.The June 2016 client update is the most dysfunctional, broken, worthless piece of trash I have ever used on Steam, or likely anywhere. The developers (if they can even be referred to as such) took the original, terrible client and exchanged it for something that is far worse and much less usable. There are even less features now in comparison to before. Many of the basic functions no longer work or no longer exist. Now the player is limited to one single game at a time, and challenge requests mostly do not work. Yes, you read that correctly. Challenge requests sent to friends simply do not work. You send a challenge request and the friend will never receive it, no matter how many times you cancel it and resend. I have personally opened various support tickets reporting this serious problem, and in response have received the equivalent of shrugs and brush-offs, with the developers never actually addressing or resolving the issue. Also, they have downsized the amount of all rewards. These are a few of the many, many, many, problems, and I assure you that the game is nearly unplayable, which makes it useless. In its current state, SolForge should absolutely not exist.On July 25th 2016, these shameless, repugnant, crooked, corrupt, fraudulent, deceptive developers had the audacity to release this valueless, defective abortion out of Early Access, being completely aware of its nonworking status, which I consider to be a criminal act belonging in a court of law.Don't be like me. Don't waste your time and money on a product that has been developed like garbage by despicable developers who couldn't care less. These developers should suffer the dire consequences for failing to provide their paying customers with a usable product. These cretins do not deserve your attention, they do not deserve your money, and they surely do not deserve to function as a company. This disgusting attempt at game development should be grounds for immediate refunds to all customers. Do not let these scammers get away with deceiving and defecating all over their playerbase. These crooks should be unemployed and they should feel permanent shame for ever accepting and keeping money from people for SolForge. This is effectively fraud against paying players. Either they release a playable, usable version of the game, or shut it down immediately. These rip-off artists took money and did not release the game that was intended, let alone release a working piece of software. The thieving people behind SolForge are incompetent, careless, and dishonest. Enough is enough. These lowlives have been allowed to lie and steal for too long. The titles of ""developers"" and ""human beings"" do not apply to them.SolForge is a disaster.			"

												Edit: Game finally died, sadly. Servers are going offline 31 Jan 2017.What was once one of the best collectible card games around is now unplayable by any but the most hard-core.Somehow, after over a year in development, the devs have now launched a client that is more resource heavy, less intuitive, less informative, more cluttered, more laggy and with smaller cards than its predecessor. And I say this based on the ‘fixed’ version of the client after the initial network issues that made the game literally unplayable after the initial client launch.Even more problematic, the game is now weighed heavily against new players. Draft mode is nearly impossible as players with high levels of skill or drafting luck can stay in the draft and be matched in games against seven other players, while people with poor draws or less than expert skill are knocked out after two games, for trivial rewards.Prior to the June 2016 update there were plenty of ways for new players to build up a collection - you could play against the computer to get dailies, and practice, and you could play draft mode and get a bunch of free cards against equally matched players, and perhaps score a couple of reward packs as well along the way.It’s no longer possible to play against the AI to get your dailies, which means that one is stuck grinding against established players in the hope of scoring a few lucky wins.The interface is also impenetrable to newbies. Cards are just pictures now, with their abilities only available via right click popups and tooltips. The cards are also much smaller with much less information available at a quick glance.The game is overwhelmed with unnecessary animation, including throwing a giant card in your face with every play that isn't even the card actually being played, but the upgraded version that might not see any action for several rounds, if ever.Finally, the new interface is clunky, with lots of actions now requiring several clicks that could previously have been smoothly and intuitively made by dragging cards in a single motion.About the only thing one can say in the game's favour at this time is that it finally(!) introduced a turn timber, addressing the only major problem with the old client.Seriously, the June update is nothing less than a complete disaster and I can't recommend the game now to anyone, new player or veteran. Frankly, given the resources already invested in the new client, there's no prospect of the devs releasing anything more acceptable any time soon, and sadly, this update is pretty strong evidence that they wouldn't know what to do even if the opportunity presented itself.Further, player numbers, which had already seen a dramatic decline over the last 6-9 months, have now gone into freefall. This means that even more than intended by the dev's design decisions, you're pretty much only going to find the hardest of hard-core players left to play against. It’s also hard to imagine that there’ll be any significant funds being generated by the game from this point on that might enable the devs to continue funding updates now the revenue base has been trashed.

												game is terrible if you don't drop a lot of money on it. i used to play a long time ago when things were different. i built a nice collection without spending money and was competitive the whole time. it was fun. now i tried playing with my old cards, but they are extremely weak compared to the cards now. and i tried opening a new account but i never get paired with other new people. don't waste your time here			"

Early Access Review
								The game has now moved to the new Unity client, and terrible timer begone! Currently the game is in 'free mode' (cheap ingame currency purchases, no real money purchases allowed, rollback after a certain point). After that rollback and some time with the game, I will revise my review posthaste.---SolForge is a digital collectible card game created by Stone Blade Entertainment, prior Gary Games and creators of Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer. Taking experience from their previous game and Richard Garfield's work on Spectromancer, SolForge has the same kind of fluidity of a deckbuilder (though not the main construction mechanic) and combines it with lane based combat. What results is a fairly decent game; proper planning and foresight is required to secure the game. There's no traditional resource system, and instead players must manage a limited amount of card plays each turn to both gain control of the board and level up their cards for later turns. It's a unique mechanic that takes fair use of the digital space, and although it's not readily intuitive it offers a lot of flexibility in card design and deckbuilding, as not all cards are equal at all levels.The system itself is problematic in a number of ways, though. Each player's hand consists of a new set of five cards each turn. Fresh hands each turn are nice, but occasionally you can get a raw deal that breaks the rest of the game (the dreaded five spell hand). Further more, even with a thirty card deck, you only see about twenty cards per rank (every four turns), meaning you can end up missing key cards that need to be leveled. Drawing leveled cards on the rank is required; especially at rank 3 and beyond, leveled cards are drastically superior to their lower leveled counterparts, even where cards are designed to be low-level monsters. It's a flaw adapted from Ascension's design of first come first served powerhouses. It's not serving of a strategic game to have such drastic swings in ability due to chance, and though it usually isn't the norm to draw a stinky hand in a well constructed deck, when a player draws a perfect or perfectly trash hand, the effects are felt for the rest of the game.Outside of the gameplay itself are a myriad of other problems, mostly rooted in its initial offering as a mobile formatted game. There's no right clicking anything: Every interaction is done through a series of clicks and drags. Sometimes those 'gestures' change between screens: Double clicking to zoom in game would instead add or remove cards in the deck builder. Elements of the game lag, as if the client does no work in handling gameplay. It's poor optimization all around, and has been around since the very beginning, and this game has been in development for quite some time. Worse yet, and quite possibly the most sinister flaw to ever be unaddressed is the in-game timers for each player. Instead of going with a sensible, scalable turn timer, each player gets 20 minutes minimum to take all their turns.Expect every win to cost you 15 minutes of your life. There is no end to how many times this is abused outside of moderated events.No game of SolForge ever legitimately takes the entireity of a player's clock, and of course the whole reason the clock still exists to this day is not only poor optimization burning away seconds just to execute one of your two card plays (and god forbid if you can do other things in a turn), but is voraciously defended because of the game's mobile roots, to allow players on poor connections to enjoy the game, or so it is justified. No other card game, to my knowledge, no matter how complex it is, uses a death timer over flexible turn timers. This flaw alone, that you're constantly playing chicken with trolls over the clock's function, ruins any sense of reward and competition the game brings. The multiplayer component, core to the dueling card game experience, is completely obviated by a dumb design decision. Any other space, any other game would punish you if you simply got up and walked away from it to waste the time of other players. You'd likely get banned over unsporting conduct.. SolForge never discourages it. It's the other player's burden to bear.The clock is in fact the core reason I do not recommend SolForge. Everything else is overlookable. The interface isn't good at all, but it is borderline functional at least. Getting a bad turn ruins the game, but that's simply what you buy into with these kinds of games. Nobody should have to monitor a game where nothing is going on for fifteen minutes just to declare victory. It's a poor point in the game that the developers have overlooked, an inconvenient problem for them that they'll never address, and it'll bleed out their playerbase down to the patient saints and the sinner provocateur. It has lost me, and I'm saddened to have lost the experience of this game to this albatross hung ceremoniously around SolForge's neck.			"

								SHORT VERSION:Solforge is way deeper than Hearthstone, way easier to play without spending any money, and more fun/rewarding imo.Strongly recommend.-----------------------------------------------LONG VERSION:I'm going to compare Solforge to other card games I have played.So first of all, I would like to start out saying that I was seriously into playing Magic the Gathering until Ravnica (the first one, not return) rotated out of standard and all the money I had invested in dual lands was worthless. I ended up just playing proxy decks with my friends, but no longer showed up to tournaments/etc. Magic the Gathering is just way too expensive to play, as the cards rotate out of standard too quickly. Extended/Modern is even more expensive to play if you don't already have the cards from when they were in the Standard rotation.So then Hearthstone came out, and I started playing it. Had no cards so I was playing zoolock/hunter (when uth was broken). Nax came out and I didn't wana spend 20 dollars on it, so my decks stopped being competitive and I quit for about three months. GVG came out, bought packs with gold i had saved up. Still wasn't competitive. Decided to buy Nax for 20 bucks. Turns out Sludge Belcher/Loatheb win games. Also mad scientist pretty much needed in every hunter/most mage decks. Then Blackrock Mountain came out. I haven't bought that one because i don't think it brings anything to the table besides Thaurissan/Flamewaker/Quickshot. I have a pretty good set of legendaries and have fun playing the game, but that is only cos I sank a lot of time into it since it came out of beta. Everytime I try to get a friend to play it, they get turned away by the inability to acquire cards for free. The quests require you to win games, which is really hard with the starter cards, and you will only get a pack every 2-3 days assuming you do the quests. The arena, at 150 gold, is prohibitively expensive for new players, and since theyre inexperienced they usually go 0-3. You don't get to keep the cards either.Now to solforge. I started playing this game a couple of days ago and I have to say it's great. A lot of the card abilities seem to be Magic abilities with a name change, but that's fine. What is great is the ability to be able to play it for free. Completely for free. You get a pack just for logging on every day. You get another pack after three wins every, which can be against the computer. Free packs for no reason.But card packs aren't what make this game, it's the drafts. To get into a draft you need 3 event tickets. You get an event ticket for your first online win of the day, every day. That means you have to beat a guy, but you will probably get wrecked if you're a new player with no cards who hasn't mastered the game yet. What I recommend is you make a second account, and every day you make the accounts play each other and get an event ticket on each. That way you can draft 2 out of every 3 days (one day on one account, the next on the other).The drafts are like in Magic. You open a pack, pick a card, then the computer passes you their pack, which is now missing a card. Maybe I'm biased because of my Magic experience, but I much prefer this to Hearthstone's ""pick one out of 3 cards"" method. Anyway, you get to keep all the cards that you draft, so it's really easy to build your collection.The first few drafts I played were stomps. I went 0-4 multiple times, but it is nowhere nearly as frustrating as the first few arena fails in Hearthstone because you keep the cards. You also get 3 card packs for going 0-4. The game is extremely friendly towards new players.Assuming draft is not for you and you want to play constructed, you can just go to solforgeladder.com and sign up for the unheroic ladder. This means that you play against other people using only commons or rares, no heroic or legendary cards. Commons or rares are very cheap to craft. I was able to craft an unheroic netdeck on my third day of playing just from the login rewards. Of course, I still got destroyed because I wasn't used to the game mechanics yet, but at least I knew that it was my fault and not the fault of my poor cards. Losing mirror matchups in unheroic ladder made me realize ways in which I could improve my play, which ended up boosting my draft win rate.Solforge is truly a free to play game. Way more accessible than Magic/Hearthstone-Paper card games like Magic are definitely pay to win and prohibitively expensive. -Hearthstone isn't really free to play due to the single player adventures, which require you to shell out cash. You can be competitive if you grind Hearthstone without spending money, but you would have to be some sort of arena wizard or grind quests for months.CONS OF SOLFORGE-the client is ugly. super ugly. Hearthstone is extremely beautiful in comparison.-Some mechanics are ripoffs from Magic-The unheroic ladder has long queue times unless its nighttime in the US-There are like five people total who play this game (draft queue times are almost instantaneous though)Still, greatly recommended over Hearthstone. Really don't understand why this game is so shunned.			"

								I backed the game and when the first version came out it looked promising but even then I did not like the random buy aspect (I gladly pay for card packs, expansions etc as long as they are not random. Like the Living Card Games from FFG). Also it was slow and buggy so I left it and forgot about it.Now I received mail that they are giving free gold to people who were there from the beginning. They mad it sound like they are giving away a huge ammount of real money. Really??? You get 1500 gold (5$ or so) and you can't even buy a card pack from it. By the way there is only one card pack? For most of the things you need real money and they are too expensive and with in game money you can't get anything.Do not recommend it. A shame because it's a Richard Garfield design and could be fun.			"

								Terrible game.  It litteraly has the worst campaign I've ever seen.  Complete nonsense AI decks that just kick the crap out of your starter decks so that you have to go to the store and buy packs to beat them.  Yes, if you bang your head against the wall enogh times you eventually get through, but the experience is ridiculous and furstrating.  Playing vs players is no better when you're new.  All of the opponents have ridiculous decks that will just smash you and you get nothing for playing if you don't win.  There are FAR better digital card games out there than this utter rubbish of a game.			"

								First of all I would like to say that I'm in a grey zone if I like this game or not.The Drafts/Tournaments are super fun while the regular vs-mode is ""meh"", and if you plan to play a lot of drafts this game will probably require money.I would also like to point out some of the reviews I've seen here. Some reviews claim this game is pay to win. It is not. If you think about it any TCG is ""pay to win"" at the start. You should never start playing a TCG with the belief that you're going to be on par with players that have played several weeks more than you, it doesn't work that way. This is the nature of any TCG. You can't believe that you will be able to beat any player with more experience and invested time than you in any TCG with your starter pack. Be it an IRL TCG or a computer TCG.Let's compare SolForge to some other TCG's like Hearthstone and Scrolls. In all these three games you can pay real money for booster packs. Does that make them pay to win? Well, maybe. But let's compare them to some IRL TCG's... NO WAY! You pay MONEY for CARDS that may or may not be better than mine!?!?!++ PAY TO WIN!!! PAY TO WIN!!! You see how silly this becomes? Yes, a core element in a TCG is that it IS pay to win. But in all the TCG's I mentioned above there is the option to ""grind"" for in-game gold that you can buy cards for, and doing casual drafts in SolForge will surely get you started!Another complain I've seen is that some reviews claim RNG is a major part of SolForge. I'm baffled.In SolForge you play with a deck with 30 cards. You are allowed to have 3 copies of a single card. This means that you could make a deck of just 10 separate cards (such constistency!). In SolForge you discard your hand (5 cards) and draw a new hand every turn (in which you may play 2 of them). This means that you in theory can go through one copy of each of your cards in just two turns, and there are a lot of cards with good synergy!Compare this to Hearthstone. You can have 2 copies of a single card and a maximum of 30 cards. This means 15 different cards in your deck, minimum! You can also only draw one card every turn (with some exceptions). This means that you would need atleast 15 turns to go through each separate card in your deck.It does not take a math genius to tell the difference between 2 and 15...Except from this the whole ""So much RNG""-point is strange since RNG is a core element in any TCG. Some TCGs have more and others less.TLDR; Do not listen to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviews, try the game because you may or may not like it.			"

												At this point, I can no longer reccomend the game, which is a real pity, because i've been playing since the kickstarter. Almost every single card that is remotly playable is the highest rarity, the UI rework has been a disaster( bring back the next game button), and there are a whole host of other bugs. In MTG terms, at least 70% of every competitive deck is mythic rare. The game is very much /not/ free to play. To get the free rewards, you need to WIN online games at this point, which is basically impossible for new players, who cant compete with the legendaries of established players. The core game is really neat, don't get me wrong, but the rarity thing is really murdering it.			"

												Terrible. Was fun back when there were only one or two sets, but now that its had some time to grow the power creap has gotten out of control, and half the new super rare cards are so broken that you HAVE to spend money to buy them if you want to even have a remote chance of winning. The pricing used to be fair toward free-to-play players as well. Back in the day you could spend silver, which is won by winning X matches or recycling your extra cards, on both draft tickets and relatively inexpensive cards. I was even able to build a few reasonably competative decks by just playing daily and doing reasonably well. Now, you can barely afford a single rare card after a week or two of playing, and you can only get draft ticekts by winning all the time. They made it so you have to spend money if you want to play the game, especially if youre just starting out.Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. As others have mentioned, the RNG of this game is out of control, and half the time you win or lose based entirely on a roll of the dice. Its not fun, its not exciting, and you have little influence at all.			"

								SolForge is a F2P (don't stop reading, trust me) trading card game. It sets itself apart by being made by ex Magic and by having a unique take on things. As an example. You have some lanes and each card can take up one lane.  Once that card is in the lane, you cannot move it (unless it has movement) until it is destroyed.It is unique in that sense. The game revolves around a hand of 30 cards, cards come out each turn and stay for the duration of the turn. You have no mana costs so you can throw down any card in your current hand in any free lane (or no lane depending if it is a spell card (up to 2 cards per turn)). But each card does have a level. As you level up, so do your cards. And each level makes them stronger.As said it is F2P, so you'll be expecting the costs of the game. Well there really isn't any. You can play and enjoy the game ""as is"". Each day you login, you get free silver and a free booster pack of cards. You can spend silver to get boosters or misc items. And if you really start to feel the vibe, you can lay down some actual money on gold. Which is not needed to enjoy the game. I have been playing for a few hours and I have to say, I log in each day, and claim 3 victories against the computer for my goodies and enjoy every minute of it.Enjoy the game for what it is, a F2P game that wont rip your purse from you.

												I was in the Kickstarter, spent an unholy amount of money chasing the latest power cards, and I no longer play. I think that's a pretty solid summary. If you decide to play it anyway, be aware that it's very Freemium once you get started, you'll need to drop 50-100$ quarterly to compete at any serious level, and possibly much more than that if you want to win consistently. The new UI is also pretty terrible, but if you're new you won't see what's missing.			"

												*Edit after 3 years (~1100 hours playtime)Well spent 1000 hours. Was such a great game with the best Art Style in the market.Thanks for everything.* Edit after 4 months (~250 hours playtime):(Pre note: Today i got two legendary cards from daily login reward pack. One is Ghox other is Yuru. \o/)So after 4 months  i still think that game is the best Digital Card Game on the market (after trying Hearthstone, DOTP, DOC, IW, Scrolls and HEX). Stone Blade Entertainment is doing an amazing job with pumping new sets, cards regularly.In this 4 months, i only spent 5-10 bucks per month and i have competitive decks now which can be used in constructed tournaments. For card games with paying that little and having some competitive decks is great because we all know that card games are expensive hobbies in general. Also, realized that i didn't praise enough how the game has an amazing art. I don't know how they keep pushing that level quality of artwork with every set but they are just beautiful, amazing.I criticized the UI of Solforge in my first comment and it's still the same. But at least, we know that devs are thinking to improve it. Here's a mockup from them: http://imgur.com/a/NNxYNIf you're looking for a good card game with a mature community (one of the best communities i've seen in any game), best DCG artwork in the market with some fresh game mechanics and huge potential, there's still one choice, Solforge.--------Newbie here who just started Solforge and playing it for a week. I read reviews to learn what people think about the game and most of them say that the game is pay-to-win and as a guy who have been playing Hearthstone for a long time and got nearly all the cards in the game, i didn't ♥♥♥♥ing understand how Solforge is P2W.Comparing to Hearthstone, game is much more generous. You get silver for every win, you get a huge amount of silver for every 1st and 3rd win and 1st online win. Opened a few booster packs (pack of 6 cards) and saw that possibility of getting legendary or heroic cards are much bigger then getting an Epic or Legendary cards of Hearthstone. Forging/Crafting cards are also much easier than Hearthstone's dust system. And think about it, even daily login prize is ~2000 silver and you can buy a common card for only 150 silver (rare for 1400). By just loging in and winning 3 -specific- games in a day, you can buy 30-40 common cards or 3-4 rares. To put it simply, game economy is much better organized than both Duels of Champions and Hearthstone i think.Also I'm playing with Starter packs mostly and i won many matches against those decks with lots of heroics or rares. Game is not P2W not just because of getting packs is cheap but also you can create good decks with common cards too.One problem of the game is UI, especially the lack of native full screen mode.Other than that, game is great; yeah, really. Leveling up the cards is a great idea and i felt like i'm playing Heroes of Might & Magic III. Game is fast, fluid, fun  and being able to play multiple games at the same time is a good idea too.Game is also in early access state for now but i hope player base will grow because it has big potential.

Early Access Review
								3/23/14: When I originally wrote my review, SolForge had a very strong pay to win aspect, as getting competetively viable cards without paying real money was a major chore. With the latest update however, the severity of that chore has been greatly reduced.They have added the ability to trade in your unwanted cards for silver, buy single cards for silver, increased the amount of silver you earn from daily rewards, and perhaps most importantly greatly improved the boosters you can get for silver, giving more cards with a better chance for decent rarities (and thus qualities) of cards.True, you'll still progress faster and be more competetively viable if you pay real money for the game, but it's now much easier to build a competetive deck without expending real money.--Original review follows--So there's 2 questions to ask yourself before starting to play SolForge:Do I want to pay money?Do I want to be able to compete?If you answered yes to the first, your fine. If you answered no to the second, you're fine.If you answered no to the first, yes to the second... you might want to go elsewhere.Despite what some want to say in their reviews, SolForge IS a Pay To Win. Yes, you CAN get everything without paying a dime. You CAN build a competetive deck without ever spending money. But you CAN also get a publishing contract that turns in to a multi-million dollar franchise the first time you throw a manuscript at a publisher.SolForge is a pretty nifty CCG, with a mechanic that can only really exist in a computer version. Every time you play a card, it gets better for the next time it comes up. Which is cool, but slightly gimmicky. If you ignore that quirk, it's standard fare:Playing field is 5 lanes. Each creature played attacks the opponents critter in the same lane. Attack Vs. Health. If there's no critter, opponent takes the damage instead.4 factions: Necromancers (Nekrium), Druids (Uterra), Elementalists (Tempys) and Technomancers (they're not as fun as the elves from Spoils do I don't care). Each deck can contain 2 factions.Deck building is the best part of the game, and the worst. You build a deck of 30 cards and see how it fares against other decks. It's cool! And you can get the currency to buy boosters by playing the game? SCORE!Except only the basic (3 card) booster can be purchased for Silver... if you want one of the larger packs with a better chance of good cards you have to either pay money or get lucky.Outside of paying real money, there are 3 ways to get cards:At 'achievements' each day you get a reward, which is anywhere from 1 card to a standard booster pack. These points are: First log in, First win, 3rd win (including against the computer).At each of those noted points, and after beating players, you earn Silver, which as mentioned can be used to buy the 'basic' (3 card) boosters.Tournaments, the first time you beat a player every day you get a 'tournament ticket', for 7 tickets you can enter a tournament... and probably lose miserably, but you get cards for playing at all.Now the problem with this, is the odds of beating another player when you're on a free to play deck is ... not great, especially not early on. So when you're starting out, unless you want to throw money at the game, you're pretty much stuck beating the computer 3 times a day to get your rewards, and constantly trying to build a deck you can actually compete with.It is a pretty fun game though, with interesting potential deck synergies and some cool cards. Decent enough way to pass the time.It is also worth noting that whilst I consider SolForge Pay To Win, the price point of cards is not at all unreasonable. It is perhaps slightly high when one considers that they're entirely digital and if the game goes away, one is not even left with cards they can look at or use to play with friends.A 3 card pack, with a chance to open to decent things is $.25 (or can easily be earned in game)An 8 card pack, with a guarantee of decent things and a chance for awesome things is $2 (and occasionally can be earned in game)A 10 card pack, with guaranteed awesomness (1 legendary, 3 rare, 3 heroic) is less than $12(prices assume spending $20 on gold, spending lower amounts will lead to slightly higher prices, while spending higher amounts will lead to slightly lower prices)If one compares this to a real CCG, one will find this just as easy to spend stupid amounts of money on in the hopes of getting the perfect cards for your deck, but also much easier to spend very little money on.

								I do recommend this game, but I don't recommend spending any money on this game. It's an interesting ccg, lots of fun to play, but the gap in power between legendaries and other cards is a bit much. When you combine that with the prices for everything, it just doesn't have reasonable value.As far a how the game plays, even though you can only play 2 cards per turn (you can play more than 2 with the right cards) it seems somewhat shallow at first, but the real strategy comes in as you understand the different Rank during play and identifying when your opponent will be weakest and/or when your deck is strongest and trying to level the appropriate cards and strike at the appropriate time.

								I stop to play at this game because there is no more daily rewards when you defeated 3 times the AI (which was idiot even in hard mode, but it was relaxing and allowed to complete your collection without playing in PvP which was really unpleasant).No anger (thanks to the ""free period""), I just feel some regrets and I am a bit disappointed to stop playing this game after more than 1 year and 6 months (each day). I got the keys in an Bundle, never spend money in this game because items to purchase are too expensive and if I got money to spend in a CCG I would buy real cards instead.I hate PvP, I exploited the ""free period"" when SBE was fixing their bugs to perfect all the features of this game (cards, silver, opened hundred of deck when I got some time to waste...). Your compensation is cute, but way too poor comparing to the ""free period"".I dislike the new interface which is more unreadable than the old one when playing, even if the new one is prettier.This game is now designed for PvP players, casual gamers like me are now unwelcomed.So farewell SBE.

								This used to be my go to freebie card game with the ability to gain stuff in game slowly and safely solo and for free, now its a mess of an UI, card sorting gone out the window, the ability to gain more cards against an AI gone , The cards have turned into heartstone popsicles ( hate heartstone with a vengeance ) loved the original REAL wow TCG thou. All in all i will not spend a second more in this game until its fixed brought back anything from this present edition, i really dont get how you can take a game that works solid and turn it into a big pile of garbage with an "" update "" ! of the freaking game. Game designers stop drinking the heartstone coolaid and bring me back my solforge thanks!			"

The waiting times for every click are waaaaay too long.Much of the new interaction is worse now than it was before.Some good stuff has been removed (Like quick play, random decks, propper sorting) and instead of this what has been added?Lots of shiny nonesense.Sad thing but after the update i really dont want to play this anymore...

												A very sad example of Devs destroying an amazing game with one foul swoop.  I will never understand what possessed them to release the absolute gobsh*te of an interface that came out a few months back but, I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that killed it.   The devs have stated the game will no longer be supported after the end of Jan; it's a pitty but, I hope they learn from this and, in future projects, they learn to crit their own work without their ego falling to pieces.  That is the only possible explanation I can think of for them pushing that piece of (#*&$#$ interface on us for so long before they went 'oh crap, you know what, we done goofed'.  The older I get the more I realise the difference between succesful business owners and the not-so-succesful is your ability to get back on your feet and take the constructive crit.  Best luck to you folks, I will always have fond memories of this game (before the interface change).  What this game once was:Beautiful artworkAn interesting, expanding universe which in turn led to more interesting cardsHighly unique card level play systemGreat competition with good rewardsSuper-easy to get into a gameThe interface was so terribad that the game became a literal nightmare of frustration, with simple, absolutely essential to the game features thrown out the window.  It's as if the devs revelled int he amount of extra pointless/useless time you now had to spend to do the same bloody thing that worked before.  If you can tell I'm a little cheesed, I am.  Just look at my hours.  I loved this game, I really did.  None of the other digital card games have even remotely grabbed my interest compared to what Solforge delivered.  *sniff*  Get your sh*t together  team and learn from these mistakes; you folks absoutely need to try again.  DON'T GIVE UP!  Learn from this game make something even more amazing!  Peace...			"

Single Players RUN AWAY!Imagine you get a game, like it and even give some money to support the company. A bit later, the developers decide to COMPLETELY STRIP elements from that very game because that is exactly what happened here.-Single player rewards versus AI..... removed.-Ability to assign a random deck to the AI opponent..... removed.Now in all fairness, I had a nice size collection built up from before this change but OMG I can't imagine what it would be like for a new player at this time. This game would probably seem like the epitome of PAY TO WIN now as a new player. Imagine playing MTG:Duels or 99% of the other TCGs out there with AI wins giving no rewards. Even if you want to have a relaxing game versus the AI, it is now completely boring since  you always know exactly what deck the AI will use. That is what this game has become.The game mechanics are pretty neat with cards leveling up and adds a unique twist to trading card games. A shame really, I will miss my favorite plant deck. In any case, other TCGs out there offer their own twist and allow you to play against AI opponents with rewards. I highly recommend MTG: Duels instead. So sleazy to take money from a portion of your customer base and then kill them off like that. I mean, they even removed the ability to assign random decks to the AI. RANDOM ******* DECKS! I'll never give another cent to this company ever again.By the way, I used to really enjoy this game. Used to, before they decided they don't want single players to play anymore. However, if you have a lot of money to spend and don't care about AI skirmish then it is probably worth checking out.			"

								I DON'T like Solforge. Even though the game has everything a good cardgame should have: Cards, strategy, a specific playtime period and the oppertunity to get better cards via playing, tournaments and other forms matches!What I don't like about Solforge is the following: The amount of luck u need in order to win a match is staggering.....so much so that all the tweaking and gathering of cards is pure and simple a con to pull  some more money out of the players. Pure and simple.Luck plays too big a part:The 'luck' factor is way to high. With that I mean the chances of one player drawing lower level cards (consistently) and the other player drawing higher level cards is devastating in any match. No amount of strategy or color of cards can make up for that. I dont base this on 1, 2 or 3 matches but many matches and draft tournaments.There is simply no telling what u get but u can be damn sure the opponent gets better cards. U try to improve the odds with cards like 'meta transfer' or 'technosmith' and other discard and level up mechanics but the result is still the same... the chance u get lousy cards late in the game are simply too damn high... getting your first lvl 3 card(s) in round 3.3 or later is going to devastating for any match especially if the other guy is playing them from the start of 3.1 Server connection:There is also the server connection. For any online cardgame to work u need a stable connection. At the moment however that  stable connection is not there. To many times during a tournament the error message is shown that the client is unable to communicate with the server, frequently resulting in a big amount of lost time that u dont get back...and could mean the difference between winning a match or losing.9 second refund:There is also the point where u get about 9 seconds back after each turn to make up for slow connection between u and the server but it also means u can play whole rounds without losing any time at all...why have a maximum playtime if u are goimg to build in a way to cheat the given time? Something to look at for sure!All in all this game could become a favorite of mine but for the moment with the above mentioned problems being what they are... this game is irritating as hell... I will keep playing though in the hopes of it getting better but for now the tournament is off limits due to the extreme luck or bad luck u generally have as a player!			"

								All glitchyness with the beta release aside, I can't strongly recommend SolForge, even though I found it somewhat enjoyable at first.I have to mention card selection. There just aren't that many cards when it comes down to it, which means that strategies are limited. This is something that can be improved as the game develops.Currently, the metagame revolves around a battle of attrition where the person who has the cards that offer the best value win nearly every time. Cards can offer value in terms of what they add to the board state or how difficult they are to deal with. Synergy is not nearly as important as raw power. Anyone who has played this game knows how absurd Echowisp is for example. Everflame Phoenix is essentially impossible to recover from once it gets online. The design of these cards just don't lend themselves to comebacks. It's more like a gradually building avalanche from which there's no escape.			"

								As you can see from my hours played, this is a game that I actually enjoy. The cardplay is innovative; cards you've played in earlier rounds  get stronger  and 'level up' in later rounds. This adds a great deal of strategic depth as ones must decide whether to trade off one card's immediate utility against another's future 'leveled up' usefulness. I've seen a great many deck types have success, and the available drat-style games are different enough from the constructed variety that there's a great deal of fun to be had here. Why then the thumb's down?---- One design decision alone: When a game starts, each player is given 20 minutes to complete his game. Usually, at the start oif a game, eaxh player moves relatively quickly. However, when one player appears to gain an advantage, VERY often the other will begin to use the time on the clock as a strategic resource. By this I mean, you'll play 10 turns in fairly rapid succession, each using only a minute or two of time. Then, one player pulls ahead and then will wait 10-15-17 minutes for the other player to move. He may be hoping you'll have lost interest, or just to catch you unawares, attempting to win via boredom what he cannot through skill. This effect is compounded by the fact that one can have a large number of games open at one time.  In constructed deck play, you are rewarded daily through three victories, and sealed deck takes 4 games to complete. Ineither style, prepare to devote majo amounts of time waiting, staring at an unmoving screen, before you can finish up.Apart from this, the game itself is well-designed and fun to play., It is possible to be competitive without spending real money, though it can take a little patience. The trade-off here is cash vs. time to build reaonable decks, but the mechanic is fair. No real complaints on that score.			"

												*Edited for syntax and coherence*I‘m reposting this review since the developers relaunched their game with a new user interface, and older reviews do not show. I’ll take the chance to update it as well.Solforge has the most elegant concept for a set of core mechanics that you could find in a virtual CCG ever. Sadly, it absolutely fails in the execution, the main problems being, in first place, a lack of balance in the constructed format which causes an oppressive and reduced meta-game, and in second place, the presence of very punishing variance issues in the draft format that become stronger as any given match progresses.So I can reference this game to f2p players that want to try out a CCG with an innovative core. however, i strongly advise against spending money on this game, both, because of the above, and for the following reasons:-	The new UI is visually unappealing and comes with bugs. The bulk scrap function (cards de-crafting for in-game currency) doesn't work correctly and often shows copies of cards that have been scraped. There is disconnect issues across all platforms.-	Communication from the developers towards the player base is often lacking unless they are advertising new expansions or trying to fix a major blunder, like the technical issues that made the game unplayable during its official launch. They are currently working on fixing this, but given SBE’s record (that is the developers), I won’t keep my hopes up.-	The game has a steep learning curve that often dissuades new players from staying in it. Combine that with an economy based on grinding, with heavy aspects of pay to win, and an inability to pay for event tickets with in-game currency and it will take several hours a day, for any new player to even get to complete a playable deck within months.-	Power creep is a very real thing in this game. Powerful cards from older sets have been nerfed, while others just became ineffective over time, and new cards are often intentionally unbalanced so players have to pay or grind for them. Additionally, the higher rarity cards are much more powerful than the lower rarity cards.-	The matchmaker is terrible. New players will often be paired against older players who have all of these more powerful cards. Players in lower ranks of the ladder will sometimes be paired against players in the highest ranks of the ladder. And the ranked game is a mess when they reset the ranked season.-	The game’s community in the forums during the open beta was proactive, polite and willing to help. But after many players left, the remaining community is fanboyish, and often times toxic. Sometimes even moderators spew toxicity over the forums.-       Player base is so low that people get paired against each other repeatedly.			"

								The game is playable and reasonably entertaining from a basic playability standpoint; but deck building is an exercise in needless frustration and there are massive issues with competitive online play that doom SolForge to meet an early grave. I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have: Timed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it. A single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind The interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens) Very laggy performance, especially in the deck builder Many other issues...Instead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic). Catching up at this stage would require an investment of several hundred, or even thousands of dollars.I've played dozens of people, to the point that I see certain names often enough that I know their decks and what to expect; and every card in their deck is wildly more powerful than almost every card I've been able to get in more than a month of play. At this point, I'm pretty sure the only people still active in the game are long-term players. The few new players come in briefly, see how much of a mess it is, and promptly leave.It's a complete waste of time to invest in this game, even if the balance issues are worked out, the cheating/trolling is curtailed, and more players join. Save yourself the hassle and find something else to do with your time.			"

								Best CCG by my Taste.I have tried them All: Magic the Gathering, Hearthstone, Infinity wars, hex, duelyst and and and...AND... Solforge is pretty much the best in my opinion. first the Bad stuff: The Launcher and game UI are a little flimsy and sometimes in certain (not affecting actual gameplay) areas the clicking area of Buttons is off somehow. All over the menus and Deckbuilding the whole thing seems a bit... well, not so well and cleanly done. But nothing to an amount that should stop you from playing this gem.The GOOD Stuff:1. Fair free to play system. Youll after a while playing with free stuff can (and will) totally get cards that enable you to beat every deck. Some of the strongest decks dont even need any (or many) of the Rarest cards.2. Cross platform. Yes. Steam players and Android PLayers and Ios Players. You have one account which you use for mobile and pc and all the systems supported. Its always in sync.3. Multiplayer modes: Besides the tournaments and drafts (in the standard draft you can keep your drafted cards) there is a few cool things to mention about the multiplayer: You can challenge people on your friendlist, you can play at home with friends in local coop (but only with decks on ONE account) and, of course against randoms online.4. Campaign. Dissapointingly short, yes, supertricky and challenging but SUPER Rewarding, giving you some of the strongest Legendaries. 5. RNG / STRATEGY / Deckratio: Its nice. one of the most balanced in my opinion. but dont cry: As a beginner, youll have a hard time online until you know what are the most dangerous cards.6. Artwork. Its wonderful. (the Cards)PLAY THIS NOW! Dont let this nice game die for that RNG Hearthstone kiddiecrap.			"

								This game should be a fast paced card game.You have 5 active card slots you can fill.You have 5 cards in your hand that you are dealt each turn, and 30 cards in your deck.Cards evolve and get stronger each time you play them.There is a nice balance between getting the strongest cards out vs even leveling of cards.One you have a greater chance of getting a weak hand but if you get a strong hand you are hard to beat.The other you have a less chance of getting a weak hand but you also have less chance of getting a strong hand.There good combinations and counters between the cards.There are 4 factions that have their individual specialties.Lots of good deck building strategies.The cards have 4 rarities, common, rare, herioc and legendary.Though I did spend a little money initially to support the game, I have since stopped spending money.I have been able to get a full collection of cards without trading, most of the cards were aquired after I stopped spending money on the game.Recenlty I have been averaging 1 legendary card from daily events each week, so have multiple copies of a lot of the legendaries.I have found this game free player friendly.This is a fast paced game when it works.Update:July 5, 2016New client issues mostly solved.Server problems are mostly gone.The client is relatively stable.That being said there are still some major issues with the client.Card text is sometimes wrong, for example if you use a remove ability from a card, the card text may not change to reflect itthere are occasional lockups when you play spell cards and try to select a target, need to restart client joining games in progress, may cause client to lockup, have to terminate, and restart clientWhen you play spell cards sometimes the spell cards are overlaid on top of the enemy cards and you can't target themoccasionally if you win by timeout you need to restart the client to register the winoccasionally the client doesn't register turns properly and you may need to restart the client to complete your turnCard effects at end of turn fail, looks like the client card animation and end of turn takes precidence over card effects, if you have a lot of card animations at the end of turn the client will fail to process card effectsPet Peeves:Hidden card play, in most other card games card effects that target cards in your deck or discard pile are displayed, solforge doesn't display theseEase of getting cards. some times this is a problem as you can get a lot of people playing the same decks(ie Indomitable Fiend decks)Because of all the animations it is sometimes hard to tell what effect you are currently selecting a target forI still find the old client was more stable and better in almost all aspects of game play then the new client.They have changed the reward system so it is now a lot more time intensive if you want all the daily rewards.Having a disable animation option would solve a lot of the problems with the new client.Until they add that option I would advise new players not to play this game as the bugs in the new client detracks from the enjoyment of the game, and the proper interactions of the cards.

								It's a good concept and would be a lot of fun, but it's pay to win. The heroic and legendary cards completely overwelm the other cards by a drastic amount. Even after months of rewards you won't be able to compete with someone who paid. In ranked play decks may be filled with over half of these types of cards. If you have a decent amount of money to throw at it then get it, but if you're just a casual gamer then it will cause you a great amount of anti-fun.			"

								This is a great card game. I use to play hearthstone and enjoyed it for some time but I actually like this one more. For one its not well known so there isn't a million sites with deck builds all over them for it. So you don't run into a bunch of net decker's. 99% of the time people are using decks they thought up themselves. Cards are pretty easy to get. Everyday you get two packs from dailies that often net you a few commons and some rares and an occasional heroic. But if you really want heroics and legendary cards you have to play draft games which only cost 3 tickets and you get 1 ticket a day. So you can do drafts every three days if you want. You on average get about 2 or 3 heroics a draft and 1 legendary maybe every 8 drafts. There are tons of other ways to get cards to for people just starting the game. Just play all the single player challenges and they give you cards too.My only real gripes are that you can't talk to anyone. There is no way to chat and really no easy way to add a friend either... So that kind of sucks. But other than that it's a good game.			"

								Game isn't pay to win. It's [resource] to win. that resource can be money, but it can also be time. I have over 600 hours logged and do my dailies without fail. You can play 3 games vs computer very quickly. I've spent like $10 on the game forever ago, but the vast majority of my cards come from dailies.The fastest way to get the legendaries you want (other than paying $$$ for them) is to do dailies and drafts.DON'T BUY PACKS WITH YOUR SILVER. Save it up. Sell your extra cards for silver. Use the silver to buy legendaries.Legendaries cost around 140,000 silver which can seem daunting, but if you ""rare draft"" (draft the rarest cards you can every round) you can sell them all for quite a bit. A really good draft can net you 35-40k silver. Don't start the game and expect to play constructed PVP in the first week. or first month. But you can do well in drafts as soon as you have a grasp on the core game rules. Every day get 1 draft coupon and 2 free packs if you do your dailies. 2 free packs per day is more than you can get from a lot of card games. I'd reccomend the game for a number of reasons, but it boils down to ""are you willing to do your dailies?"" if you aren't, then keep walking. If you are, then your patience will be rewarded.			"

												Farewell SolForge, I hardly knew you.I received a starter and some cards ages ago, so I gave it a try.The mechanics were straight forward, you play cards in specific locations on the map to attack and defend.Many other games have similar mechanics.The twist is, your played cards would level up and get stronger each time you shuffled.I found that some of the AI opponents simply outclassed my deck much too much. It was a bit discouraging. Still, the game had process, but now its being shut down.I would certainly give a  micro-transaction free version a try should it ever return in the future! "

								They ruined the game with the last patch.Now it looks much better, yeah, but it became just a 100% P2W game. To compete you need good cards (even for completing missions and playing ladder). Almost every deck you face will be filled with legendary and heroic cards, wich are critical in this game.There were rewards for playing against AI before the last patch, and now they are gone.So, if you don't have a collection already, you'll be forced to make $-purchases.  Well, if you are a masochist, you may enjoy winning 1-5% of your games with no worries of course. Just kiddin.Developers should change at least some important things ASAP. Otherwise I don't see any bright future for SolForge.4/10. And 7/10 if you are OK to throw in decent ammount of money.			"

												Get ready to lose, lose, and of course lose.  unless you want to spend $$$. The game itself is a fairly good idea and I had fun for the first hour. Then I went to play online......... If you dont have 10 full sets of legendary cards that work perfectly toghther dont even try. I've played at least 20 games and I win one out of every ten games. It's a ok game but if you can't climb over the money wall (like me) then this is probably not for you.  "

								This is a fun ccg with an interesting mechanic of leveling up the cards you use.  I've only been playing for two days at this point, but I've made a few observations so far.  The game offers lots of rewards daily, with one for signing in, one for your first win against the AI, and one more for your third win against the AI.  These three can be completed in less than 10 minutes and will net you the regular ingame currency, new cards, and a booster every day.  If you win an online match, you also get an event ticket which can be used in various tournaments, including a booster draft where you get to keep the 30 cards you use.On the down side, the cards I've seen so far point to this being either pay to win or patience to win.  The heroic and legendary cards are much more powerful than the common and rare ones.Overall, I'd say give the game a try, but don't spend money unless you really love it.			"

								Update completely destroyed the game. Use to be really simple and fun to play. Now it takes forever to even load into the main screen, even longer to get into a game (and as of rn can\'t even get into an online game. it says opponent found, loads for 5 minutes, and then goes back to the home screen. and repeat) Can\'t do daily rewards with AI anymore, really dumb move. Not going to play this anymore until they come out with a fix and improve this game.			"

												Although it was my favorite ccg for 2 years, i've sadly said farewell to my friend Solforge: having a competitive deck is almost impossible unless you spend tons of money, or are the luckiest person alive and spend very little. I'm not the average ccg player, as I don't like playing against other people (for various reasons) and i was happy to spend 10 minutes against bots and trying out new fun combos to one day not try in actualy pvp matches...now this is over: daily missions used to complete against the AI, not anymore. And booster packs have rose in price and i no longer got the free booster packs after dailies (which i painfully did against other players). Last but not least, I just gotta say this: i only played drafts in pvp and I loved and hated them: i love drafting, hate having to wait for 15 minutes for my opponent to actually do something. Goodbye solforge, i'll never forget you but i just don't see the point in playing anymroe.			"

												Game was designed well and has some uniqueness for a card game, which is hard to find nowadays. It was fun for quite a bit and had a reasonably active community, but the developers ruined it about a year ago making the game less user-friendly, more expensive and less fun. Now they run with the money and shut the game down. Help prevent this in the future and don't invest time or money in StoneBlade's products again.			"

								As a Magic:The Gathering player, I really like this new concept on CCGs.Pros:Free to play!!Variety of possible deck builds whether you are playing casually with friends or playing constructed.Dailies are easy to complete to help boost card collection without the need to spend money.You get to keep all the cards you choose for draft (except on Legendary draft), unlike Hearthstone.I really enjoy having the play the best current hand since all cards are reshuffled/discarded after the turn.  Makes combos a little more difficult to land but worth it when they do.Card of the Day and Alternate Art are nice if you want to spend money.Cons:Drafts can get frustrating when most players choose the same type of draft deck.Some cards/decks are definitely balanced a bit more favorably.  (Varna's Pact giving the possibility of playing all four factions can be annoying if luck works in favor)Leveling cards (although I like it) can be a bit too random when hitting higher ranks but still pulling low level cards.Cards of the Day and Alternate art makes me want to spend money...People you play during tournaments and random online matches get added to Friends List (wish there was a separation)All in all: I rate this game at about an 8.5/10.  It is still a new game but I spend a good amount of time playing with friends each day, even if it is a single game that might take 16 hours due to work schedules and time zones.  I really enjoy trying to mix cards and make new combos for specific type of decks (Mobility, Swarm, Health Gain, Poison, Tarsus)			"

Conflux setting here is a mix of faeries, robots, mages, tanks, zombies, drones, dinosaurs, nano technologies, elementals, protomans, mechs, demigods etc., all divided into 4 factions by interests, without neutrals.	Deckbuilding: 30 decksize / 3 copies / 1-2 factions; no other limits and no resourses.	Draft system, constructed tournaments, ""Weekend Warrior"" tournaments with new rules every week. Competitive ladder and casual mode. Timed and untimed turn queues. Pass-and-play mode, to play with ur friend on 1 device. And even ""asynchronous turn-based"" mode, reminiscent of ancient play-by-email games, when both players do their turns independently (though, sequentially) whenever they come online. And.. ""Play Random Deck"" button, dammit seriously, how often do you see it in card games, think about it?? :D	Half of the features above were unreasonably cut on later stages. Or reasonably; does it matter though?.. (find me reason to cut ""Play Random Deck"" function btw)	SolForge spent in beta ridiculously huge period of time - playable state was around 2012 afaik, so 4 years after kickstarter finished, at least. (If this isn't obvious hint, than what?..)	Card art is wonderful and 300% deserves permanent place on my harddrive. Looks very professional, especially among hoards of these Hearthstone-wannabes. To remind, conflux arts require separate talents, at the very least 1 for each setting. All creatures here are drawn in 3 evolution levels (or 4, if OP :D), like your pokemons, normal->Cooler->SUPERCOOL. Girls are hot, undead are sadistic, mechs are heavy, giants are brutal, etc.	It will be remembered by me personally as a card game with most generous business model ever seen. For long time they were giving 2 boosters + currency + tickets EVERY day - just for playing couple games vs AI. After huge game rework, daily boosters were reduced to 1 (with small chance of getting 10) and AI games were no longer counted, but still. I heard veterans talking about tournament rewards being overgenerous as well. The fact should speak for itself: without giving a penny or actually playing ANYTHING except dailies, ever - my collection as of today contains: playsets of everything except last 2 rarities | 5/7 expansions with playsets of penultimate rarity | at least 1 of each ultimate rarity, 2/3 of them are playsets or 2 of. In the game with 7 sets and ~770 cards of 4 rarities total. I don't have a single alt art card for bragging though, for reason above (most aa don't even look cool though -.-). -------<[CUT]>-------	Another reason for remembering - the record amount of boosters I opened at once - 1111. Not in one sit, accumulated amount was opened in 3 days with pauses. Could be little more, but yeah, for the cool number. And anyway I don't think I will ever reach that number in any other game, physical or digital. Total amount of SolForge boosters was ~1500, plus couple ""Legendary Chests"" - big boosters with guaranteed ultimate + penultimate rarities inside.	And the last reason, I will remember it as a game I used to continuously collect, and never got to actually play it, even once. Except for campaign and AI skirmishes =D	SolForge is OPD as of today, January 31, 2017.Class: III - Dead BreadVerdict: YesReviewed: 1.31.2017Approach: Steam - PCTime: Several Dozen HoursDeeds:  1111 Boosters Opened At Once Collection: Playsets of everything except last 2 rarities | 5/7 expansions with playsets of penultimate rarity | at least 1 of each ultimate rarity, 2/3 of them are playsets or 2 of "

								So apparently this game was made early last year?  Graphics aren't everything for sure, but this game looks like it could've been made a few years ago as one of those completely free flash games.  While playing Solforge I've been trying to look past it, but unfortunately this game has too many parts that seem to have been totally overlooked.My biggest complaints:No tutorial that goes beyond ""drag and drop to play your cards, press these obvious buttons to end your turn, here's a quick explanation for the leveling and rank system, here's how spells and effects sorta-work, good luck!"".  The game doesn't really explain the various factions in any form or the way that thier ally abilities work, now does it go on to explain any sort of basic strategy in this game at all.  There's so much missing for a game that's already a year old.The card balance is pretty bad.  There are several cards that are simply better than other ones.  There are several clones of Zombie Soldier that have the same stats as well as an added effect, for instance.There's no undo button, which is pretty vital for a card game.  You can't undo any actions whatsoever.  This is especially annoying when you start to realize the full potential of the battle and turn phases being seperated.The interface as a whole isn't as streamlined as it could be.  It works better than most games that have recently come out, with thier 20 buttons and 50 menus at least, but it's much nicer to click on a button that says ""settings"" over fishing around for a cog symbol....There's only 4 factions, and no lore.  I don't understand why factions even exist except to have those little ally effects, but almost all of the ally effects pool into Tempys so they don't matter very much.There are too many similar cards, except for spell cards.  The spell cards tie into my aforementioned gripes about the card balance in this game, where one faction has many powerful spell cards while another faction has some OK ones to get by on.  I could understand it if 1 of the factions had particularly strong spells and particularly weak creatures, but this isn't the case.  Because half of the monsters in this game could be clones with very minor stat differences.In summary, I'm glad that I got these starter packs in a huge Humble Bundle, because I would have regret my starter pack puchase if I had not.  I'm going back to Infinity Wars, I'll take its' more punishing economy over this game's less fun, less explodey, less varietal gameplay.			"

								Waited a while for them to fix the glaring problems with this game, to no avail:-The bias towards higher rarity cards to the point of almost disregarding lower rarity ones (and screwing up the new player experience in the process, together with the recent reduction of daily rewards)-The excessive accelerated pace of the meta game (spam or die), which wouldn't be such an awful thing if: there was any kind of match making involved on unraked games, and most of the cards needed to counter said meta weren't placed in the upper rarities  (there is something off when you are worrying about countering the meta in casual mode).-The lack of options regarding buying booster packs of a desired expansion (having only the options of buying the most recent one with cash or an all-in-one pack that dilutes the chances of getting the card your are aiming for quite badly)Honestly, the lag in the new client and some other technical issues, at least in my eyes, can be waited out and fixed. But the other issues really turn me away from the game. It is truly an interesting concept for a CCG, with interesting mechanics, but with the glacial pace of the development, the issues that remain unsolved, and a whole world of other CCGs out there, the game ain't worth much of your time just yet. However I would say that you should keep an eye on this one, here's hoping they manage to turn this around.			"

Making daily quests only doable against real opponents also made it virtually impossible for newer players to complete their dailies. If you're very patient and don't mind grinding for years, there is a good game hidden underneath all these problems, but I can't recommend this.			"

												I honestly used to love this game. Just take a look at my Steam screenshots, I think there's only one in there that ISN'T of a SolForge game. But, as with many other users and reviewers, they lost me when the new expansion came out.  I had saved up ""free"" (you get them from winning games) packs for months, along with tons of silver, which is the ingame currency that costs no real money, only real time. The plan was to get as many of these exciting new cards as possible as soon as the expansion came out, which I did. I opened all 100 packs (a significant and rather dull time investment) and spend hundreds of thousands of silver on new cards from the ""Raiders Unchained"" set. Two weeks later, every single one of those cards was gone, and 0 silver or packs were refunded to my account. It's possible that every card from the packs I opened that day was removed; I don't know the list of what I did or didn't have beforehand well enough to check. But I know that I'm done with this game, and I can't recommend that anyone else play it.			"

								The visual overhaul removed a lot of the functional and attractive graphics and smart decisions of the previous interface, and each new set FURTHER nerfs the older sets more than the last release. Do yourself a favor and skip this game. You don't need to nerf old card to make new cards. If you can't avoid power creep that's fine, some cards will just be less good in time, as is the case for all CCG, but there's a cardinal flaw in your design process if you think nerfing player tools is the right answer; make the things that are too weak by comparison a little stronger to make up for it. Thanks for trying Solforge team, your game was fun for a while.			"

								If you ever think about starting playing, here is my take: just don't. Turn around now, while you can.Let me start with the positive stuff: The underlying system, the variance of cards and as such the potential for deckbuilding is great. The game itself works well. Artwork is nice, tournaments are sometimes fun.And now for the bad: it is not at all friendly to new players. Play online and you WILL run into highend decks. Nothing else can compete at this stage. There is no learning curve. You either have the good cards, or you get stomped by one of the 5 dominant decks of the meta at the time. Sure, you can get cards for free, but, sadly, now you need to win an ONLINE game for that. Same for tournament tickets. This was different, before the client redesign. Nowadays, there is no way for you to get your toes wet, so to speek. It's a bad system and it is not getting better.Right now, if you are ready to drop a lot of money on a card game, you could do worse than SolForge. But if not? Stay the hell away.			"

								Having just uninstalled the game after 70 hours of playtime the reason can be summed up to a single word ""greed"". Now as a gamer one has to think what is the value I am getting for my money. When I compare the value I have gotten for my money from current master of digital CCG's Hearthstone one has to conclude that Solforge is a ripoff in comparison.There are a few reasons for this lack of value:A) The rewards for tournaments are weak for example one has to win all matches to get enough game's F2P currency of silver to play another. B)The rewards for playing the game are at most an insult i.e. you will get 100 silver per win and less than 10k for dailies and you need 60k(casual) or 140k(competative) to enter a draft so you do the math.C)So as the prices of everything are beyond reach of F2P currency one has to spend a lot of money in order to actually play the game and then feel bad as you will probably lose at the tournament and get nothing for you money.Now obviously as I spent over 70 hours on the game I actually liked the game mechanics, but come to realize that I like roller coaster rides as well but doing them daily is just not economically viable. So back to Hearthstone wherein I am happy to spend some money as I don't feel rippedoff at the end of it all.			"

								I know that it\'s a free to play game, and I know that the latest and greatest version of it just went live, but the new version is really clunky. I mean, I can\'t even get into a game. Solforge won\'t let me. The pack opening, while it tries to be more organic and true to a traditional paper and ink card game (such as Cardfight Vanguard and Future Card Buddyfight) it just seems clunkier compared to the old way of opening packs.The new release of a game should be a step forward, improving things that need improving, and highlighting aspects that are good. The new update doesn\'t really hold true to this so far. Only time will tell if they can move forward and try to make a game that can hold its own against Hearthstone eventually.			"

								Interesting take on the CCG where you don't have resources to play, just limited number of plays per turn.  I wanted to like it, especially since it has an Android port which meant I could play it on the go.  Something Hearthstone has just recently added.  The single player vs AI is smooth and decent for trying out new decks and getting daily rewards.  However, the problem, and why I have to say not recommended, comes from the abyssmal responsiveness and overall laggy feeling of any actual multi-player game.  I have a feeling since it has an Android port, even on the PC it doesn't stay connected to game servers and only periodically communicates.  In multiplayer games that seems to be when you finish your turn or your opponent finishes theirs.  Occasionally I've seen part of an opponent turn, then wait 30 seconds, then the 2nd part of their turn.  I guess they needed to think.  It feels very rough and unfinished and doesn't stand up to Hearthstone or MTG.  I wanted to like it.  But I don't.			"

								Wow, so Brian Kibler (Magic The Gathering Pro) designed his own card game, I'll bet it's ROCK solid eh?Nope.This game is literally 99% luck, there's no trading between players, rarer cards absolutely decimate cards that are less rare (eventually you'll get an all-rare deck) and you will lose games because they drew Level 3 cards and you drew Level 1 cards.Now let me explain, the fundamental mechanic here is when a card is played it goes back into your deck, but it levels up. As a card levels up it gets better. You can play two cards per turn and discard the remainder (so they go into your deck but don't level up) while drawing 5 cards at the start of your turn.What does this mean?You can't hold cards until they're strategically useful, you just have to play what you got.Mid game is dominated by level 2 and level 3 cards as neither player will have access to them.Late game is entirely dominated by level 3 cards and the loser is often whoever has less rare cards available to them.The limit of cards played per turn makes cards that grow in power amazingly good, or cards that can deal with multiple cards.This means that with the correct combination of spells it's easy to quickly create a giant creature that's unkillable and will win you the game.Of course with the correct combination of spells it's easy to dismantle that strategy but c'est la vie.So is this game fun? Definitely, the mechanics are fun.Is this game worth money? Definitely not. While the mechanics are fun and interesting they don't really reward skillful play, many games will be lost to simply drawing level 1 and level 2 cards when the opponent plays two level 3 cards and then two more the following turn.Worth a bit of fun if you don't care about winning/losing for no apparent reason.

								Uninstalled SolForge today, which at some level is a shame because without the P2W aspects it was a fun, albeit low strategy CG, but it does highlight the difference between how gamers and F2P devs define what is a “good” game.Unfortunately games that follow the Asian F2P whale model task the developers to build a “good” game from a gamer’s POV while simultaneously breaking balance in a way that can only be ameliorated with a credit card.From this gamer’s perspective a “good” CG offers a level playing field emphasizing skill by increasing strategy (in deck construction to maximize card synergy and in variety of play style choices during a match), decreasing luck of the draw aspects (leaving just enough fate to keep it interesting, but not so much to make it feel random), and striving to have balance between card choices. In contrast from an Asian model F2P dev’s perspective a “good” CG game is one that drives whales to obsessively use the cash shop to increase their chances of getting overpowered cards relative to those commonly available through in game currency transactions; it is a basic intermittent positive reinforcement operant conditioning design to foster compulsive spending. In this model cash flow can be maximized by downplaying strategy to favor accessibility (also a problem in B2P these days), luck of the draw is increased so one can never feel quite secure enough with their decks, as well as allowing less skilled players to stand a better chance of also winning, and by purposely breaking balance so one is constantly striving to fill their decks with more OP cards than their competitors.Specifically the SolForge monetization pit is built around the absurdly imbalanced legendary cards and the increasing of rank of cards.While the gambling aspects of trying to acquire OP legendary cards in bulk booster pack purchases is obviously a cash grab, the leveling of cards is a more subtle monetization tactic. At first I thought leveling was a cool idea as I always like playing games where I can nurture my units with experience to greater power, but here it is used to further exaggerate card imbalance. While on average a legendary level I card is somewhat more beneficial than non-legendary one, it usually isn’t in a game breaking way; it is at end game when level III is achieved that the P2W aspect manifests in full, and games come to an abrupt end, virtually always at the expense of the non-whale without red star cards.So one can break open their wallets and start enriching their decks with reds (but don’t be surprised if you just end up losing in turn to a larger whale) or try to enjoy the game with the exclusion of legendaries, smartly avoiding the overt monetization mechanics by immediately dropping from matches when a legendary comes into play; if one is a small fish in a sea of whales you are going to have to accept that you'll be taking the whale bone frequently, and don't expect the devs to step in because they designed the F2P game to foster just that feeling of unjust frustration on the loser's part, and the thrill of crushing victory on the whale's side. So since the whales are paying to keep the game afloat, the freebie players need to respect that and give them their due, but one should feel absolutely no responsibility to get ridden for longer than necessary. Just immediately concede and get on with a balanced match in spite of the SolForge dev's intentions. By analogy I wouldn’t find it entertaining to join in a seven card stud tournament, where I am restricted to five cards; could I win, perhaps, but obviously the cards would be stacked against me, so why bother?I do like seeing the non-heroic/non-legendary player sponsored tournaments in the forums, but of course even their existence points to the ugly pink whale in the middle of the room.This last day of playing, even among decks of comparable strength, I found the sheer luck factor was too much for me to ignore. We have all been there where in late game the opponent is playing out III’s and II’s and by the chance of the draw we get a hand of I’s which stinks to lose in such a way. Conversely I can’t help but to feel sympathetic when I just played out a couple of III’s and the opposing player blocks with two level I’s; you kind of want to send them a “sorry” emote. Lastly I think such power disparity fosters a virulent community of frustrated players that in my experience won’t think twice about walking away from a match to slowly let the timer run down once the realize they lost, as if to say ♥♥♥♥ you.Give me a B2P CG where everyone has access to all of the cards, and I’ll pull out my credit card happily, but there is no way I am going to constantly ride the red legendary dragon FTW! ;) http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php?print=1  "

								This used to be a viable, low-cost alternative to titles such as Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone, which I used to enjoy playing on mobile and occasionally on the computer. It used to have a client which was graphically unimpressive, reminiscent of Hearthstone with almost no graphics other than a background image and card images, but functional. The game used to be very generous, giving you tickets to play in tournaments/draft vs real players and letting you build your collection when playing vs AI. The highlight for me, not having a large collection, was ""draft"" mode, where you built your deck from a selection of cards, then faced opponents who did the same.As of June, however, the client and the game have changed dramatically. Client is now full of effects that remind you of the '80s and are unskippable, slowing down gameplay, health ticks down slowly and takes seconds to display accurately. Game is buggy and will seemingly randomly delete your decks. In the three ranked games at the lowest rank I played yesterday, the 1st match was bugged and required me to leave the game, then 2 next matchups were against clearly highly tuned decks full of legendaries that prevented me from doing anything. At the lowest rank. And I've been playing since last November, so I can only imagine how bad it would be for a newbie.Playing ""draft mode"" will let you expand your collection without facing overpowered decks, but, unlike previously, to get tickets for it you now have to beat aforementioned highly tuned decks, or pay money. If you do, you can eventually play constructed mode and smack people with lesser collections unless your client bugs out, I guess.I used to recommend this game, but unfortunately unless things are dramatically rolled back, it's a solid NO.

												I really enjoyed playing this game several months ago. Computer was fun to play against and try things out. The campaign was fun and challenging, and the background/UI needed work but was not too bad. This new update that athey have put into play has made the game feel like a facebook game and it makes me cringe.			"

								The game mechanics are fun, the cards are interesting, and the art is very good looking.  I was going to spend some money on this game, and I wish I could recommend it.Unfortunately, the only way to grow your collection, is to either:A) Play against other players, 99% of which have hundreds of Legendary cards.     - This gives you a small amount of currency you will collect to have a small chance to get the cards you need.B) Spend a huge amount of money hoping to get some of these Legendary cards.     - This gives you a variable amount of currency you will use to have a small chance to get the cards you need.Which means that you are afforded the opportunity to learn how to play the game, and then presented with a wall of people who have either years worth of cards, or have spent $1000+ on being competitive.After the initial tutorial, you have no way to progress without spending 4+ hours a day trying to collect lucky wins or that rare game where you are matched with someone at your own level.

								Summary:Constructed: Pay to win.Draft: Fun.Let me tell you a story why you don't want to play constructed with a slim wallet.At the beginning, my starter deck was fine, I tried to make the best out of it with more or less success. Then I was lucky enough to open a Tarsus Deathweaver from a booster pack, forged 2 more, and built a whole new synergy-based deck around it. Only commons and rares, a couple of heroics and no legendaries. It worked literally awesome, I won 80% of my matches even against players with better cards overall. After a while, I felt, I'm being paired agains players who had spent a bunch of money to buy the same starter deck 3 times (since this is the most reliable way to get legendaries). Now, I can only win 20% of my matches because in the other 80%, my opponents present more legendaries in their first 4 turns then I have in my whole collection.You might feel tempting to buy legendary chests. Once you spend money on the game to play better constructed deck, you are part of the big grinding. The daily rewards are far not enough to get good cards. On the other hand, drafts are suprisingly good. The system works differently than anything else I've ever seen. You draft alone, which means no other players are involved in your draft procedure, thus you can draft in your own pace. Once you drafted the 30 cards, it becomes your deck and you are now ready to play your matches. However, you don't need to play them on the spot! Play them whenever you have time. If you're too tired in the evening, you can draft the cards and play the games on the next day or whenever you want. This means you  don't need to spend 1-2 hours to draft and play at the same time.			"

								As of 2/13/2015 the game is worse by the day, there is no balance to older cards, no external market, no campaign, still an ugly SNES-like interface and music, both the devs and most of the community seems to be in a denial state in which everything is ""healthy"" despite the last major tournament 13 out of 16 decks where the same one.The devs don't care about the community (there is only 300-give or take of us), I wouldn't want to imagine how it would be if it was a larger community. There is always an IMBA Nekrium card or more, the main reason I waited 5 months to update my review was to ""give devs a chance to mature the game"". and it just didn't happend despite false promises of ""quicker balance"".Draft is fun, the game engine and concept is fun, but poor design and balance kills it, there's a 4 color wheel but you only see the same one (Nekrium) with another as a sidekick, so don't bother with it. I won't even bother giving full details as to why gameplay is broken, as it's always one Nekrium card, this time it's Duskmaw, if you read my older entries you'll find out it was something else, like the previous one, broodqueen never got anything but a soft nerf, she still dominates games.So move over to some other TCG, don't waste your time like me, I'm too deep like to just leave it now.On a sidenote, Richard Garfield is no longer involved in this mess, he was in the initial design when it was balanced towards 3 out of 4 factions.***Previous review***As of 9/19/14 there's been a new update with a new set of cards, guess which side got the most OP cards? Nekrium! how surprising, on the bright side, SBE is finally doing some rights...Just some weeks after they finally nerfed Zimmus the unnerfying all the Nekrium fanboys thrown their Zimmus aside, but for them to be happy the guys at SBE decided to launch some more OP nekrium cards, so instead of getting beaten hardcore at Rank 3 you can get beaten badly at rank 1.These cards are broodqueen, doomrider and xithian direhound, I don't even bother, everytime I see my oponent playing any of the first 2 I know it's over, I just concede, it's POINTLESS to play UNLESS you got a VERY SPECIFIC Tempys deck that requires... more heroics, in other words $$$ or grind because I have yet to draw ONE of those heroics, set aside the idea of building a deck and pulling one in the right moment.The folks at SBE decided to ""nerf"" broodqueen by nerfing it's spare token, but it can still destroy any creature matching it's level by sacrificing any creature or token that player controls, the other 2 are left untouched.Card design is still as terrible and lazy as ever, there's this mechanic called overload you play a ""very strong card"" and then remove it from your deck, so meanwhile Tempys deals 8 damage and uterra gives +6/+6 to an allied creature and Alloyin does EXACTLY the same as an already existing rare without any other benefits (lets say the older rare metasight is better) Nekrium lets you debuff a creature for -5/-5 AND put a solid 5/5 into play, because Nekrium needs even more power right?On the bright side, SBE added a handful of achievments that can help new players get a legendary each time they reach a win milestone, it's very nice, but it's not enough for new players to catch up.Non-nekrium removal is as terrible as usual, it's hard-gated and still costs a lot of board advantage to get it to work properly, Uterra ""removal"" sometimes ends up benefiting your oponent rather than helping you.Tarsus is still as OP as ever, just some people forgot about him already due to the broodqueen frenzy, in the worst cases which are many, people combo Tarsus with broodqueen.The rewards where a little beefed up from 30 silver to 100 silver (a booster costs 5k silver) setting aside the generous 3 daily rewards which are the core for f2p players.So it's still a GREAT game, really the best among the free to play card games as far as mechanics go, but it's ruined by lousy balance and design.On another bright side, SBE recently started re-adjusting old commons and rares, I think this is great as starting players won't have as many useless cards as they did, IF they keep this trend of re-balancing the old cards I will say this is another great step for SBE, all they need to do is nerf the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Nekrium cards and the game can be solid and enjoyable.It can improve, but we're VERY far away from a desirable state of game, it has a lot of potential, but right now it's still broken, if all classes where equally balanced I would say the game would be very enjoyable until then it's frustrating because most people rely on power-play.***Here's my old review***Okay, before you look at my hours playing it and say ""but this guy enjoys the game"", let me just warn you, I'm a masochist hence why I still play this, but you should avoid it.Solforge is a fun card game, but it has a huge problem, and that problem is balance, developers just sit self-entitedly making OP nekrium (a faction) cards while all the other factions remain gimped in comparison.All nekrium cards outclass any of the other factions, sometimes even combined, to the state where the game has become ""play zimmus, you win"".all nekrium fanboys sit in denial saying there are workarounds, and yes, there are many counters, the problem is they cost ALOT of card and position advantage.Picture this: you can play 2 cards per turn, if you play for example Alloyin you must play a disable (not even a removal) and then your creature and your 2 cards are gone, you must still kill the disabled creature someway and on top of it all, you must level up your disable if you want to use it on higher leveled creatures, if you didn't lost your card position advantage leveling the stupid disable, you won't be able to disable a higher level creature, meanwhile Nekrium has creatures with free removals or removals with free creatures, and the devs say it's fine.There's also the card inequality, meanwhile Uterra has a ""target creature gets +3/+3"" Nekrium has a ""target enemy creature gets -4/-4 you gain 4 life"" in a game where most creatures have 3 to 5 health it's an instant kill.There's an alloyin heroic that gives all enemy creatures -3 attack, there is another alloyin heroic that gives all allied creatures +3 attack making that casting 2 cards, but there is a Nekrium rare that gives -2 to all enemy creatures and +2 to all allied creatures in one card.Great design, props to Stoneblade.90% of the kids in this thing play Nekrium or splash nekrium as it's the easy way to get around, and they maintain their ""everything it's fine"" mentality, but it's not, even when the tournament deck winners are often not nekrium or just splash nekrium but they require alot of legendaries and that's microtransactions or time your choice, I won't say it's pay to win because it's not, you can grind your way out or you can pay your way out.Cards are easily available for everyone at the steep cost of $20 for one legendary or around a month and half of saving silver and not buying anything during that time, knock yourself out, the apologists will say ""oh that's cheap compared to MTG"" the difference is, a real MTG can be re-sold, these cannot.So we get a game with alot of powerplay, that doesn't reward creativity, high costs, and on top of that we get a lousy community with A LOT of AFKers holding your scarce wins back away from you, did I mentioned there is a lousy RNG too? yeah, sometimes you take a game leveling cards to never see them again while your oponent just summons their freaking godzillas twice, because every 4 turns the cards cycle back again.You should definitely avoid this, I'm too far inside like to come out that easily, but if you're looking into it, take a turn around, save yourself time and don't look back, and if this review gets alot of ""not helpful"" thats the fanboys in the community for you.

With this said the graphics are teribad , even for a ccg, music is also bad . And most of all it is super pay to win . the best cards are the highest rarity ones . While other games like runescape chronicles  or hearthstone try to balance the power of the rarities .			"

								Update: 05/12/2014Since the last update the game as gone from P2W to SuperP2W. Now the people who pays can trade cards making them even more powerful than the free players.As a free player, after opening hundreds of free packs and 4 legendary chest i have only collected 17 legendary cards, no even one of these are one of the more know powerful legendaries.My conclusion is that free players dont really get good cards, for that you have to pay. So for all people interested in playing take into account that only if you are willing to pay you can have a posibility to win in this game.Free players dont bother with this game.08/10/2014Like all cards games is a P2W. You only can obtain free cards 3 times a day, whit the first login, whit the first win and whit the 3rd one. The cards you receive are random and fluctuate from a pack of six cards to only one of any rarity. Like this you can get only 3 green cards daily (the lower quality) and be done. This is insane, how can you imporve your cards if you maybe only get 3 greens a day? So you have to pay. You can buy packs for silver but taking into account that you only earn like 6000 silver whit the daily rewards and that PvP only give you 100 silver for a winned match ( who normally take like 20 minutes to end) you can only affort to buy one pack a day, so another 6 cards to add to the 3 of the dailys, not really too much, right?And theres only that in the game, free PvP (you enter in a MM who put any other player agains you) and tournaments who are full of people who have payed her way in (full of decks of legendary cards). Nothing more, no campaing no nothing ( i dont count the PvCPU who is based only in the basic decks of the game and very easy to beat).You can have fun for the firts hours of gameplay, after that you crash to the wall who is the P2W and the game becomes much less fun.In resume, stay away and dont lose your time here.

												So after not playing the game for a super long time (like a year plus) I get an email from Solforge dev team saying ""Hello Forgeborn,There are only 12 Hours left to get your free 1500 gold! This is something we've never done before and we don't plan to do again. There are no tricks, catches, or caveats. We are literally giving away thousands of dollars in currency just for logging in and playing. Have you gotten yours?""So I'm like, ""why not, I enjoyed the game. I'll login, get a bunch of free money and try it out again, see if I like it."" (1500 is a pretty good amount of gold from what I recall)Login and play some tutorial matches because it's so different from last time, plus there must have been some massive changes that were large enough to prompt people who haven't played in a while to take the tutorial. But I don't get any gold. Mind you I logged in. Thought it would be that simple, like a daily login and I get the gold. Tried logging out and logging in again, nothing. Tried playing other matches, nothing. Sent an email to the dev team and got this response three days later, two and a half days after the gold offer expired: ""Hi,The gold was in the store for purchase at the cost of one silver.""Would have been nice if that was actually explained in the email that prompted me to play the game again. Pretty sure after reading the rest of reviews that this experience can sum up the games changes over the past year and the general feeling that the player base has towards the devs and the changes implemented in the game itself. Left with a sour taste in my mouth. And the game's hella slower than I remember it too. :(Sad, because I remember liking the gameplay when I played it before. If there was a ""maybe"" recommendation I'd choose that, but I'm gonna have to side with no instead.			"

								Obviously you cant do much wrong on a free to play game, but waste your time.Thanks to short game length you do not need much time to figure out how much fun the game is to you, so it might  be worth a try.Still, there are certain aspects that make the game way less entertaining than other card games, which is the main reason i do not recommend it:1.) You draw 5 cards and select 2 of them to play. Each turn you draw 5 new cards.This leads to a situation where you cannot plan your next step, since you do not know which 5 cards you will draw next. This game mechanic drastically reduces strategic options in this game.2.) The 2 cards you play level up. After a certain amount of turns you have access to the leveled cards. Additionally, there are many cards that can snowball within a single turn. If you are simply unlucky not drawing your leveled cards ( or a viable counter), your opponent can snowball to an unbeatable situation quite quickly. This increases the RNG factor a lot, which is quite negative for a card game that already has a lot of RNG.3.) While this game is not actually pay 2 win (as you can get all cards for free over time), there are certain cards that are clearly better in all aspects compared to some of the cards you start with. Some cards are even unbeatable by the starting decks. Additionally the amount of free cards you can earn per day is limited.The game is much less enjoyable if you do not pay for it or grind for weeks to get the cards you need for a solid deck.So in the end.. it offers less strategy than other trading card games and is less casual as well, making other games clearly better.

								The good:There is pretty deep strategy to this game that isn't immediately obvious from the first couple of plays. It has some neat mechanics that I haven't seen in any other CCG.  I have 700+ hours on record, so it cant be that bad, or can it?The bad: ITS SLOWWWW: About that 700 hours.  A  lot of that time was spent playing other games or working while waiting on a slow opponent to take their turn.  Games take too long and players are slow. The only game mode is a 20 minute timer on both sides. Many players rage AFK when losing making you wait for 15 minutes to collect your win.  Many other players play so slowly they take their whole 20 minutes. This is really frustrating to me, as I rarely use more than 5 minutes of my time. NOT FTP FRIENDLY: Decks are 30 cards, and most top tier decks use 9 legendaries or more. That makes it very difficult for FTP players to be competitive. Spend money or you will be locked out of competitive constructed games.POWER CREEP: Power creep seems to be a real issue.  Every set has a couple of godawful broken cards that are then nerfed later on (after the paying player base got a chance to abuse them, of course).NO MARKET: There is no public market for cards, instead there is a trade system. Its okay, but a market would be much preferable. As it is now cards have little value. COPY_PASTA: Copy-pasta meta.  I have played CCGs quite a bit, never have I seen a meta so dominated by builds that are blatant copies of winning decks. It makes things really dull. SWINGY:  Recently the game has become much more swingy due to uber powerful cards and combos. By this I mean you may be 10 turns into a game, have your opponent locked down at every turn, ahead on life, ahead on board position, then suddenly you lose. Its pretty frustrating.I dont enjoy the game anymore.  I liked it the first hundred hours or so,  now I just play it due to inertia.			"

												I am heartbroken that i can´t recommend this game, i absolutly loved it and  spend alot of time fiddling around with deck composition and new cards.I dropped it at some point, because I basically had acquired all cards that interested me and was looking ahead to come back later to discover all the new stuff that the devs would put in in my absence.Fast forward about a year, decided to give Solforge a shot again, launched a new client that looked waaay more clustered than it used to in the earlier stages of development, was a little bit put off.That ""little bit"" changed to a ""whole lot"" when i entered matchmaking, all my cards and deccks I acquired over almost 600 hours of playtime became useless, due to an enormous amount of powercreep present, and while I get that powercreep is present in almost any continously updated game Solforge really takes the cake for me, probably because I just invested such an amount of time in filling my collection which is now useless.A true shame, the concept was, and still, is great.Go get Heartstone instead, more bang for your buck and for your time.Also better balanced.

								Went from a ""time and patience"" game for users who didn't want to spend money to be able to compete with the people who bought all the strong cards out the gate, to directly catering into a pay to win game. Now you can not earn the in game currency or event tickets without going against another person, who 9 out of 10 has bought into the game since the start and has a full deck including the strongest legendary cards. I got to the point of having 2 each of a majority of legendaries to where I could make a deck able to hold its own against some meta decks when I wanted to play against others, but now that ended.

								Unbalanced cards, expensive Pay to Win, noticable powercreep, no turn timer, and extremely luck based gameplay will make you regret ever playing this game and wasting your time on it like i did.It started out very promising, but went only downhill. Its not even a real trading card game like mtg - there is no actual trading. Only a very confusing and easily abusable and unreliable way of ""cardsharing"". Hell it lacks almost every feature possible! All there is to do is 1on1 online dailyfarming and draft. It will get boring and repetitive very fast.BEGINNERS BEWARE - it is nearly impossible to catch up with building your cardpool as f2p-booster contain cards from every release and there is a new release every 3 months with minireleases in between and doing your dailys will be chore due to the suckiness of the starter decks.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this.UPDATEGame is now officialy dead. Well done.			"

								A cool idea, terrible execution. There's a reason for all those negative reviews piling up recently: Solforge was patched into oblivion. It's inaccessible, matchmaking is terrible and even although the cards and the system itself are cool, it is endlessly frustrating to play.Play Duel of the Planeswalkers instead.			"

								Edit: The day after I wrote this, the Varna expansion was released. Blatant powercreep, a lack of limitations on legendary cards, and ridiculous powers for those legendary cards has basically turned matches into the typical who-has-better-cards and curtailed the amount of strategy in the game. There is no purpose to owning any cards othen than the top 2 out of 5 tiers for the most part, with a few exceptions. Sadly, you'll only get a legendary chest about once a month as a free player, and considering the ridiculous price of a single chest, it's kinda tough to justify the purchase, especially knowing the next set will powercreep your collection out of the game. While I'm gonna stick around for a bit and hope the tide changes, it's pretty difficult to recommend right now. ~~~I've been pleasantly surprised by this game. While there is a power advantage to having rarer cards, there is enough of a synergy requirement, and a large enough playerbase, to prevent it from being too annoying thus far. The card-leveling mechanic is really engaging and refreshing. It adds progression to a CCG that isn't found elsewhere, along with another strategic layer. The small deck size (30) helps mitigate the odds of not drawing the card you want. This creats a slight negative in that deck variety is a little limited, but after 100 wins (which I reference because that's the achievement that just came up) I'm still excited to load up a match. The tounaments are a lot of fun, and seem to be pretty accessible (~2 per week as a free player, maybe more). I got in through the Humble Bundle, which gave me 2 starter decks, and I've been pretty competitive (though I wouldn't recommend buying the packs, as the cards have been powercreeped out), winning at least half my games, though I have a lot of CCG experience. The 4 factions have distinct styles, and seem very well balanced.The interface leaves a LOT to be desired, but it gets the job done. Hopefully it gets a serious makeover in the near future.			"

								SolForge was my favorite CCG.  Then they updated it into an ugly mess.  The store page says ""battle against the computer"" but they removed rewards from ai battles.  I have a large collection and used to love playing Random decks vs ai, but random is no longer an option.  Gameplay feels slow and clunky due to the new ui.  A great core game that is weighed down by terrible design choices.			"

								Solforge is a card game with a new formula, and it's leveling up cards while playing a game.Each turn you draw 5 cards and you get to play 2 of them.When you play a card, you discard a higher level copy into your discard pile.Cards you don’t play get discarded themselves with their current level.PRO:+ Lots of different & beautiful cards + Updates also add new cards, besides fixes and so on.+ New idea of leveling cards is refreshing for a card game+ SAVING WHEN IN A CAMPAIGN MISSION: press return to menu, you can find your unfinished game in the play menu. Other (card) games can learn from this feature.+ Campaign is challenging, first some proving ground tutorials, then mastery games,… (winning a mastery gives you a legendary card of your opponent !)+ There are tournaments: constructed (your deck against another), draft (pick cards and make a deck), expert draft. (higher position in tournament, higher rewards) (Losing in a tournament still gives you card packs.)+ Some cards can be forged cheap (most of them are not)+ You earn cards& card packs by playing the campaign (also rare, heroic and legendary) (Yes, I got a lot of heroics and 2 legendary by opening packs the game gave me.)+ Daily rewards (win 1 game a day, win 3 games a day) will get you a card pack and other rewards (win online game, win 10/100/1000 online games) give you even more. 10 online games completed => legendary chest !+ First items from the store are at a discounted price, so you can buy these by playing a little ( got enough silver& gold &2 decks via a humble bundle)+ You can buy additional deck slots in the store.+ Price for card packs in the store is ok (but I never did) CON: - Booting up issues- Collection loading issues- Collection: the button to switch from list view to card view is hiding itself very good, took me a while to notice it.- The font used for the text is somewhat blurry, but you can adjust that. (But the text itself is nicely done.)- Very short campaign.- Mastery missions in campaign => excuse for the game to cheat on you, this wouldn’t work in real life ! Example: only 1 card may be played when you begin the match, they play 2,…- Decks, event tickets, legendary chests, daily cards, special packs, are expensive ! Even the ‘discounted chests’ are expensive.- Constructed tournament is pay to win, they all have superpower decks, including new cards you didn’t buy or legendary cards which are just too expensive.- Access to tournaments is expensive from 3-7 event tickets, to large amount of silver you can’t obtain by just playing the game, quantities of gold that require real money !- Alternative legendary cards not forgable, you can buy them in a daily rotation card scheme (card of the day), but this rotation scheme also includes normal legendary cards.- You can only break down a card if you have 4 copies of it.- Breaking/forging cards can be accessed by clicking on a card in your collection. Maybe say it somewhere in a tutorial ? Make an extra menu option for breaking/forging cards ?- Breaking/forging cards doesn’t really pay off. => expensive !There are better (Magic) and a lot more more renewing (Card City Nights) card games out there, try them instead.If you already played all other card games, you can try this game.Try the campaign and the drafting tournament.Avoid the constructed tournament, so you won't experience the pay to win story.I could play the game without paying, but then I realised I actually payed because I got Starter deck 1 & 2 & bonus gold from a Humble Bundle. I doubt you can fully enjoy the game without paying for something, but don't understand me wrong, the game also gives you cards etc.			"

								SolForge is an interesting take on the digital card genre. It's a fairly simplistic card game, but with a suprising amount of depth / theorycrafting to your decks once you've unlocked some cards. It has the unique aspect of your cards levelling up as you play them; adding a depth of strategy that other card games haven't really explored. Not only do you have to think about what card to play right now, in order to damage your opponent, or save yourself from damage, but you also have to think about the future - and which cards you'll want then and how your deck will evolve compared to their deck.The starter decks are playable, but I would strongly advise you to buy some packs (you can use silver which you can get from logging on daily and from winning matches) and get a custom deck going. You will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked taking your cheap/free decks into PvP, but you can win your silver rewards playing against the AI - which is beatable on all difficulties with the starter decks, although the higher difficulties will be a challenge. If you do use real money to purchase packs, you will have a higher chance of getting the best cards, ultimately people should remember that card games are about spending money and RNG, but overall this is very playable as a free player too.One of the big advantages of this game right now to me is that the Ipad app is extremely fluid and responsive. You can play untimed games with friends and the push notifications are accurate - meaning if you have a lazy day with 5 minutes to spare here and there, you can have a good duel with your friend from anywhere. (Untimed) games save despite the application being shut down; and you can start a game on the ipad and continue it on the PC, or have the game running in two locations at once if you so desire. A lot of digital card games right now have promised this sort of cross platform interactivity, but few have competently provided it yet. The android app is sadly not out yet so I can't comment on that - but they have said there'll be one in the future.I'm pretty happy with it overall and would recommend.			"

												CONS:There's no game economy to drive collectability. So earning the promo's are only for bragging rights in a very small community of players. Most of whom do not care at all about bragging rights.The leveling system and randomness is still unbalanced and frustrating.Has the feel of a pay to play, rather than a pay to support good work.Developers focus too much on releasing new cards with new mechanics rather than trying to improve their brand, or gameplay.PROS:They're still working on it, so maybe it will come around.The weekend warrior events, especially the constructed events where you don't need to own all the cards and limited events are the saving grace. I enjoy playing them quite a lot.			"

												Great game and the idea of transformation as the core makes gameplay fun and entertaining. I split most of my time playing CCGs between this and Hearthstone, which is also pretty great.Sadly the campaign in this game is incredibly broken. If all you'd like to do is play in online battles, then this game would be great for you as you can obtain great cards and content just playing online alone. However, if you wish to play the campaign it takes endless amount of time to devise a strategy to beat each individual boss. One of the most broken characters in the game is Cercee, who kills you in one hit after about 10-15 turns, every time, unless you have the proper card in your hand to prevent it. While accomplishable, it's infuriating to play against an AI that can defeat you with one card, even if you maintained all of your health up to that point. Each enemy campaign player also has passive abilities that you are never allowed to utilize as well. (I.E. whenever a creature hits you, destroy that creature. Whenever your creatures deal damage, gain that much health. All creatures have aggressive. etc.)(Cercee -> Whenever this creature deals battle damage to a creature or player, deal damage to them equal to their HP,)It would be far better if they would make a campaign that had a story to it instead of pitting you against incredibly broken enemies instead of fair fights in which they simply have better or equal cards and you need to out-strategize them.Sadly, in the campaign's current state (which is half the point of the game), I cannot reccomend this game to someone who is looking for a game to enjoy without requiring them to play against other people that will probably be willing to empty their wallet into getting the most OP cards.

								I have tried to keep an open mind since the big update that pretty much killed this game but in the end the game is just not as good as it used to be.  This is perhaps a perfect example of exactly how not to use an open alpha or beta. The developers put the nails in this game's coffin by releasing a whole new client as the 1.0. instead of using the open alpha to release incremental updates and get feedback. They scrapped the old game entirely and released a whole new one after an exceedingly long time of zero public updates.The new client is absolutely horrible. The new flashy animations are headache and eye strain inducing and detract from the gameplay. The game is buggy and unresponsive.  The update has pretty much removed everything that was conducive to bringing new players to the game. When I first started playing I had almost no cards and would lose almost every single pvp match but I was able to earn cards daily by playing the A.I. and now I probably win 75% or more of my matches. You can no longer earn rewards in non pvp matches so good luck getting started.The game log, which I use to use extensively is now mostly useless which will further alienate new players as it is now harder to understand what has happened in a match.Overall the game is just not fun anymore and probably on its way out with new players turned off by the ever increasing number of negative reviews. Developers take note, use the benefits of an open alpha/beta and don't make this same mistake.So to break it down, most of what this game had going that made it stand out as the best TCG out there is gone. I could go on for a while with the plethora of things broken by the update but I'll just end it here and uninstall.			"

												This game contains the stupidest AI I have ever had the misfortune to play againt in a CCG. You start with 120 health and have to reduce your oponents health to 0 to win. On the HARDEST AI difficulty setting I have to play ""kill the opponent without losing a single health point"" for any sort of challenge, and even then I beat the AI 95% of the time... and this is where the AI and I are playing exactly the same deck.I understand the programming an AI to cope with so many cards can be a challenge, but countless other CCG games have done it without a problem. There are certain cards that get a bonus if they are placed in certain slots on the board but even if the board is completely empty and I have no creature in play that the AI needs to counter it still plays its creatures in the slots that WON'T get the bonus. If I have a creature with 11 damage and only 2 health left and all the AI has is small level 1 creatures, I have lost count how many times it refuses to sacrifice a 2 attack creature to kill my 11 attack creature but instead puts it in an empty row where it's not going to do anything, so I get to inflict 22 damage on the AI without issue. The AI is SO DUMB that when I'm playing my ""end the game with 120 health"" and I am below that number so I am waiting for healing cards to push my health back up I have to start replacing my OWN cards with new ones that won't attack until the turn after next because the AI is so stupid it plays cards in a way that would cause it to lose even on its hardest level.

												I have been playing this game since the beta and first was amazed by the graphics and sleek design.The game has changed a lot with new cards being added, the built-in store offering more and tournaments being released.Now, that is not necessarily a bad thing.I could tell you about over-powered cards now that can dominate a whole game but let me assume that every strategy game has at least one of these.Instead let me tell you what I have noted as a casual and none-paying gamer:You start the game off with (naturally) weak cards and are being pointed to the campaigns that serve as tutorials and also offer stronger cards as rewards for completing them.So after you have mastered the first, let's say, four of them you might feel the urge to test your cards on the field against real players.Now this is where it goes wrong for me. No matter if you choose a ranked or un-ranked game, the opponent you face will have stronger cards than you. The change to win any game with just a handful of compaigns completed is about 1/10 if you are lucky.There are a couple of ways to get cards beside through the (limited) campains though:1. buy with real cash (easiest and most promoted as this is how this game is financed)2. complete quests (win 1 online game, play 4 games etc) to get game gold or random cards2.1. forge cards (requires game gold)Attention: I do not consider the tournaments here since I have not entered any. Reasons to be found all over the review.Now here is the funny part: You either have money to pay for cards and win (the greatest deal of) games against non-paying players resulting in more cards and game gold to forge and/or buy better cardsORYou do not have the money to pay yourself to victory and a strong deck. This means you have to play. A. Lot!This way you can at least get the daily quantity quest completed (play 4 games). Let's say one game takes half an hour and you only play 4 per day to get one rewards which is either 6 cards or a bit of game gold (of which you need 3 to 4 portions to buy 6 random cards). In each random card deck you get the chance at two higher ranked cards. To get there you need to put in two hours per day considered you do not get lucky and do win a game.Are you doing the math?If you are a hard-core player or one with a great budget, then this game could be something for you.The decision is all yours!

												I REALLY want to give this game a good review, but...I just can't.Good:- The mechanics of the game overall are fun and easy to understand- The single player campaign helps learn how to play and provides cards to help make decks - The columns mechanic and the overall number of different mechanics in the game are fun and varied, allowing multiple playstyles- The game also has a fairly helpful and welcoming community.Meh:- The daily quests are helpful for getting some cards and tickets, but there's no variation at all in daily objectives. Might help to have some easier ones for new players (the 1 and 3 win ones can be nigh impossible for new players)- No trading (At least that I've seen). Makes collecting cards to make a half-decent deck to play with regularly that much harder and slower- Weekend events help with gaining cards, but still are heavily geared toward those with a vast library. It seems only 1 out of 3 events is one allowing the player to use cards they don't ownBad:- The curve to get into playing the game is steep. Unless you just don't mind taking your lumps getting beat a lot for a while until you can get some cards in your collection (like 6mo+ of it), expect to spend a fair amount- Their customer service is atrocious. I submitted a ticket about a problem with my account 2 months ago and heard back once about 3 weeks after. When I replied to the response, I've had no response since. Brough it up on their FB page and had the same response there. One person from there replied and been weeks since I've heard from them. Certainly makes me not want to spend any further time or money on the game- In a similar vein, it seems like there's very little contact from the company with the community (at least that I've seen). I get it's a smaller company, but nowadays, there's zero excuse not to have a community and/or social media manager to interact with the community.As much as I find the mechanics fun and different, I just can't recommend this game to new players until the company pays more attention to the customers and they can lower the overwhelming curve it takes to get into the game for new players.

Waiting 5 minutes for your cards to show up in the deck builder is ridiculous. Fix the lag issues, and I may try the game again sometime.  Diamond in the rough			"

								Updating review since the new client has released.First the improvements based on my last review: Turn timer is here now, which is a relief. Also a ladder system in place, which is great. Patching frequency is too early to call yet. Communication is better (but still not that impressive).The negative: Feature loss, deck builder going backwards being one of the most crucial (especially for a game like this). Still lots of visual bugs. Discard pile bug is extremely annoying. Mobile platforms seemed to be neglected...buttons and scrollbars are too small, display does not scale to full screen, cards are smaller, cannot double tap to view cards anymore..etc etc....Still not recommended....yet. (my 2000+ hours is simply because I put in a chunk of money and I will continue to sink my time because I am an invested fool.)			"

								Solforge is an awesome card game. For anyone new joining in I recommend searching for Kaelari's Ladder on the internet. It's a website we all use to communicate, compete and learn. You can ask literally anything there and our top players will surely help you. There are also guides in the menu there... new players have HUGE advantage if they visit this.Currently the game is in an awesome state. Fresh start could be hard if you are not properly informed. So come and we'll surely aid you. I know I would have quieted long time ago if there was't such an awesome community so rounding this game.Hopefully seeing you there, Soreg1			"

												SolForge - The DOTA of card games****************************************SolForge is that rare card game that can suck you in for countless hours with its unique gameplay. I have been playing this game for almost 2 years, and the new UI update has finally brought this game close to par with other competitors (atleast the pc version). The base concepts are simple, yet lead to so many different strategies. Deck synergies can make a heroic deck easily beat legendaries, and that is where this game shines. There is no one designated way to play this game, and a good levelup deck can drag a win out with 10 health remaining, and 1 turn away from loss. The satisfaction of dumping out a L3 Iron Maiden or Chrogias is just amazing.The gameplay has gradually gotten more polished over the last few years, and concepts like aggressive, mobility, vengence, flank, ambush, poison etc. keep old cards from fading into obscurity by coming back into gameplay with new deck synergies.Pros:1] Unique card levelling gameplay, where the weakest L1 cards become L3 behemoths, and L1 powerhouses become wimps at L3. Its all about deck planning, and identifying the right levels for a deck to peak at.2] Great card synergies3] Specific cards to run counter-strategies against cancer decks4] New game update finally makes games much faster5] Dailies give enough to start playing random draft eventually, and help build up silver to start forging specific cards.6] http://solforgegame.com/shop/ usually has a few prebuilt decks for new players, though for some inexplicable reason they aren't  available in the in game client anymore.7] CARD SHARING !!!Of course, SolForge does not come without a few cons as well, but they aren't so big that they affect the core gameplay, which probably in itself is a big win.Cons:1] Building a good free collection takes time, especially getting 3 drops of that 1 card you're looking out for. But this is inherent in any free to play game.2] Buying card pack boosters with gold (cash) can get expensive, especially when looking for something specific. It is a lot better to collect silver and forge cards, rather than hoping for a random drop from a booster pack.3] Offline wins against AI no longer completes dailies, thereby removing the easiest way to collect cards and silver.

								When I first picked this up a few months back for an hour or so I shrugged my shoulders and tossed it aside (foolishly) having just spent a day or two on the vastly inferior bloodrealms I felt the similiarity of the lane style one card face off style fooled me into thinking they were the same game. I was wrong and the beauty and the simplicity of this game is that the choices you make early can completely change your end game strategy.As a CCG I will personally score this game highly because it breaks away from the Magic the Gathering formula that many recent ccgs are clutching to (Hearthstone, Hex). Though I love the game in the case of Hex, Shards of Fate, the best way I can put it is that they made some very basic and simple modifactions to MTG mechanics and cards and tweaked it to take advantage of digitial playing field. To be honest its nearly a blatant copy and some will hate on that but Hex took a great concept and made it better. Given that MTG has failed miserably and shamefully to be able to do the same with their own product I will just quitely applaud that the product is there to enjoy. I will however stand up and applaud louder when someone strikes out into some different territory and manages to make a few decisions (usually only two or three per turn) evolve into a complex web of moves and counter moves. There's alot here to love and I am ashamed I missed out on it the first go round.There are some weak points I will touch on but I would like to point out that there seems to be alot of hate in this review sections for this game that are centered around the ""pay-to-win"" aspect of this game. EVERY colletible card game has some element of this (Scrolls comes close but you can still get an advantage by tossing in some extra coin) and If your passing this one by because of all the hate you see in the forums or on the internet you are making a mistake. I paid absolutely nothing into this one for the few weeks and acquired a MASSIVE collection of cards to play with. There is plenty of fun to be had here without paying a dime. The worst thing far and away about this game is the User interface which I have found to be awkward and counterintutitive. There are achievments that can not be found anywhere in game which is a bit odd to me. The collection screen where you make decks is frustrating to say the least. This is a real shame because all the accessibility bonus the core mechanics offer to draw new people to the genres is lost pretty quickly when you can not figure out what is what after the brief tutorial.Overall Solforge offers something great from a mechanics standpoint and the f2p factor gives it a big boost for me (don't believe the hate).Recommended if your a fan of TCG's and want something a bit outside the box.7/10 "

								SolForge is a very interesting digital CCG.  Those familiar with CCGs such as Magic might be skeptical about the lack of an explicit resource system, but the game manages beautifully without lands to pay for your cards.  The idea that you can play any card in your hand is incredibly empowering, but the knowledge that the cards you don't play will be discarded makes for agonizing decisions.  Each turn is a difficult balance between playing for short-term needs and long-term strategy.Cards can be bought with real money, but they're also handed out quite generously through simple play rewards.  One can earn the play rewards by beating the AI, and AI difficulty can be set to make the rewards trivial to obtain.  A downside is that there's nothing that can be done with duplicate cards, but I hardly find this to be a significant fault given how quickly it's possible to build a collection.Speaking of the AI, I'd never have put as much time into the game as I have if the AI wasn't interesting to play.  The Hard AI poses a reasonable challenge, and is great for quickly testing out deck strength.  Humans will always pose a better challenge, but the AI is good enough to making beating up on it fun, and if I can't beat it consistently then I know my deck needs work.I highly recommend SolForge.  It's a fresh design in a world where so many games are simply tweaked clones of those that came before.  It's fun, it's challenging, and it's free to try.  What more can you ask for?			"

								Solforge is a unique card game that stands out from competition in both gameplay and design. Cards in Solforge level up as you play them, from levels one to three, getting more powerful as they go. Decks are composed of 30 cards from 4 factions with no more than 3 of each card, the interesting part being you can mix and match from 2 different factions. Each turn you draw 5 new cards and discard your old hand, and you're allowed to play 2 of these 5 cards in any one of 5 lanes. After 4 turns your deck is reshuffled and every card you played is leveled up. The goal of the game is to get your opponent's life total from 100 to 0.Cards vary quite diversely as you would expect from any good CCG or TCG, there are direct damage spells, buffing spells, cards that allow you to play or draw more cards, creatures that are weak at low levels but extremely powerful at higher levels and vice versa. Within the Creature category there are many abilities they can possess, ranging from regenerating lost health, to having armor that detracts damage being done to their health, to ignoring summoning sickness that other creatures have, and much more.Gameplay is very fun and VERY strategic, although still occasionally plaqued somewhat by RNG as most other card games - however I find it to be completely managable. Balance is pretty decent, there are a few cards that are too powerful as you might expect, but nothing too drastic in my opinion. The main problem I see with the balance is that the rarest cards are, for the most part, the cards that make the biggest (and strongest) impact, the kinda cards you can build a whole deck around, which brings me to the Free-to-play aspect of Solforge.The F2P aspect of Solforge is probably where the game fails most in my opinion (although once again, nothing too bad). Card rarity varies from Common, to Rare, to Heroic, and finally Legendary. Common and rare cards are very easy to get, heroics a little harder, but legendaries are very difficult to come by. You can obtain cards by completing daily rewards for playing, purchasing packs with an in game currency, and of course using real life money to purchase packs/additional cards. I find the prices to be placed on these to be placed too high - HOWEVER, Stone Blade Entertainment (the creators of Solforge) are still testing the market and have definitely discussed lowering the prices, so in a few months they might be better priced.This segways nicely to the next topic of developer communication and commitment. The developers are very involved with the community as you might expect from a game that started on kickstarter, they have answered many questions and made balance descisions based on community feedback. Updates are pushed out decently quickly and I believe an 100+ card expansion is coming soon. Other things that are planned are a card ""forging"" feature, which will give a way for players with excess cards and in game currency to create the cards they still want, and a campaign mode to go along with the regular ""constructed"" and ""draft"" modes and I believe a trading feature.All in all a really great game that has the potential (and I think its potential will be filled) to be even better. In my opinion a real contender in the Online CCG market that is MOST CERTAINLY worth a try.			"

								I was never cool as a kid. Shocking, I know. I was always intrigued by table-top rpg's, and card duel games like Magic, etc. but never really had anyone in my social circle who shared the same interest so I never got into it.Which is why I'm probably really garbage at them now as an adult (except drunk d&d, I rock that!). Having said that though, this game is great. It might be more complex than I feel that it is, but it doesn't seem that way. It is nice and easy to drop in and figure out how to play, the rules are simple but the matches can be intense.The game has a few flaws, but unless you are die-hard over details, nothing you can't overlook to enjoy a quick match here or there. I recommend giving it a shot, since it's free you know, so why not? Hit me up if you do, and see if you can lose to me, since that's miles harder to do than win (against me that is).			"

								Decided to give it another try. I still don't like the game. Many battles come down to just having more effective cards in your deck compared to your opponent, especially because you have two turns at a time. I got stuck on a boss quest where the boss kills any minion that attacks him (which has to be done to defeat him) because it allowed him to overwhelm me with his minions. I don't know how I'd be able to beat the boss when spell cards are not very viable against him, defend only minions would allow him to get higher rank cards and I lack ""deathrattle"" or powerful enough monsters to clear a lane (or all the lanes?) to finish him off after he activates some kind of a shield when reaching 0 HP.

Game over. Basically either you just get your daily packs for a long time or you dump money in game to be competitive. Until then get pummeled if you get to play. nice try but fail. Campaign is good until you get to a boss that they give tons of advantages to and also cheats im guessing to make it more difficult.

tl;dr: The game is fun and free, but expect to sink a decent amount of money into cards if you ever want to win matches.I really want to like this game. It's set up well, a lot of fun to play, and you don't need to sit down to an hour-long play session to enjoy a few games. The visuals are good, and the reward system for playing brought me back day after day.What killed it for me? The power differential: between the library of cards you amass from free play, and what you can purchase in the in-game Store. After months of daily play, I've put together a pretty decent deck. In random constructed matches, I win the vast majority of the time against decks with a similar number of Rare/Heroic cards. However, most random matches pair me up with players whose decks are suffused with Legendary cards (which have been purchased). In these games I'm consistently flattened, even when my opponent makes some serious misplays.If you've ever played MTG before, think of it in these terms: if you're not spending money, you're going to be playing a Pauper deck against top-tier constructed ones. If SB is going to continue this (which is perfectly valid, they're a company out to make money!), they might consider giving players the choice of seeking a random Casual match with low win rewards, or a Pro match with better rewards.If you're willing to spend money to win matches, go for it! It really is a lot of fun.			"

								The game has some very innovative and intriguing mechanics that differentiate it from the TCG genre. Principally the lack of any 'resource' generation and the 'leveling' of cards, allowing for more powerful versions to be played in later rounds. However, it suffers from three major flaws:1) If you are interested in deck building and/or competitive constructed play, don't bother unless you intend to throw down a significant amount of money, or are patient enough to wait (playing every single day) for several years (and even then, you likely won't have close to a full play-set of all the key cards you'll need to play at the top level).2) RNG is a massive determinant in games. While this helps keeps mediocre players 'competitive,' it's very frustrating to have game after game decided by a series of bad draws.3) Power creep. New cards are frequently just reprints of old ones with superior abilities, completely invalidating the older sets. Rather than augmenting existing decks or adding new and interesting folds to the metagame, they simply obsolete everything that has come before.Draft format helps with this somewhat, but without spending real money, you're only looking to play a handful of times per week.While these troubles aren't necessarily peculiar to this game compared to many other competitors in the TCG genre, it is enough to keep me from being able to recommend it.

								Having given this game a good couple of hours (spread over a few months, which makes it seem rather sparse), I feel confident in recommending it to others if only for the novel appeal.In short, drop cards like they're hot! The ""Leveling"" system for the cards puts a different spin on play-style, as well as the zero cost for playing them. The only cost you pay is the regret of having to discard the cards you didn't use but ended up needing. But that's all circumstantial and a bit easier to mitigate once you've a better grasp on the cards and mechanisms.That said, some cards might put you off at first. ""Big whoop,"" you might say, unless it's within the first 'round' or two of hands and you realize, ""Holy balls, the level-ups are incredible!"" So yeah, drop those cards. Even if your ranks are full and the spells you have aren't necessary, it still pays to play *something* if only for the sake of getting a stronger version of it later, and you're on hand 3 of 4 in the round. And again, no 'mana' cost.It has a ""snowball effect"" appeal to it, I guess. Which can be refreshing. While I appreciate the cautious, long-haul strategy of Magic and similar card games a bit better, sometimes I like something with a faster pace and exponential growth - though I seldom see my level 3 cards.This is all online play notwithstanding. I base an assumption of ""Legendary Stomping"" on other reviews, and have had enough experience with Hearthstone to be frustrated by feeling incapable of beating anyone. Fact of the matter is, I'm a heavy gamer, but spread my attention across many games. I simply don't invest enough time in these F2P games to build a strong collection and be competetive. And that'd be a lame excuse to pay real life money, so I won't. If I get tired of playing against CPU and draft tournaments feel too noncommital after awhile, I'll just stop playing again.But again, fun game/concept and worth at least a small chunk of your time to try.

								Waaaay too simplistic.  No resource management whatsoever, pick 2 of 5 cards each turn is like traffic on rails.EDIT: Read the good comentsI gave it more play, verdict unchanged. I did discovr that the play is not as simplistic really, there are battle effects and stuff to evaluate, make hard choices, etc.However I found the playability very limited. You can struggle through the handicaps of the campaign to have fome fun (and lot of frustration), but the real thign would be the online matches on other players. As the vs. AI is limited to your own decks. Online you only get obliterated obviously as everyone else has a magnitude more cards than you. The idea of daily tasks is interesting but when it is 'Win online game' and you can't guess what you're supposed to do.... (earlier edit)I gave it more play, now other problems surfaced:  - the UI is a mess. For good play you're really supposed to know each card by heart. As when you hower over the card, the tooltip is misleading. In this year of information technology do I really need to click on each card every time?    - In deckbuilding it's even more a problem and the filter takes over 2/3 of the screen. - All the local play options I found was playing 2 of my constructed decks against each other. WTF? Others mentioned there was play against random challenge decks.   For a starting player that's no help at all. I'm even confused by the state. Article in News states that after 3 years of EA it launches 2 weeks ago -- yet still listed as EA.  And that time perios should have been more than enough to provide an excellent interface to support play and deckbuilding, I see no reason for a hall pass.			"

								Honestly I like the game a lot it has alot of cool game mechanics different from other card games but ... It has some very annoying flaws. Like there is no skill or rank based match making ... every time I try to play pvp my opponent will have a perfect deck with 18 Legendary cards in it while I dont have 10 legendaries in my whole card collection. Legendaries are not really over powered but they are pretty close so giving player having them a great advantage. Only way to get legendaries is to pay a lot of money or win pvp matches to get silver to get those legendary chests. Yes you can get legendary cards from ordinary packs but it is very very very rare ... also to make the most of the legendary cards is to make a deck solely built arround their strenghts and to do that you need to get those legendaries drawn from the deck rather freguently so you need multiple copies of those legendary cards to make them really op making this game also like many other cardgames of this type more or less pay to win.

												When it comes to cardgames, Im more of a casual gamer and don't have the time nor interest to put hundreds of hours into the game, this might bias this review a bit.The few games I played online I could only fight with the cards I wrestled from the Campaign and a few I bought. There is not much variety in the beginning because it gets costly very fast. Being unable to craft a decent enough and consistent deck out of what I had, I was defeated every time when playing against other players. They were either very lucky or bought enough stuff to create something that is beyond what I could do.This is frustrating and annoying and thus, not something I enjoy. If you don't, too, than this is not the game for you.			"

								I'm somewhere around 700-800 hours of playtime, since iOS progress isn't calculated. I've played the game DAILY since January 2014 on iOS, when the deck customization was implemented to the game.SolForge is one of the two actually proper digital card games around for the people looking for depth in mechanics. The other would be Battle Decks, not Hearthstone, but let's not go there now...-30 card deck-Draw 5 cards on each turn-Start with rank 1 (tech level in game)-Played card gets a leveled up version to your discard pile-Each rank consists 4 turns for each player-Discard pile and the rest of the draw deck gets shuffled when new rank (tech level) begins-Based on actual effects and combinations, instead of flat out power/health of the cards-Most of the cards are capped to rank 3, but these are few that have rank 4 as well (not necessarely better)The table consists 5 lanes. Creatures attack the players, which both have 100 health at the start. The goal is obviously to get that to zero. If there's a creature at the opposing lane, the damage is exchanged. The damage is permanent and not healed on turns.The reward mechanic is VERY fair for a F2P game. There are no premium only -cards.1) You get a booster (or better) reward as daily login and silver worth around ~333% of a booster.2) From a first daily win, you get a draft ticket worth 4 boosters.3) From a third win, you get a similar reward as daily login - booster (or better) and silver worth ~33% of a booster.4) Each win also gives you 250 silver, which is 5% of a booster price.5) With 3 draft tickets, you get to enter a draft where you KEEP the 30 cards you draft. On top of that, you play 4 matches and get better rewards depending on how you succeed. Minimum reward is 4 boosters on top of the 30 drafted cards, which eg. include all the legendary cards in the game.The only real downside is that the legendaries from the past few sets have been power creeped. Legendaries used to be very situational, but the fact that there are now quite a few lengedaries that work.I suggest you play the game on iPad. That works wonderfully.The developer said that there should be a massive overhaul to the UI this autumn, but not quite sure if they'll make it.Highly recommended.			"

								While the central mechanics are interesting, they feel poorly put together. Each turn is basically a coin toss as to whether or not you will be able to do anything good. While strategic play can influence this to a point, the fact that you discard what's left of your hand and draw a brand new one each turn makes planning ahead difficult, not to mention that going several turns drawing level-1 cards which no longer have any impact once the stronger level-2 and level-3 cards appear is incredibly common and will often lead to losing any advantage you may have had, if not to losing the game outright.Aside from the fact that luck is far too great an element in this game, the balancing is an issue as well. Having spend 150 hours of in-game time on this game, I managed to acquire a grand total of 3 legendary cards and there were plenty of heroic cards I hadn't even seen at that point. At this point, I feel like I should mention that not only are the interesting effects mostly limited to legendary and heroic cards and many (if not most) deck archetypes are completely based around them, but in the few cases where they can be compared to the less rare cards they are almost always better. Who'd rather have a nexus core than a thundersaur? Who could make a removal deck without dreadbolt, a lifegain deck without Oros/Arboris or a metamind deck without Drix? Why is Chrogias better than scrapforge titan, echowisp better than ether hounds, hinterland watchman better than cypien infiltrator, etc?When we take the combination of poor balancing, slow releases, and the always overhanging element of luck and then add a UI that would've looked bad in 2005, the fact that card effects trigger in a random order, the fact that there is no reason to play more than 3 games a day, locking drafts to an average of 6 games (not 6 drafts, 6 GAMES) a week if you win half your games, the poor matchmaking and the frequently exploited fact that there are no turn timers - only a chess clock of 20 minutes, we get a game with interesting basic mechanics but unspeakably poor execution.While the review says I don't recommend this game, I actually recommend that you play this ONCE if you're intersted in TCGs, because the mechanics at the base of SolForge are actually fairly interesting and might change some things you take for granted in a TCG. But I do not recommend playing more than that and I beg you not to spend money on this. SolForge might be worth returning to one day, but do not expect that day to come anytime soon.			"

								I see people mostly refer to missing features, stuff like ranked MP which is so obviously missing but as far as I understand is in the process of creation. Being an EA game (something should change here, EA game means something evil and should not be attributed to early access games) I guess missing stuff is normal. Even though, IMO ranked MP for games like these is a core feature, not something one should plan to implement at a later date. Right up there with ""make an online gameplay system"" regarding priority.My gripe with this game is its economy system. I simply have to compare it with Scrolls because there are many similarities. I'm personally not that much into competitive play and in this regard this game really doesn't offer much, past some OK campaign missions and a sub par AI with 0 rewards. Collecting cards and building decks would be interesting to me, had it not been for some problems.So, in scrolls you had (at the time I still played the game a few months back)- 360 cards in 4 factions- possibility to make some 1k gold daily, with a few daily trials and maybe one AI match. 1 hour tops, doable in 30 minutes.- with 1k gold you could purchase a pack of ten random cards, of which one was guaranteed to be a rare card and another two were uncommons. There was also a chance of about 10-20% to receive an 11th, higher tier card.- standard decks typically require one faction so upon choosing your color you practically had a pool of 90 cards from which you could choose.- most expensive cards on the market went for about 1800 gold, which in effect would be an equivalent of 5 LOST online matches, something like 2 hours of your time.- as long as you managed to put up a decent fight, online losses were rewarded nicely. AI matches were also rewarded, less handsomely, but the same principle applies - more fighting means more gold.- there were precon decks which went for 5k and 8k gold so all in all, if you wanted to build a specific deck you could do so without grinding to death. Say, two hours daily for a month should net you 60 to 80k with which you can build almost any deck you want. If you were good in competitive play you could net even more easily.In SolForge you have:- around 570 cards, not really sure how to check the grand total nor how many are there per faction since the interface is lacking in some regards.- easy daily rewards which require three victories against anyone, netting about 2.5k silver, two packs containing 6 random cards and a ticket which you need for online events. This requires about a half an hour of your time, if you played against easy AI probably doable in 15 minutes.- these packs guarantee only one rare card and offer a decent chance of getting some heroic and legendary cards. The problem is you are getting 6 from a pool of ~570. Compared to 10 out of 360 from Scrolls, which also gave one highest tier card guaranteed, this is quite bad.- to make things worse, forging prices are rather high. Common cards go for 150, rares go for 1400, heroic 32500 and legendary 142500 silver. If you decide to build a specific deck with say 15 heroic and 15 legendary cards you will need 2625000 silver which is an equivalent of about 1000 days of daily rewards.- online victories net 250 gold, max 10 daily I think so that could split above 1000 to 500 days of grinding, but with a lets say more significant time investment.- there are preconstructed decks for purchase and a sharing system so that, as long as you can find someone with whom you might share, you can cut deck costs to about $5 a piece.- there is also the option to earn some cards in the drafting portion of the game, which seems interesting and I'd like to get to know the cards a bit better before getting into that. You can play one casual draft match every three days for free, as things stand now.All in all, it is my opinion that, as a card collection game, SolForge sucks due to a bad business model. IMO. Even more so for new players.I'll update this after getting some drafting experience, maybe that can change my opinion dramatically.			"

								I liked this game and played it a lot till the 4-Level Card Addition which is unbalanced and a bad idea of more ranks more fun(if you pay)which gives no room for game knowledge instead it rather adds unbalance to the current game state.Deployed cards can be intuitive and predictable your oponnent will deploy the same card but it will be upgraded depending on the rank now 4-level can be easy to deal with but most of them are 1-hit kill if they reach such level.The huge variety of cards made the game attractive to me at first(i didnt wanted to try solforge i always wanted HEX but its on beta) dont let this fool you it just adds more fancy effects to your deck but there is no actual balance or skill involved on this.You can win a game with just yellow/red(legendary epic or whatever) in your deck and do nothing more than drag cards to the board and you will still win that easy.

								I liked this game and played it a lot till the 4-Level Card Addition which is unbalanced and a bad idea of more ranks more fun(if you pay)which gives no room for game knowledge instead it rather adds unbalance to the current game state.Deployed cards can be intuitive and predictable your oponnent will deploy the same card but it will be upgraded depending on the rank now 4-level can be easy to deal with but most of them are 1-hit kill if they reach such level.The huge variety of cards made the game attractive to me at first(i didnt wanted to try solforge i always wanted HEX but its on beta) dont let this fool you it just adds more fancy effects to your deck but there is no actual balance or skill involved on this.You can win a game with just yellow/red(legendary epic or whatever) in your deck and do nothing more than drag cards to the board and you will still win that easy.

								Reading other reviews: Most complaints revolve around being supposedly pay-to-win. It's a TCG. Compare it to an IRL one, where you HAVE to pay money (often LOTS of it)  to increase your collection, and it becomes FAR less so. Another is RNG. I've seen a few cards that use a ""gain between 1 to 20 health"" and similar, but frankly it doesn't detract that much from the game as you're just as likely to roll crap as you are fantastic.Start out facing the weakest AI level, build up your collection a little bit at a time. When you have collected 3 Event Tickets, start doing the Casual Draft - you keep the cards you draft, which will often include half a dozen Heroics, and are guaranteed at least 3 booster packs after you've played 4 matches with that deck. It's the fastest way to boost your collection. Don't bother buying booster packs with your earned silver, you can collect enough of those by playing, save it up for a Legendary chest.One thing I wish would be implemented is an inbuilt chat and trade function: maybe it's already there but I haven't seen it. Cross-platform is cool too, but the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥on my tablet anyway so whatever.			"

								For a free to play game, I have already spent $40 to buy gold.  This game is very fun if you enjoy games like Hearthstone or MtG.  Despite it's many bugs (constant crashing, having to reinstall the game every time a new patch comes out, inability to edit decks without the game freezing on my andriod device, etc) I will continue to play this game until they release a group of cards that are too broken and ruin the fun of the game.  The newly released campaign mode makes the game instantly accessable to new players, offering a way to expose you to deck ideas and collect heroic and legendary cards early with only a couple of thousand silver worth of cards.

								I see people mostly refer to missing features, stuff like ranked MP which is so obviously missing but as far as I understand is in the process of creation. Being an EA game (something should change here, EA game means something evil and should not be attributed to early access games) I guess missing stuff is normal. Even though, IMO ranked MP for games like these is a core feature, not something one should plan to implement at a later date. Right up there with ""make an online gameplay system"" regarding priority.My gripe with this game is its economy system. I simply have to compare it with Scrolls because there are many similarities. I'm personally not that much into competitive play and in this regard this game really doesn't offer much, past some OK campaign missions and a sub par AI with 0 rewards. Collecting cards and building decks would be interesting to me, had it not been for some problems.So, in scrolls you had (at the time I still played the game a few months back)- 360 cards in 4 factions- possibility to make some 1k gold daily, with a few daily trials and maybe one AI match. 1 hour tops, doable in 30 minutes.- with 1k gold you could purchase a pack of ten random cards, of which one was guaranteed to be a rare card and another two were uncommons. There was also a chance of about 10-20% to receive an 11th, higher tier card.- standard decks typically require one faction so upon choosing your color you practically had a pool of 90 cards from which you could choose.- most expensive cards on the market went for about 1800 gold, which in effect would be an equivalent of 5 LOST online matches, something like 2 hours of your time.- as long as you managed to put up a decent fight, online losses were rewarded nicely. AI matches were also rewarded, less handsomely, but the same principle applies - more fighting means more gold.- there were precon decks which went for 5k and 8k gold so all in all, if you wanted to build a specific deck you could do so without grinding to death. Say, two hours daily for a month should net you 60 to 80k with which you can build almost any deck you want. If you were good in competitive play you could net even more easily.In SolForge you have:- around 570 cards, not really sure how to check the grand total nor how many are there per faction since the interface is lacking in some regards.- easy daily rewards which require three victories against anyone, netting about 2.5k silver, two packs containing 6 random cards and a ticket which you need for online events. This requires about a half an hour of your time, if you played against easy AI probably doable in 15 minutes.- these packs guarantee only one rare card and offer a decent chance of getting some heroic and legendary cards. The problem is you are getting 6 from a pool of ~570. Compared to 10 out of 360 from Scrolls, which also gave one highest tier card guaranteed, this is quite bad.- to make things worse, forging prices are rather high. Common cards go for 150, rares go for 1400, heroic 32500 and legendary 142500 silver. If you decide to build a specific deck with say 15 heroic and 15 legendary cards you will need 2625000 silver which is an equivalent of about 1000 days of daily rewards.- online victories net 250 gold, max 10 daily I think so that could split above 1000 to 500 days of grinding, but with a lets say more significant time investment.- there are preconstructed decks for purchase and a sharing system so that, as long as you can find someone with whom you might share, you can cut deck costs to about $5 a piece.- there is also the option to earn some cards in the drafting portion of the game, which seems interesting and I'd like to get to know the cards a bit better before getting into that. You can play one casual draft match every three days for free, as things stand now.All in all, it is my opinion that, as a card collection game, SolForge sucks due to a bad business model. IMO. Even more so for new players.I'll update this after getting some drafting experience, maybe that can change my opinion dramatically.			"

								SolForge is a fast-paced, balanced and thrilling new experience to the world of virtual card games. While the concept is not relatively new, SolForge introduces several simplified yet intriguing effects and mechanics, chief of which being the ""rank up,"" giving incentive to play cards in certain orders.The game allows you multiple packs daily, and already offers a broad range of campaign missions with challenging objectives and vast possibilities, not to mention the tournaments. No matter what you pursue, there will never be a moment of low activity or a lack of others to play with.Exciting, fresh and unique, SolForge is a must-have up-and-comer on the digital CCG scene, and being free-to-play, offers no excuse not to give it a chance.

Early Access Review
								Back in January, I was a relatively new Hearthstone player who was also relatively new to card games in general. I was watching Brian Kibler's stream when he mentioned he was a developer for another free to play collectible card game: Solforge. He spoke a bit about it and I was intrigued enough to check it out.Now, in April and having played Solforge for a few months, I think I can speak enough about the game to warrant a review. Solforge has four factions and hundreds of cards. Games are played with creatures and spells, the former being placed in any of the five lanes and the latter having various effects. Creatures in lanes will ""battle"" opposing creatures in the same lane. If they are unopposed, they attack the player, removing a given amount of base HP. The first player to drop to zero, naturally, loses the game. As cards are played, they are discarded and ""leveled"", and when a rank is gained, the discard pile is shuffled and becomes the draw pile.If you enjoy CCGs, you will *probably* enjoy Solforge. It has a generally great community, many of whom are always willing to share cards with new players to help them get on their feet, which is really important because, as with any CCG, new players begin with an inherent disadvantage as all the veterans have more cards. This is something that all CCGs struggle with, and not even Hearthstone has a solution for it. Another thing to note is that the developer, StoneBlade Entertainment (SBE), seems to really enjoy ridiculously strong cards. They update often (new cards, nerfs/buffs, etc), but in the few months that I've played they've nerfed some strong cards while leaving other glaringly, fun-suckingly strong cards like Wegu untouched. The card Herald of Destruction recently received a massive buff that makes it as un-fun to play against as Wegu. Luckily (?), there's no ranking system, so games can be conceded without a second thought when you discover your opponent is running one of those decks. (Caveat: beware that complaining about cards will occasionally be met with ""get better"" replies or other variants of the same thing from veterans who have played the game since Kickstarter and will defend all of SBE's decisions to the death)Solforge has some incredible art, like the Byzerak Frostmaiden[hypershotgaming.com] and the Cindersmoke Wyvern[i.imgur.com], and some pretty bad art, like the Weirwood Ranger[solforgespain.files.wordpress.com] and the Tarsus Necrolord[www.ghoxssocks.com], though apparently many of the latter cards are from the Kickstarter, where backers were somewhat poorly photoshopped onto cards.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible Kaelari and his unofficial Solforge Ladder[solforgeladder.com], where you can chat with other players, participate in tournaments of various kinds (the best are the unheroic and unlegendary ones, where the really strong cards that new players won't have are ""banned"") for different prizes, set up trades, and actually participate in a ladder ranking system. Most of the stuff that Kaelari's site does should ideally have been done by the developers themselves as opposed to an unpaid third-party, but SBE is seemingly more focused on pumping out cards than they are with smoothing out what they already have. There is a downside to this ladder, however, and it's that most of its users are veterans, so if you queue up for a ladder or tournament game, it's very likely the person will be better than you. Other than release day for new sets of cards, the number of people who concurrently use the Ladder sits around 50. That means that if everyone's queued (which is never the case), you've got a solid chance of playing the same person more than once. Not enough of Solforge's several hundred daily users either know about the Ladder, or care enough to use it, which is a damn shame, and it'd probably be a different case if it wasn't third-party. Indie developers only have so much money, though.As I said, I think StoneBlade needs change the focus from more new cards (which everyone loves), to doing things like meshing most of the Ladder's features into the game, overhauling the UI, and actually advertising the damn game. That being said, I'd still be hesitant to label this an Early Access game if it weren't for the big blue label on the store page (otherwise it'd just look like an indie game). Despite all its flaws, I do enjoy Solforge a whole lot and I implore you to give it a shot if you're even remotely interested. It's easier to get into than Hearthstone, as packs and cards in general are easier to acquire. SBE recently revamped the Draft (Arena) queue, where now you can pay 2 event tickets (acquired from your first win of the day) to draft 30 cards that you KEEP after the tournament, which is a fantastic value for new players.

								Some of the rules are just a ""wish you have luck, or pay for the good cards"". Because you don't start with all your deck so it means if you daon't have a 100% heroic/legendary cards in your deck, surely you are not going to use them until is too late. Other thing that it's totally worng, is the campaign. Just a joke. Instad of doing something close to be a campaging, they made a few matches against the AI (btw the AI is awful). You can easy do this ""campagin"" in 30 minutes. They noticed this issue and the last match it's almost impossible(cheating rules for the AI of course). So a few easy as hell matches for entertain you for 30 minutes, and other one you can't finish. Good way to make the campaign last more time without work.Too much to fix and not intention of doing it.			"

												As you can see from my hours played, I love this game!The New client isn't perfect (yet) and yes, there are some issues, but most of them have workarounds for now.The basic gameplay is very easy to learn, but the more experience you get opens up a lot of deeper strategy.I've only put in 100$ after 4 months to jumpstart my collection when I knew this game was for me, and now I've got a full collection + for the next 2 years I'm probably safe to buy any card with the free ingame currency (Silver) and I've accumulated enough Even Tickets (from doing your Dailies) for the next 3 years.I'm not a top player (not by a longshot), but if you know a bit what you're doing and use your free resources wisely, you can get pretty far (there are some guides out there), but as with all ccg's, money gets you there faster.There's an awesome fanmade community site with extra Ladders (Standard, Unlegendary, Unheroic and Sealed) + free tournaments with prize support, a live chat and trading interface + a lot of people willing to help new players (http://solforgeladder.com/page/faq) There's lots of interesting and fun cards, a ton of fun decks to be brewed.The ingame Draft lets you keep the cards, so this is the best way to grow your collection and it only requires 4 Event Tickets (you get 3 by just doing your Dailies) and if you win 2 games you already get 1 ticket back, so it's quite possible to draft daily for free.Every Thursday to Sunday there are Weekend Warrior Events, ie tournaments with special rulesEach month there are Elite Events with awesome prizesThere's an inclient LadderPermanent Constructed and Draft queuesI really can't agree with the supernegative reviews on here, sure not everything is peachy but the core gameplay is awesome and very different from other ccg/dcg's and overall the game is very playable and enjoyableThe Daily Rewards are quite generous and there's lots of stuff to keep you busyThe biggest issue imo is the relatively small playerbase right now (altho I've never had a problem finding a game in any of the queues), so it's a bit tough for new players in the beginning, lately there's been an influx of fresh blood but we always need more, so come join us, it's completely free to try out :)			"

								The great thing about early access is that sometimes games actually change for the better and Solforge is one of those rare games to do so.Initally I had a bad run with the game which is pointless to talk about now since those issues are mostly gone now.I really like the systems Solforge has in place, such as leveling up cards during the match which adds a 3rd layer to the game. A card might be bad now at Lv1 but during the match it might be better at Lv2 so do I play it now in order to level it up or do I stick to my better cards now?Their is a lot I would have to explain about the game in order for this review to make sense and honestly even then it would sound confusing so you are better of trying this game out if you like card games.Their is an active player pool still playing even after 2 years and the game is taking the usual cardgame routes in terms of playstyles but the in-match leveling system really sets Solforge apart from its competitors and that is probably why Solforge is still going strong.Solforge is not for everyone, it is middle of the road as far as card games go but it is still young and the expansion packs have really shaken up the formula for how you play this game because originally it had some flaws to put it mildly whereas now it is a deep and engaging experience both creating and playing your deck.As far as I am aware, ELO rating is not implemented yet which I am fine with because matches give no rewards. Win 3 games per day (even against AI, or oddly even from the AI fighting itself) and thats it for the day. No more and no less. The game does have a cash shop, its free to play so of course it does but outside of that everyone is pretty limited in how many cards they can farm a day and while that is okay it does also make playing feel kind of hollow at times because you may need a card to finish your planned deck and after your three wins of the day you are out of options.Or you can pay, of course. Even if you do though their is no in-game ladder showing who is #1 etc and while that may be planned in the future if you are the kind to spend money on games like this be aware that you don't get any kind of trophy to show for your wins but on the flipside if you are not very good at card games then no one can see your low rank in this game so you are classed as equal amongst your peers which is a rare oddity in a competitive game. Matches are too random though so the game is terrible in the face of its competition.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												As you can see from my hours played, I love this game!The New client isn't perfect (yet) and yes, there are some issues, but most of them have workarounds for now.The basic gameplay is very easy to learn, but the more experience you get opens up a lot of deeper strategy.I've only put in 100$ after 4 months to jumpstart my collection when I knew this game was for me, and now I've got a full collection + for the next 2 years I'm probably safe to buy any card with the free ingame currency (Silver) and I've accumulated enough Even Tickets (from doing your Dailies) for the next 3 years.I'm not a top player (not by a longshot), but if you know a bit what you're doing and use your free resources wisely, you can get pretty far (there are some guides out there), but as with all ccg's, money gets you there faster.There's an awesome fanmade community site with extra Ladders (Standard, Unlegendary, Unheroic and Sealed) + free tournaments with prize support, a live chat and trading interface + a lot of people willing to help new players (http://solforgeladder.com/page/faq) There's lots of interesting and fun cards, a ton of fun decks to be brewed.The ingame Draft lets you keep the cards, so this is the best way to grow your collection and it only requires 4 Event Tickets (you get 3 by just doing your Dailies) and if you win 2 games you already get 1 ticket back, so it's quite possible to draft daily for free.Every Thursday to Sunday there are Weekend Warrior Events, ie tournaments with special rulesEach month there are Elite Events with awesome prizesThere's an inclient LadderPermanent Constructed and Draft queuesI really can't agree with the supernegative reviews on here, sure not everything is peachy but the core gameplay is awesome and very different from other ccg/dcg's and overall the game is very playable and enjoyableThe Daily Rewards are quite generous and there's lots of stuff to keep you busyThe biggest issue imo is the relatively small playerbase right now (altho I've never had a problem finding a game in any of the queues), so it's a bit tough for new players in the beginning, lately there's been an influx of fresh blood but we always need more, so come join us, it's completely free to try out :)			"

Early Access Review
								This is a card game in transition, and stone blade entertainment is trying their best to move this product towards completion, but it's not there yet. So consider this a review of a very half-finished game. The game is VERY rewarding for playing. A good 10 minutes a day is all it requires for you to farm yourself some excellent currency and a chance at packs of cards that go from poor (3 cards, one rare) or amazing on a seemingly very random process. The balance of the game is a ""work in progress"" to say the least with some factions having some seemingly near impossible creatures to answer. The investment necessary to kill those cards is so high that you put yourself too far behind to do much of anything against the lesser threats that still kill you. The game pace is great for quick games, and I think there is definitely a niche for this card game in the digital trading card game market, but they need to move quicker to solidify their position with a completed game before games like hearthstone and hex completely lock them out. The one thing as you may have gotten out of this review so far is that the game is truly free to play. You can be very successful in gathering cards with only investing time, and perhaps if there is actually a criticism, it is that they are giving you very little reason to play living opponents at this point. All in all, this game is headed in the right direction for a mobile digital card game especially and for that, this game gets a thumbs up from me.			"

								Good game, very in-depth and suitable for both the casual and compeitive player alike. Even in beta, this game carries a lot of potential.However, it is still a CCG at its core, which means that starting out, you can expect to lose pretty badly. To alleviate that, daily rewards (First win, log in and third win) can be accomplished on the AI, so that isnt as much of a sore point.All in all, a excellent game you should try out.			"

								Solforge is broken to the core. With the player drawing a new hand each turn, and cards not having any cost (You play two per turn, plus extras if you have a free to play card), the game comes down to just what you would expect. Turn tactics. No long term tactics.To put it simply, building a deck in any other card game is about figuring what cards work well together, planning out for certain events and counters. Solforge? Its more about filling your deck with as many ""Good"" cards as possible. There is some thought to be hard, with certain cards working well with spells or deck types. But when you get down to it, the game is all about having the more rarer cards.This system itself is nothing new to card games. Nearly all of them run on the ""If its rarer, its better"" game. However, in a game without hard counters, no saving your cards for later turns, and entire hand wipes each turn, and on top of that, no card cost? It all ends up being a very messy, ""Pay to win"" style of system values the quality of your cards, and your luck, far more than the effectiveness of the deck.Putting aside the game rules for a second, we get to the more (And only, in my opinion), positive aspects of the game. The dev team are oddly running a double sided blade. The game is one of the most unfair, poorly balanced card games I've set my sights on.. Yet you can't fault them on their ethics. Everything you need, you can earn for free via three rewards daily (Logging in, winning your first, and third game). With the devs planning on adding silver rewards directly from online wins. If you found yourself a fan of the game, you'd seemingly at least be in good hands. Solforge doesn't make you feel the need to put money into the game. However, you'll soon find yourself wishing to do just that after experiencing the system itself.With the likes of Hearthstone, Magic, the up coming Hex and the countless other card games around, digital or otherwise, I see little reason to bother with Solforge.

								My review of Solforge used to be longer, and sort of confusing. That, and my impression of the game has changed quite a bit, so I decided to delete the old review.The core mechanic of Solforge, card leveling, is incredibly unique, to the point that a lot of people won't grasp how it affects deckbuilding and gameplay for a very long time. While SolForge seems like it doesn't have much strategy, it is actually incredibly deep, and every turn has very intricate decisions. You have to balance the desire to not fall behind on the board with leveling the cards that are going to help you win later. Using your life as a resource is imperitive when you are behind, and choices such as choosing the correct empty lane to put a creature into can be incredibly important. Tight play is rewarded very well in SolForge.Deckbuilding is also incredibly deep. You see your entire deck every game, which allows for narrow but powerful cards to be included in decks. When building, you have to plan the entire arc you want to follow in game. Do you plan to play very aggressively with powerful level 2 cards, or do you fill your deck with insane level 3 creatures, and build the rest of the deck to buy you time to get them out?The leveling mechanic makes drafting SolForge incredible. Every game I play with draft decks feels unique, since different cards get leveled, based on what my opponent was playing. In short, in a lot of ways, SolForge is too clever for its own good. The game's design is super simple, but the leveling mechanic has a ripple effect on strategy. I have so much fun brewing decks every day.			"

												Despite the numerous bugs (getting fewer) and annoying QOL things that need adjusting, this game is still easily my favourite CCG.It is definitely FTP viable, the game is very generous with rewards, and although new players may get stomped in constructed the draft fromat is cheap and there are guides out there to help players pick. (1 draft a day is easily sustainable and all cards picked in draft are kept in your collection)The vast array of playable decks is staggering. Obviously some decks are better than others and you wont get to the top by messing around with fun decks, but that being said you can still enjoy a 50% win rate whilst trying a few combo-y decks.Great game, can't wait for the devs to sort out their sh!t.

								SolForge is another entry into the recently-full group of Collectible Card Games, but it takes a fresh and unique approach to the otherwise-tired genre. Gone are the typical Magic:the Gathering clone features -- it removes the single card draw at the start of the turn, the 60 card deck slot, and even the concept of a graveyard. Instead, you get an incredibly deep, strategic system that demands you plan ahead, but flexibly (since RNG is still going to determine which cards you see).The most interesting part of the game is also its core: the cards you play level up each time you play them, to a maximum of level 3. Each time you level a card, it gets more powerful, sometimes exponentially so. But what makes this more strategic is that every 4 turns you reshuffle your played or discarded cards back into your deck. Since you draw 5 cards a turn, you're seeing 2/3 of your 30-card deck every 4 turns. It adds an insane level of consistency to your draws, if you plan accordingly.All in all, it's a game that's got a lot more depth than your typical CCG, and it is entirely Free-to-Play if you're willing to take a beating at first. (It takes about a month to really build the card pool based on the current daily rewards, but they're working to improve that too.) Definitely worth looking into!			"

								It makes a valiant attempt truth be told and it does try a few unique things but alas it falls short of the gold standards of MTG and Yu-Gi_oh. The fact that your hand resets after every turn removes a very key strategic element from the game, the ability to plan. Combined with the 0 play cost of any card each round is essentially each player slapping their 3 most powerful cards in hand down.Admittedly there's random chance in all card games but imagine if you will a poker game where after each round everyone discards all the cards in their hand, shuffles them back into the deck and draws a new set of cards; It'd pretty much knock out many important strategic elements of the game. IN this game simply, there's no reason to not play your most powerful cards which is the frist sign that strategy has been pushed to the side in favour of fast games. In MTG there are very good reasons not to play your super cards, because you have to figure what sort of cards the opponent might be having that'll pretty much destroy opr turn the card against you. Moreso in YigiOh because of the trapcard system, here, none of that exists.Is the game enjoyable? Yes, to a point, and that's about the point when you realize winning or losing is basically a dice rolls. Imagine a game where each player takes turns rolling a dice, the first one to accumulate a total of 30 wins. Such a game can be fun and nail biting yes but in the end it can be rather unsatisfying because your actual input in the victory as the player is minimal.A good game for those who want to test the genre of COllectible Card Games but for seasoned experienced players, skip this one.

												This game is interesting. I wouldn't say it's particularly complex as far as card games go, but it has some fairly unique and compelling mechanics such as the central mechanic of continously discarding and ""leveling up"" your cards.For new players, the game presents something of an uphill battle. Your best allies in this battle will be the daily quests, campaign, and the Draft tournament mode. The daily quests give a bit of currency and the occasional booster pack, and also event tokens you can use to enter Draft tournaments. (You get 3 tokens daily, Draft costs 4 tokens. If you get at least 2 wins, you get at least 1 token back, so it is possible to do at least one draft daily if you do well). The Campaign mode of the game serves to teach new players how to play the game, and gives some rather nice rewards to get your collection started, including some packs, currency, and a couple very solid cards.The Draft mode is perhaps unusually generous, you not only get rewards based on your number of wins, but you actually keep the cards you drafted. After completing the Campaign, rinding out this mode should be the primary goal for new players, imo. Sadly, the constructed deck side of the game is Pay2Win AF:1. Generally speaking, Heroic and Legendary cards are objectively more powerful than lower rarity cards, and2. You can have up to 3 copies of any Heroic or Legendary card in your deck, same as any Common card.This results in the best decks being composed of multiple copies of high-rarity cards that quite simply overpower opponents that can't afford to do the same. Particularly in the ranked ladder you'll run into nothing but people playing legendary after legendary. The game is free to play, and if you like card games there is definitely some enjoyment to be had here, but don't expect to get very competitive with it if you don't pay up or grind for a year or two. And if you choose to pay up, don't expect it to be too cheap, either. A ""monthly discount"" offers 10 booster packs for $5, And the only guarantee in such a booster pack is a Rare card, which are cheap to craft and generally quite underpowered compared to Legendary cards. And no, sadly Heroic and Legendary cards are not remotely close to cheap to craft. A rare costs 2500 Silver (in-game currency), a heroic is 25,000, and I don't even know how much a Legendary is since the 50k I've saved up over ages of playing this game isn't even enough to see the price. :')Booster pack costs 7,500 silver, and you can only buy the basic booster with Silver, recent expansion boosters are real-money currency only. The daily quest that gives silver is like 2500 I believe. I've read it costs 100,000 Silver to craft a Legendary card. So that's quite a bit of change to craft one card, and you'll likely need 3 copies.. plus 3 copies of several others.Rarity for this game goes: Common < Rare < Heroic < Legendary.As for a recommendation.. Running into people with full Legendary and Heroic decks can be a very frustrating experience, and I've played quite a bit of this game, have a few Legendary cards of my own.. but you playing the occasional Legendary just doesn't compare to a unified, themed deck running multiple copies of all the best cards. But even despite all that, I can still go back and try some new card combinations, make a new deck, and overall just enjoy myself for a while. And the game is free to play after all.. so even though I believe the ranked ladder is P2W.. I'm going to say yes, I would recommend trying out this game. It's also available on mobile devices so that gives it some bonus points. (As an update after spending all the tokens I'd saved up on drafts, all my silver on packs and crafting a few cards, etc.. I do find myself with the knowledge and a decent enough deck (or two) to climb the ranked ladder to some degree. But, I did have the advantage that some time back I bought a Humble Bundle deal that included 2 of the DLC decks for this game, and having those extra cards does definitely help). Anyway.. Yeah, the game can be fairly entertaining. Give it a shot.			"

								I signed up for the Early Access for Sol Forge but ended up being unable to play it on my PC unfortunately because it runs into a DEP windows error which I have been unable to solve and the DEVs said they would look in to it but never got back to me. I can only assume it isn't common enough to be worth their time to figure out what it is. After trying a bunch of different things on my own I gave up in mid  August which is when they went gold with it. Full disclosure: I do have the game installed on my laptop too and that works fine but I rarely use my Laptop at home (where I have a guaranteed internet connection) and when I do go out with it I usually have other things I need doing instead. Sol Forge seems like a fairly basic game but I can't really say whether I like it or not since I've never played a person with it, only the bots which are predictably bad. My ""no"" is with the caveat that is you like simpler CCGs and don't want to really think too much during play then Sol Forge might fit your bill. But Caveat Emptor. There are no refunds (if you buy packs and then find it suddenly doesn't work for some reason) and no one will care if it doesn't work for you.My initial reason for getting Early Access had less to do with what I knew about the game (not a lot) and more to do with who was making it. Brian Kibler, Justin Gary and crew have been involved with CCGs for a very long time indeed and have some amazing credentials between them. I've never gotten a chance to play their other big game Ascension but as I understand it, it is quite elegant and powerfully fun. Sadly Sol Forge didn't strike me that way though it has its charms. The 5 factions are I assume just the beginning of the diversity as I am sure many sets will be produced eventually. I hope someday I have something more positive to say about the game.			"

								Having a lot of fun with this now that Draft tournaments are out. Don't worry, you don't have to pay 40 bazillion silver (the in-game currency) to draft. I got 7 silver event tickets from the daily rewards over 3 days.You'll have to grind out boosters a bit to get cards, but the starter decks are pretty decent.  Took me a while to get used to the lane-based battle mechanics as well. NIce thing was just by playing against the AI to get used to the game and cards allowed me to get daily boosters to build my collection.  (Disclosure: I'm also a KS backer, so that helped as well)Looking forward to what crafting & trading features are coming up next.			"

								The Good: Solid card game with a good balance between strategy and fun. Many possible deck variations choosing from 4 different card pools. Nice short games (usually). Very generous with booster pack unlocks and in-game currency. Syncs with mobile versions of the game. Nice level-up mechanic that introduces addition strategy into the very act of playing the cards. Simple, easy to read interface. Great artwork and some of the cards have a neat evolution of appearance as the cards level up. Recent updates slowly add a new expansion set of cards. The Bad: A bit simple if you're a veteran of Magic: the Gathering. Hard to see what the opponent plays sometimes because it flashes by too quickly (although you can go back to the log to look). Only 4 schools/houses of spells. Not as well polished as Hearthstone which has nice spell animations and creature sounds and highlights spells and effects as they happen. Deck construction is a little messy the way the cards are displayed although the filters do help. Slightly clunky menus and interface in general.Overall: Great card game that is worth spending your time in. Great on the go, especially if you link the game to a mobile device. Simpler than Magic but still fun. Lacks the polish and oomph of Hearthstone's sound and animation but far more generous with free card/booster unlocks and in-game currency. That's honestly the main thing that really keeps me hooked to logging in daily. Otherwise, I'd probaly spend more time grinding Blizzard's game which requires a lot more grinding to unlock cards unless you want to spend cash. Ultimately, I am divided between both online CCGs and find them both equally enjoyable in different ways.			"

It helps satisfy my urges for card game play, while remaining bite-sized and easy to consume in whatever amounts I need. (Which was intentional by design).

								This game is a lot of fun if you enjoy games like MTG/PoxNora/Sanctum(the oldschool one) or just strategy games in general. You can play just a little bit to unlock your daily rewards or play a whole lot. There is a barrier to entry element at the beginning if you are trying to play over people (instead of computer) since other people will have a lot more cards from which to construct their decks. This begins to dissipate relatively quickly though as long as you collect your daily rewards for a week or two. Overall this is a great CCG.			"

								 Wanna know how much worth it it is, compared to MTG? BIG TIME. Mostly because it does what MTG doesn't:1. The gameplay is more simplified.2. There ARE no infinite combos; that's because the game is STRICTLY strategy based, where you can only use two cards per turn!3. It's FREE TO PLAY! And no terrible freemium offers, either!4. You can earn cards and booster packs, by simply PLAYING the game! If you like MTG, you might like this, better; it's simple, once you get the hang of it...plus, you don't have to pay, just to play campaign missions! This is a MUST, for anyone who wants a simplified alternative, to MTG.(P.S.; to those who don't know what ""MTG"" stands for, it stands for ""Magic: the Gathering""!)			"

								It's an OK game. There's not too much strategy to the gameplay itself since there's no mana system and you just play 2 cards a turn. While the previews talk about ""leveling up"" and ""evolving"" your cards, the way it really works isn't what you would expect. Instead of altering the card on the battlefield, playing a card puts the next level or evolution of the card into your deck, which you can play once you hit a certain point in the game.I'll try this game out again when it fully launches, but it isn't complex or engaging enough to really hold me, and it's difficult to get the better cards when playing for free.

								A Note before this begins: This is my very first Steam Review. Coupled with the fact I'm rather poor at giving feedback, I apologize in advance for this review's probably not being up to par with most peoples'. I'll be returning to this review to alter and add onto it, as I am oft wont to do; and just as well, as a read of what is below will demonstrate that in a single session, I cannot compose anything even remotely approaching the standards of an acceptably comprehensive body.Disclaimer: This review is based wholly upon my own experience and opinion of the game. I do not claim to speak for anyone else, nor presume to, nor do I believe my opinion to be factual, nor any closer to objective truth than anyone else's. I entrust the reader to understand this applies to the whole of the review, including sentences wherein clauses that disclaim this are absent.___Like more than a few 90's kids, I definitely met the Battle Card Genre growing up. The Pokemon Trading Card Game; Yu-Gi-Oh; Digimon; and many more battle card games caught the interest of so many others in my age group (and beyond, even!). All of these were very popular, I took a look at all of them- and I never took to any of them. The Battle Card game genre was simply not for me, and still largely hasn't been.Even so, there's been something interesting about the genre and many of its products in my opinion, even from a distance. So I've spent time of late looking for one that I might be able to enjoy. Countless ones, I've read of, seen numerous demonstrations for, and found myself uninterested in, just like old times.Then, the two nights preceding the one wherein I write this review, I gave it another try. I found two very interesting prospective games. One, is Infinity Wars. It looks amazing, and I'd love to try it, but it commands space my potato cannot provide.The other is SolForge.Well, I installed it last night, started playing today, and if my impressions must be expressed in a single sentence, let it be this: I, someone who has never played a battle card game before, like, perhaps even am finding love for, this game.I must start with the gameplay itself. As most reading this probably know, the game's playing area consists of ten spaces in a five-by-two arrangement. One strip of five is used by each of the two players; each space can be occupied by a card. In my opinion, this provides enough room for strategy to truly matter, while at the same time not intimidating a player as the presentation of a vast field can sometimes do. This having been said, a somewhat claustrophobic feeling often sets in when placing a card, adding a feeling of tension that can throw a player off-focus- which, in my opinion, is very satisfying to focus through the fog of.Cards come in two variants: Creature and Spell. Creature cards have two statistics, Attack Power and Health, and most of them have a special ability (and/or multiple ones, in the case of some cards) There are four main factions, each with its own pool of cards. Once again, simplicity that provides room for complexity.There are many other rules of the game that I'd love to individually praise, but I realize this is dragging on. I'll probably return to add onto the list and give my critique of each element of the gameplay that I can in kind on one of the aforementioned review edits I'm bound to do. Until then, let us move on.The instilling of a feeling of tension mentioned in the paragraph about the playing field is just as well, as the cards in this game represent troops fighting and dying within the game's fictional universe. That brings me to what I'd like to talk about next: The appeal thereof.In my opinion, the creators of this game have done a splendid job of making the lore and universe of this game very interesting. Each of the four main factions has its own unique characters, locations, and (most notably in my mind) culture and elements there-comprising, including their own unique ideals, established government, and general mindset toward life, the world, and even to each other. If you are interested, I'd advise to go to the developers' official website for the game and read their lore section. The descriptions there are highly descriptive, and will give you an idea of the world one is stepping into. There are no direct third-person descriptions of such nature in the game itself, ironically, nor any link to the official website- something I have mixed feelings about.Even though direct explanations are not provided in the game itself, the game's universe does shine through- and how! In the campaign modes, the ""Info"" bubbles often relay colorful descriptions of the setting in which your avatar (you?) find(s) her/him/yourself, and/or interactions with the culture of the given faction that one will be facing off against.Additionally, and in my opinion most noticeably, the images on the cards themselves associated with each faction give insight into the creatures, constructs, and, in particular, the people and, again, culture of that faction. In my eyes and mind, the characters themselves, their attire, their stances and activities, anything they might be holding, the setting each one is portrayed in, even the variations between the images for the different variations in each card, each and all seem to portray living beings with stories to tell, things to show, and a culture/environment/etc. to go back to after the dust of battle has settled. I find myself imagining what they do in peace-time, and in different situations, what a day in each one's life is like. Numerous specific examples swarm my mind, which I've been tripping over myself on my keyboard trying to type as examples, before finally deciding to leave it at this and hope it is moderately acceptable in the way of portraying my opinion of the developers' success. As I look at this paragraph, I am aghast at the degree to which I have utterly failed to express my true wonderment, and opinion of the importance that each card's image plays in picturing the fictional universe. Perhaps I'll come back and go into further detail.On this note, the artistry of the images themselves is, in my opinion, utterly breathtaking. Even outside of what it does in communicating each character's place in the fictional universe and as an extension thereof, there is much, in my opinion, to be admired. The lighting, shading, and coloration of each item and creature make each one feasible to visualize existing and moving in real, three-dimensional space, even with the obvious fantastical flair of the objects and creatures themselves.There are other elements of this game that are meritorious of praise. I also fully intend to go back and add onto, edit, and otherwise adjust each and every paragraph to be more descriptive, and adhere more loyally to the purpose of describing the experience that I have with this game. Additionally, there are numerous elements of the game I've not yet experienced, such any of the campaign missions beyond the first four, or the Multiplayer mode.From one who never liked battle card games before, and is still wary of them for the most part, this game receives a hearty recommendation. If you're interested in battle card games, and/or otherwise turn-based strategy, and you have five-hundred Megabytes to spare on your hard drive, I would recommend giving this game a try. Though there are card packs for sale (none of which I've yet patronized), the game itself is free of monetary cost. Worst case scenario, uninstall if you don't like, no less the wealthy for having tried it.(Review created/posed 11/23/2015, 10:17 PM, GMT-6. First edited at 1:16 PM, 12/3/2015, GMT -6)			"

								This game is the best CCG I have ever played (and I've tried a few). The recent update to the UI a few weeks back had a rough release, and this led to many of the negative reviews recently, but much of that has now been fixed up, and improvements are being made all the time. And leaving aside the bells and whistles of the software, the underlying mechanics of this CCG are second to none.If you play M:TG or Hearthstone I would highly recommend you give this a try. It takes a while to get your head around the nuances of this game, but there's a great community eager to help new player with friendly advice. So what are you waiting for - see you in the queues!

								Its an alright game. If you dont mind the campaign cheating against you. Online vs other players is ok. But challenging the PC and it will just cheat you. Imagine playing an opponent and he gets to heal completely right before he dies, or an opponent who gets to do 3 damage to everything you play right off the bat. Or am opponent that kills your cards just for successfully attacking them lol.  Now if we got those powers too it wouldnt be so bad, but to just give the PC opponent an unfair advantage is just plain dumb. I mean, its the only way to unlock more cards (unless you wanna pay) and they have to cheat to keep  ya from winning.....MTG had a similar concept where you could use a BIG card that gave you an advantage during the game, but at least your opponent also got to chose one. This is just 1 sided....			"

												Bleh, Enjoyed the game while it lasted.... was great that you could get ALL of the content with out real money, if you played long enough...  And as others have stated, they development team did shoot themselves in the foot as time went on with the UI and the continual changes of the tournament brackets and rewards.  The last two continually made it progressively harder to  keep getting awesome rewards.  All in all, was a fun game that was easy to play, simple rules, no ""permission plays"" (other players could not interrupt your own plays, only on board cards and a few auto triggered cards limited your plays), and I actually talked to devs a few times via steam chat!  Solid cudos points for that in my book!			"

								A Free-To-Play Card game... These seem to be a dime a dozen as of lately here on Steam but there is nothing wrong with that. This one is very straight forward. You get five spaces to place cards and only two types of cards- Creatures and Spells which alter the attack or health of the Creatures. The matches can be really quick or can last a good ten minutes depending on the cards you use. Online is very good and out of the 2 hours I have played, I only had one connection failure that may have had to do with my internet connection as opposed to the game's server.If you like Magic The Gathering or Pokemon cards or the old school version of Yu Gi Oh, I suggest playing this.

								The closest game I can equate SolForge to is chess.  Chess with cards, which means the chess pieces are not always the same, nor does your opponent have the same pieces as you posess. So, why do I equate it with chess. I equate it with chess as it is the only game, I came over to Steam from playing SolForge on my iPhone, I have played on my phone that allows me to think. To really use my brain. The process of using my losses and wins, by utilizing the knowledge and wisdom of other players on the various forums, and building on experience I gain by playing everyday. Rewards me with a  deep satisfaction, and a sense of enhancing my brain as I received over the years of learning and playing chess. I do not know how to recommend to someone well or  high enough to play SolForge. Nor how to thank all those involved in creating and continually improving this wonderful game. Particularly in comparision to the benefits I receive  by playing this game not to mention my  appreciation to all involved with SolForge for their generosity in the countless gifts the give to help their players, which to me is so very kind of them, and when combined with the benefits I stated earlier makes this game, to me, an absolute joy and a priceless gem.Sincerely,Strangebear			"

								I haven't spent a single cent on this game but I find myself playing it more than any other game on Steam or my android.  The great thing about Solforge is that all you have to do is login once a day and/or win a game and you get free cards and Silver.  The Silver you win can even be used to purchase additional booster packs with more cards!  After a week or two of playing the computer, I had a decent enough collection to build my own decks and play against others online.  If you download the android version, it syncs with your PC account so you can take your collection with you to the toilet.The game isn't perfect.  I think the interface could be improved especially in deck building mode.  This is more of an issue with the mobile version of Solforge as opposed to the PC version.  There are still some balance issues to work out with individual cards but that's what patches are for.  Some players will let the timer run out on their turn if they are losing and force you to sit there for 10 minutes because they refuse to concede.  This is more of an issue with the community rather than the game but it's the only time I have ever been frustrated with Solforge.  If you are a fan of Magic: The Gathering or Adventure Time's Card Wars, you will enjoy Solforge.  It's easy to learn but difficult to master.			"

								Quite an underrated gem of a CCG. In my honest opinion I love this game, it has a very unique gameplay in which you level up your cards as you play them, offering some interesting combos and themed fights that will be diverse with each duel depending on what you level. It's complex, yet simple. So if you're looking for something as fun as Magic but as simple as say Pokemon, try Solforge, you won't regret it.			"

Actually, scratch that. what he will probably do, like many others, is wait 14 minutes. by then he is hoping you are doing something else, and he will make a move. if you are doing something else and not paying attention, now YOUR timer will run out, and YOU lose.haha so fun. trolling BUILT INTO the game for losers to exploit how great.draft play: well this WOULD be fun, but honestly is just kind of makes the whole game silly. it's a CCG, and now instead of being a CCG it's just a card game. i guess if this is the only mode you will ever play i can honestly recommend this game.A NOTE: dont assume most players you meet will be playing with just the free cards. people spend enormous amounts of money on iaps, and this game is no different. odds are you will get crushed, ESPECIALLY if you are a new player entering the playerbase at this time.the saddest part of all this is that it's easily fixable by introducing a matchmaking mechanic similar to the one found in banner saga. every card can be given a value based on it's rarity: then players can be matched up to people whose decks ""total rarity"" is similar to your decks. that would make things pretty fair, as it would all be up to skill at that point. the devs will NEVER do this. do you know why? they want you to get crushed. they want your soul to get crushed. because then you will spend money.so just go away now.

								Really great F2P TCG! Very casual player here and I generally just play against bots (dailies) or do tournaments.Recently a campaign mode was added, which was easy up until the last mission... very tough, for me at least. Zimus the Undying was a life-saver there! (gets killed, respawns... infinite loop, AI isn't smart enough to stop it)Can get 1 or 2 booster packs per day and generally the prices aren't crazy in the shop. (sales and such) Lots of grinding if you intend to buy a single Legendary card, though.Balancing is also very iffy here... some cards are totally OP, others are useless copies. Needs some tweaking for sure.EDIT: My hours aren't totally correct; I play this game on my iPad. Probably have 15 hours logged on there.			"

								By today's standards SolForge is not a good game.  You can not directly choose which of your characters attacks the enemy characters nor can you directly choose which of your characters blocks the enemy characters.  You just lay out your creatures and hit the 'battle' button.  Very old-school mechanic which have been repeated by games like Battlegrounds with almost no success.  My review is based on about an hour of gameplay so that must be considered.  However, I don't see much value in this game when other free-to-play games are much better.  Games like Hearthstone, Infinity Wars, and Might and Magic: Duel of Champions make SolForge feel like a college project instead of a full-fledged game.I liked the use of sound effects and graphics during combat...it's about the only appealing thing I found in this game.4/10 - I'll come back in a year and check it out again "

								Solforge is one of the more unique online collectable card games. A feature which really sets it aside, is that once a card is cast, it levels to the next tier, adding new abilities and stronger stats the next time it is drawn. It still has a large amount of depth for something that seems quite streamlined at first.The gameplay is somewhat simpler than more in depth games such as magic the gathering, and luck can have somewhat more of an influence on occasion. This can lead to some epic comebacks and to some fights where you just didn't quite get what you needed. Most of the time, fortunately, your own card decisions and anticipations of the other players moves and deck composition are still strong enough determining factors for victory ( although not all would agree). This is assuming the other player has a similar skill level and deck level to your own,which is not guaranteed with every match just yet, hopefully a ranking system will be fully implemented.Is it fun and worth grinding through and throwing a few quid at ( I've spent £3.50) ? It was for me, try it and make a decision. I wouldnt recommend spending much more than 5-10 quid ot get you going, if anything. You can grind through and learn, learning from other players in the community and your wins/losses.The game has a really quality feature of weekly tournaments, which you can enter with event tickets ( fairly easy to obtain for free). There are constructed tournaments ( pre made decks - stay away until you have some stronger decks made) and draft competitions, where you make a deck from the cards given out. In the non-casual draft, you can actually keep all the cards you pick  in addition to some you win. I can't stress enough the importance of this! you get to keep some horoic and rare cards that are essential to the cores of certain deck builds. It will dramatically increase your card and deck arsenal whilst you enjoy some more evenly matched draft based games. You will have some poor draft tounaments some times, picking the wrong card combos. It's not always ideal, but its quite consistent with choices offered.Yes, some players who are silly enough or rich enough do pay for cards and get there quicker (although high pricing of this approach seems to discourage it, imo). But this is the case with many free to play games. The important thing is you can get there spending next to nothing in my opinion anyway, and I personally found the journey to be a fulfilling one, full of ups and downs.You can also play on your phone or tablet, although lag can be an issue.If hearthstone didn't grip you, Solforge might. If you loved hearthstone, I'm sure you will enjoy solforge as well.			"

								I know I havent played much but I am in love with this game already! I have played alot of hearthstone, and this game, like most card games, reminds me of the Blizzard game, however it has less of the childish (sometimes annoying) noises. Obviously like all F2P games there is a way of purchasing a head start (like extra card packs, tournement tickets, etc) but as a F2P player I have yet to need to purchase such items as the game is extremely well balanced and fair about rewards. Unlike alot of F2P it is easy to catch up to those that pay for such items, if you only put in some effort and time. I would give thi game 10/10, espically as its a F2P that is easy to understand and quick to pick up!			"

If you take everything that makes you frustrated with both games, like a player who has all the broken cards and you have a starter deck, or maybe cards that completely upset the balance of the game, well they are in this as well.

												Earlier this year, Stone Blade Entertainment rolled out a new client for this game, and it was pretty unstable during the launch period. This upset a lot of people and led to a lot of negative reviews on here, which I don't think is particularly fair considering most online games have rocky launches. While the new client does have some annoying bugs, it is way more stable than the previous version, so take those comparisons with a grain of salt.Gameplay wise this game is like a combination of dominion and MTG. I love the core gameplay, although I don't always agree with their balancing decisions. Generally cards have less RNG than card games like duelyst or hearstone, although it still is used occasionally. The monitization model is one of the most ethical I have seen, compared to other online tcg's solforge practically hands out cards.  It's very possible to build a solid collection without spending any money, although it's definately faster if you are willing to spend some cash.The meta is pretty healthy with a lot of variety amongst the tier one decks, and drafting is extremely fun and accesible for new players. If you like TCGs but don't like the monetization model of something like hearthstone, this is a solid alternative and is imo the best online tcg availible.			"

								I've only just started playing, and while my TCG exposure has only been a few matches of Magic, and 10 hours of Hearthstone, I have to say that this is a super fun one. The card art is great for the most part. Each creature card has 3 levels, and the card art changes as the card gets stronger mid game. A really unique mechanic and it's fun to have the game evolve to a stronger and stronger level as time goes on. There's no mana in the game, so you can play any two cards in your hand during you turn, with the hand being entirely rerolled each turning, giving weight to the decision of which cards to play. This is because each time you play a card, you level it up, so the next time you draw the card, it'll be one level higher, often unlocking new abilities.The game's not flawless though, there's not nearly the same amount of polish as a game like Hearthstone, and there's no visible ranking, although the game has a hidden ELO system, and there's a new UI incoming. There's a great card selection, easily over 400 cards, if my math is right. A bunch of different types of spells and creatures, although there is some overlap between them. The best part about the game is that it basically throws currency at you, so you're able to buy a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of basic cards. You get about 2000 to log in each day, and the most common of the cards can be bought for 150. I respect that, and I'm alright with there being rarer cards worth up to 34k. The game's free to play, they need to make money somehow.Overall, I heartily recommend the game. "

								I have a lot of hours accumulated on this because I leave it open a lot. Honestly, for a free card game, it's not half bad. I've definitely gotten some enjoyment from it, and you don't need to invest money into it for cards if you have some patience and play to get the cards from rewards.Pros: Easy to learn, pretty big variety of cards and not pay to win like Hearthstone.Cons: Could just be me but this game does feel more influenced by RNG compared to a game like Hearthstone, which is something I don't like. Can be buggy at times, but it's rare.It's free so you've nothing to lose if you want to give it a shot.			"

								Pros- Very strategic at times (wide decision trees for those who like to mull it over)- Very intuitive at times (narrowing those decision trees, on the surface, can seem quick and easy)- Brewing (executing that master plan with your quirky combos is excellent)- Drafting (picking and pairing happens asynchronously, no advantage for whales)- Free currency (daily rewards in order to collect currency and cards are not tedious or overbearing)Cons- Interface for all devices is slow (you will think sometimes that you are disconnected from the world, but you're not)- Interface for all devices is bugged (which means learning how to play the game well involves a period of trial and error regarding some game input/output, e.g., time clocks, cancelling card effects)- Some card rules and interactions are not made clear (and after researching this a bit, it appears to be more of an issue of lazy programming than it is an issue of making the game newbie-friendly)- Features which have been promised for a while (single-player campaign) have been put on the backburner in favor of some which weren't ever really neededThis game is always changing, but this list of pros and cons has remained the same since I started playing the first Steam-released version.

My favorite feature is the untimed games, so you can take your turn when you have a couple minutes, and put it down until you're free again, by which time your opponent usually has gone.  Makes it much easier than setting aside a chunk of time to actually play out a full match.			"

								I've been playing TCGs for years now, mostly sticking to Magic with a bit of Hearthstone, so when I heard about SolForge I just had to download it.It's a bit different to your average card game in the fact that there's specific lanes you can place your creatures into for attacks, similar to Scrolls, but it works. It's complicated and unfamiliar at first, and seems quite daunting, but the in-game help system is a breeze to use and explains everything explicitly and clearly, without sounding like a complicated rule book. It's a fun twist on the classic genre.A bit un-user-friendly and buggy at times, but I'm sure the devs will make it better for final release.If you like Magic or Hearthstone, give this baby a go. You'll love it.Also, the art is GAWJUS!!! Jus' sayin'7/10 Fun, but UI could be better.			"

Love this game, definitely my choice of an Online TCG.The only money I've put into it was enough to draft, because it is so much fun!

								Ok I am changing my review today.  The game is not at the level of smart one would have hoped for it to be.  Really, with the game as it stands, it is a troll game once you start to get good cards.  The only skil it seems to foster is in draft games: you need to be a good shopper and pick the best produce to fit in in your basket - then pretty much let the game run itself on auto pilot when you play.  Very rarely do you get to use your brain in this game, because:1) card shuffle randomness2) there is no deck for every situation3) does your battle of the bulge beat your opponents blitz?4) rarely does using multiple spells combat simply very strong creature cards- so being cute, fancy or inspired doesn't cut it in most matches against nerd players.Finally, there are a ton of FTP card games out there that have a much more involved system than this one.  Solforge was simply the dumbest easiest one I found and played it because I never played Pokemon or Yugi-oh and was wondering if I missed out on anything.  Apprently, not.			"

												This is my favorit CCG.  Easy to pick up, but the winning curve is steep.  Nothing else like it out there with leveling cards.  Great depth in card combo and mixing factions.  It makes other CCG's seem juvenile... and its FREE!  If you have a sensitive ego, you will be crushed - You WILL lose ALOT!  The campaign will take you through various playing styles, and how the factions fair.  If you get discouraged, maybe knowing that I lost over 20 - 30 times before finding a suitable deck to beat some of the mid - late levels.  Daily quests, draft, and packs are given quite generously.  You can easily rack up 10+ packs in a couple days.  Drafts are awesome since you keep the cards (to a point).  The battle mechanics are what makes this game - engaging, evolving, and dynamic.			"

								I disagree that this game is pay to win, i have never paid for anything within this game and even after not playing for half a year and returning, I find that my old decks still hold up very well vs swarms of new cards I had never seen before including the ones that can go up to level 4. *edit* After checking the shop for the first time in ages I've noticed they have bumped the price of free in game currency card packs by a ridiculous amount, which I suppose could make the game quite a bit more grindy when you are starting out, they have bumped the price from 900 silver to 5k which is ridiculous considering you normally get about 4-6k silver from your 3 wins bonus per day. This is clearly an attempt to make people purchase boosters with real money which is a shame. That being said, what I like about this game is how the combat works, everything gets a lane and everything is required to attack, there is no saving a monster on the field for later nor in your hand as it gets refreshed every turn. This also prevents people from being total asses and just destroying all your monsters and leaving you alive forever like in other CCGs. When you use a card it levels up into the next tier and becomes unusuable until  you yourself level up, as the cards go through levels they get stat boosts and ability boosts, some of them even gain abilities they don't start with.This IS a game you will have to play daily  if you want to have a decent deck though, you need 3 wins per day in order to get all the free rewards which include silver(free currency that can be used to buy basic boosters) and a random item that can be  an event ticket, a card(which is usually terrible and the worst reward) or a booster pack of any tier(I think I received 3 premium packs in the first month of playing). After about the first 2-3 weeks you should be able to assemble a decent deck and after that it's all a matter of tweaking. you are allowed to use cards from 2 out of the 4 factions in your deck which also creates some interesting combos.Legendaries are well...legendaries, they either fall into the massive stats and terrible abilities type or the very  very squishy but amazing ability  type. Legendaries tend to start off way weaker at the first level but become better at endgame, what this means is that if you can put the pressure onto your enemy and  force them to put up normal monsters in order to defend, do it. This will cripple their lategame and potentially make the difference on whether you win or not.Spells are also a major part of the game, there are no traps or secrets just regular spells. They can be buffs like armor, damage,  heals, special abilities like moving on the board or damage that goes through defending monsters etc. Or debuffs and damage: straight up nukes, poisons, debuffing of hp and attack(debuffing hp to negative CAN be used as a killing technique and has the benefit of going directly thorugh armor at the cost of usually doing way less damage than a nuke does).It is a different system to get used to but once you do I find it is quite fun, matches are quite quick and you can play multiple at the same time, plus they just got android support so you can officially play it on just about any tablet or phone now. As long as you long in once a day and do your 3 wins (you can even play against bots if you're lazy since they're very easy) you will have very nice cards. The only cards you cannot get for free are the alternate arts*(essentially shiny cards) they release once a week			"

								Actually turned out to be the best TCG I've ever played. I got an invitation from Blizzzard to play Hearthstone after downloading this, but quickly went back to this. The gameplay requires more strategy and the artwork is more mature. Strangely it's not as complicated as the likes of the Yui-gi-oh's but the card leveling mechanic gives it that right amount of strategy. Great game!			"

												Was better before the UI change. Unfortunately was recently let go from the developers. But then Grinding Gear Games (The people behind Path of Exile ) chipped in along with the playerbase to migrate to a smaller server. The game is back, but currently no new updates. They have plans to do so in the future, if possible. Now, for the review. Graphics:I like the art, but the UI is kind of clunky and annoying to use.3/5Gameplay:This is where the game shines, each time you put down a card, it upgrades to a stronger version for later use.5/5Sound:Not bad, but for me not memorable.3/5Final Verdict:4/5			"

There are some fun tribes to play, and the company does a good job of giving away free stuff to the players.Unfortunately I find competitive play and drafting a little stale. There are some issues with getting the game to recognize friend matches. Also, the daily quests are really really boring. It's the same 4 every day, and it's basically a grind.			"

I've definitely gotten some enjoyment from it, and you don't need to invest money into it for cards if you have some patience and play to get the cards from rewards.Pros: Easy to learn, pretty big variety of cards and not pay to win like Hearthstone.Cons: Could just be me but this game does feel more influenced by RNG compared to a game like Hearthstone, which is something I don't like. Can be buggy at times, but it's rare.It's free so you've nothing to lose if you want to give it a shot.			"

								ORIGINALLY NOT EARLY ACCESS, SolForge is a decent free to play card game with some of the easiest mechanics of any card game I've ever played. Choose cards from four factions (nature, fire, death, and robots), make a 30 card deck, and fight the computer or an online opponent. You get two actions per turn (except for the first turn, when the player can only play one card), and as you play you gain levels in order to play higher-level cards. Any cards you don't play don't gain levels, and any cards you don't use get discarded. Several cards synergize for higher levels of strategy, but overall this is a simple game anyone can play. If you don't mind being limited to only two actions per turn, that is.			"

								Pros- Very strategic at times (wide decision trees for those who like to mull it over)- Very intuitive at times (narrowing those decision trees, on the surface, can seem quick and easy)- Brewing (executing that master plan with your quirky combos is excellent)- Drafting (picking and pairing happens asynchronously, no advantage for whales)- Free currency (daily rewards in order to collect currency and cards are not tedious or overbearing)Cons- Interface for all devices is slow (you will think sometimes that you are disconnected from the world, but you're not)- Interface for all devices is bugged (which means learning how to play the game well involves a period of trial and error regarding some game input/output, e.g., time clocks, cancelling card effects)- Some card rules and interactions are not made clear (and after researching this a bit, it appears to be more of an issue of lazy programming than it is an issue of making the game newbie-friendly)- Features which have been promised for a while (single-player campaign) have been put on the backburner in favor of some which weren't ever really neededThis game is always changing, but this list of pros and cons has remained the same since I started playing the first Steam-released version.

								Pretty much interesting CCG where everyone can get a decent deck in a week or two of daily free card farming. And after that there are two scenarios: either you learn all the game mechanics and winning strategies and drop or you find the friends to play with a game or two and do that from time to time. Mine was the first, but I still recommend the game for all the good memories I get after playing some weeks with people from all over the globe.			"

								This game borrows so much from MtG (abilities, special powers, even some spells has similar artwork..), yet the combat itself is made very primitive and chaotic. Not worth and bland yet another online collectible card game trash.. Tried it again after a few years and i can't even complete a tutorial. All this all lanes attack and the thing that youcan't control who blocks is just so not my cup of tea. Same why i didn't like the Hearthstone. Too much chaos and not enough control of the field.			"

								SolForge seems like a decent digital card game, I have not played it much compared to Infinity Wars and Hearthstone recently but the game seems to have all the makings of a popular digital trading card game (CCG). Hopefully it becomes more popular though or gets a little bit more attention otherwise I dont see it lasting very long. Thats your cue to try this game!			"

												I can see why this game has mixed reviews.I'm a new player. Wasn't involved in the Kickstarter. Didn't play the earlier version. I joined in August 2016 knowing NOTHING about the game ahead of time.At first, it's super fun and addicting. Going through the campaign is SO EASY ... until you get to the final one, and then it's ABRUPTLY, IMPOSSIBLY HARD. Even after improving my decks, getting more powerful cards, learning multiple strategies in the game... I STILL can't beat that final campaign challenge. Ugh. No real transition between effortlessly easy to suddenly impossibly hard.And that's just playing against the computer.Try playing against real human players? Heh. I can't tell a difference between ranked or unranked matches. Either way, once in a blue moon, I face an opponent who's cards and skills are relatively comparable to mine. THE REST OF THE TIME, I'm facing players with tons of ""legendary"" rare cards that are EXTREMELY over-powered and broken, especially when used in the right combination with other legendary cards... Countless times I haven't even gotten a chance to damage my opponent once before they obliterate me. It's beyond frustrating.Slowly, I'm acquiring more powerful and useful cards. But the only way I seem to get ahead (without spending lots of money) is to play a bunch of PvP matches and HOPE that some internet error makes it so they never actually connect with or play against me... the match starts, but they never do any actions, and eventually it times out and counts it as a win for me! Woohoo! After 3 wins, I get a random reward: usually a draft ticket or booster deck. After 6 wins, the same again. And you get a small bonus (usually just silver coins, which are pretty much useless) just for loggging in daily.Draft tickets (it takes 4 of them) allow you to enter into tournaments. If you pick the draft one (not a pre-built deck one), you get to acquire some uncommon and rare cards, and keep them after the tournament. That's the ONLY way I've managed to build up even half of a decent deck after several weeks of playing almost daily.If it's such a bad game, why do I keep playing it?I think it's Flappy Bird Syndrome. It's FRUSTRATINGLY hard. But hey, the artwork is beautiful and it's kind of like playing Magic the Gathering... I don't play this game to have fun. I play it because it's nearly impossible to win (without dumping a ton of money on a deck full of legendary cards) and for some reason that hopeless challenge keeps pulling me back... for now. I never get very far, but once in a while I'll earn a win, and that victory feels f--ing amazing!			"

								Alright, honestly I'm tired of people giving the new client or the new reward system crap and saying you need hundreds of Legendaries to play the game. For the New Client: Yes it has bugs, it's a brand new client and a complete overhaul of the GUI, OF COURSE IT HAS BUGS, and SBE is working on fixing them, however they can't do a bunch of small hotfixes because they're working on three platforms, one of which makes updates really difficult, so grouping a bunch of fixes is easier to do for the devs. For the New Reward system, yes it makes you play against other players which can be a little daunting, but realistically even just getting the ticket for 3 games played is easy as pie and after a week or two of playing and getting cards through draft and what not even the 3 wins isn't that hard. The new reward system drastically increases the ability to get new cards by allowing players to draft every other day. I have played since alpha and can say with certainty that this reward system is sooooo much better than the old stuff. For all the people who think you need a crapton of legendaries to play online: Having a deck that is one of the top teir meta decks is all well and good, but yes it is very hard to acquire in a FTP account, it isn't impossible however, AND more importantly you don't need a top teir deck to be able to play and get wins, hell you dont even necessarily need Legendaries beyond the great ones you can get through campaign, I have a Spirit Wanderer deck, it runs 1 legendary: Varna (who you can get in campaign), and 4 heroics: 2 relentless wanderers and 2 rutheless wanderers, and that deck has yet to lose to MonoNekruim hate (A strong deck running a lot of legendaries), Nekruim-anything Fiend (Dont even get me started on this deck), and Stall/Level Chrogias/Iron Maiden (another one of those obnoxious decks that you see a lot of)I have a Darkforged UT deck, that beats most other decks i've played it against, including a titanium 1 Ignir decklist. How many legendaries does that deck have? Oh... right, it doesn't, I built it for a nonlegendary tournament a couple of my friends where trying to do. Anyways, sorry for the rant I'm just tired of people being super salty about not being able to build ""top Tier"" netdecks, and the client update. TLDR: the game isn't bad, it's quite fun honestly, you don't need a ton of legendaries to make a good deck (you just need to really look at the cards and find synergy) and the new reward system is leagues better for new players than it was in the ""good ol days"" If nothing else give the game a shot, find a couple friends who are okay with building silly decks and troll around, you might find something that beats the meta ;) and you know what if you hate it go ahead and uninstall, that's fine too, but don't pass the game by just because a bunch of people are being salty.

Now that they are moving to full release and their 7th expansion I know that this will be around for a long time. I can't wait to see what new mechanics each set brings. It changes up the gameplay just enough to make things feel new again but it is so well balanced that it has never broken the game. 10/10			"

								Solforge is a great card game which is different to most of the other games out there.   Most CCG's follow a mana bar pattern where you start off small playing critters, then as your mana increases you play bigger controlling cards, ultimately leading up to your big hitter cards which cost the most mana.     I get bored of this format of playing critters->controlling cards->big hitters.     In Solforge the cards you play in the opening rounds could be the most important plays of the game.SBE as a company have listened to their player base and have made numerous requested changes to the new client.  In particular you can now earn rewards against the AI again.   This means that casual players, like me, have a method of daily progression.			"

												TLDR I am a rabid fan who hasn't dropped a dime on this game in 2.5 years but have a massive collection, play competitively, adore draft, and just earned $40 of in-game gold in competition this past weekend.  I am not the only one.Let's be frank, I've sunk a lot fo hours into this game--in fact, I play 2-3 hrs daily on my Android phone, so it's very likely my total horus should be around 3000 after 2.5 years of play.  I have loved this game, I have seethed at it, I have quit for months (a brutal constructed meta in SUmmer 2015) and returned.I don't understand the complaints of the new client's appearance--it is different, and people hate change, but it is easy to read and decipher what is going on and very easy to work with on PC and Android.Is it buggy--absolutely--the Discard pile can be broken by a key legend that levels cards in it, the ability to open the deck can be blocked by use of another popular legend, and if you don't know the right tricks, you can loose a brand-new deck you've just designed because the game forgot it existed.  So, player beware--it isn't a the most smooth UI in existence.  But, the core of thsi game is fantastic--I played MtG for 15 years and have never looked back.  Yes, you can get ""level-screwed"" but is honestly less likely to happen than in MtG or Hearthsone and you always have 2 guarenteed plays and only 5 lanes to block, so it can be survived.you're doing. As to Pay-to-win.  Two thinsg to consider: One, if a player were to drop $100 on MtG and then play in an arena where they are facing vetrans with lots of time and money invested, would we claim it's pay-to-win? Possibly, but we wouldn't assume that if that player had paid $1000 they should have been able to achieve a championship right away either.  This is a game of skill, it has a learning curve, and you are going to lose to people who have played more and have earned up to better cards.Dailies: At this point, you need to win against an online opponent to gain a booster per day--this is not simple, it was easier when you could just beat the computer for two boosters, but SBE has also made it possible to earn 2 tixkets a day just showing up 8 times (heck, you can even concede).  That means every 2 days you can pay those 4 completely free tixckets to draft 30 new cards, many of which can be new rares and heroics, and play to get new cards and silver to craft even more--and let's be clear, the single pack you earn now has a much higher-rarity drop than those of old.To cap it off, I have never spent any money on this game--I have been drafting and building and competing for almost 2.5 years, yes, but I run 3 separate accounts and am Platinum or Titanium ranked on each of them, can accrue enough silver to purchase brand new powerful cards on release, and can compete in Elite tournaments to earn valuable in-game gold for free.  I rarely play anything else; I am a rabid fan.  You'll never know if you can be one too, unless you try it for awhile.

								No time limit during pvp unless you set it to 20 min timed, so you basically are looking at 20 mins matches against a sore loser so you can get the win.Fully P2W decks, every new deck with absurd  I win cards are relased  to people to buy for money first then released to the plebs.  YOu can mix match 2 type of ""race decks"" but  it all go down to the same dual combo from races so youll fight the same decks  over and over.You get to play arena once or twice a week, but dont expect  to win if you dont put some money to get the latests decks.There are better alternatives out there but you are free to try it.

												Picked this game up about a month ago, my first impressions were mixed: After having some issues figuring out how the client worked, it didn't take long to see the amount of depth the game had in turn to turn decision making being cruicial (A hand of 5 cards, 2 being able to be played every turn, the played cards level up as they go to your discard pile which eventually gets shuffeled into your deck again) gave a good first impression of the game. Blowing through the single player campaign facing unique decks which tested my deckbuliding immediatley.After the single player campaign, I decided to try assembling a deck with whatever cards I had and give it a spin in constructed. I faced decks and players way out of my league as a player starting out. My only realistic chance to get my wins for the daily quests (I later learned that if you get a friend or alternate account you can play vs them for daily quests) was that my opponents game time ran out due to the power difference between higher and lower rarity cards.I went to the draft mode since there I figured I'd at least have a chance since the collection size doesn't matter in that format, and was pleasantly suprised in the fact that whatever cards you picked up in the draft was added to your collection. With daily quests providing almost enough for a daily draft (enough if you do well in the draft) made daily drafts became an enjoyable daily dose of SolForge.+: In depth gameplay that rewards playing well. Lots of interesting card mechanics and design (Having a card in your deck adds other cards to your deck, for instance). Generous daily rewards and progression for a F2P game. (Daily draft where you keep cards). If money is spent on buying cards, an extra copy is recieved which can only be given to a friend. Chess clock-esque turn timer, making momentary disconnects Has an app for Android/iOS.-: Small playerbase which throws off matchmaking at certain times of the day. Big power difference between lower and higher rarity cards (Higher rarity cards tend to be more situational to be powerful but usually under easy to fulfil conditions). Initially confusing and buggy client that lacks some key features (chat). "

								No time limit during pvp unless you set it to 20 min timed, so you basically are looking at 20 mins matches against a sore loser so you can get the win.Fully P2W decks, every new deck with absurd  I win cards are relased  to people to buy for money first then released to the plebs.  YOu can mix match 2 type of ""race decks"" but  it all go down to the same dual combo from races so youll fight the same decks  over and over.You get to play arena once or twice a week, but dont expect  to win if you dont put some money to get the latests decks.There are better alternatives out there but you are free to try it.

								The game is still glitchy, it fails to run on my computer and requires a reinstall every day or so, but the fact that I am willing to do that to play this game has to say something.  Its a unique CCG where you shuffle your discard pile back into your deck every 4 turns, and rank up your cards by doing so.  It makes it so you may play a crap card early just because later it get better, which in any other CCG you would avoid putting it in your deck to begin with.			"

								This is a Trading Card Game like no other, I assure you. Do you love playing TCG's? If so you are probably like me and have a tendancy to hate being in the middle of a duel with some low attack and defence card that you just want to cry. Well, this game will fix that for you. Why? Because using a card will not only place it back in your deck when played, but it comes back stronger as it levels up from doing so. Who wouldn't like to play that crappy 2 attk 4 def card and pulling it out again a little later now with 6 attk and 12 def and dropping it on the field next to it's weaker kin? I know I sure would. so if you want to try the new way of dueling, this game is a good haul. give it a shot.			"

								Free to play trading card game, it's easy to learn but hard to master!this game is excellent and has A LOT to offer without spending a dime, the game is really generous with awarding the players free cards and it's definitely possible to have fun and win without paying anything, though you can spend money to cards faster and guaranteed more powerful cards...the powerful cards aren't blocked off from the f2p users though it will just take them longer to aquire them, so in that sense it's not really pay to win.this is so great and I've had so much fun with it so far that I'm even tempted to spend some money on it just to support the developer...I think I'll wait a little though for them to iron out some problems:1) stability issues, especially on Ipad.2) card balancingthat said I highly recommned this game and hey it's free so it won't cost ya to try it.

								OVERALL: It's a fun quick CCG that has depth beneath the simple interface . But SolFoirge feels unfinished; like it's still in Beta. The lack of user trading really detracts from the deck building strengths within the game, and the expensive rare cards generally dictate the good decks. There isn't a ton of metagaming that can be done. It's a good game that needs about twice as many cards to allow for competitive play.I'd play it in a year from now, assuming the above features get added, but I wouldn't recommend it to people at this moment.

								From what I've seen, this game brings nothing unique to the table. It's just a maximum of 10 creatures standing in front of each other, hitting their heads in. Apart from the occasional spell synergy I don't see any interesting strategies to be developed here. Even Hearthstone has more tactical depth than this game, so I would suggest you play that game instead, or of course the vastly superior Duel of Champions.			"

												SolForge has had a tough life, but the core gameplay is still great. The recent updates and changes to the UI have prompted a wave of mostly negative reviews that exaggerate the few flaws the game has while failing to do the good points justice. Yes, some features have been changed or removed from the old UI. Yes, there are probably some more bugs present in the UI overhaul. Yes, it's a little harder to get cards without paying money. These were all necessary and inevitable changes to the game if Stone Blade has any hope of competing with the likes of Blizzard and Hearthstone. And yes, the game is more complicated and challenging than Hearthstone. But it's also more rewarding and innovative.Few if any other digital TCGs take advantage of the digital medium better than SolForge. Because of the way cards level up after you play them, your deck will constantly change over the course of a game. This means that, since you can only play two cards a turn, on every turn you will have to decide whether to level up the most powerful card in your hand or deal with your opponent's immediate threats. This dynamic deck-building on the fly would be very difficult to replicate in a traditional cardboard TCG and is SolForge's best mechanic.Despite the recent patches, accumulating a collection is still vastly easier in SolForge than it is in most TCGs. There are daily rewards for winning games, and you get to keep all the cards you pick from drafts. Booster packs can contain cards from any expansion, which means that you don't have to pick and choose depending on which cards you want. SolForge even has tournaments built in, a feature sorely lacking from Hearthstone and other games. Finally, you can share cards with your friends, making it possible to help others build their collections without spending money.I decided to write this review, because I feel this game deserves a lot more positive attention than it's been getting over the past few years. No one is writing about it, hardly anyone is making videos about it or streaming it anymore, the game is not nearly as popular as Hearthstone or Magic, and, admittedly, the devs have not done a good job of marketing the game to or communicating with their core audience. But none of that means the game has to be lost and forgotten under the weight of juvenile negative reviews or die due to a lack of players. New cards are still coming out, and the UI improvements prove that the devs still care about the game and the players.So I urge you, if you care about the future of digital TCGs at all, play SolForge. Go through the tutorials. Beat a few campaign missions. Do a draft or two. Play a few online matches. And then decide whether this game is worth your time or money. But don't let the grognards railing against the winds of change or the newbies with less than an hour of playtime cloud your judgment. Good luck, Forgeborn. You're gonna need it. "

								Yes, the official launch was plagued by bugs and server-side issues.  Those have been mostly resolved.  It's to be expected from a small independent game team.  Now that that's out of the way, this is an absolutely fantastic game.  The card-leveling mechanic is innovative and adds tremendous strategic depth.  It's much better than games like Hearthstone!Like all CCG games, you can't expect to compete at the highest levels in constructed tournaments unless you spend some money.  However, draft tournaments reward pure skill.  If you want a game where you can spend nothing and 'pwn everyone' this game is not for you.  If you're willing to invest a little, you'll wonder why you ever played any other CCG!			"

								Solforge is one of the best TCG game out there. The mechanic is sharp and unique compared to other TCG I played  (Magic, HS,Duelyst etc) That is why it has gather quite a fanbase whilst it was still in beta. (it has been in beta quite a looong time. 7 sets was released in beta)Everyone was excited when Solforge finally was going to be officially launched on 31st May. Unfortunately, it was not the smoothest launch as the client was buggy and have several issues. This explain why a lot of people gotten upset and start giving negative reviews.Fortunately, SBE have addressed a lots of the issued and fixed the major bug.  The game is still not perfect yet, but it sure shows that the team developing is responding to the community call seriously.I highly reccommend everyone to try this game as it is really fun and easy to pick up. I am a FTP player and have been playing this game for a loong time. I can proudly say I have a reasonably big collection now and able compete with players who pay no problem. Hats off to the guys at SBE, it might not have been the smoothest release but they listened.   Solforge as a card game is wonderful and the client goes a long way to adding the pizzazz so it should be attractive to a wider audience now, once the obvious problems are fixed up.			"

Not P2W, there is some element of RNG here, but that’s expected, much like in MTG, sometimes you just don’t draw the cards you need despite your best efforts to manipulate your deck, it happens.

												SolForge is a free to play CCG still in open beta. It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok. Has Five lanes and the rules are different from other games like this. I don't like games like this much, but have looked at most of these games on Steam so far.  Try it, maybe you might like it.For more info:

								It looks good but the gameplay is quite boring. Just outlast to level 3 units where you will actually duke things out. PROS1. Nice VisualsThe artwork for the cards are great.2. Easy to LearnJust play 2 cards every round if possible. Preferably choose units over spells as the stat point growth for units far exceed spells. E.g. Stone Giant 6/9 to 20/20 vs a 6 damage to 12 damage.3. Interesting AbilitiesArmour (Negates X damage on the first hit), Aggressive (Attack on Summon)4. Campaign is okayIt's still another AI battle but it's campaign is better than some other online TCGs that I've played E.g. MMDOC (Google it) CONS1. Peculiar mechanicThe idea of a default mechanic where you gain a higher level card by playing a lower level card first is quite strange. E.g. Play a Level 1 card to gain a Level 2 card of the same card.2. Repetitive cardsCard Levels go into 1, 2, 3. The next level is merely a buffed up version of the first card. E.g. Cull the Weak: Destroy any creature with 4/8/12 attack and below.3. Pay-To-WinYou get normal booster packs with Silver (in-game currency) and rare booster packs with Gold (cash currency). People who spend cash on this game will get better cards than those who don't.4. No Trading SystemCan't see anyway to trade your cards so your cards are valueless.5. Low Multiplayer CountHardly anyone playing.6. TournamentsMinimum number of event tickets to enter is 2. You need to pay cash to get these tickets. With such a low player count, I wonder why they even charge.7. BugsLot of bugs8. No unique narrativeStandard undead horde, wild animals, technology city and primordial tribe cards. This is the same story as Infinity Wars. There is nothing unique.			"

The default decks are worthless, so you basicly have to buy gold coins to unlock the good boosterpacks that contain Rares and Legendaries (you can unlock normal boosterpacks which only have a tiny tiny chance for a Rare or Legendary).

								My favorite card game was Yu Gi Oh series, and it was great, but this game's nowhere near Yu Gi Oh. I had big expectation but came off disappointed.Game's pretty lackluster, from repetitive background sound and seemingly too barebones battle mechanic. Graphic is ok though - like the art direction and animation.Tutorial missions are there to help you, and they're good enough to introduce the mechanics in general. My own experience was quite good with the tutorials, but I had to replay them once each to understand better. Just me being bad here.In game micro-transaction also ticks me off. But hey, the game's free and it's still being developed. Hopefully they can polish this more to compete with the upcoming Heartstone by Blizzard.			"

Original Review:The new Client is AMAZING. Everything runs so smoothly now. Any frustrations you might have with this game, give it another go, it's like a whole new game.  I love that there is a Ranked Ladder now, one that costs me nothing to participate in. And the new ticket prices for Draft (and you keep the cards) is very generous. Probably because of the double reward thing going on right now, I've been able to play one draft per day. Very nice. Managing to pull a win via Forgeguardian Omega in Draft was a delicious highlight of the new experience.I bought 10 Raiders Unchained pack to pump up my collection a bit. Love the new cards, love the new combos that I am able to piece together. That's what I like about Solforge, it's ability to consistently reinvent itself.I am still hoping for word on official No-Legendary Tournements, but that might be bad for business, which I totally understand. In draft, all Forgeborn are equal, so it's not a huge issue. A friend of my did mention that he would like to see Standard play (ie, we only play with the most recent sets). It would make things more interesting for sure, but not as accessible to everyone.The naysayers haven't played this game enough lol. Their hours are seriously lacking.			"

								This video game is extremely misogynistic and problematic.All the female characters portrayed on these trading cards are highly sexualized, eroticized and sometimes even outright explicitly treated as sex object, oppressed by the male-looking, dominant, imposing and pretty much naturally oppressing trading cards.The game is also biased against womyn by not giving female players the same rewards that the male player gets.

								I never had any interest in card games like this (for example, I found Magic the Gathering vomit-inducingly awful and boring) but this one caught my attention. This leveling mechanic is quite neat, and I'd definitely recommend trying it.As every card game out there it is pay to win and currently booster packs on offer are questionable value, but this is offset by the fact that they are giving you cards/currency for free every day, so if you play it long enough you eventually get everything for free (of course if you'll like it you'll also likely buy some stuff).I'd definitely recommend trying it. No reason not to, it's free.			"

								This game is kinda like playing a game of yatzee. far too random in its approach. at first it looked like a game i could really enjoy. i used to play a lot of magic and i saw a lot of similar elements. the problem lies in the rank system. you play a level 1 card and it ranks up to level 2 making it more powerful so as you go a few cards that you play get more powerful and the rest stay at lower levels. then you get to rank 3 and its entirely random as to getting a full hand of nearly worthless rank 1 stuff or getting an amazing hand or even set of hands with lots of high ranking stuff. this is pretty much determines who wins. many games i felt like i could have just tossed a coin in the air to decide the winner and that doesnt make it very fun. there are better cards you can accumulate as you play that give you more of an edge but i'm not really willing to spend the time or money to get there. The draft system is also poorly imagined. you choose 30 cards for your deck but not from a pool of cards. first you pick one of 6 then one of 5 and 4 etc. frequently i wouldnt want any of the cards or just one but it wouldnt be the color that i want to play. there are 4 colors and you only get 2. there are amazing cards and i got a few on the first draft. i went 2 and 2. the second draft i played i felt like i got nothing useful and won 0 games. i recognize that sometimes you get a good hand and sometimes you dont but when it takes a week to get enough tickets to play draft i'm just not willing to waste the time needed.

								Solforge is fun. The pricing is outrageous, but the battles go to luck way more often than they should. So really if you play long enough you'll amass one of a relatively small number of effective deck types that can usually be summarized by a two-card pairing of whatever is unbalanced for this development cycle. But it's fun enough. Seriously though, don't spend more than like 10$ on this game.			"

								I will start by saying that stoneblade has produced a card game with an innovative and very interesting core mechanic. However I have exhausted a considerable amount of time into the game and have come to the conclusion that RNG 'feels' like it plays too large a hand in the game.Without going into specifics becuase people who are reading this may not have experienced the Solforge leveling system, I will say that more often than not you will lose matches and 'Feel' like you had absolutly no power. And unlike magic wereby matches you lose due to RNG are lost in the first few draws due to mana, Solforge matches are lost turn 20-30 around 10+ mintues into a match.Basically an average game of solforge has you play a card you will need leveled later and then you cross your fingers in the hope that you draw that card when you need it. But more often than not you will never see that card again and if you do see it there may be no benefit in playing it. In conclusion I don't mind losing when the game is close but the majoritiy of time you will lose because the level 1 creatures you draw will NEVER beat those level 3's your opponent keeps playing.

								SolForge is the only online CCG I have seen that makes good use of the online medium: most online CCGs could just as easily be done in cards, and most of them fall short of MtG; leaving me little reason to play them. SolForge, however, uses a leveling mechanism that could not be done in a paper CCG; and exploring the leveling system and the need to think not only what you want to play now; but also what you want leveled for later in the game, makes SolForge the one online CCG I am likely to keep playing.

								As a CCG, SolForge is one of the most solidly constructed games I've played in years. It takes full advantage of the fact that it exists in virtual space to explore mechanics that would be difficult or even impossible in real space. Also, instead of banning or restricting cards, if a card becomes unbalanced in play, they won't hesistate to update it to make it more functional. However, they don't go overboard changing cards all the time, either.Like all the best games, it is fairly easy to learn, but hard to master. The basic concept is simple. You draw a hand of 5 cards, of which you can play two. There are spells and creatures. Creatures occupy one of 5 lanes. When you play a card, it levels up into another version of itself, usually a better version. How much better varies from card to card. Each turn you battle, any creature that doesn't have summoning sickness attacks the creature across from it, and if there is nothing across from it, it deals damage to the opposing player. At the end of your turn, you discard your entire hand, and draw 5 new cards. After four turns, you level up, meaning you reshuffle all your cards back into your deck, except now some of those cards are higher level. And this repeats, with your deck getting stronger as the game goes on.  There are four factions, and each of them plays differently. Decks are 30 cards, and can be made of one or two factions.From that simple structure, there is a lot of depth in the game. This game was designed by Stoneblade Entertainment, the same company that created the Ascencion deckbuilding game, with the help of Richard Garfield (creator of Magic: The Gathering). Most of them are Magic protour veterans as well. The plan, for now, seems to be to release one major set and one minor update each year. There are timed and untimed matches, as well as tournaments and drafting. The game is built to be free to play, although it is still in beta, so many things like a single-player campaign and trading cards between players are not in yet, but the game is updated fairly regularly. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is keen on strategy games or CCGs, and the free to play nature makes it easy to try out.			"

								This is a fun game to play, and it's easy to pick up the rules and jump right in.  For a casual gamer like myself, that is a big plus.  The mechanics of ""leveling"" a card were new to me at first and took a little bit of time to get the hang of, but the best times I've had are figuring out good combos to play.  I played M:tG years and years ago, and at first I tried to approach SolForge like that, but I was not very successful.  I like that there are a bunch of powerful cards that you can work towards and hope that they turn up in a booster, but the ability to purchase basic booster packs using silver you win in game is a much easier way to start growing your collection.  I don't like that you can't trade cards (hopefully that get implemented in some fashion, someday down the road), and all the tournaments that I have entered were filled with very powerful decks (so I lost almost every time), but overall, this game is a great way to spend 15-30 minutes at a  time.  It's still in beta right now, and they tweak the cards when trying new game balances, but it is very polished and I have only had one or two instances where something buggy happened.  Lag is sometimes an issue too, but that might be my local connection more so than anything in the game itself.  Give SolForge a try, it is worth it.			"

								SolForge is a strange and quite unique CCG. It contains four ""Factions"" modeled after Technology, Nature, Life and Death. Each Faction does have it's advantages and disadvantages and you must combine two factions together to create a near-perfect card-dispensing, death-dealing deck! However SolForge is not quite as polished as other CCG's like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, nor is it as publicized. However It is worth playing equally as much as the other CCGs. Originality: 6Mechanics: 7Polish: 5Rating: 6/10 SolForge is an interesting game, though it lacks the polish others of it's genre have.			"

								This game is an incredibly well designed CCG cross platform game. The card pool(which is only expanding) allows for incredibly dynamic play and lots of cards to look for and collect. The game allows for you to spend some money and jump right in with the best decks or you could learn day by day with a wealth of cards given out every day. One of the best parts is that you can have it crash on your laptop/desktop and then immediately go to your ipad or mobile device and finish the match there. Also it means that you can play when on vacation if you can't bring a PC with you. In general I think that the game is quite amazing and despite minor bug fixes(which are totally within acceptable standards) the game is incredibly well desgined. "

								This game reminds me of Shadow Era, another F2P TCG. The basic concepts are similar; it's just the execution that differs with each game. Even the Uncharted card game for the PS Vita doesn't deviate much from the core objective of whittling down your opponent's life points while getting rid of any obstacles in the way.I like that the game already seems to have a solid foundation. Of course, LOADS more improvement is needed but even at this early stage, I feel confident enough to give it a recommendation. It has a lot of potential. Two thumbs up!Now, if only they wouldn't charge us so much to buy gold... I have a few suggestions regarding that:1. Let us earn some gold by playing the game.2. Give us more bonus gold. 5% bonus gold is just measly...3. Charge us less for gold. It shouldn't cost me in the vicinity of USD20 just to buy a faction starter deck. That's outrageous for a F2P title.			"

								The game is quite fun, and has many deckbuilding options. The lane based combat is an interesting difference from other TCGs and CCGs that I have played. The daily rewards allow you to play free, but buying gold credits with money can get you competitive faster, and allow for more tournament play.			"

								It is a good game but still in a rough spot in terms of some aspects.  It is worth the small download, but it'll take you quite a long time before building a really competitive deck even if you pay in since every card and reward you get is random.  There is no trading yet or crafting, which is the real issue... but that is reportedly coming... eventually.Also, if you do enjoy the gameplay, you'll find yourself required to log in every day to play 3 matches to collect all your daily rewards.  4 matches if you want to get every daily reward (the last one must be versus real players online but the first 3 can be earned from playing against the cpu).  It doesn't take a lot of time but it is required and a little bit of a menial repetitive task.  This can be a positive for some people and a negative to others.			"

								It's a great game with a few issues that come with developing a whole new genre of game. Online play is a bit laggy and will probably be your #1 gripe, as it is mine. I've been in since the early days of the kickstarter campaign and it is great to see the team continuing to develop the game. The Reddit sub (/r/SolForge..duh) is actually pretty active and they arrange tournaments and so on; as are the major websites (Forgewatch is the most popular). Anyway, give it a play if you think you'd like Hearthstone ; it's a similar game, but it is developed by a team of people that really knows games and includes Richard Garfield (the guy who invented Magic: the Gathering).

Several new cards got introduced and revamped, they seem to be listening to the player's concerns and keeping an eye on balacing.This game takes me back to my early days of playing Magic the Gathering and ironically, when i had the most fun.

								Alot of depth to the game, once you start getting some cards from the daily booster packs you will soon find tha you are able to make amazing decks, i find that a lot of the fun of the game is the deck buiding... Read the other reviews here and noticed one saying that the worst thing about this game was luck, first of all its a card game, second, if you build a deck well, you should always have options, maybe not the best options but if everything was given to you on silver platter you would soon find you craved a challenge.There are some very strong cards in the game, but nothing is without a counter, for example there are cards that can win game  on their own, that i why you have cards like botaminate that turn a single enemy into a  seeding :)Great game, loads of fun, very tactical, if you give it a little time to build some cards and learn strategies you may find yourself loving the game			"

								A fun digital CCG that is simple compared to genre mainstays, but complex enough that deck building can be its own reward and reason to come back.  Sufficent and regular card rewards encourage you to keep playing, and the F2P barely gets in the way of the game.  Not perfect, but if you're looking for a way to scratch your card game itch you can do much worse than SolForge, and the price is right to give it a try.			"

								For anyone that has been following me on Youtube for the past few months, you probably noticed that my focus is on digital TCGs. And SolForge has been one of the most commonly played games. Currently I am sitting at over 150 hours played (though some of that may or may not have involved accidentally leaving the game on overnight a few times) and I have played countless hands. The style of this game is what I would call a lane game (as opposed to a MTG-like or a board game like game like Faeria).First of all it is free to play. The game comes with 2 precon decks that are not in your card pool as far as I know (meaning that those 4 legendaries between the 2 decks you do not own). The prizes currently are fast to earn. Every day at midnight pacific time it resets. You get bonuses for loggin in, first win and 3rd win. The prizes are silver (free to play currency which can be used to buy play mats, the smallest booster pack, and deck slots), and randomized prizes which currently only includes cards or packs.The pacing of this game is the most enjoyable I have ever played. It is easy to play a 5-10 minute hand and just as easy to lose yourself for hours at a time. The basic gameplay is so simple that I think my cat could learn it. But the strategy does present itself if you give the game a chance. Leveling up is the resource in this game and you need to play the right cards at the right time to progress your deck properly. There is still plenty of luck... but trust me. It is less than you think there is the first time you play a hand.Plans for the future include: booster drafting and in game tournaments (coming in next patch that will be ""soon"").A new 20 card psuedo expansion which will be added to the current set. Save your silver to buy those new packs but don't be afraid to open any packs as old ones will not have new cards.Graphical and UI upgrades.And most importantly some form of trading and crafting. If you are not in this game for the long haul now is the time to warn potential players. The pack system is currently very frustrating. You can only get the 3 card pack for free now. I recently opened 110 of these packs and only got 2 legendary cards. Premium packs guarantee 1 legendary card. But they cost $10. And there is no way to guarantee getting the legendary you want unless they are in one of the faction starter decks. Legendary cards aren't necessarily always better. But they add depth to decks and make certain strategies work better (or make SOME viable since they do not work without specific cards). Between the fact that there is CURRENTLY no trading or in game card crafting, it can be very frustrating for new players. Or even players like me. I Kickstarted this game. I used my store credit to buy 1 of each starter pack and 145 of the middle sized booster packs. And there are still numerous legendary cards that I have 0 copies of.This game is good enough that I recommend it to anyone that loves lane based CCGs. But I want to say. If you are easily frustrated by RNG with packs. If MMDoC made you flip tables because of the lack of trading. I recommend just doing your daily bonuses against the AI, playing occasionally with your friends, and waiting until trading is implemented in game. If you have the patience to slowly build a decent card pool, then go for it!  Otherwie just remember that beta is beta and SBE is still a small company. And there are plenty of CCGs out there right now while you wait for Kibler, Justin, and the rest of the team to continue developing SolForge.			"

								I've been playing this a lot since the first set was out.This is my go-to game when just chilling with my buddy who also rocks this game.Testing decks, reaching infinity (unlimited plays per turn, nice challenge, try it!)Thinking long and hard about draft choices, debating nerfs. so much fun if you enjoy strategy.Gameplay wise, this is MUCH more interesting than hearthstone, much more choices, less of a reliance on legendary's.One of my strongest decks atm (U/A spawn deck with scarabs, weirwood patr and lifeblood dryad)has only 2 (Ancestral Echoes) but they mostly make the deck slower and worse.Although it really needs a ranking system, I disagree with the p2w sentiment of some other reviews.People seem to think you can only get silver through online matches, but the best way to get cards (and to have major fun on equal footing with other players) is the draft system. The normal draft (3 event tickets, 1(+) ticket per day) nets you 30 cards to keep.this will fill out your collection fast and with the forging of excess cards, this will give you20.000+ gold for each draft. Not to mention the pretty large amount of legendary's i got from winning draft games. Too bad you can grind it all day, but this has given me a full collection everytime before a new set came out.    protip;  NEVER BUY LEGEND CHESTS Just think up a deck which needs them or netdeck the current best or something.Play for 5-10 min every day to get draft tickets > draft > sell > buy specific legendary.this is way better, not all are equal in usefulness and the chances of getting a truly good one are slim.  just get some thundersaurs or nexus aeronauts through buying.To make a long and incoherent story short;Try it, now!  just play it for 10 min of fun every day and soon you will have a decent and viable collection to toy with.tell your friends, we need more ppl playing.And stoneblade, thanks for making this awesome game, but make a ranking system. It is frustrating to go up against  twinked out meta decks if you are new.			"

								The transformation mechanic at the heart of solforge makes a very nice change of pace from the standard ""mana"" based card games. However the game is very much pay to win, heroic and legendary cards are often straight up superior to commons or rares: this makes putting together a viable constructed mode very slow if you don't want to pay big bucks.All that said the draft mode is excellent and a lot of fun and the daily rewards are very generous, a great game to play casualy			"

								After playing SolForge for a while, I can say that it's no Magic: The Gathering, but it isn't bad. You get one booster pack per day just for logging in, you can earn more by winning games, and there's a single-player campaign mode that - while fairly thin - still provides a good tutorial first and a rather crushing bit of challenge later on. Will you run up against truly unfair decks online? Oh, hells yes. Will you eventually make crushingly unfair decks of your own? Sure. All in all, it's not a bad F2P - and I define that as ""A F2P that you really don't have to spend money to enjoy.""PROS: -Interesting gameplay.-No need to spend money, though earning cards through winning will take time.-Single-player mode intact.-Also available on AndroidCONS: -Some minor balance issues, although some of the most broken cards have been taken care of over time.-Repetitive music.-Getting your first competitive deck together will certainly take a while.Overall: 7/10. One of the better card games available on Steam.			"

								SolForge is a great CCG in the vein of Magic: The Gathering.  Unlike Magic, SolForge is much faster and easier to understand (although it still has quite a bit of strategic elements).  Also, SolForge is well adapted to digital play, compared to many CCGs that are really only ""paper-based"" games.  SolForge's uniqueness is in how it upgrades your cards as you play them, so your Level 1 card becomes stronger (Level 2) the next time you play it in the game.  It's quite a lot of fun to try and turn your small ""squires"" into giant ""Knights"" as you play.  The price to play is a bit high, in that you need to buy a starter and if you want more cards, you will need to acquire more boosters.  You can earn some boosters by playing each day and earning in-game currency (silver) to purchase more packs, but it is a slow process.   It is still in Beta design, but I think it's going to a great game once it's totally completed.  Both constructed and booster drafts have recently been introduced and are a LOT of fun.  Originally a dream on Kickstarter, SolForge has become a really fun and enjoyable reality!			"

								Excellent implementation of the CCG style in the digital age.  Love that I can play from my PC and also from my phone and my collection is linked.  Drafting is awesome.  Particularly like that you don't need to queue up for a draft and you can play your games over an extended period of time rather than blocking out 3 hours of your day.			"

								This game is a lot of fun and you can certainly sate your craving for a collectible card game type experience with it.  While there  is strategy involved, a lot of the game is dependant on luck and the quality of the cards you have.  The good news is that you can assemble a decent deck relatively easily.  The tournaments are a lot of fun, especially the draft tournament, but the cost/time commitment necessary to participate is a little steep.  However, for a free game, I think it rates as one of the best.			"

								I enjoyed the game while I played it. The lane system was new to me and very interesting and fun, as was the leveling system for the cards. The game could have taught more at the beginning rather than just throwing you in, but it wasn't too hard to pick up still from a few games with the AI. The graphics weren't amazing, but they didn't need to be. The game overall felt really well put together. My only complaint lies with there being no way to track your dailies (Win 3 games, etc) and the difficulty to get the higher level cards without paying. Neither of those prevented SolForge from being a lot of fun though			"

								Fantastic freemium CCG with great mechanics. You can make some truly fun and unique decks using their system.Best parts:1. No resources (mana). Instead, cards power up as you use them so it's about strategy and choice.2. Really free. Can get some of the rarest cards in the game without ever paying.3. The most competitive decks don't need the rarest cards in the game.Worst parts:1. Still buggy at times. Game graphics crap out, and daily rewards are animation delayed (but still register).2. Friend finding for games don't work very well across different platforms. I've tried playing my iPad friend using my PC and it keeps reseting our game.All in all, fantastic and easy to get into. A wonderful CCG.			"

								This game is kinda like playing a game of yatzee. far too random in its approach. at first it looked like a game i could really enjoy. i used to play a lot of magic and i saw a lot of similar elements. the problem lies in the rank system. you play a level 1 card and it ranks up to level 2 making it more powerful so as you go a few cards that you play get more powerful and the rest stay at lower levels. then you get to rank 3 and its entirely random as to getting a full hand of nearly worthless rank 1 stuff or getting an amazing hand or even set of hands with lots of high ranking stuff. this is pretty much determines who wins. many games i felt like i could have just tossed a coin in the air to decide the winner and that doesnt make it very fun. there are better cards you can accumulate as you play that give you more of an edge but i'm not really willing to spend the time or money to get there. The draft system is also poorly imagined. you choose 30 cards for your deck but not from a pool of cards. first you pick one of 6 then one of 5 and 4 etc. frequently i wouldnt want any of the cards or just one but it wouldnt be the color that i want to play. there are 4 colors and you only get 2. there are amazing cards and i got a few on the first draft. i went 2 and 2. the second draft i played i felt like i got nothing useful and won 0 games. i recognize that sometimes you get a good hand and sometimes you dont but when it takes a week to get enough tickets to play draft i'm just not willing to waste the time needed.

								As a CCG, SolForge is one of the most solidly constructed games I've played in years. It takes full advantage of the fact that it exists in virtual space to explore mechanics that would be difficult or even impossible in real space. Also, instead of banning or restricting cards, if a card becomes unbalanced in play, they won't hesistate to update it to make it more functional. However, they don't go overboard changing cards all the time, either.Like all the best games, it is fairly easy to learn, but hard to master. The basic concept is simple. You draw a hand of 5 cards, of which you can play two. There are spells and creatures. Creatures occupy one of 5 lanes. When you play a card, it levels up into another version of itself, usually a better version. How much better varies from card to card. Each turn you battle, any creature that doesn't have summoning sickness attacks the creature across from it, and if there is nothing across from it, it deals damage to the opposing player. At the end of your turn, you discard your entire hand, and draw 5 new cards. After four turns, you level up, meaning you reshuffle all your cards back into your deck, except now some of those cards are higher level. And this repeats, with your deck getting stronger as the game goes on.  There are four factions, and each of them plays differently. Decks are 30 cards, and can be made of one or two factions.From that simple structure, there is a lot of depth in the game. This game was designed by Stoneblade Entertainment, the same company that created the Ascencion deckbuilding game, with the help of Richard Garfield (creator of Magic: The Gathering). Most of them are Magic protour veterans as well. The plan, for now, seems to be to release one major set and one minor update each year. There are timed and untimed matches, as well as tournaments and drafting. The game is built to be free to play, although it is still in beta, so many things like a single-player campaign and trading cards between players are not in yet, but the game is updated fairly regularly. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is keen on strategy games or CCGs, and the free to play nature makes it easy to try out.			"

								I love this game. It's strategic, challenging, and surprisingly visually interesting for what's essentially a cardgame. It definitely rewards long-term play and/or monetary investment, but it isn't PTW  and you scale quickly without any investment. I also like how it would be impossible to play in the real world - that is to say, it makes good use of the fact that it's on a computer, rather than mimicing already extant cardgames like M:TG.

								This is a fun game to play, and it's easy to pick up the rules and jump right in.  For a casual gamer like myself, that is a big plus.  The mechanics of ""leveling"" a card were new to me at first and took a little bit of time to get the hang of, but the best times I've had are figuring out good combos to play.  I played M:tG years and years ago, and at first I tried to approach SolForge like that, but I was not very successful.  I like that there are a bunch of powerful cards that you can work towards and hope that they turn up in a booster, but the ability to purchase basic booster packs using silver you win in game is a much easier way to start growing your collection.  I don't like that you can't trade cards (hopefully that get implemented in some fashion, someday down the road), and all the tournaments that I have entered were filled with very powerful decks (so I lost almost every time), but overall, this game is a great way to spend 15-30 minutes at a  time.  It's still in beta right now, and they tweak the cards when trying new game balances, but it is very polished and I have only had one or two instances where something buggy happened.  Lag is sometimes an issue too, but that might be my local connection more so than anything in the game itself.  Give SolForge a try, it is worth it.			"

								SolForge is a strange and quite unique CCG. It contains four ""Factions"" modeled after Technology, Nature, Life and Death. Each Faction does have it's advantages and disadvantages and you must combine two factions together to create a near-perfect card-dispensing, death-dealing deck! However SolForge is not quite as polished as other CCG's like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, nor is it as publicized. However It is worth playing equally as much as the other CCGs. Originality: 6Mechanics: 7Polish: 5Rating: 6/10 SolForge is an interesting game, though it lacks the polish others of it's genre have.			"

								This game is an incredibly well designed CCG cross platform game. The card pool(which is only expanding) allows for incredibly dynamic play and lots of cards to look for and collect. The game allows for you to spend some money and jump right in with the best decks or you could learn day by day with a wealth of cards given out every day. One of the best parts is that you can have it crash on your laptop/desktop and then immediately go to your ipad or mobile device and finish the match there. Also it means that you can play when on vacation if you can't bring a PC with you. In general I think that the game is quite amazing and despite minor bug fixes(which are totally within acceptable standards) the game is incredibly well desgined. "

								I don't think the game is bad, and the way to play it is interesting and different. However, I personaly dislike it. I do not like how it is set in stone that you can only play 2 cards each turn, and that the cards you had in your hand previously are all mulled. I feel like you should be able to keep the cards you like. Also, when playing against the A.I, everything happens so quickly that I sometimes feel like I don't know what they did. I do like the quick pacing of the game, and the fact that there are 3 ""levels"" to cards that increase as you play them. Some concepts like that are original and unique to SolForge, and I think that is great. I will not, however, continue to play this game.I think everyone should atleast give this game a try and see if they like it.Also, I recoomend Might and Magic Duel of Champions for people who like games like this.

								The game is playable and reasonably entertaining from a basic playability standpoint; but deck building is an exercise in needless frustration and there are massive issues with competitive online play that doom SolForge to meet an early grave. I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have: Timed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it. A single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind The interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens) Very laggy performance, especially in the deck builder Many other issues...Instead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic).

								The game is playable and reasonably entertaining from a basic playability standpoint; but deck building is an exercise in needless frustration and there are massive issues with competitive online play that doom SolForge to meet an early grave. I won't waste time describing the same issues others already have: Timed and untimed matches encourage abuse. Trolls either wait until the clock is about to run out before they play, or they leave untimed matches sitting there until the opponent concedes to get rid of it. A single mediocre draw basically ends your game because there's no way to catch up once you're behind The interface has obnoxious inconsistencies (i.e. Double-click does very different things in differet screens) Very laggy performance, especially in the deck builder Many other issues...Instead, I'm going to focus on a single point that has grown to end any chance of the game being playable for any incoming player. At this stage, there's no realistic way to compete with players that have been around for months because their decks are loaded with the rarist cards in the game (legendary and heroic). Catching up at this stage would require an investment of several hundred, or even thousands of dollars.I've played dozens of people, to the point that I see certain names often enough that I know their decks and what to expect; and every card in their deck is wildly more powerful than almost every card I've been able to get in more than a month of play.

								I'm an avid Magic: the Gathering player and all-around CCG player. With that said, I think SolForge is one of the best and quickest paced card games I've played in the 18+ years I've been playing card games. I would definitely recommend this game to any and all CCG fans that I know. The best thing about the game truly has to be the leveling and ranking. This is something that I haven't seen in any other CCG before and greatly enjoy.The worst part about this game is that after most all update (especially when new sets come out) there is always a long list of bugs that come with. Most players will experience anything from not being able to create/update decks all the way to failing to load the game at all.Overall this is a great game that I think most players familiar to CCG's would love and could easily devoted many hours to like I have.

								It's sad but I got sick of that game.SolForge brought amazing new ideas to the cards game universe. You have a deck of 30 cards. Each turn, you draw 5 cards, play 2 of them and discard the rest. You also put in your discard pile a version of the played card but on the superior level. After 4 turns, you shuffle your discard pile in your deck, unlocking sweet level 2 cards. It goes on until level 3 when you just put an other level 3 card in the discard pile.It might not seem like much but a whole new depth of strategy comes with it. Somes cards are stronger than average on level 3 but terrible on the first level. If you play them, you might lose the hand at the begining of the game but you'll wreck your opponent if you survive. Other are the opposite, you must win fast or you won't have anything good to face his level 3. You might also have to level a specific card to counter something at higher level even if it's not usefull to play at the moment.And, like any card game, there is LOT of different effects on each card, factions to group cards under a same theme and playstyle, card rarity and boosters to buy to improve your collection.But, it is very hard to get a solid grasp on the game. Everything is a little bit more random that in other cards game. Of course, you have to build a good deck to hope drawing the good cards but a good SolForge deck will go haywire a bit more often than in Magic or Hearthstone. (It's still minor because it's part of the game everyone.)It is also very hard to understand the cards alchemy and counters. I mean, most counters are obvious. If your opponent spawn many weak creatures, play a mass spell. But I get myself thinking a lot about why my decks aren't working. Most of them either have a great synergy but doesn't comes that good when it comes to playing. Others are just good cards with minimal synergy that comes good on game but not as good as I could expect.Somes decks seem very strong in the hands of my oponents (even without legendaries) but I can't put them together. It seems like everything turn to ashes when a pick a Tempys deck but I sometimes get wrecked by those in a few turns.And there is the 20 minutes timers issue. (You don't have time for each turns, you have 20 minutes for the whole game. It is too much and easy to abuse.) In my opinion, it is minor but it should have been fixed months ago. (Probably before making new cards.)So, the game is great because you can drop in any moment and begin an untimed game and finish it later but if you really want to enjoy this, you shouldn't get competitive about it. (Not like me.)			"

Simple and effective.But you look away for one day and suddenly: Boom! Another expansion or more cards show up and you just can't catch up with the power creep and you just give up.That's what it feels like to me, anyway.			"

								Compared to Hearthstone and Magic, I really like how this game handles randomness: enough for novel experiences, but you feel much more in control. Got a bad draw? No worries, you get a whole new hand next turn. Legendaries buried in your deck? In just a few turns you'll cycle through the whole thing.The art ranges from meager to gorgeous and the interface can be a little finnicky here and there, but these are definitely forgiveable. The unique mechanics and interesting card effects are worth it.Oh and they give out free cards like craaaazy. Dailies, crafting, and packs are relatively very generous.

								This game reminds me of Shadow Era, another F2P TCG. The basic concepts are similar; it's just the execution that differs with each game. Even the Uncharted card game for the PS Vita doesn't deviate much from the core objective of whittling down your opponent's life points while getting rid of any obstacles in the way.I like that the game already seems to have a solid foundation. Of course, LOADS more improvement is needed but even at this early stage, I feel confident enough to give it a recommendation. It has a lot of potential. Two thumbs up!Now, if only they wouldn't charge us so much to buy gold... I have a few suggestions regarding that:1. Let us earn some gold by playing the game.2. Give us more bonus gold. 5% bonus gold is just measly...3. Charge us less for gold. It shouldn't cost me in the vicinity of USD20 just to buy a faction starter deck.

								Although not quite as deep tactically as Magic: the Gathering, this is still a very fun card game that elegantly solves some typical CCG issues through its simplicity. You play two cards, all of your creatures that are in play attack every turn, and you discard your hand after each of your turns. I love the art direction, and the art is consistantly high-quality & interesting. As of this writing, the Campaign mode has yet to be implemented, and general functionality is somewhat barebones, but I'm looking forward to seeing the evolution of this game.			"

								An interesting game. Plays very fast for a card game of its type and yet the game isn't over until it's over, you can still win with 1 health and a lucky hand.Now that there are more cards and the ability to ""sell"" extra cards for silver I'd definitely recommend this game as a F2P card game. I really have only two complaints:1. As with most games with micro transactions, if you buy gold you'll have difficulty spending all of it due to the prices of the items... A standard tactic to get you to spend more, but it annoys me as it's effectively throwing money away.2. The random number generator occasionally seems to get stuck, at least in the effective end result (when selecting a random deck I've literally ended up with the same one 30 times in a row... no joke).Beyond those two things, it's pretty decent.

								Pros: Wide card selection, easy to learn, and high skill ceiling.Cons: It takes a LOOOOONG time to get anything done. You must double click on a card to view it's card text, but that takes several seconds to pop up and then some more time just to close it. Before you view a card's text, all you see is the art, power, and life. If it showed even a portion of the text box, then I'd be able to tell at a glance if the card is vanilla or not, but I can't. It also doesn't show you the faction (color) of the card without double clicking on it first - which is absurd. This MUST be sped up and changed into a mouse-over if the game is going to proceed at a reasonable speed.Browsing through your card library is very slow. You can either view cards iOS app store style (1 at a time, swiping through hundreds of cards), or in a vertical list (very little information displayed). We need more view options that isn't as extreme as these 2 choices. Viewing card text is a single click, which is different from the main game. Double clicking adds a card to your deck. If you were just trying to read the card text, you'll then have go to a different menu (which is also slow) to remove the unintended card from your deck (and for some reason, the game allows you to add more than max deck size). This could be fixed if you could add cards with a different command, like right click.In game timer is ridiculous. You have 20 minutes total to make all your moves, like speed jenga or speed chess. If that runs out, because either player is playing a defensive deck, then you have to start making moves faster. However, once that time gets down to around the 1 minute mark, you get an additional minute to make your moves, but that minute isn't added onto your total time. So if you had 1:05 left, at the beginning of your turn, you would have 2:05. Then if you finished with 1:10 left, your total time is now 0:10. Then for the rest of the game you have roughly 1 minute to make your moves, which is NOT enough with how SLOW it is to play and read cards. Just put a time limit on individual turns, like 180-200 seconds.The font size in the game log (which is a text version of what moves each player made) is WAY too small. I'm talking like times new roman size 7 on windows. When I tried this on my android device, the text was indistinguishable from the dust and scratches on my screen protector. Probably font size 1.5 there. ALSO! The game log is hidden away in the menu, so it takes even MORE time to access. Since all spells aren't shown to the opponent as they are played (recycled animations are shown instead, so different spells may share the same animation), I have to rely on the game log to see what was played. The log MUST be more accessible and LEGIBLE if the game continues to animate the way it does now. I'm sure there are more problems with the game log, but I couldn't read any of the text. At the very least, I can make out the highlighted text to see the card that was played.Great game with a bunch of potential. Fix these problems and I will gladly return.			"

								Edited 13/8/2014: It's still an alright game, but I can't honestly reccomend it anymore, I still enjoy playing it every now and then, but there's just too much RNG to make it fully enjoyable for me anymore.OK, as you can probably tell, I have played this game a lot.It's a good game, really easy to wrap your head around the basic mechanics, but has a lot of room for skill growth. If you like card games there's no real point not playing it, as it's Free-to-play. Your card selection will be quite limited to begin with, but if you get your daily rewards regularly you'll start building up a wide variety of cards in no time.While the game can be frustrating at times, when you have unlucky draws and things like that, it's still a game that I have kept coming back to despite these occasional frustrations.There are still features that are needed in the game, mainly card trading and crafting, but these are in development and on the way.I definitely would reccomend this game if you like trading card games, or are interested in starting to play trading card games. As this is one of the most beginner friendly, mechanics-wise, card game that I have played.			"

								While still in development SolForge is a fairly pollished game. With limited play options and an unchallenging computer opponent being its only real flaws. The play style of the game is very easy to pick up but puts a real emphisis on deck development stratagy as the way to win rather than just who can play more cards and who started with the better hand. This makes duels more fair against evenly matched opponents. Over all the ballance of play definetly makes the game interesting and worth a play if you find TCG's fun.			"

								Pros:Nice big colourful battlefield where you don't have to strain your eyes reading tiny textNo mana dependenceEasy earning of ingame currency with daily logins and 3 winsYou can buy any card with your earned currency (though getting a legendary can take up to 15 days of play)Interesting and complex card interactionsCons:Newbie decks are often matched up with legendary filled decks - this is probably one of the biggest reasons why new players will get discouraged and not stay with Solforge - a newbie would rather wait to be matched up with another newbie than be matched up fast with a super deckYou can only play 2 cards per turn usually, which feels too limiting and drives players inevitably towards the cards which help break that rule - 3 would provide better balance and create even more interesting interactions. Seriously only being able to play 2 cards per turn is a major drag lol. It almost makes me want the mana/resources system back so that I can get to play more than 2 cardsScreen layout and decor still feels a bit stiff and amateurishMost of the strong decks all pack in Nekrium ('black') legendary cards - that is so obvious an imbalance that needs to be addressed and I'm very surprised they haven't yet - are they Satanic programmers or something heheConclusion:If you're a newbie, play it daily for just three wins (can be against computer) until you strengthen your card collection and you won't get frustrated. Remember you can forge any card you want with the silver you earn ingame.The game has great potential, perhaps as much as Magic The Gathering when it first started out, and with new cards introduced regularly and speedily to compete with other card games, especially non-Nekrium legendaries, the game will be more colorful, balanced, varied and interesting. Those are imho the only ways it can genuinely catch up with MTG. "

								Some of the top minds came together for a unique card game, no resources and drawing a new hand each turn make for a great core mechanic. Solid weekend tournaments offer a nice variety of gameplay modes on a regular basis. Interesting ""share"" technique for card trading as well. Buy cards with gold(premium in game currency) and you get to give a friend or trade 1 copy of that card, which keeping a copy for yourself. Daily rewards bonus got a recent rework so you get lots of free packs of cards on regular basis. New Campaign mode to play vs special skilled AI's presents a new challenge that awards heroic cards and packs to help get your collection started as well.			"

								Playing starter deck vs starter deck is kind of fun and a good way to spend a couple of hours vs the AI.    But make no mistake, this is outright Pay2win.  The new drafting format really helps even the odds, and it also helps with expanding your collection.  But the 7$ to draft price point is a bit high and you wont go infinate until you have a good handle on the cards.Good for a bit of Player vs ai.  bad for Player vs player unless you are going to sink hundreds of dollars in the game or spend about 7+ months of collecting dailys.

								Solforge is a free to play digital card game. Now while it may not match up to the likes of Magic, you can still be assured that you'll have some great fun playing this game. As a free to play, Solforge has both its positives and negatives, the latter of course being that it is not an entirely finished game and still has a way to go in terms of mechanics, namely the ability to trade between players and find cards of a particular type. At its heart it's a cheap alternative and it shows, HOWEVER, I would never tell anyone not to play Solforge. The gameplay is simple yet it works fantastically, tying in very well with the game's wide array of cards, each of the four factions bringing clever and interesting options to your decks. The artwork is absolutely gorgeous. With so many great cards and such a simple playstyle, Solforge breaks the card game down to a true battle of wits, while you may have some better cards than the other player, you may not use them well enough to defeat them.NOTE: While I do like this game, online play can some times cause a slow between player turns as it seems unoptimised and there is now way to know who you're playing against (i.e. where they're from). Definitely play Solforge, you won't regret it.  "

								SolForge is the only online CCG I have seen that makes good use of the online medium: most online CCGs could just as easily be done in cards, and most of them fall short of MtG; leaving me little reason to play them. SolForge, however, uses a leveling mechanism that could not be done in a paper CCG; and exploring the leveling system and the need to think not only what you want to play now; but also what you want leveled for later in the game, makes SolForge the one online CCG I am likely to keep playing.

They have been working on improving the client for what seemed like forever, but the day they improved it they tightened the free to play rewards so harshly that they choked out a lot of the community including myself. By the time they get the dosing right between polished product and profitable business model they will have been fully overshadoweved by a competitor.			"

								Edit: Okay.  After being away for about a year or more (I think?), I still get the emails and saw they finally came out of Beta.  Played for a few hours since and here's my takeaway at this moment in time.-There are bugs,  There have always been bugs.  There will always be bugs.-UI is subpar, especially in comparison to previous ones.-Campaigns got easier.  I smoked em all with the starter decks.  Granted, I have all the skill and none of the cards from having played for 2,000 hours in the past.-Random and constructed queue are just chock full of people with seemingly nothing besides legendary cards in their decks.  Nigh unbeatable for a new person.Overall, come back in 6 months.  We'll see how they're doing then.			"

								Interesting card game. Pretty generous with the cards, but getting legendaries can be a grind and you need those to be competitive. Good card game that can be played free without too much of an issue.Edit: They've now made legendary packs purchaseable with in-game credits, making legendaries a bit easier to come by.Edit2: And they've now wrecked it all. With release they have overhauled the client. It is slower, both in performance and gameplay. On top of that, they ruined the most important aspect. YOU CAN NO LONGER GAIN CARDS EASILY FOR FREE. Even doing fast dailies against AI every day left the game somewhat grindy to get good cards. Now you can't even do that because you are forced to play against players and player battles take for freaking EVER and you'll just lose to good players.The devs have ruined a rather fun game.			"

												I most definetly suggest this game for anyone that is into CCGs.  You may read alot of reviews nagging about the P2W, but what card game isn't.  If you are into MTG, Pokemon, Yugi, or any other CCG then I am sure that you have dropped more money then you would like to think about. Think about it for a momment.  A booster of MTG will cost you $3-$5 depending on the set which will get you 15 cards. Same goes for any CCG. Then there are the single cards that can go for way more than what a booster or even a box will cost you.  If you are a serious CCG player then you know what I am talking about. I didn't start paying for things until I had played for a few months.  I figured that the game had provided me with plenty of entertainment that sending a few bucks here and there wasn't a bad idea.  As for this grind people speak about it really isn't that bad.  During your dailies you can get up to 3 free boosters and enough silver to buy 2 more and boosters are worth 5000 silver which will get you 6 cards.  I have also recieved legendary chests as a daily reward as well.  I have collected a majority of my legendaries this way. Yes, I have bought a few of the precon decks, but thats like buying a precon deck with any CCG.   So I do not see the big gripe with the P2W asspect when it is the same for all CCGs.  The other complaint I see a lot is that you need legendaries to win and I call BS on this.  I played for the longest time without legendaries and I would still win online matches against people with stacks of legendaries.  Do legendaries help? Yes, they can. So can mythic rares and rares in MTG but they don't always make the deck. Its all about synergy and knowing how to make a proper deck.  When I played MTG those were my favorite decks to win with.  Playing against people that have dropped hundreds of dollars on their deck where mine would be but a fraction of what they spent.  One of my MTG decks that has yet to lose consists of nothing but commons and uncommons.  I took this tactic over to Solforge and it still works time to time. Like in any game you are going to win some and lose a lot.  You have to keep analysing whats out there and try to think of something that no one else has and surprise people.  If you are into CCG then I say give it a try cause as a person with 18 years of CCG playing I say it is worth it.EDIT:This is gonna be long winded, but there will be a short response below.The comment above was from some time ago and the game has changed a lot since then. I wish the game was still the one my review was originaly for, but it is not. They got rid of the ability to do your dailies against AI and that is the biggest negative thing to me. As you can see I have spent a lot of time (and some money) into this game. I would log in, do my dailies, have some fun with newer cards and then log out. This would take but just a few minutes. Now if I want to get my rewards I have to play online against people that take their sweet♥♥♥♥♥time while I start getting bored and just rage quit you could say. This game was a fun casual CCG and now they are trying to make it very uncasual. Since they have done this the community has dwindled and the game has suffered. Everyone voices what they want, and its all pretty much bring back the way the game was, and they do not listen. That is the other thing; communication with these guys is as slow as a pregnet slug on salt. When they finaly say what changes they have done, no one cares cause it is still in the wrong direction. The forums on their website are nothing but negative responses to what they have done and they dont even reply. All they ever post about are the new cards coming out and once in a full blue moon some sort of update news. I use to look forward to playing this game every day, but now I hardly ever. Truly sad.Pros-Lots of cards to play with-Fun new way to play a CCG with the leveling up of cardsCons-Game is dying-No communication from devs other than to promote new cards-Not new player friendly what so ever. I made an alt account to see if I could do anything and that was a big no go. So unless you have been playing for a while or plan to drop some serious cash, enjoy getting pounded by experienced players and their built decks. Good luck!-No dailies against AI. This was the main way to collect silver, cards, and tournament tokens, but that is gone.-They screwed up the way you could build your decks by limiting the card filters. Before you could easily sort your cards and now its a hassle.-New UI was not needed, I prefer the old beta version (as do many others)Before their ""Full Launch"" this game was a 10/10 for me. Now its probably a 1/10 sadly. I'll keep logging in everynow and then to see if things have been fixed, but I doubt it will ever be the way it was.			"

								After playing SolForge for a while, I can say that it's no Magic: The Gathering, but it isn't bad. You get one booster pack per day just for logging in, you can earn more by winning games, and there's a single-player campaign mode that - while fairly thin - still provides a good tutorial first and a rather crushing bit of challenge later on. Will you run up against truly unfair decks online? Oh, hells yes. Will you eventually make crushingly unfair decks of your own? Sure. All in all, it's not a bad F2P - and I define that as ""A F2P that you really don't have to spend money to enjoy.""PROS: -Interesting gameplay.-No need to spend money, though earning cards through winning will take time.-Single-player mode intact.-Also available on AndroidCONS: -Some minor balance issues, although some of the most broken cards have been taken care of over time.-Repetitive music.-Getting your first competitive deck together will certainly take a while.Overall: 7/10.

But its Solforge i keep playing hour after hour day after day im not even very good at TCG's (even tho i relly should be:( I cant even stand magic anymore it's so dull compared to Solforge.even if you only play 3 online matches a day and use the 7 tickets you get (one for each first online win of the day) and the end of a week you can play a free round of draft and all 30 cards you draft will be added to your collection! no other DTCG out today offers such a fair and easy way to aquire new cards.TLDR: 30 free cards each week and makes other DTCG seem dull Download it NOW!!! UPDATE 2016 ....With the release of the new client it sadens me to say this but i can no longer recomend this game.As you can see i have almost 1,500 hours logged this was my go to game but SBE have made a huge plile of mess so many features removed or changed unjustly what once was a vibrant unique take on the TCG , has been warped into some dull generic monstrosity devoid of style or life a product that seams to have been draged from the days of windows XP that can barely at this time function as a working product let alone stand as a competior to the mirid TCG's out today.

								I have been playing this game since it's release (mostly on my phone) and I think it is an incredibly good CCG. The levelling up mechanic is unique and makes this game stand out against other CCGs. I just wish you could get gold a lot more easily.			"

												Awesome card game, nice detailed art. Matches don't last long because of the leveling system.This leveling system is pretty unique in that it does not in any way reflect a leveling card system outside of the matches. It is in fact you, the player, leveling up and the cards follow suit; which makes the match become faster when someone levels up.Also, as a sidenote. There are three kinds of daily achievements in this stage of the game (early stages). these are 1 the daily login reward, 2 win a match (which is easy when you create match against easy ai) and 3 win three matches. After those rewards, you're capable of buying a couple of small boosters. So at this moment of the game, it's to play 15 min max a day.EDIT  Ok, I've been playing the game for a while longer now and I have to say, my enthousiasm hasn't been depleted. One of the possible login rewards is the event cards which in the end (for example with 3 events cards) permit access to a tournament. The awesome thing is that, when you play that tournament and you lose all three matches, you still receive a normal booster (contains a lot more cards than small booster). If you win one out of three matches, you get your event cards back :o(And I haven't even begon about drafting which, in the end,  gives you even more cards at your disposal (even after tournament).With the adding of Iphone players, the playerbase has become larger which, in turn makes it faster to find an online opponent. AAAAnd if you win your first online match of the day, you receive another reward (this would be the fourth daily achievement). :DLate edit:Do not play game. Expectations are higher than reality.			"

								I have been playing this game for a while now(mostly on phone) and so far it's pretty enjoyable even as a free to play. You can make some decent decks with only common and rare cards and get decent daily rewards. There is one thing that really bothers me and I think most f2p players in this game. There is no ranked system to seperate from normal online matches. Why does this bother me? 9 out of 10 players I face in a normal online match have insane full heroic/legendary decks while I only have some heroics and a few legendaries(which I can not make a decent deck from). I maybe win about 2 out of 5 games I play online but for f2p or new players it is really hard to get started.But besides that it can be pretty satisfying winning a game against players with a full heroic/legendary deck with only common and rare cards. There is a really big cardpool to make and try a lot of different decks and a lot of different and unique card effects.I can't say anything about the tournaments because I never did one of those(might try those later).The UI is pretty bad but it doesn't bother me that much but please Stone Blade, make a ranked system so newer players can get some fair opponents in online mathes.I will give this a 7/10(this could've been an 8/10 if there was a fair matchmaking for online matches). I do recommend trying this out even if it is hard to get started. If you like TCG's with lots of variaty in cards, lots of deckbuilding and tweaking, this can be an interesting game for you.			"

								The transformation mechanic at the heart of solforge makes a very nice change of pace from the standard ""mana"" based card games. However the game is very much pay to win, heroic and legendary cards are often straight up superior to commons or rares: this makes putting together a viable constructed mode very slow if you don't want to pay big bucks.All that said the draft mode is excellent and a lot of fun and the daily rewards are very generous, a great game to play casualy			"

								One of the best trading card games.Playable with little or no money invested, although hard to be competitive in all type of games.  For example constructed decks might need too many cards that a casual player (or one that does not spend money) will not be able to collect.  On the other hand there are special tournaments (unlegendary, unheroic etc.)  where even relative newcomers can have some fun.  Also drafts are pretty good fun for all, and a good way to build your collection...			"

								1. Join a draft tournament.2. Pick the rarest cards, regardless of their utility.3. Concede and get a free booster along with the cards you drafted. If you try to compete, you will get paired with a petulant child who will go AFK as soon as things go in your favor. Better to just concede.4. Forge the new cards into silver.5. Purchase cards then go back to 1.6. Play game (you will never reach this step; see 5)			"

								I've been playing this a lot since the first set was out.This is my go-to game when just chilling with my buddy who also rocks this game.Testing decks, reaching infinity (unlimited plays per turn, nice challenge, try it!)Thinking long and hard about draft choices, debating nerfs. so much fun if you enjoy strategy.Gameplay wise, this is MUCH more interesting than hearthstone, much more choices, less of a reliance on legendary's.One of my strongest decks atm (U/A spawn deck with scarabs, weirwood patr and lifeblood dryad)has only 2 (Ancestral Echoes) but they mostly make the deck slower and worse.Although it really needs a ranking system, I disagree with the p2w sentiment of some other reviews.People seem to think you can only get silver through online matches, but the best way to get cards (and to have major fun on equal footing with other players) is the draft system. The normal draft (3 event tickets, 1(+) ticket per day) nets you 30 cards to keep.this will fill out your collection fast and with the forging of excess cards, this will give you20.000+ gold for each draft. Not to mention the pretty large amount of legendary's i got from winning draft games. Too bad you can grind it all day, but this has given me a full collection everytime before a new set came out.    protip;  NEVER BUY LEGEND CHESTS Just think up a deck which needs them or netdeck the current best or something.Play for 5-10 min every day to get draft tickets > draft > sell > buy specific legendary.this is way better, not all are equal in usefulness and the chances of getting a truly good one are slim.  just get some thundersaurs or nexus aeronauts through buying.To make a long and incoherent story short;Try it, now!  just play it for 10 min of fun every day and soon you will have a decent and viable collection to toy with.tell your friends, we need more ppl playing.And stoneblade, thanks for making this awesome game, but make a ranking system. It is frustrating to go up against  twinked out meta decks if you are new.			"

												Genre : Board & Card Games - TCCGGreat TCCG but in early access too long. I had a lot of entertainment out of it however, and the business model was generous back when I played and ended up with a nice collection for little to no money. They have been working on improving the client for what seemed like forever, but the day they improved it they tightened the free to play rewards so harshly that they choked out a lot of the community including myself. By the time they get the dosing right between polished product and profitable business model they will have been fully overshadoweved by a competitor.			"

								Edit: Okay.  After being away for about a year or more (I think?), I still get the emails and saw they finally came out of Beta.  Played for a few hours since and here's my takeaway at this moment in time.-There are bugs,  There have always been bugs.  There will always be bugs.-UI is subpar, especially in comparison to previous ones.-Campaigns got easier.  I smoked em all with the starter decks.  Granted, I have all the skill and none of the cards from having played for 2,000 hours in the past.-Random and constructed queue are just chock full of people with seemingly nothing besides legendary cards in their decks.  Nigh unbeatable for a new person.Overall, come back in 6 months.  We'll see how they're doing then.			"

								Interesting card game. Pretty generous with the cards, but getting legendaries can be a grind and you need those to be competitive. Good card game that can be played free without too much of an issue.Edit: They've now made legendary packs purchaseable with in-game credits, making legendaries a bit easier to come by.Edit2: And they've now wrecked it all. With release they have overhauled the client. It is slower, both in performance and gameplay. On top of that, they ruined the most important aspect. YOU CAN NO LONGER GAIN CARDS EASILY FOR FREE. Even doing fast dailies against AI every day left the game somewhat grindy to get good cards. Now you can't even do that because you are forced to play against players and player battles take for freaking EVER and you'll just lose to good players.The devs have ruined a rather fun game.			"

												I most definetly suggest this game for anyone that is into CCGs.  You may read alot of reviews nagging about the P2W, but what card game isn't.  If you are into MTG, Pokemon, Yugi, or any other CCG then I am sure that you have dropped more money then you would like to think about. Think about it for a momment.  A booster of MTG will cost you $3-$5 depending on the set which will get you 15 cards. Same goes for any CCG. Then there are the single cards that can go for way more than what a booster or even a box will cost you.  If you are a serious CCG player then you know what I am talking about. I didn't start paying for things until I had played for a few months.  I figured that the game had provided me with plenty of entertainment that sending a few bucks here and there wasn't a bad idea.  As for this grind people speak about it really isn't that bad.  During your dailies you can get up to 3 free boosters and enough silver to buy 2 more and boosters are worth 5000 silver which will get you 6 cards.  I have also recieved legendary chests as a daily reward as well.  I have collected a majority of my legendaries this way. Yes, I have bought a few of the precon decks, but thats like buying a precon deck with any CCG.   So I do not see the big gripe with the P2W asspect when it is the same for all CCGs.  The other complaint I see a lot is that you need legendaries to win and I call BS on this.  I played for the longest time without legendaries and I would still win online matches against people with stacks of legendaries.  Do legendaries help? Yes, they can. So can mythic rares and rares in MTG but they don't always make the deck. Its all about synergy and knowing how to make a proper deck.  When I played MTG those were my favorite decks to win with.  Playing against people that have dropped hundreds of dollars on their deck where mine would be but a fraction of what they spent.  One of my MTG decks that has yet to lose consists of nothing but commons and uncommons.  I took this tactic over to Solforge and it still works time to time. Like in any game you are going to win some and lose a lot.  You have to keep analysing whats out there and try to think of something that no one else has and surprise people.  If you are into CCG then I say give it a try cause as a person with 18 years of CCG playing I say it is worth it.EDIT:This is gonna be long winded, but there will be a short response below.The comment above was from some time ago and the game has changed a lot since then. I wish the game was still the one my review was originaly for, but it is not. They got rid of the ability to do your dailies against AI and that is the biggest negative thing to me. As you can see I have spent a lot of time (and some money) into this game. I would log in, do my dailies, have some fun with newer cards and then log out. This would take but just a few minutes. Now if I want to get my rewards I have to play online against people that take their sweet♥♥♥♥♥time while I start getting bored and just rage quit you could say. This game was a fun casual CCG and now they are trying to make it very uncasual. Since they have done this the community has dwindled and the game has suffered. Everyone voices what they want, and its all pretty much bring back the way the game was, and they do not listen. That is the other thing; communication with these guys is as slow as a pregnet slug on salt. When they finaly say what changes they have done, no one cares cause it is still in the wrong direction. The forums on their website are nothing but negative responses to what they have done and they dont even reply. All they ever post about are the new cards coming out and once in a full blue moon some sort of update news. I use to look forward to playing this game every day, but now I hardly ever. Truly sad.Pros-Lots of cards to play with-Fun new way to play a CCG with the leveling up of cardsCons-Game is dying-No communication from devs other than to promote new cards-Not new player friendly what so ever. I made an alt account to see if I could do anything and that was a big no go. So unless you have been playing for a while or plan to drop some serious cash, enjoy getting pounded by experienced players and their built decks. Good luck!-No dailies against AI. This was the main way to collect silver, cards, and tournament tokens, but that is gone.-They screwed up the way you could build your decks by limiting the card filters. Before you could easily sort your cards and now its a hassle.-New UI was not needed, I prefer the old beta version (as do many others)Before their ""Full Launch"" this game was a 10/10 for me. Now its probably a 1/10 sadly. I'll keep logging in everynow and then to see if things have been fixed, but I doubt it will ever be the way it was.			"

												I've been playing it for awhile now (50+ hrs into the game) and now have a good grasp of the gameplay. Solforge appears to take some ideas from deckbuilding games (such as Ascension) and adds unique concepts to the mix. The game has a refreshing Evolve mechanic where cards level up as they are played. This opens up a lot of unique cards that can be used to cull undesired cards from the deck, level up/evolve, overload (play once), etc. Thus there is a lot of nice strategies that are unique to this gamePros:- Interesting game design. Takes ideas from deckbuilders (such as Ascension, an *excellent* game these devs publish- well at least the mobile version) and mixes with Card games where you build a deck. Unfortunately, after investing more time into the game I have realize the game design has several flaws that I'll get into in the Cons section- Can trade cards that you purchased with gold (actually you share a copy of a legendary you acquired with gold)- Ranked Matches can be a lot of fun if you get a solid deck together- Can keep cards you get from drafts- Can buy starter decks that contain legendaries. You can share a 'copy' of this legendary too with a friend or community member.- Nice little community that shares the current 'meta' and info how to build a deck.- Sometimes they run Forgemaster weekends that allow users to create decks that uses *ANY* card. This gives users the opportunity to play the game with Legendaries they do not own.- Lots of science fiction themed cards which is very refreshing. Factions are Alloyin (SciFi), Nek (Zombies), and Uterra (Forest / Tree Folk)Cons:- UI is a little buggy (sometimes if you're awarded a new card from a draft for example, it may not show up until you reboot or wait 5-10 minutes)- some beginning users may find it really difficult to win early on- Community feels small as you might bump into same guy again at off-hours (sometimes a Bronze player might be pitted against a Gold or above)- Might take a lot of patience for beginners to build their collection. This might be very frustrating for a f2p gamer especially that doesn't care for Drafting.- Cards could use more flashy vfx and unique audio.- Card balance generally favors Legendary and Heroic cards. So many common cards do not see play on the constructed ladder. In order to enjoy common cards you'll want to do drafts or participate in the user run solforgeladder tournaments. But I've seen some few common cards be effective on ladder at my elo/rank. - The single player campaign is meant as a tutorial apparently and grants come cool legendary cards (very cool). I actually wish they provided more regular single player content (like some sort of optional daily or something)- Unlike most CCGs (like Hearthstone), if the match were to go long enough you'll 100% see all the cards in your deck. Not so with Solforge. Since your hand is refreshed every turn there is a chance you might not see the card you want. There is a LOT of RNG here in regards to how you receive your cards. Also, you can even level up a card and might not see it later. It can be very frustratingMixed:- You can run 3 copies of a legendary so many top tier decks are filled to the brim with high rarity cards. Plus due to lack of mana, these cards can be played asap. This might be bad for beginners that lack these cards but can be very fun for experienced players. So I'm listing this as a pro & con			"
