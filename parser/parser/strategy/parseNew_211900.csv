												This game has such primitive graphics that I think I would have turned my nose up at it were I to load it onto my Amiga 500, circa 1987. The sounds are atrocious, though the operatic soundtrack isn't bad. Combat just runs without any input from you. Your units hop up and down in clumsy drawn-out All-my-guys-go then all-your-guys-go rounds. It's impossible to recommened this game based on the way it looks or sounds. If you crave lots of colorful, well executed feedback and fireworks then this game isn't for you.If, however, you enjoy truly diverse factions, random maps, tons of monsters, spells and items, executable at a reasonably fast pace, then you will find much to like about Conquest of Elysium.Rather than attempting to describe the many factions or the different eras that you can play in, as well as the many ways to go about engineering total domination, I'd rather relate an impromptu story that I discovered while playing.I'd started as the Troll King for no other reason than that I relish having a giant with which to roam the landscape from the very first turn of the game.Well into the run I'd developed a sizable squad of armored, regenerating trolls that had been the front line for a vast army of goblin archers. While there were enough trolls with enough hit points and armor to absorb serious frontal assaults, they couldn't protect my numerous, but vulnerable, archers from the spells of an enemy Pyromancer that I'd stumbled into.My trolls didn't care for immolation but they were tough enough to survive the blaze. All my goblin archers, except one lone fellow, were incinerated.I was momentarily amused by my single tiny camp follower for my troll army and figured I'd eventually make it back to a city where I could recruit more archers. It was not to be, however, because I found myself pushing farther and farther into enemy territory: even without the support of sixty screaming goblin sharpshooters, my trolls were laying waste.Fight after fight, I marched across the map, more than a dozen armored trolls accompanying the Troll King with this one goblin who hung around in the back.Perhaps an hour into this Sherman's March, I began noticing that the goblin was comically ineffective. All the trolls would attack and then this one sad goblin would shoot a single arrow, never hitting anything.After several battles, I finally clicked on the little guy and was amazed by what I saw.This one goblin had maxed out his level, lost both eyes (which explained all the missing), lost one arm (which doesn't explain how he still managed to shoot his bow), was lamed and had a chest injury that reduced his hit points to the level that a fairy farting at him would have put him in the ground.I was astounded at how this guy kept kicking along in the company of a massive troll army, fighting devils and hordes of undead, dragons and wizards. Not only had he survived, but he'd become the ultimate veteran. I couldn't help but to imagine this poor wrecked creature and wonder: how does he manage?I decided that he was sort of a mascot to the trolls, a seemingly immortal mystery that they largely ignored. They allowed him to follow along as a curiosity, feeding him tidbits and saving him from wandering into holes and what not, if only to see how many more battles he could survive, one-armed, lamed and blind.My imagination went so far as to picture some of his stray shots hitting his troll allies in the back, but that they were so ineffective that the only response to getting shot by the goblin was the laughter and pointing of your troll comrades-in-slaughter.I'd never have made up that little story if there weren't so many status effects, magic items, buffs and curses and so very many enemy types available to mix and match. By keeping track of individual unit's injuries in such detail and allowing them to accumulate scars and  skills makes them into characters.If you can look past the presentational limitations, there is a ton of content and gameplay, supporting many different styles, for anyone looking for a fast-paced turn-based (is that even possible?) strategy game. Should the high fantasy genre appeal, then this one provides all the grist a fertile imagination requires.			"

												8.5 / 10May not look like it, but this is one of the best turn-based strategy games ever once you get past the learning-curve (which is actually less steep than the Civ games).Pros: 1. Not like any other game that I am aware of!-each game plays out completely different-Equip looted items to unit(s) of your choice-units gain experience/levels and get better at everything they do (new spells unlock!)-plenty of personal style choices-as complicated or simple as you want-ancient/medieval-fantasy theme is well doneCons: (these are minor & mods may help some)-graphics are ... simple-ui interface could be easier to learn-neutral animals are a bit more aggressive than is realistic imo.-I wish there was a way to convert/recruit neutral units into your army, particularly ones that are unique to your faction/class, instead of always being forced to fight/kill neutrals.Short description:Unique, turn-based fantasy army building & broad-strategy, map domination.  Game mechanics take a bit to get used to, but are elegantly balanced, with scaling-complexity, and replayability.Longer description:-Pick one of 6 different ""societies"" (time-periods which adjust the map generation parameters, making certain map tiles more or less common). -Choose one of 18 different ""classes"" (army factions), each with unique combinations of units (each has unique units but many have some common units as well) to battle against the other ""players""-(the ai has 10 difficulty levels!).-At least 9 different types of resources make ""money"" handling slightly different based on which class/faction you play (it's simpler than it sounds)-Build your armies, assign leaders to move them around; explore, conquer, and fight your way to victory.--Almost every unit has lots of item slots, and items are sufficiently rare as to be extremely exciting when found and generally only equipped to your best units (leaders usually).--Magic users have their own well-crafted system to them with many schools of magic and various spell ingredients/mana used to power them (see resources like sacrifices, herbs, fungus, and gems)---Combat is automated and runs in real-time with several speed settings, including ""skip to the end"", which may seem crazy at first but is quite well done.--unit capabilities & stats are fairly easy to grasp and analyze. Be sure to note your magic users' spells; learn which spells will effect ALL UNITS on the battlefield (including your own!), as you'll likely want to disable the use of those spells most of the time.

												This is one of my favourite games, I would value it at $60+ so it is an absolute bargain. All 17, yes 17, factions play in their own unque way and I have had fun playing every faction. This game is a must if your a Civilization fan or enjoy turn based strategy games in general. I found it very helpful to watch some lets plays on youtube by Das24680 I highly recomend watching these he explains all the controls and other basics very well.I recommend the troll race for your first game as the troll king is a one man army at the beginning and is very forgiving of newbie errors.

												Intro:Conquest of Elysium 3 is the latest in the CoE series made by Illwinter, who are also the designers of the Dominions series. In simple terms the game is about raising armies to defeat your opponenets. At the start of each game you select a class to play which determines how you go about raising your armies or what your fighting style is. An example is the enchanter class, at the start most of your army is composed of generic soldiers until you get resources to summon powerful constructs and golems in the mid to late game.Pros:-There are 18 different classes to pick from each having cool special abilities and playstyles unique to them.-There are many cool units and magic spells to mess with.-Games play quickly and end faster than most strategy games.-Random generated maps allow for endless play.Cons:-The graphics are rather lacking.-The unit animations are also rather lacking.-Lots of unit stats to sift through.-Some matches are doomed from the start due to bad spawn areas.Bottom Line:If you enjoy a strategy game where everytime you play you learn something new this game is for you. If you are short on time a lot but you love to play complex strategy games this is for you as well. If you are a person who cares about graphics do not pick this up, likewise if you are not willing to (possibly) read a manual sometimes then do not pick this up either. Illwinter has made many improvements from Conquest of Elysium 2 and at the cheap price of ten dollars it could be argued that this game beats many modern strategy games in terms of features and replayability.

												I assume you saw the screenshots, understand that gfx aren't gonna carry this one and are interested in fantasy turn-based strategy games. In lieu of a review, here's some very early impressions:- ♥♥♥♥. Why did i buy this?- I SO don't want to play this game.- I don't even. All these stats... And the clunky menus.- Allright lets get her holy high highnessness out there a-conquering. A cannibal camp... Oh well, gets me a ritual sacrifice bonus.- Crap, you front line spearmen need to stay alive.- Hahaha, suck on 3rd degree incineration spells hob.. er, half.. er. gn... whatever the hell you are, hahaha!- Damn you and the planes you spawned on, and all other untis that show up to be recruited for 50 gold when i have 49! Still, with cheap summoning i get lots of fresh units. Mostly tiny rats and spiders. :\ Ooh o.O Giant Spider! That's more like it!- Aw, crapdamn! Lost a town to 4 wolves. 4. Wolves. 4! C'mon town! Mmkay whatever, i'll just have this caster with leadership take a few archers and summoned monsters go and take it back. They can stop by the capital to pick up new recruits as well.- Wait did my rookie summonamancer just blindly luck into summoning a demigod stronker than 3-4 of my combined armies???! Oooh, and he's a front row melee attacker, sweet!- Damn these cheap summoning rituals, i'm up to my ascots in rats and scorpions. At least they soak damage really well.- That... that giant moose is honestly too big. I heard of not seeing the forest from the trees but never a forest from a moose. Seriously.At this point i have 4 stacks of mixed melee/archers/casters stomping things, leveling up, collecting shiny swords and boots of flight, and generally spreading peace, love and understanding of the Cult of the mad blood god whose return shall end the world in pools of pizza sauce.The game is relatively straightforwad even if it takes a bit of figuring out. Time wasting features are thrown right out and all that is left aims to streamline fantasy flavored, turn based conquering. Might sound featureless but the unit type and terrain diversity, not to mention hosts of spells and artifacts, season changes and random events all keep your campaign interesting. Plus even mooks get item slots, so you will find plenty of uses for shiny loot.I can't accurately appraise this game. Not at this time. Ok maybe i can. It's a victory of substance over generic shinied sparkly baubleness. You might wonder why a prettier game wouldn't ever have decent, simple and honest fun mechanics, but the anwser is in the question. If you have a VERY shiny wrapper, then you'd be a fool to put anything better than a turd in it. Final Fantasy says hello.""I stomped things!""The menus are a teeny bit clunky and take a few minutes to figure out but the rest is:9000/9001			"

												A fantastic hybrid of roguelikes and 4X strategy games like Civilization. The great strength of this game is in the number and diversity of the factions available to play. There are seventeen factions total, allowing play as anything from a mighty Baron of men to the High Priest of an Elder God cult. All factions have unique and highly individualized play styles that will keep you going for potentially hundreds of hours. On top of the various factions the world itself is full of danger. Bandits, monsters and the ghosts that rise from the fields of battles present plenty of danger in their own right. From the makers of the Dominions series, this game offeres similar depth while being more accessible.			"

												This is my first steam review... yay!  CoE3 is a nicely put together Turn-Based Stradegy game.  It reminds me a lot of Master of Magic.  There is no control in combat, and the game does not focus on research or city building, but instead, the acquisition of units and capture of cities/towns/villages/mines/outposts/towers/etc.  With each capture, you increase your income, build your army, and set out to explore the map and find and conquer your enemies.There are numberous races in this game, and most of them play differently.  It's enough to keep me interested to keep playing and learning how they each work.  There are a massive number of unique units, there are magic items you can find and equip, and random world events which can be good or bad... losing a town due to a meteor is never fun, but it sure keeps it interesting!The game has multiplayer as well.  My friend and I play all the time, and I can say after numerous games, that this is a stable, polished, and enjoyable game to play, either single-player or multiplayer.  If you are into the turn-based world domination, my army is bigger than yours but not necessarily better type games, which offer randomly generated maps, exploration, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff, I'd highly recommend this one.The learning curve for CoE3 is a bit steep, but most of the information you can find in the games manual.  The graphics are not top-notch, but if you grew up on 90's gaming, the nostalgia is great!			"

												This is a fantasy-themed turn-based strategy game for 2-8 teams selected from 18 different classes. The graphics are very simple (think Civ 2), but gameplay is excellent, with many interesting choices to make and no obvious dominant strategy. Each of the 18 classes plays very differently from the others. It is not a pure strategy game as there elements of random chance in certain actions, most prominently in combat. Maps may be randomly generated, and a map editor is included.			"

												If you can look past the fairly simple graphics and don't mind reading a manual to help you overcome a steep learning curve and incomprehensible interface then there is a very enjoyable and strategic game waiting for you in CoE3.  There is a great variety of races to play with heaps of interesting and different units.  It is more strategy than tactics: you choose your army composition but the computer plays out battles automatically.  You need to pay attention to ensure your heroes don't kill your own army with their spells, a creeping doom will single-handedly destroy your huge army of recruited units and the RNG will sometimes make you cry, but overcoming the challenges and emerging victorious is extremely satisfying.

												This is a gem of a game, a stripped down Dominions 3/4, but not in any way a simple game.  There is a hypnotic rhythm to the turns, and 60 turns in you can still process a turn in just a couple of minutes, letting you avoid the bogged down feeling you get with so many similar games in the mid-late game.  Given, there are warts galore and lots of areas for improvement with the interface and AI, but it's such an elegant concept. The factions really play differently from each other and it is well worth your time spending a few games with each.  Give it a go, or try COE 4 due out mid-November. It's also a great introduction to Illwinter's Dominions 4 which is a crazy deep deep deep deep game that i'm still just scratching the surface of.			"

Posted: November 24, 2015
												I've never really been one for competitive 4X-style strategy games.  I've generally found them too bogged-down in micromanagement and strict formulaic approaches to really be interesting.  That's a personal taste, so I hold my ambivalence to the whole genre a bit in reserve.This game... doesn't exactly escape from micromangement, (what micromanagement it lacks, it's becuase the whole city-management aspect of 4X games was completely gutted from the game, not because it was automated to give players only the interesting choices,) but it does manage to bring a lot of new ideas to the table to make it at least more interesting, and cities and towns are just resource generation points.  What makes it interesting is that those aren't the only resource-spawning locations.  Each faction has access to different kinds of special resources gained from different terrain tiles, meaning that forests are useless to dwarves or priest-kings, but witches can farm them for fungi they use to summon more units, making controlling them critical when a witch is in play, but pointless when they are not.  This makes the value of different landscapes fluctuate based upon who's in play, unlike a game like Civilization, where all cities are operated in basically the same way, so stealing one is always both a positive to you and a negative to your opponents.That said, most factions let you summon monsters randomly from a table you have no access to, and because battles are random and uncontrollable, as well, this means that you have randomly created troops filling out uncontrolled lines of battle to fight random battles you can't control with randomly generated enemies to take up random landscapes whose composition you have little control over.  Strategy goes where?This game winds up using that classic of turn-based (especially 4X) combat models I call ""Stack Mashing"", because all you do is make a giant stack of troops, and then blithely ram it into everyone else's stacks until you run out of stack and need a new one.  In 4X games, this can generally be forgivable because the point of the game isn't some strategic maneuvering, it's building up the infrastructure to field that giant army in the first place.  In this game, however, you really don't have an infrastructure, you just have resource-generation tiles. The graphics are ""I could do better, oh, look, it lets you mod the graphics, so I CAN do better,"" and the music can be muted so you can play your own, which is generally what I wind up doing with most games that take a long time to play, anyway, since no game comes with enough music variety to last you a 100-hour game.I've also only played single player, and I'm not sure how well this game works over the Internet with random nobodies.It's interesting and has some novel ideas, and so I recommend it to strategy gamers for that reason alone.  Maybe you'll love it, but I think it's worth buying on sale just to play for a couple hours to understand what it does differently, then carry it with you next time you see a bland space 4X do the same thing a billionth time.

Necromancers must find places with lots of dead bodies to grow their army. Dwarves have one female dwarf in the city that gives birth to dwarf workers...So while it doesnt look like much, it actually is a really fun and addictive game!Just watch out for those deer taking over your castle...

												This game is actually a pretty good strategy game.  It's like what many reviewers are saying, that it is deeper than it first appears.  It's kind of like master of magic except you can't go into your town and build buildings and stuff.  It's more like Heroes of might and magic where you explore the map, fight battles, and gain control of strategic locations that increase your resources.  The resources are then used to increase your army strength.Be aware that the battles are automatic.  No battle tactics, only tactics on the strategic map.Keep in mind, there is no town/castle management.  Also it is not very pretty.  There is no tutorial or even anything to read on how to play.  There is a list of keyboard controls that you can bring up.  By continuously bringing that list up and experimenting I was able to figure out how to play after 3 or 4 little test games.There is 10 or so different leaders to start out with and they are pretty different.  Some use magic and can summon guys  to fight.  Others might only be able to recruit guys with money you earn.  It's worth the money just not real nice to look at.Working just fine in Linux Ubuntu 14.04.  Goes full screen.  Playing it on the living room TV.  Somethings are a bit hard to see but it is doable.

												Even though I have Dominions 3, I recommend this.  I might even enjoy this better, because it seems faster paced and less serious.  You don't need much time investment to the starting game settings like in Dominions.  Instead it's more of a rogue-like (I wanted to use this term rogue-like in an earlier review and thought ""no all the rogue-like fans will get all over me about that"" - but then saw another review using the term ""rogue-like 4x"" - yes that describes this game very well).It's a rogue-like 4x with game saves!  SAVES!  Okay?  All you rogue-like developer nutso's - think about adding game-saves to your rogue-likes - because I for one welcome our rogue-like game-saving not so much punsih the player when he makes a mistake overlords.Okay.. so what else can I tell you?The variety that's in Dominions still seems to be here - or most of it anyways.  It's just buried under the hood.  If I had a choice and could only buy one game between Dominions and Conquest of Elysium - I think I would pick this, just because it's a little more fun and not as taxing to play.The game is so fast-paced (for a 4x) that several games can be played in succession.  Yet it still has very much a Civilization 1 feeling to it.Lastly, the sound effects (I know.. right?) - the sound effects are pleasant and not overbearing, if simplistic.  One of those details they got right.  That, and building a whole universe of interactions.  :)			"

												Buy it!I wish I'd bought it sooner. It deserves your attention. It's a little gem, a modern Master of Magic, streamlined and simpler but with a richness that stems from the vast treasure-trove of creatures, spells and unique races already made by Illwinter. While you may be familiar with many creatures from playing Dominions, Conquest of Elysium builds on the familiar and adds twists that make it a very different experience. Dominions is for the grand strategy, long turns and slow pace with lots of planning even before the game begins. Elysium is fast, smooth, clean and streamlined. It has a lot of depth without ever overwhelming you with it. The creatures have a massive collection of traits (all with icons) that make them much more than cosmetically different. Your magical resources are only seen by those able to use them - so you're never overwhelmed by having to keep track of gems/herbs/weeds/hands of glory...etc. If you have someone who can use a new resource then you're able to see it on the map, if you don't then you can't see or claim it. It's one of the little things that helps new players. It's simple, elegant and eases you into the game gently. Simple, yes. But that isn't to say the game is easy. It's easy to lose and tricky to win. Early mistakes can end the game, losing all your commanders and castles ends the game so there's always some risk from stealthy bandits and animals capturing your castle or some invulnerable creeping doom rolling over your army. At the end of the game, the streamlined options makes the AI smarter and stronger than I've come to expect from many 'modern' games. Even on the default 'jester' difficulty setting the AI can have large armies that are quite happy to attack your towns and castles and use all the magic they have available.I've not played as every race yet, but I'm looking forward to doing so. I'm looking forward to team games, trying the different map sizes, the different ages of the world and to seeing what other hidden gems I'll find. I hope you get a chance to do all that too.So... Buy It!			"

												It's a shame that Illwinter makes people buy another full price game because they fixed ONE aspect of gameplay from CoE3 to CoE4. I really like this game but the release politics are really messed up.CoE3 already uses a foreign product engine (Dominions series) and now they basically rip off their own rip off. Sorry, but NO. You can't do very much wrong if you buy either Dominions, CoE3 or CoE 4 but don't buy more then one.			"

												This game has one of the worst UIs I have ever seen, the sound design is amuterish and the graphics are bad to middling at best and I think you should go play it. The thing is CoE 3 doesn't care about any of the stuff I just mentioned. Because the mechanics are rock solid it doesn't need flashy graphics to be a deep and engaing strategy game. It has a surprisingly large array of different armies all of which are asymetrical and distinct. If you're a fan of intellegent strategy games and miss the days when mechanics where front and center CoE 3 is for you.			"

												This is approximately the 9th time I've attempted to conquer Elysium, and I'd like to believe that I've become exceedingly efficient at it. This strategy game is great as long as you can manage risk and attempt to stack the odds in your favor in battles. Be forwarned, the A.I on higher difficulties simply gains more resources than you, but it doesn't become much smarter. Aside from all that, I would highly recommend the game.			"

												A classic-style strategy game with a massive number of classes to choose from.  Each of the unique classes have their own strengths and weaknesses that provide a high level of entertainment.  The economy system is extremely innovative as different classes (armies) gather different types of resources from the same terrain.  For example, a Baron (the knightly themed army) gathers an increased amount of gold from his villages and towns but finds little of value on forest squares, while a Druid gathers plants from the wild to produce his special units.A very unique, yet nostalgic feel to this game.  I highly recommend it.			"

												I don't think that this will be a Game everyone is going to enjoy, but I am having a blast with it and it is a good, solid turn-based Strategy game. The Graphics are not the focus of the Game, they're focused mainly on conveying information on Terrain types and showing Armies/Monsters. The real work went into the Rule-set, Gameplay, and 17 different playable Races/Classes that each have unique strengths & weaknesses. Add to those 17 Classes the epic number & variety of wandering independent monsters and the fact that Maps are randomly generated (a Map Editor is included to create your own, as well) and the replayability value of the Game is pretty impressive!

My primary army was roving about, far away from home.During the enemy/independent phase, a Bakemono thug and his army assaulted my watchtower. My squadron of soldiers + archers were quickly vanquished and the watchtower was lost... but no worry, I still had my main city. However it was only defended by 2 soldiers, I made a mental note to remember to recruit more forces there next turn.But wait, what's this.. a barbarian elephant appears in the forest just outside my main city during the same turn. It moves onto my city.. my soldiers are slain. ""Player was eliminated after losing their last citadel to independents"".GG.I ain't even madBuy this game.			"

												An interesting little game.  I've spent some nice time playing it and finished a couple of sessions.  I'd be reluctant to call it 4x, though.  Although it has all aspects of it (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), it doesn't have any other characteristics associated with 4x genre - there is no micromanagement, you can't choose different strategies for a battle, and there are no multiple ways to win the game (you have to defeat all the other factions).  I'd be prone to add 'casual' tag to it, since you don't really need to dedicate much planning and thinking to it.  The best thing about the game is it's high replay value.  There are many factions they play differently and there are multiple possibilities for the terrain.You can see from the screenshots that the graphics are no high tech, but suitable for the game.  Music is also not very exciting.The worst thing about the game is lack of any tutorial, and it's not very straight forward.  So I had to read the manual to figure out what to do.Score: 7.5 of 10			"

This game is very unique due to the face that when you go into a battle you dont actualy control what ANY of your monster/people/demons/ghosts... Etc do. and some of the abilites are extreamly entertain, And the monster are Freaky and extreamly cool too just by the way that they look and how they attack. So if your interested in games like this then it is DEFFINETLY worth checking out it was honestly worth the $9.99 even tho the graphics arnt the BEST the game is still AMAZING so i would give it a 9/10.

												Pro- factions look and play very differently; many have entirely different resources and mechanics- lots of factions to choose from- excellent battle system that doesn't rely too much on RNG but rather, you having imperfect information- battles resolve before being played, so you don't have to watch them if you don't want- lots of different types of units- custom units and mods- simple and easy multiplayerCon- Random roving monster bands often kill you at the start of games in a way that you can't control- charming, but ultimately sometimes eye-straining and plain ugly sprite-based graphics- antiquated UI that doesn't let you know what something does before clicking it- manual doesn't explain too much- very unbalanced factions- no real ""population"" or ""civilization"" mechanics to speak of- one way to win: conquest- worldmaps are boringIt's okay. If you can get over the issues in the ""Con"" section above, you may get some enjoyment out of it, but Dominions 3/4 is ultimately a better game by the same developers, that allows you more customization and has more features anyway.

												This game is about as old-school as you can get without whipping out a floppy disk.  Its layout, graphics, and gameplay could probably have all been programmed with technology available in the late 80's.  But, even with all of that, this is one of the most interesting strategy games I have ever played.  The world and mythos are unique (even though the maps themselves are randomly generated), the magical powers of each leader are distinct and interesting (each of the 17 or so races has completely different game mechanics), and the wide range of creatures and events make this game compelling far beyond what screenshots would suggest. If you like grand strategy or were a fan of the old Lords of Magic, give this a try.			"

The only diplomacy is what you manage by talking to other humans, the game assumes all players are fighting to the death and the AIs are merciless.If you've ever heard of Dominions, this game is from the same company and shares a lot of the same ideas as far as armies and units go, but it is a unique game and a lot of fun for the warlord in all of us.

												Conquest of Elysium 3 is deceptively FAR better than the screenshots would lead you to believe. If you like turn-based strategy games at all, this game will be very fun and addictive.(Some of it isnt very intuitive though, and there are no pop-up tips for new players. So either skim the manual, keep it open in a side window, or be patient until you figure the interface/mechanics out. Or catch a youtube getting started video) The other descriptions say it is very similar to the Civilization games, but it is far more similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. (there is no technology research or diplomacy or city/town improvements to build.) Armies can only move when a ""hero"" type unit is leading it. Heroes are the only way to claim the resource generating nodes on the map. The map is far more active than in Heroes of M&M though, with monsters being generated very frequently from ""neutral camps"" like ancient forests and brigand camps, until you take a hero and go clear them out and claim them, and there are random spawn events that happen to keep you from getting too comfortable. The animals will randomly wander and make you lose control of things they move over, while brigands are evil and smart and will go directly for capturing towns and villages away from you and will garrison them and they are stealthy about it.(essentially they are stealthed or cloaked and cant be seen except by running over them by accident or by bringing a stealth-detecting unit with your army, etc.)The game really shines in the strategy department. Unlike Civilization or Heroes of M&M, the class type you choose will have HUGE implications for how strategies will work (instead of minor differences), it decides what heroes you will have access to, what armies you will be able to create with heroes via magic(if any), what unit types you will be able to purchase at towns you control, bonuses with certain terrain types, weaknesses and strengths with the general types of units you have acess to, etc. Unlike most competivite strategy games the resources themselves are varied and can only be collected by the appropriate hero types. For instance a witch will claim forests and swamps to get an income of fungus to use for making magical brews to summon nature spirits for their armies. A demonologist will want to claim towns and villages in order to get an income of 'sacrifices' to summon demons for their armies. And this is just a piece of the differences.The combat itself is automated, which was annoying at first, but then I saw why later. You get so many random fights, and some fights with hero vs hero where both sides have 100+ units each, it would burn anyone out to try to control that turn by turn, unit by unit through a combat. In fact, dont miss out on the combat speed control in the upper gith hand corner of the battle screen. You will eventually tire of watching every combat play out at regular speed and will want to be able to speed it up using those controls. Also note that for your heroes and armies that can cast spells, you can inspect them outside combat to choose what spells they have ready for combat.(you dont want a frost demon to blast every creature on the battlefield with a frost attack if you have troops that could get hurt from it on your side, or you dont want to go into a fight with fire spells memorized if you know the enemy hero has tons of fire immune creatures, etc.) Also, it pays to take note of the magical items you find in your travels and from killing enemy heroes. You can trade them around between heroes, and even with your individual army members. (aka - one of your heroes finds a weapon but has one equipped already? if one of your armies he is leading could use it, they will pick it up and use it instead of it going to waste.)			"

												There's a lot to love in this game, but also a lot to hate. If you're curious but don't want to commit to cash quite yet I recommend you check out CoE2 available for free from Illwinter's site as a free download. It's a lot more limited than this version of the game, but will give you a pretty good feel for how it handles.On the good side, if you're looking for a streamlined fantasy 4X that offers a unique collection of races and play mechanics, this might be your games (I especially enjoyed Illwinter's take on why you never see any female dwarfs). It's really satisfying to finally round up enough innocents to summon demon lords, or to finally complete the necromantic ritual which will turn you into an immortal vampire in an old, abandoned castle. On the bad side, Illwinter doesn't really care that much about UI. In the Dominions series (which has gotten a lot better on this front) it was the price of admission for a really unique strategy game. With the stripped down CoE approach, the lapses in UI design feel a lot less forgivable. For example, there's no smooth way to start a new game without exiting and launching the game again. Unit moves can't be cued, so you spend a lot of time babysitting commanders on there way back to grab reinforcements.Past the interface, the abundance of unfriendly fauna can get rather obnoxious. While it's cool that you need to be careful early on, by mid game marauding bands of deer taking unprotected farms just gets annoying. Commanders are a limited resource in the game, so keeping them on hand for pest control can get frustrating. Plus I'm unaware of any kind of ""major events"" summary, so I spend a lot of time at the beginning of each turn checking my domain and making sure Bambi isn't stirring up any trouble. Then on larger maps you can have to cross fields covered with unthreatening but still annoying spawns.Finally, there's side balance. As is the case with any game that has 17 truly unique sides it's a nightmare. Necromancer's can be unstoppable in the Fallen Empire period, or they can get screwed by their early game position. Playing a side that relies on mines? Hope you start near some, because while your capital normally counts as one, there might not be any others nearby.			"

												Quite a Huge Turn-based Fantasy Strategy mess this is...I don't completely hate this game.... It actually have a very large and impressive list of different monster/magic to choose and find out. Exploration and mess troops to fight has quite a bit fun to it. You never know what’s behind fog of war and winning a game on difficulty 5+ is actually quite tough and challenging. This game was released just 4 years ago on 2012... Developer put great amount of effort to create a large fantasy world but fail to put enough fun and exciting element into the game to create a game only for the very very hard core fantasy game fan (Nerd only). It's just not friendly and fun enough for the common people.You have about 15 different hero to choose from 10 different of map generation to create a random map for your commander to discover and defeat. There is no tutorial session and I recommend everyone who wish to play this game go read at least half of the manual before starting. (The first thing u need to learn is transfer units to commander). Maps are not always generated fairly and after trying a few games I believe the element of mountain/hill are a bit too much so your units move quite slowly most of the time. Winning is beat the other faction by either kill all their commander or taken all their castle. Discover though fog of wall for independent monster, village, and monster lairs. Magic items can be found and equip the hero into a crazy power house if you are lucky. Hero’s level up and spell/strength become quite powerful if you just fight enough battles. On small map a Game is quite fast. Defend your home and explore out in circular motion and take as much resource tile as possible while not losing too many units. You can only recruit unit and you cannot build any buildings or village yourself. Music... Is... Kind of depressing if u ask me and me personally got bored of it quickly...Graphics is not too bad but consider its 2012 game. It should really be done better...If you win a game after much effort (on difficulty 5+) or less effort (difficulty 1-5) you will get the very basic and minimum winning screen. There are not individual different ending depend on which hero/faction you choose. Quite a shame really consider the background of all of the different factions are quite fun and basic game over ending make you lose energy to replay.6.5/10 as a game but I still won't recommend people to play this unless you are a fantasy 4X nerd.

												Gameplay... varied and holds your interest.  ahuge variety of races, spells, weapons and random events. Interface is mildy clunky but workable.  Difficulty increases as the game progresses.  If you need flashy graphics don't bother with this rogue like strategy game, but they are not bad for what it is. Very pleasantly surprised by the value and the work the devs have put in to this game.  Well worth the money.    8/10.			"

												I'd call this Dominions Lite meets Roguelike. it's a good game in it's own way, and especially easy to recommend if you find Dominions too deep/hard/whatnot.my problem is I find the Dominions formula to be perfect, so this feels a tad shallow... it has it's own depth, mind you. I just may need to give it another go to realize it's goodness. (note I'm a huge fan of Illwinter, the developers)that said, I insta-bought Dom4 as soon as it got a sale (I'm too poor to pay full price), but I'm having a hard time jumping into the CoE4 sale (70% off currently). for one, I have way more games than back then, but for another, I've only played CoE3 about 6 hours before moving on, while I played Dom3 a good 100 hours before getting 4, then played about another 100 hours, then decided my backlog wouldn't play itself - I never really got bored with it.note, I'm a huge fan of traditional roguelikes, but that's still not enough for me to keep playing this (other than giving it a second chance just in case - it wouldn't be the first game I find ""just okay"" at first, then after a long-ish while fall absolutely in love with it) TL;DR: it's good in it's own way, but a tad too shallow if what you loved most about Dominions was the nearly-overwhelming depth. 6/10 maybe? EDIT - 5ish hours later, I'm starting to get the hang of it (tip: don't start in ""pis s boy"" difficulty, the AI is too dumb - get straight to ""Jester"", it's still easy but you won't auto-win as soon as things start to get interesting), yet I'm still not that sure how long will it hold my attention (it DOES have a learning curve), or if I should get the CoE4.

												Reminiscent of the old ZX Spectrum game 'Chaos', Conquest of Elysium 3 benefits from a good deal of randomness and happenstance.  There is no careful balancing to ensure a 'smooth gameplay experience' and the game is all the better for it.  Morrowind was better than Oblivion precisely because it didn't smooth out the gameplay, it provided you with unfair challenges early on so that eventual victory meant something.			"

												It's not without its flaws. The interface can be very obtuse. My biggest gripe is how easy it is to get wiped out by the bands of animals and marauders within the first dozen turns. (And it isn't as though this doesn't also happen to the AI - watching my ally be eliminated by a small group of wild animals was painful to say the least.) But if you can make it past the initial stages the strategy of the game really shines. I encounter new kinds of monsters and familiars every time I play, and all of them have their quirks that can make attacking without tailoring your army beforehand very unwise. The different factions you can play as all require radically different management of terrain resources and have unique military options available to them, yet it's never managed to feel grossly imbalanced. Really, the amount of variety and content in this is phenomenal and the graphics are surprisingly decent. I very much recommend this game.			"

												So take a war game, mix in some territory and resource aspects, and give it a dose of the crazy units and traits of Dominions 3, and you have this.    The various factions that you can pick all play dramatically diffrent from one another, from the Troll King who just barrels through the world on his own, to the Hoburgs who rely on converting farms to more profitable things, the dwarves who have to rely on the player's ability to keep troop supply lines in mind, or even some dumb wizards who can go and get themselves killed by their own summons (Plus more crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥.The game is also very moddable and you can get new maps/units/factions made/installed pretty easily.If you don't mind some old♥♥♥♥♥looking graphics and some old timey IP-address hookup for multi, this is totally something you should get.

												It's not the prettiest car in the lot, but it'll take you everywhere you want to go. At first I bumbled around not knowing what anything did but after a while, I realized how everything worked. 50+ hours later it's become one of my favorite ways to waste a few hours. Things you'll definitely like:It's a solid Turn Based Strategy. Quite a few choices of who to play as, and what the world you play in will be like. Units differ greately from nation to nation. Unique time periods that you can play in, each with it's own special randomized tidbits to throw your armies at. If you get into it, it'll eat a few hours of your life and you'll love every minute of itThings you might not like: You don't control how the fights go down.You will learn to hate woodland creatures as they terrorize you. You'll have to spend a while getting the hang of anything. Your best wizard will only cast his worst spell, every turn. There is always something hiding somewhere, and you'll run into it when you don't want to.

												Sid Meier said that good games are a series of interesting choices. This game fits that bill, in spades.The genius of this game is that the interesting choices start on Turn 1 of this turn based strategy game, and they never let up. There is no down time. Do you go for that coal mine, even though that will leave you far from your home base? Do you even have an army that can win, if you do decide to attack? Should you wait a couple turns to summon more creatures, even though you really, really, really need that gold? Did you leave enough defenders at your home base? Shold I save up my Druid herbs to upgrade my apprentice, or should I spend them now to better go on the offensive? The interesting choices never stop, all through the game.However...If you just fire it up and click Start New Game, you won't know how to do anything, you'll think the game is stupid, the graphics are ugly, the UI is unintuitive (actually, this part is kinda true) and never play it again. This happened to me, in fact. This is an old fashioned game. You gotta use the manual, I won't say read the manual, but use it. Leave it open while you play and Alt-Tab. If the game clicks for you, after a game or two you will be dying to read the manual all the way through. But it's gonna take a bit of work at the beginning because of the wonky UI. I think your effort will be richly rewarded.This game is easily worth full price, and if you can catch it on sale, it's the steal of the century.			"

												I have to be honest I didn't expect much from this game, buying it on sale for $2.70.  However, I would have paid the normal price easily if I knew what it was.  If you don't care about graphics and you have an imagination, this game is fantastic.  There are 17 different races, all of them play differently.  There really isn't that much in the way of plot, but what there is somehow just fuels the rest on its own, and those simple few paragraphs description before you start playing actually set the playing field and it's pretty cool.  I'd call the gameplay somewhat kind of similar to civilization II and graphics and feel of Dwarf Fortress.The frustrating part is every single thing from dragons to bunny rabbits to plants want to ruin your day and take over your stuff, so watch out for... everything			"

												This is just too user unfriendly to recommend. The factions are very different, but the ugly, automatic combat really drags down the game. You have NO control over combat. You don't even get to choose a basic strategy for the combat, like in King of Dragon Pass. And big fights can involve HUNDREDS of individual units! You can fast forward the fight or even just skip to the end, but it's jarring to be just presented with the end result (""Wait, how did Bob the Sorceror die???""). There isn't even a combat results screen listing deaths and injuries. About injuries - have you read the funny review for this game by the guy who was using goblin archers, and they all died except for one, who turned out to be missing all his shots because he was blind in both eyes? That's a funny story, but it's a HUGE nuisance that the game doesn't indicate that a unit has been crippled unless you manually check EACH one. (The developers are planning to add tactical combat to the next game in the series, but the early screenshots show that it's still an ugly mess with too many units).Resource management is also a pain, because there are WAY TOO MANY resource nodes. This is especially bad with classes such as the Troll King that can and should control EVERY SINGLE FOREST TILE, but every class has to capture tons of tiny little villages and such to get a coin or two of income. And because there's tons of random wildlife running around, you need to either leave a decent number of units behind at each resource node, or a rampaging deer will somehow ""conquer"" the town and make them stop sending tribute, so you'll have to send someone to RE-conquer it.I can deal with the graphics being worse than games from 20 years ago, but I can't tolerate that the GAMEPLAY is worse than ancient games like Master of Magic.The guys who make this game are like the Wachowskis - they've got some really great ideas, but they desperately need an editor, which in this case means selling out to a company who uses their creativity but doesn't tolerate bloated game design.

Posted: June 14, 2014
												I recommend this game for fans of fantasy turn-based strategy 4x games.  Made by the developers of Domnions, it's a different take on the genre from the Dominions series or anything else out there.  It is faster paced and more about combat than most games of this type.  You choose from a roster of unique leaders (from Necromancers to Troll Kings to the CoE equivalent of Hobbits), and start on a single fortress unique to your leader.  You can capture farms, towns, cities, fortresses, and magical sites.  Each turn is a month and the seasons matter - winter will slow your troops to a crawl and cut your income.  Combat is non-interactive - you can set the spells you want your casters to draw from before battle but that's about it.  There is no diplomacy - everyone is at war unless they are on your team from the start.  The interface is quite intuitive and right-clicking on just about anything will bring up an explanation.    The best part of this game is how uniquely each of the 18 leader classes plays.  They each have different magical resource requirements, spells, units, methods of recruiting units and progression paths.  For instance, as a Demonologist, you will need people to sacrifice to summon demons and upgrade your casters.  That makes controlling towns and cities important.  In contrast, the Witch powers her summoning spells and upgrades from fungi gathered in forests and swamps - settlements are far less important to her.  I think this is absolutely brilliant game design and the most fun in the game is had by learning each class and struggling to stay alive in the first 50 turns while fighting neutrals and other computer players.  The game is not without its flaws and frustrations.  The graphics are charming but primitive.  The lack of control over combat can be frustrating - you can lose battles you should win because your idiot spellcasters won't pick the correct spell.  It is difficult to hold territory because your captured settlements don't generate any militia (except for a few leader classes).  You can and do often lose a key city or mine to a rampaging group of 3 small snakes.   The map generator tends to make somewhat wonky maps - each terrain tile seems to be independent of its neighbors so you are unlikely to see a large forest or mountain range.  Instead you'll find randomly clumped tiles that don't look like realistic geography.  And after you've survived the difficult but enjoyable early game, the mid and late game tend to drag on.  It's too bad you can't develop any of the settlements or fortresses (or even build roads to quicken the horrendously slow pace of your armies).  That might add an empire building aspect to the game that would keep it interesting beyond the first 50 turns.  More rituals for each class would also be nice.  As it stands, most classes basically have a weak summon, medium summon, and strong summon spell.  Rituals affecting the world would add a lot to the game.  For instance, if I could blast those aforementioned 3 snakes with a fireball or cast the world into eternal darkness, the mid and late-game would be a lot more fun.   Let's hope CoE 4 adds more depth to the mid and late game.     However, as it stands the game's advantages heavily outweigh its shortcomings.  I found it to be a breath of fresh air and greatly enjoyed playing a game with each of the 18 leader classes.  If you like fantasy TBS games and are not turned off by the primitive graphics, you'll find it to be a treat.      "

												Very fun, very deep. Overall, highly recommended. My only complaint is the sheer number of 'critters' (i.e. deer, snakes, etc.) that run around on the map. I've had times when virtually every tile is covered with them. As soon as I kill them, there are a million more. Plus, how the hell can a single deer take over a whole town?!??! Would a deer wandering into a village really bring production to a halt???I'd recommend ""lairs"", where a large concentration of one type of creature lives and which spawns mobs until cleared out. That way you could use these animals strategically - clear them out if you don't want them, or leave them active between you and your enemy so that he'll have to go through a bunch of moose or whatever to get to you.

												I wish I could find the right words to capture this game's experience, in a way it justly deserves!  First let me start off by saying, this game was NOT rushed in the development.  The developer accomplished a completely functional game that pulls off the hybrid mix of Turn-based strategy games like Civilization (very much like the original Sid Meir's Civilization), and many of your favorite old school role-playing games, without redundant menus, complicated interfaces and pointless cosmetic displays.  It's a simple game, that somehow manages to get it all right, perfectly!  Everything you need to know is right on the main window, or a couple of right and left mouse clicks away.  The factions are incredibly diverse, not like most games today, which is merely a ""re-skinning"" of a generic faction, but each faction seemlessly plays by its own ""logical"" rules in a fantasy world.  It plays like an adventure, set in a strategy fantasy world of conquest.   Non-linear, journey, exploring a constantly evolving world, and shaping it to your own character's specialized needs and strengths.  And the modding opportunities...			"

Furthermore most of the time you'll have a problem with random creeps spawning and conquering your towns, forests, mines or whatever you need. Espacially frustrating is the fact, that your allies can conquer your belongings. But the game has a nice variety of races which all play differently (well mostly at least) and the game is quiet quick to learn (since you can't actually do the battles).I like it a lot, although it probably is not for everyone.

												This game is not winning any graphical awards; it looks a bit 8 bit retro, except that isn't intentional, I think. The tactical battles are not interactive. The interface is workable, although it's easy to notice details that could be smoother. The soundscape is middling to fair, mostly due to the soundtrack and not the effects.But the gameplay is great. The variety in factions and how they play is great. You have 17 factions. None of them are all that good. The 'holy church of El' wants to break the seals and release the apocalypse. The deep ones... yeah. Necromancers, Demonologist, and a Troll King. Holy Priestess? Nope, worshipping a demon god. There are a few that are not intrinsically evil, I think that's about as far as you can stretch it in the alignment scale. Still, to illustrate the factional differences.. the Troll King is awesome in battle. He can lay waste to armies on his own. (And at start, that's what you have to do). But after a while, an overly critical mum sends a cauldron of gold because you're not doign so well. That helps a lot, you can finally buy a few units... and then suddenly the dread message: Mum is coming over to take over because her bumbling son is an idiot. New unit spawns in the HQ: Mom. Which is a troll witch of considerable skill, and a definite gamechanger.You don't get high price games that try to pull all the wacky, wonderful, or scary stuff going around here. It is described as a 'strategy rogue-like', a surprisingly apt description.

												This game is not winning any graphical awards; it looks a bit 8 bit retro, except that isn't intentional, I think. The tactical battles are not interactive. The interface is workable, although it's easy to notice details that could be smoother. The soundscape is middling to fair, mostly due to the soundtrack and not the effects.But the gameplay is great. The variety in factions and how they play is great. You have 17 factions. None of them are all that good. The 'holy church of El' wants to break the seals and release the apocalypse. The deep ones... yeah. Necromancers, Demonologist, and a Troll King. Holy Priestess? Nope, worshipping a demon god. There are a few that are not intrinsically evil, I think that's about as far as you can stretch it in the alignment scale. Still, to illustrate the factional differences.. the Troll King is awesome in battle. He can lay waste to armies on his own. (And at start, that's what you have to do). But after a while, an overly critical mum sends a cauldron of gold because you're not doign so well. That helps a lot, you can finally buy a few units... and then suddenly the dread message: Mum is coming over to take over because her bumbling son is an idiot. New unit spawns in the HQ: Mom. Which is a troll witch of considerable skill, and a definite gamechanger.You don't get high price games that try to pull all the wacky, wonderful, or scary stuff going around here. It is described as a 'strategy rogue-like', a surprisingly apt description. Your grand armies can be destroyed in moments and your empire reduced to crumbling ruins by a bad choice, it is fast-paced and light-hearted. I can highly recommend this to anyone who want a novel take on the fantasy wargame genre... and at the price*? It's a no-brainer.* Steam sale, at time of writing.			"

												Very fun, very deep. Overall, highly recommended. My only complaint is the sheer number of 'critters' (i.e. deer, snakes, etc.) that run around on the map. I've had times when virtually every tile is covered with them. As soon as I kill them, there are a million more. Plus, how the hell can a single deer take over a whole town?!??! Would a deer wandering into a village really bring production to a halt???I'd recommend ""lairs"", where a large concentration of one type of creature lives and which spawns mobs until cleared out. That way you could use these animals strategically - clear them out if you don't want them, or leave them active between you and your enemy so that he'll have to go through a bunch of moose or whatever to get to you.

												I wish I could find the right words to capture this game's experience, in a way it justly deserves!  First let me start off by saying, this game was NOT rushed in the development.  The developer accomplished a completely functional game that pulls off the hybrid mix of Turn-based strategy games like Civilization (very much like the original Sid Meir's Civilization), and many of your favorite old school role-playing games, without redundant menus, complicated interfaces and pointless cosmetic displays.  It's a simple game, that somehow manages to get it all right, perfectly!  Everything you need to know is right on the main window, or a couple of right and left mouse clicks away.  The factions are incredibly diverse, not like most games today, which is merely a ""re-skinning"" of a generic faction, but each faction seemlessly plays by its own ""logical"" rules in a fantasy world.  It plays like an adventure, set in a strategy fantasy world of conquest.   Non-linear, journey, exploring a constantly evolving world, and shaping it to your own character's specialized needs and strengths.  And the modding opportunities...			"

												What I really like about this game is that it scratches the board game itch. I have very few hours on Steam but I bought this before it made it to Steam. Anyhow, CoE3 seems to have been partially inspired by Fantasy Flight's classic Runbound and Runewars - both of which I would sell my soul for digital versions.What may put some gamers off would be the minimalist battle graphics. This is not a Total War game. Rather, this is a strategy-wargame in a more pure essence. The really cool thing about CoE3 is that like the best fantasy boardgames, you never know what the game will throw at you. Yes, sometimes you will want to rage quit but persevere and when you do win, you will know you have earned a hard fought victory. So, why are you reading this? The game is on sale this week for 3.49 USD for a lifetime of fun!! Buy it, play it, love and hate it then come back for more. ;)			"

												Decent game, but is only half done and its potential half exploited.Worse of all, this is a Turn-Based game and there are NO AUTOSAVE! Come on! We're in 2016 and these guys can't even make an autosave feature in their games.I would recommend this game to casual gamers if it had an autosave, because it seems complicated, but it is not at all. You just go with logic and you'll be fine (soldiers are better than militia for example).But with that primary feature in a turn-based game missing, thumbs down for these guys who do half games.			"

												I found this game unintersting and unplayable.At first, it kind of reminded me of the old game, ""Questron"".  It was a C-64 game that was pretty good.  The old-school graphics reminded me of something that I found enticing about those old exploration/combat games a la Ultima I - VI.The more I played, however, the more I began to understand that there's a difference between something that looks old school and is remniscent of my days past and something that is old school.Old school is just that -- old.  I don't mind the retro style of programming and gaming, but the content should be contemporary, the mechanics should be modern.  I found the controls in this game to be unnecessarily clunky and burdensome.  I couldn't easily figure out how to check the statuses of various units and really couldn't understand.  The animations didn't just look old school  -- they WERE OLD.  Again, it seems as though I'm splitting hairs by saying this, but  there are plenthy of retro games out there that truly are innovative and cutting edge in the content they provide.One way I could express my experience with this game -- I always felt as though I was on the cusp of an enjoyable experience.  At times, I almost began enjoying what I was playing.  Almost.  But then the clunky interface would strike or the ancient game mechanics or the old (not old-school but OLD) graphics would take away the enjoyment.I couldn't figure it out and I didn't feel like putting the time in to do so.  Sorry.			"

												Intro to the review: Wow what a game HEHAHAHE! This game is 10.99$ and let me tell you, this game is basically the overlord of strategy games; people always cry and moan and say ''boohoo I'm a little child, civilzation is the only good strategy game out there.''. You know what I say, I say screw those kids man, Conquest of elysium is the way to go if you aren't some meta slave underage pimple faced lesion upon the behind of the unholy dark king satan himself.Summary of the game: You play as some random race—well not exactly random, there are like nine thousand races to choose from— and the goal is simple, YOU CONQUER ELYSIUM, SIMPLE? IS IT NOT. HEHEHEHAHAHA. YEEHAW PARTNER. SEE YOU LATER ALIGATOR, IN A WHILE CROCODILE, THAT'S ALL SHE WROTE. Intermission: I wish there was a race that let me enslave other races and use their grinded up bones as some sort of gasoline fuel hybrid to power my war machines, but that aside, yes I do like Ice cream.The big cheese: It's very much a point and click game, but there is some depth to it. It is as they say, easy to play but difficult to master. You can have very much fun in this lovely game while being blissfully ingnorant to it's contents. Or you can really go deep into and penetrate the thin haze of confusion that is a new strategy game and really learn how to play this masterpiece. But, it, is, optional.Conclusion: If you're some crazy kid with an edgy haircut, kill yourself. I rate this game good/10.			"

												This is a wonderful game. The amount of content is fantastic and the variety of units and heros makes for many happy hours of fantasy wars.One small con is that user interface isn't super friendly so watching a how to or game-play video on CoE3 would be a good way to quickly learn the ins and outs of how to manage your army.Pros include: Huge variety of units and artifacts; I ran into a super powerful ring for the first time after playing for 70+ hours. Random maps; so no two games play out the same. Random events, sometimes a aspiring dark mage will ""accidentally” open a gate to the neither world and demons will come rushing out to terrorize the nearby country side.The last and perhaps best part about this game, is that each race plays out very different from eachother and yet very close to what you would expect in popular lore. When you play a necromancer, you can raise incredibly large armies in a single turn, these troops, while vast in numbers, are really slow and have no range, but the feeling of impending doom when fighting them as the raise more and more troops is loads of fun! This is a very different feel from playing another school of magic such as the enchanter. With the enchanter you enchant massive Golums to do your bidding or perhaps create Necrotods (snake that will bewitch your enemies troops into fighting for you.)Regardless of who you play, and there are 17 classes to choose from, each race has a very different feel and style that keeps the CoE3 fresh and fun for many, many hours. I watched someone play it on you tube for 30 minutes before I purchased it. So when I started I had a good grasp of how to play. I would recommend doing this so that you do not get frustrated with the slightly unintuitive interface.  "

												9/10, it's a great strategy game - especially at the price.  It plays like the old Civilization games, but there's no building of cities - instead you conquer what's out there.  It makes for a faster paced start instead of waiting 15 turns to pop out a settler to expand.  The varied races play *very* differently which is a pleasant change from most of these games where it's just cosmetic differences between factions.  The Senator (Rome) is a simple faction based around building legions of troops to overwhelm your opponents.  Other factions instead rely on summoning a few super powerful monsters to obliterate the enemy.The only negative is that the user interface leaves something to be desired.			"

												This game reminds me so much of a finely crafted board game! It is all there - a customizable, randomly generated game world filled with interesting places scattered throughout a vast wilderness to explore; armies formed of a myriad of different creatures, led by powerful commanders; game mechanics straightforward enough to grasp for new players, yet hiding remarkable depth. Graphics are simple but completely adequate - again, contributing to the board game feel. Duly described as a ""fantasy roguelike"", Conquest of Elysium 3 plays quick and is great fun: with all its lovely details, it sparks the player's imagination and creates an immersion not often experienced. Give it a spin - it is well worth your time.			"

												CONQUEST OF ELYSIUM3 is a great 4X game that has some roguelike elements. COE3 doesn't really have a story; all you need to know is that you have to destroy the capital city of the other players. COE is a turn based 4X game which means that you really have to think through you moves. You can assign armies and those armies can move around freely across the map. If you move one a tile that provides any sort of resources you’ll conquer that tile. If enemies are on such a tile you have to fight the opponent’s army before conquering the tile. With your new resources you can build more troops and with those new troops you can repeat the process. Compared to other 4X games COE3 is rather easy and doesn't acquire a lot of learning although a tutorial is completely missing. I got all the information i needed to play the game through the manual. It sucks that there is no tutorial because I think every game should have some explanation on how it works. But that's actually the only coplaint I have. Another great feature are the races you can play as. They all have different abilities and that spices the game up. I would recommend COE3 to everyone who likes 4X games.			"

												With time strategy games have become more complex.  They have become more micromanaged, and these complexicites have provided more immerisive levels of game play.  However Conquest of Elysium 3 provides a simplified experience that is great in its own way.  Each class of hero (from which there are 16) the player has to choose from has a very different style of gameplay from the other classes.  This includes classes that are seeming similar, however you will find each play through, according to the class will be very different according to what could seem to be small nuiances.  If random maps and events are your thing there is no shortage here (not to mention moding options that can increase the factions and randomness).  Other than that you pick units to purchase with gold, and according to your class your unique resource (herbs, Sacrifices, Crystals; etc.) that allow you to purchase unique units or spells.  Combat is automatic; the only control you have is spells memorized by casters and the units entering the battle.  This is a great game and I caught it on a steam sale for a couple bucks, and I definitely recommend Conquest of Elysium 3 without reservations.			"

												I love this game. I love it so much that I purposely avoid playing it for fear that it will become a massive timesink. It surely has the potential to be a Civ-type stealer of hours. Basically CoE3 is a giant fantasy toybox. You get to wander around the land as one of 17 different races. You fight for and acquire resources that you use to fund your ever growing army. You then throw your armies at other armies and they duke it out to the death. It's fun as ♥♥♥♥. There is of course WAY more depth than I am letting on to, but at it's core it's like when you were a kid and you made your action figures fight each other. The diversity of the playable races is extremely high. They are all unique and play very differently from each other. Highly recommended if you are a high-fantasy nerd, like me.			"

												The interface is abysmal, the sound design is lackluster, the graphics are simple to put it lightly...And if you can get past the fact that it's completely lacking any of those bells and whistles and take the time to figure out how to play, you will be rewarded with one of the most mechanically sound 4X games I've ever played. Have you ever played a Civilization game and thought ""this is nice, but it's just lacking -something-, feels like it's too aesthetic-heavy, and I really wish it didn't take four days non-stop to play one game""? Try this. The pacing is excellent, each 'race' plays totally differently instead of just having one or two unique units availible only at a certain point in the game and feel fairly well-balanced in spite of it, it only takes a couple of hours to play a game through, you'll continue to have that feeling of exploration and conquest through the game instead of only at the beginning, and it even feels more like you're building an empire than Civ games because NPCs will actually put up a fight, and be genuinely lethal if you let your guard down.So, if you'd like a 4X strategy game in an interesting fantasy setting with excellent pacing and very well executed RPG elements, give Conquest of Elysium a try, but only if you can get over games with weak graphics, sound, and interface. Great for classic roguelike players who are used to ASCII graphics and perplexing interfaces.If you -don't- like 4X strategy games or are thinking of getting into them and looking for a springboard, just walk away now, this is not the place to start.

												I wasn't expecting much when I bought this game for a dollar, but I got my money's worth. Hell, I'd say it's worth the whole ten. It's not a perfect game. The graphics are lacking, and the sound will drive you insane. The music is good, but each attack of the same type sounds exactly the same. Gameplay wise however, you'll find that the gameplay is extremly entertaining once you get over a few ui dificulties. It does not come with a tutorial, but you could read the guide, or get the hang of it after experimanting for a while. Each of the many many classes plays differently, which leads to loads of different gameplay opertunities. All around, I only recomend the full priced game to be played by those who love stratagy games, and will put time into a game before puting it down. At bargin price up to 7 dollars, (or full price if you go by the dollar per hour thing), it's a steal.			"

You then throw your armies at other armies and they duke it out to the death. It's fun as ♥♥♥♥. There is of course WAY more depth than I am letting on to, but at it's core it's like when you were a kid and you made your action figures fight each other. The diversity of the playable races is extremely high. They are all unique and play very differently from each other. Highly recommended if you are a high-fantasy nerd, like me.			"

												I wasn't expecting much when I bought this game for a dollar, but I got my money's worth. Hell, I'd say it's worth the whole ten. It's not a perfect game. The graphics are lacking, and the sound will drive you insane. The music is good, but each attack of the same type sounds exactly the same. Gameplay wise however, you'll find that the gameplay is extremly entertaining once you get over a few ui dificulties. It does not come with a tutorial, but you could read the guide, or get the hang of it after experimanting for a while. Each of the many many classes plays differently, which leads to loads of different gameplay opertunities. All around, I only recomend the full priced game to be played by those who love stratagy games, and will put time into a game before puting it down. At bargin price up to 7 dollars, (or full price if you go by the dollar per hour thing), it's a steal.			"

												First things first - if you are a player who needs modern, fancy sounds and graphics and a highly developed UI to enjoy a game, walk away from COE3; it is not for you. The game is hilariously retro, it is basically the fantasy world conquest game that everyone would have made in 1978 if the technology had allowed it.The good news is that the gameplay itself is great, replayability is huge, and most of the possible sides differ greatly from one another in so far as the best ways to play them. They are also sometimes quite unexpected - for example, the Dwarves are some sort of bees, apparently? The AI is nothing special, but it's adequate. I have seen worse in much more expensive and flashier games.If you like old-style TBS games, this one's a gem.			"

												Its an old styled game, and it's not just fun and tactical, but it will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you laugh about it.I lost a game once, because a boar spawned near my capitol city and walked onto it 2 turns later, automatically taking command of it as I slaughtered my enemies. Game Over, lost to a wild pig who was now the ruler of my capitol.Yup, you need it too.			"

												Functional graphics and sound aside, this game is deeply rewarding, but can be very punishing if you are impatient or not thinking strategically. A very worthwhile way to spend your time if you enjoy strategy turn-based games. Note: I've got hundreds of hours logged with COE3 on Desura.			"
