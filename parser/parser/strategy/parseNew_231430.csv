												I really like this game and it is a really good game. So why dont I recommend it? Well the reason is simple: Relic has turned this game into a giantic ♥♥♥♥ing cashgrab with pay2win commanders, an overpriced in game store with microtransactions and a slow transition into a free2play game. This could be related to the 2013 takeover by SEGA and an imposed microtransactions model. I would'nt have granted them a single cent if I knew what they would end up trying to do. Free2play is coming soon. Every update is clear step in the free2play direction. In a final assault they want to get everyone to buy the game before they actually make it f2p. Like with almost every game, free2play will demolish of what is left of a once great game. If you really want to play, just wait for the free2play. No, its really that ♥♥♥♥ing bad. During the 2015 christmas sale, certain items were 75% off. Great!, is what you might think. However these ♥♥♥♥ers are so ♥♥♥♥ING greedy that they actually raised the price of certain commanders to 9 euro,s (instead of the normal 2-3) so that they could pretend giving a -75% discount, while selling it for the orginal price :^). Another example: The British expansion costs originally 13 euro’s. It has day0DLC commanders that cost 12 euro’s total. So you’ve just bought an expansion and then you already have to pay again? Didn’t I just purchase the expansion to the game…? Meanwhile I spend about 100 euro's on this game and I always did so gladly. Even with day0 DLC, ""no we wont add pay2win commanders, but we actually are adding pay2win commanders"", a 40 euro single player campain that didn't add any MP-content and wasn't even worth half of the orginial price, a weird random drop system that they just used to justify their pay2win model, ""because now you can get it by drop so it doesnt matter were asking outrages prices for content in our store"". (The chance that something drops you actually need or want is nihil and the only thing that really drops are crappy bulletins). Yet, I have always defended this game because it was enjoyable and it was a good RTS. In the end the game is still fine, but the way Relic and Sega want to make money of its player base is not. They have crossed the line.  In recent patches they have made it clear that they only see's players as a cow to be milked before they send you off to the slaughter in the free2play ♥♥♥♥fest they are planning, comrad!. Be smart and invest in a company that actaully gives a ♥♥♥♥ about their player base. If you don't own this game yet, wait for free2play. If you really want to play it... well the only thing I can say is: get it on sale. It would be worth the money, but be aware of what your getting yourself into and the direction that Relic and Sega are taking this game.As a historian I'm offended that they could abuse one of the most significant events in human history like this. They have chosen to use the traditional American centric Hollywood perspective on the war.  Some might like that perspective, but I think those with deeper historical knowledge and understanding will find it unsatisfying and childish. The campaign of COH2 was thus not compelling and (imo) did not paint a complete and historical accurate picture of the Eastern front.			"

												I have to write this review as it troubles me greatly the way that SEGA are distributing games.  I like Company of Heroes 2 and I like playing it just as I like the Total War series but I do not like the precedent that is being set through DLC and need to make others aware of it.I am reviewing this game on the basis that it is full price and all the DLC is full price, which no sane person would pay!  Please, please wait until the game and all its content are on sale to buy it else you feel like you've had a raw deal.  I bought this game for £10 from a supermarket when it was on special offer and the deals Steam puts on can undercut that.  I felt I had got a good deal but if I had paid £29.99 I certainly would have felt cheated.I'm from a generation of gamers who used to play on 4 colour 8-bit computers where you had to wait for games to load via a tape player that you bought from Tandy.  I've seen the development of PC games from Doom to the present day and it was a sad fact that the internet was double edged.  We had good things like forums, multiplayer servers, modders and the publisher could release updates for the game.  Then the bad like publishers releasing buggy, unfinished games which would then be patched later.  Now we can add to that the insidious practice of DLC (down loadable content) that we must pay for to use.  Now I'm a realist, some DLC such as extra levels or new units may be worth paying for where it adds to the game and its here to stay.  SEGA aren't the only distributors to sell DLC but in the case of Company of Heroes 2 they do let you know what you haven't got!Let me explain.  So you've just paid £29.99 for this and checked out the DLC from the store page and see that there's some Theatres of War and an add on for Ardennes Assault (this is really a separate game and I won't cover that in detail here but it is a very good campaign).  So what do you get for £29.99?  You get a base Soviet campaign, one theatre of war and some commanders, skins and intel bulletins for skirmish/multiplayer (more on that later).  So you have a relativity engaging single player campaign but for multiplayer you quickly realise you've just been sold a 'starter pack' if you will and you're lacking a hell of a lot.  That doesn't mean it isn't there, it just you can't use it!On the main menu screen you are hit with adverts for DLC - Theatres of War, Ardennes Assault and Fox company rangers to try and get you to purchase them.  It seems the game delights in showing you what you don't have.So you click on the store page and you are taken to options you cannot see through Steam, you have to see them through the game, those are: Commanders, Skins and Faceplates, all with associated costs.  Then you thin, what have I actually paid for other than the short campaign?  A good Question and the answer raises more questions!The theatres of war are like mini campaigns which take place on the maps from multiplayer and some are very challenging but they aren’t worth the full price of the game.  You look at the cost for all the Theatres of War DLC (Southern Fronts £2.99, Stalingrad £6.99 & Case Blue £6.99), total of £16.97.  Now comes the gut wrenching part, the cost for all those bits of DLC for multiplayer.  For those who aren’t familiar with the Company of Heroes games one of their traits is it allows you to select a commander  who has specific abilities that you can use to gain a tactical advantage during the game.  This can be the ability to call in airstrikes, off map artillery, special units or uniquely powerful armoured units such as Tiger tanks.  In the original game there were three commanders (Infantry, Airborne and Armoured).  In this game there are lots, I don’t know how many but there’s a forum about it somewhere.  Initially when you buy the game you get a basic number of commanders for the Soviets and the Werhmacht.  (I got a message that as a legacy player I’d unlocked some so I have a number that weren’t ‘unlocked’ with the base game).  These are critical for your experience on multiplayer and skirmish as the computer can use commanders you don’t have access to and it will.  Likewise, online players may have access to that German commander who can call in a Tiger Ace (a Tiger tank with full veterancy level) and you don’t have a commander who can call in an equally powerful unit.  This makes the game unbalanced.OK, so I talked about ‘unlocking’ commanders and earlier on I mentioned intel bulletins.  Intelligence Bulletins change the mechanics of the game and you can select three from a vast number of options.  Some are subtle such as giving machine guns a 2% faster rate of fire and some have a greater impact such as giving tanks 20% greater accuracy.  You can’t buy these through DLC (that’s no loss as there’s already plenty of that) you have to ‘unlock’ them.  You unlock more commanders, intel bulletins, vehicle skins and other goodies via the war spoils system.  This essentially involves grinding away for hours on skirmish matches to ‘win’ random war spoils.  There’s no logic or pattern to what you get, when you get it or how many get.  For instance after one 20 minute game I won two war spoils and after one 1 hour game I got none.  Plus you can get repeats like trading cards except you can’t trade them with anyone.  So intel bulletins and commanders are classified as common, scarce and rare.  The rare types being the more useful and more powerful.  ‘Rubbish’ you cry, I want the special commanders, can’t I download them?  Yes you can, at a price through that store page accessed via the game.  Now I’m not saying that anyone would buy all the commanders, or that you would even need to, especially as many just have different combinations of the same abilities.  But just say you’re a completest, well there are: 1 x starter bundle of four commanders at £6.49, 8 commanders at £2.79/each, 8 commanders at £2.99/each and 10 commanders at £1.99/each.  Total cost = £72.63.I’m not finished with the DLC here though, no, you can also alter the cosmetic appearance of the game with vehicle skins (different camouflage paint jobs) and for a full set you need three (one for light vehicles, one for medium and one for heavy).  Now I’m not big on paying for cosmetic changes but just say you wanted to as they were there and you wanted them all.  There are two starter packs (one Soviet and one German) at £4.79/each.  There are then a whopping 40 extra skins at £1.59/each.  Total cost = £73.18You can also change the control bar face plate if you so desired and there are four options at £1.59/each.  Total cost = £6.36Then there are the Western armies (USA and OKW) at £14.99 that you will want for multiplayer.Total cost of DLC = £184.13, yes £184.13!!!But you say, surely you wouldn’t download all the cosmetic stuff, just what you want.  This is true, but it’s not the point.  You have paid £29.99 for a game that is missing fundamental aspects to make it playable in multiplayer and the only way to get it is to pay more, a lot more.  I would never part with my hard earned cash to buy commanders which should be in the game I’ve bought.  In fact they are in the game, I just can’t use them.  Fix the war spoils system, reward players who are very good and very skilful with the better commanders, don’t fleece us!That’s why I can’t recommend this game, stuff the gameplay, it doesn’t matter, no game is worth £214.12 (DLC cost plus base game cost, all full price) to access all of its features, not one, ever!Buy this game when it’s on offer, but please boycott paying for what’s in the game already.  Don’t buy the commanders, even those you really want or need.  £2.99 may not sound like a lot but you can often buy a FULL game for that on a Steam offer.  You’re paying to use a single special unit that the computer can use at will.  It sucks.			"

												After scrolling through many negative reviews, I began to realize that these reviews were not reviewing the game at all, they were just complaining about Relics business choices. Now the amount of DLC's  Relic made for this game is shameful, but the game is amazing and definitley worth the 30 dollars. Rather then write a lengthy review i will just have people see how many hours I put into the game and have them judge for themselves.			"

												Save your money, buy the original CoH, and download the FREE Eastern Front Mod. The developers of the Eastern Front Mod took the AI from that game and actually fixed it to the point where the units use real strategy instead of blatant cheating like in Company of Heroes 2. CoH 2 AI will just call in smoke attack, after smoke attack, after smoke attack - cooldown time be damned! But there is no real strategy or adaptability. (FYI - smoke attacks are special ability artillery/bombing attacks)The only thing worse than the AI is the fact that this game really didn't do much to improve over the first. The pathfinding is still as terrible as ever and there aren't any sort of squad formations, which if included, would limit the amount of units that get killed when the computer calls in smoke every 20 seconds. These are two basic things that games in the late 90s were able to accomplish, so it boggles my mind how CoH cannot incomproate it! On top of that, I cannot think of anything added to CoH2, except for maybe line of sight and the ability to jump over sandbags that were actual improvements over the first. Last but not least is the fact that you actually have to buy so much DLC, which is just a slap in the face to anyone who is an early adopter. ""Oh, I see you paid $50.00 for our base game, here - spend another $20.00 five more times so you can get what should have been included in the original or offered at a significant discount for those who bought the original."" Instead, they just have more and more bundles for people who haven't bought the game yet. Once again - save yourself the time, money, and frustration and skip this game. Buy the original and download the FREE Eastern Front Mod. You can thank me later.(Edited for grammar and to state that I donated $25.00 to the Eastern Front Developers because they actually EARNED my money.)			"

												While being a sequel, Company Of Heroes 2 offers less content than the original game and has many holes that scream to be filled with future DLC releases. Many of the units simply feel like a re-skin; the Russians take the exact role the Americans did in the first game. All of the Russian units have a similar counterpart in the first game and yet CoH2 still manages to offer less variety in units than that first game, leaving certain battlefield roles completely missing. On CoH2's day of release it already had a gigantic collection of twenty six DLC packages totaling a whopping £42. Costing more than the game itself, the downloadable content added vehicle skins and access to five unique commanders which could have simply added to standard release. Downloadable content implies you are actually paying for something, however Company Of Heroes 2 manages to charge and give nothing in return. The five commanders that can be bought offer no new abilities, just remixing the existing content within the game, only changing the orders of abilities players can spend hard earned cash without adding a single drop of new content to the experience. For pre-ordering I had access to the new co-op “missions” known as theater of war; instantly I was unable to access most of this since it will be released as future DLC. These missions are meant to have a unique co-op focus, however they did little to bring anything fresh to the game: most of these simply being a skirmish with one or two unique abilities and a smaller unit variety then a standard skirmish.The main campaign does little to inspire beyond the first game. Consisting of fourteen missions about an hour each, they simply feel like a skirmish game except offering unique units, upgrades, and abilities which are not available during any other game mode. I found myself questioning why all of this had been removed from the other game modes. With poor dialogue, story, and boring missions that simply feel like tutorials you will feel little incentive to return for a second play-through. Multiplayer does little to improve as an unfair matchmaking system frequently creates unbalanced teams as well as giving players no choice in what they would like to play. If you want to play with random players, you lose choice over the map played as well as only having access to point control mode. Creating your own custom game denies you access to other players, and only allows you to invite friends which feels unnecessarily limiting. The new winter maps add new mechanics to the game in which infantry become exposed to the cold and risk freezing, while random blizzards limit speed and visibility that can quickly turn heavy skirmishes into silence and small raids. This welcome and unique design can really change the battlefield while making players adapt to the new low sight conditions however it soon loses its novelty after a few games. After a few maps I soon found that blizzards simply seem to slow the game down and add to unnecessary micromanagement of units. After hearing “Your men are freezing to death” I  moved my camera to see an infantry squad stood one meter too far from a fire where they simply stood allowing themselves to freeze to death. After this happened a few times while I focused on the battle it just made winter maps soon feel like additional and unneeded “busy work.” With no other new game mechanics besides additional “busy work” it brings into question, “why should I choose Company of Heroes 2 over the first?” With the combat mechanics remaining the same of the first game I expected to find myself playing an almost identical game to the original but with additional content. However, after playing against the AI on many skirmish maps I soon realized that my choices were significantly more limited. All of the maps are very open, with little to no choke points to really plan any defensive tactics: I soon found myself getting slaughtered if I ever tried to play defensively.  Defenses soon become useless as they are now easily flanked by speeding armor or even basic the infantry squad which pushes all players to play aggressively and use almost identical tactics. Do you like to play defensively and push forwards inch by inch? Tough luck. Want to focus mostly on support infantry? Tough luck. The only way you can win is tanks, immune to most damage and with all anti-tank weaponry so easily flanked. Every match becomes a race to build the first tank and with Germany armor being superior to the soviets in every possible way, except mobility, the Germans have a significant advantage on all maps.During a match you will eventually earn your first command point, giving you access to your custom selected commanders with each having five traits. At least one of these will be a passive ability that will add little to nothing to the battlefield. Two points will often give you access to unique units, with only two semi-unique units per commander it hardly changes how you decide to play against your opponent. Often these unique units are shared between many possible commanders further removing any roles or unique identity on the battlefield. Everyone builds the same units, everyone is forced to play the same aggressive tactics and as a result every game ends up playing out like the previous one. Losing teams do not have any chance to retake the battlefield against aggressive players and the winning team within the game can be seen within the first five minutes.Pros:+good campaign length of around ten or more hours+action focused RTS appeals to those who are not interested in most RTS games+weather elements are impressive for the first few game+cinematic combat provides impressive sightsCons:-a complete downgrade of the first game-high system requirements-overpriced and unnecessary release DLC, with more to come!-winning with defensive or support roles is impossible-the new commander system makes every battle the same-poor multiplayer system, removing all choice from players-predictable campaign story does nothing to entice the player-no reason to ever replay the campaign missions-content available for campaign but denied in all other game modes-skirmish and multiplayer maps offer no chance for a losing team to fight backCompany of Heroes 2 remains a good game, the fun action-orientated strategy game remains satisfying and intense while able to appeal to players that are not familiar to the RTS genre. Though still an enjoyable experience it is a complete downgrade from the first release back in 2006. Seven years later fans are left with an overpriced game. DLC, and less content than the first release for a small graphical update. For these reasons I would not recommend CoH2 to those interested as the unique gameplay the game has to offer should look to the original Company of Heroes instead.Enjoy the read?

												The game itself is actually good.  In fact, I've got no complaints about the game itself.Thing is, though, I just want to play the game that I bought without having to close fifteen different cash-grab ""BUY MOAR CRAP NAO"" advertisements every time I start the frikkin' game... and I can't.Seriously, Relic, this is embarassing.  Zynga isn't even this scummy.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.Luckily I stayed away from multiplayer, so I've been spared from the horrors of all the pay-to-win crap that fuels most of the advertising ぶっかけ that they mistakenly call their game interface.Good game made by terrible people.  The kind of people who keep sending company shills to attack anyone downvoting their game, for example.			"

												To those looking at my hours played and saying ""but you've played such and such a time how can you give this a negative review?"".  To you I say that 75% of those TOTAL hours has been farming for War Spoils, which you will learn about further down in the review.Honestly buy Company of Heroes 1 with all of the DLC and you will have this game but with less visual fidelity but FAR better gameplay and on top of that more polish and less heavy handed DLC peddling.  The campaign is fine though there is one mission in particular that honestly I could have done without.  The game itself and the core mechanics are no longer what they were in COH, they are stripped and resold as overpriced DLC.  Add to that the fact that the developers have simply given up on this project or rather fixing it and have instead taken the EA road of putting DLC on the fast track priority list.  The engine has some serious issue and regardless of your rig's capability it will chug every time for the most ridiculous reasons if ANY reasons at all, it is simply a poorly optimized mess that the developers continue to screw with and make worse.  While I'm not the only one complaining about how poorly this game runs my current PC meets or exceeds the RECOMENDED specs for this game yet I have nothing but trouble with it and that’s running most graphics settings on low or medium!  The glaring game engine problems don't just stop when you leave the match, the game has a serious issue with ""forgetting"" your graphical settings whenever the hell it feels like it.  You'll boot up a match quickly after taking a few weeks off and you get into the match and you realize the game resolution is set to 66% and low on all settings, whoever at Relic designed the game this way needs to be fired because this in the year 2015 is inexcusable.Your unit’s AI has to be some of the most sub par that has ever been put into an RTS game that I have ever seen, the COH path finding is legendary by now because of how poorly your units navigate the map.  It was significant in COH1 but in 2 there appear to be no fixes or updates to the AI and on top of that they continue to make the same countless mistakes that will get themselves killed.  Retreating units often go out of their way to make wide paths of retreat INTO enemy lines rather then back through areas which were cleared.  Another step back in this title compared to the first one was that if a grenade lands next to a squad of infantry they will stand on it and end up killing an entire squad, where as in COH1 at times the AI would automatically spread out a bit in order to mitigate the damage done to the squad.  Tanks regularly show their rear and side armor when retreating or maneuvering around which also happened in COH1 but again you’d expect IMPROVEMENTS for a full priced second title but alas there are few if any.The advertized ""feature"" the Relic likes to tout in this game is the ""true sight"" which on paper means that your units can't just see through the fog of war within their normal vision radius.  Well in practice it is VERY different, a full squad of 5 or 6 infantry units can not see around a 1 foot wide tree with no under growing branching on its trunk.  That single bush that most people would be able to see right though? Yeah apparently the people that Relic hire are outright blind or have extreme cases of near sightedness because squads and vehicles can literally be only small bushes or singular trees apart and they will never know.  None of this is an exaggeration mind you; you can hide an entire squad or armored column behind a single fern. This also extends to all unit vision cones which are lacking even more so then they were in COH1; that dedicated long range tank hunter that should be used at long range, yeah it has the visual range of a new born child.Relic-SEGA changed the rank rewards and changed them over to something they called ""War Spoils"" which is a completely RNG system with no way to reliably get anything let alone something that should have been unlocked upon purchase.  Doctrines are now locked behind what is essentially a pay wall because unless you want to grind for quite literally thousands of hours just to get a single doctrine or camo then you'll have to fork over some serious cash.  The best part besides the system being so obviously designed to push players to give up and BUY what they are in essence owed is that the loot system can also drop duplicates which are utterly useless as there is no way to combine or sell them off for something slightly more useful.  So on top of the system being totally fixed and random you also can get I've seen players complain about having 5 of a single bulletin or more and you have no uses for multiples past 3 even then it takes up that loot space that could have been something better.  It is an absolute Scheme that was calculated for the benefits of Relic-SEGA and not the players who bought the game.  The fact that this system was added a year or two AFTER the game was actually released proves this to be quite the obvious fact.  They have made no attempts to fix the glaring issues despite a now 84 page thread about the subject.  The ""War Spoils"" system is so inconsistant and obviously broken that you will get one player who gets nothing but Doctrins, skins nd rare everything while others get almost nothing even after grinding for DAYS at a time all to unlock something that came WITH the game.  The evidence of this is in this single thread that a mod put up to cut down on the amount of complaints about the loot system: http://steamcommunity.com/app/231430/discussions/0/43099711972537578/Keep in mind future buyer, that any of the Doctrine/Commander, camos and such are already bought and paid for when you purchased the game or the US/OKW DLC.  They are NOT EXTRA DLC, Relic/SEGA is hiding the content that we already paid for behind an extremely unforgiving grind wall or a pay wall.Is there more stuff to do and just more content then COH sure but it comes at the cost of gameplay balances, game stability and and overpriced paywall or just a paywall PERIOD.  I am honestly not sure what happened to the Relic I knew, the Relic who made the Homeworld series but this new Relic is filled with nothing but the worst kind of people for developing games, a shell of its former self for certain.  If you must given them your money give as little as possible, wait for 70 to 80% off and you won't feel as ripped off.			"

												I suppose it's around that time I should revise the review again given that I've still continued to play this game once in a while, on and off.If you want a review with reasons you should consider purchasing this game, I apologize, but I won't be offering that here.I'm going to try and keep things simple, and list off the reasons I can think of as to why I personally do not recommend this game based on my 600+ hour experience.So,1. I find the excess of DLC annoying. The thought that I have to grind away for about two hours every gaming session at the least to have a very slim chance of maybe getting a paid commander through the was spoils system that sells for $3.99 is depressing. (Sales are your friend if you really, really want these)2. The single player campaign bored me to hell. Others might have enjoyed it, I didn't. I was disappointed, disinterested, and saw no reason to replay it after one run. It felt like a history circus cartoon, seeing Tiger tanks in Stalingrad and sappy drama instead of a narrative atmosphere that made me feel like I was up front and center in a war.3. Multiplayer is a mix. If you've got friends you can have a great time, but if you're thinking of getting this game as a single purchase you may find yourself struggling to learn all the skills and counters necessary to be a competitor online (If you're like me and don't like losing all that much). Unfortunately there isn't an official tutorial and the campaign doesn't pressure you to take action and micro the same way multiplayer does, so playing it does not teach you the ropes of multiplayer. The ranking system, which I put most of my game time into, does not offer any rewards for grinding away for higher rank. And when you're at max level, that's it. Have a cookie. I admit I like that patches for multiplayer come fairly frequently, so there's not too much bad to be said about multiplayer. It's not great without friends, though.4. The game did not stick with its theme. I get it, I suppose. Making more factions means appealing to a larger, broader audience with an American and British army, but when it gets to the point that the original factions sit on old abilities and units that have their roles displaced or scrambled by a flux of new units for new armies (you have to pay for commanders too to get ALL the new units for the new armies, lol. Buy the army so you can buy DLC for the army, hehe) then there's something not quite right. Unit variety in terms of infantry and armor is also pretty bland. Comon. 15 units on average for a faction? (Not counting additional ones you can get by using paid commanders. They usually only add 1 or 2 more, anyways)So, I bought this game with the interest in walking through an epic historical narrative about the Eastern Front in single player and being able to do some sweet tactical uraaaaah with varied Soviet Armor and Infantry in multiplayer. I was disappointed.Total cash paid: A small cashout of about $100			"

												CoH2 is undoubtedly a solid RTS game set in an exciting period of history. However, as a conciencious gamer I cannot recommend this game to anyone, due to the lack of content in the base game and the seriously insulting amount of DLC and microtransactions that have been crowbarred unethically into this game. Relic Entertainment have lost the plot, and I am sure that we will see more of this behaviour with their future releases (i.e. Dawn of War 3 - get ready for the pre-order bonus, DLC spam and microtransaction triple threat).Relic Entertainment are a strange company. On one hand, they make solid games with an interesting take on the RTS genre. On the other hand, their business model is an absolute disgrace and they should be ashamed at their efforts to consistently rip their customers off by releasing unfathomable amounts of DLC (which - let's be honest - almost always features content that should have been in the base game). The base game single player missions will be over in all-too-few hours, and they don't offer a great deal of replayability once completed. Sure - the major DLCs add extra missions, but considering the short duration of the original missions its fair to say that they should have been a part of the game from day 1.The microtransactions that have been added to the online aspect of the game are disgusting and will remind many gamers of ten-a-penny mobile games like Candy Crush. I find it insulting that Relic expect gamers to part with their money for tacky cosmetic items that probably took them all of 5 mins to create, and which certainly should have been in the game from day 1.Yes, the game is a decent RTS in terms of mechanics and action, but as gamers we need to ask whether we want to encourage disgraceful practices like the overabundance of DLC (featuring content that should have been in the game), tasteless and unnecessary microtransactions and an overall lack of value in the games we buy. I feel that Relic Entertainment are a tainted company and they won't realise the error of their ways until gamers start putting their money where their mouths are.3 Soviet Molotovs/10			"

												(EDITED 7/27/14 FOR ""ARMIES OF THE WESTERN FRONT"" STANDALONE EXPANSION)  Hello everyone, I just wanted to write this because I've seen all the negative reviews out there, and I have no idea what most of these people are talking about. I am a huge fan of the Company of Heroes franchise, and I have put many hundreds of hours into CoH1 both before and after if went on Steam. Not everything that the nay-sayers is wrong, but the amount of negative attention this game is getting is unfair to it, and I think that anyone who was a fan of VCoH should give it a chance.     First, I will say that the game mechanics are nothing but improved. Infantry AI is much better, units can no longer be run over by a stray tank and destroy entire squads. Tanks can no longer just roll over an opponent without being supported. Infantry anti-tank abilities (available on all factions core units except the Oberkommando West) will very often damage a vehicles engine, slowing it down to the point where other anti-vehicle weapons can easily take them out. Artillery is dumbed down from the first game, with only a handful of on-map artillery options available. You will not be able to park calliopes outside of your opponents base and win the game with long range barrage weapons. These are all, in my eyes, improvements and make for a more exciting, balanced game.     Navigating the game maps is slightly different now as well. A few things that stood out is how much less important bridges are. Terror doctrine in VCoH could esentially pick a bridge, firebomb it, and destroy it on demand if the munitions were availbable. Now, alternate (but less convenient) routes to the front are almost always available, and bridges can even be repaired before they are destroyed. Infantry can vault over low walls and obstacles too, which is just one more tool available to the player to get to the fight (or away from it) swifter. This also means troops can no longer be trapped on the wrong side of a sandbag wall, they can simply jump over to the other side. This is true for trenches as well, they can leap in and jump out without using the main entrance.      (EDIT-WINTER MAPS REMOVED)  While winter maps were not 100% removed, blizzard effects were removed on all maps. There are still places where you can fight in frozen conditions with heavy snow littering the ground and ice covering waterways, making new avenues for attack that are not present in summer. The removal of blizzards was a good decision on Relics part and shows how this game is still growing and changing. Blizzards allowed for very static gameplay by slowing down all units and encouraging long-range units to sit and camp, whereas the rest of the game demands that your forces be in constant motion, and the faster you can move the better.     The true line of sight concept I mentioned is also a new improvement to the formula. Units can only see what is in front of them, and can no longer draw line of sight through walls, buildings, enemy vehicles, or smoke clouds, making smoke much more useful than it was in VCoH. This makes setting up ambushes and scouting considerably more important and exciting. It is a good feeling for an enemy tank to roll around a corner, only to find out that an infantry squad and an AT gun are in extremely close proximity to it. The infantry squad will almost certainly slow the vehicle with an AT grenade or panzerfaust, and the AT gun will take care of the rest.     But not all was good on the eastern front, and the game did have the flaw of an overabuse of paid DLC. Relic has listened to its fans, and there is no more paid DLC commanders/skins/bulletins (the three prevalent multiplayer unlocks) that you cannot unlock by playing the game. Company of Heroes 2: Armies of the Western Front, unveiled a concept of ""War Spoils"", a stystem where players will earn random commanders, bulletins (which are static buffs for a specific unit type), and skins simply by playing for a set amount of time. War Spoils is a good idea, but it is poorly executed as the player does not have control over the drops they are getting. If you want to unlock a specific commander, it is very likely you will unlock three different commanders, four skins, and countless bulletins before you get the one you want. You also do not know how much you are progressing towards your next drop, and it does not seem to be connected to win/loss rating.     Still, this formula is a radical improvement over buying those fancy commanders. If you want to play around with new units and tactics, now all you have to do is play more in stead of breaking your wallet out. Want to unlock that German winter camo for your heavy tanks? Better go kill more Communists. Blow up your opponent in style for the low low price of... who knows how much time spent playing the game you bought! The war spoils system is nice, but ultimately I think people will still pay for commanders rather than work for them, as it can take some time. A good improvement on this system would be making it so you can choose what to work towards unlocking as well as the elimination of duplicate war spoils drops, which are by and large useless with the exception of certain bulletins, though even most duplicate bulletins do not function.     All this aside, the game itself is well worth its cost, and is definitely worth looking into for any Company of Heroes veteran, or anyone interested in real time strategy games or World War II history. Armies of the Western Front adds the OKW and American forces into the game, and both these armies bring new soldiers and vehicles (not to mention commanders) to the table, and demand new strategies from Whermacht and Soviet players to combat them. The unit emotes are all great, the sound effects are nice and authentic, and the checks and balances of the game make you end up using every weapon in your arsenal to crush your opponent, resulting in good-looking, authentic armies. The gameplay is fun, it is pretty, the auto-matching multiplayer will usually find you games in less than a minute, and the multiplayer is competitive and diverse enough to keep you coming back. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 and highly reccomend this game.[EDIT 12/26/15] A lot has changed in this game since I originally wrote this review. I have tried to go back over it and change content as is necessary, but tried to maintain its intergrity. The biggest differences are the removal of blizzards on winter maps, the overhaul to the OKW, which was a good idea but still needs some work as of this edit, and the introduction of the British forces in multiplayer, which brought a lot of new units to the table and changed the games balance.

												Earlier I would recommend this game for being fun and it being able to provide so many hours, but playing this game from launch to this day, the game has become unbalanced and it is way to DLC heavy, if you wish to win or stand a fair competitive chance in playervsplayer online you will have to connect your credit card to the pc.I am sad to see that this great and beloved franchise has been turned into a cash grind, I will not recommend this game unless you have a special interest, plan to play with friends, or get it on sale.*edit* I forgot to add how brutaly horrible pathfinding is, how much the company refuses to listen to it's fans and players complaints, and that they are so amazingly greedy that you have to buy 1 camo for light, then the same for medium, and the same for heavy units. Fair enough they are optional, but 1.99EU for 1 camo, that to use on all vehicle classes you have to buy a total of 3 times for the same skin. I wish they would take a look at the overwhelmingly large amount of negative amounts, just on their storepage here in steam.			"

												First things first: The gameplay is awesome and a worthy sequel to CoH. BUT: The underlying story of the singleplayer campaign isn't very convincing and the constant jumps across the battlefields obstruct immersion. It doesn't feel like an ongoing conflict that you're helping to win. It felt more like a concatenation of completely independent battles.What bothers me more is that in the base version of the game you can only play Red Army or Wehrmacht on a very limited number of maps. ""Wanna play other armies or other official maps that you can see in your browser but can't access? Then buy our ridiculously overprized DLCs from the shop!"". Which brings me to my next point. The audacious ingame advertising on the main menu is driving me crazy. I find this kind of intrusion extremely annoying. As a gamer I can't support such marketing policies. Since I can only recommend or not recommend this game (what a dumb system) although the game itself is great I have to say no.			"

												I see a lot of reviews that are one sided, so I will try my best to give this game a fair review with: What I like and what I don't.What I don't like:1. In the game's multiplayer, there is free reign to choose one general. That is not a problem, but people can buy these generals. this gives some people a ""pay to win"" feel.2. This game is not for children under 15. Units, both in campaign and multiplayer, use an incredible amount of cursing. Some images in the campaign can be disturbing(nothing sexual, but a lot of blood).3.The game's population cap limits the use of large scale warfare.4.The Campaign is limited to USSR and USA.Now for the thing I enjoy about the game.1. The game is the Halo to men of war 2's call of duty. The Game has an outstanding campaign for the USSR, providing historical accuracy behind things like The Battle Of Stalingrad and Order 227. The campaign seems to glorify no one (including the player's faction) and has a very neutral tone on politics.2. The game is constantly growing( though it does require payment for DLC). What  started off as Whermacht and USSR became Whermacht, Oberkommando west, USA, USSR, and British commonwealth.3. The amount of time put into the voice production. I was Playing as the Whermacht,  and my ally had his stug stolen by our enemy. I ordered my Pak 40 to destroy it, and I heard, ""Destroy that captured stug"". The voices will change depending on the map, and unlike most strategy games, When a unit captures another unit(infantry crewing a tank), Their voice sticks to that of their unit, though slightly altered for the new role they serve, rather than changing the voice to that of the original vehicle.4. Every battle is rewarding. After any match, whether it be skirmish against AI or players, one recieves a loot crate containing generals, buffs, and other goods.(The Loot crate is free to open).My personal opinion of the game is that, while it is not perfect. it is a very fun game to play on your down time, and even more so with friends. Many people cry out that the game is unbalanced, but thats not entirely true. the factions are also based on time. the length of the battle can determine who wins or loses. People who say the game is unbbalanced may simply not know how to play their faction to its fullest. I played OKW, not knowing anything about it, and thought it was underpowered. I didn't realize that the faction gained power as the battle dragged out.I hope my review of the game has helped new buyers make a decision.			"

												Somehow this game just ends up not being very much fun, at least from a single player standpoint. The campaign missions are long, dull, and repetitive. Before you get done with even the fifth mission you'll have grown tired of the 'capture a point, now hold it against near-infinite waves of enemies' trick. And spoiler alert: that isn't getting worn out anytime soon. You play that out in the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, etc. etc. etc.Now, we're supposed to be playing as the Red Army, the force that historically and infamously used mass wave tactics to victory. Thus, the gameplay just feels ridiculous when the German forces are the ones who are throwing waves of bodies, while the player is limited to the triumphant return of the utterly silly population limiter. The population limits wouldn't even be that bad, but we're also still dealing with completely inflexible squads. Let's say you have four free population, but want to call in a conscript squad. Well you need six for that. Got four guys on a machine gun? You have to use grenades to frag your own troops to bring them down to just two people so you can free up six population to call your conscripts.The game relies heavily on 'artificial difficulty'. There's no strategy to be found in the campaign. The enemy doesn't build units and send them to attack you. The missions exist in two states - in the first state, the gameplay is completley static. Enemies don't attack, and you have all the time in the world to slowly creep your way across the map. In the second state, you're facing the infinite waves of enemies, as you try to hold three points with two squads against literally HUNDREDS of enemies. That's it. That's the gameplay. Any sort of 'tricks' the AI has up its sleeve is entirely limited to scripted sequences. You attack a point, and a wall collapses and a tank drives through. Not because the AI has a tank and it's using it, but because the developers decided to make the game 'hard' by having you fight tanks with infantry. This is further compounded by the fact that they constantly 'turn off' the tech trees as you play. In mission 5, where you liberate Stalingrad, you have access to halftracks, T-34 tanks, and rocket launchers. In mission 6, where you clean up Stalingrad (and you also have to face - again - waves of armor and troops) they take away everything except your infantry. Again: artificial difficulty. The AI is terrible, so in order to make it 'hard' we're just going to arbitrarially force you to fight what might as well be Leopard 2 tanks and Eurofighters with broomsticks and rocks.My favorite example of this is the sixth 'secure Stalingrad' mission. The only anti-armor weapons you get are anti-tank grenades and anti-tank guns. The enemy has a freaking flamethrower halftrack. It impossibly takes over four head-on hits with a 76mm anti-tank cannon to destroy it (because halftracks are known for their armor?), so it just drives up, flamethrowers your gun crew and kills them instantly, and then burns all your infantry to death, and drives away.It's not a bad game, but it does absolutely NOTHING interesting or new, and it very much begins to feel like they just copy-pasted one level to the next. I'm not joking about that 'hold out against waves of enemies' thing being used on almost every single level either. This is World War 2, not Orcs Must Die. Not every battle was spent fighting as the underdog against waves of troops. The Germans get tanks in almost every mission, I'm lucky if I even get halftracks. There's almost no options for static defenses anymore either. I normally am a huge fan of Relic games, but this is such a bland, uninspired offering that I'm giving it a thumbs-down.			"

												This game doesn't deserve the ratings it has and I'll explain why. To me it is half a game. It is fine if you want to play the singleplayer, or 1v1 or 2v2 multiplayer. If you are someone who would prefer a competitive 3v3 or 4v4 game mode then I would pass on COH2. It all comes down to balance, and while most strategy games have some trouble with balance, COH2 has taken it to a new level. The WL ratio of 4v4 games has been in favor of the axis by quite a large amount for as far as I can remember, to the point of absurdity. I'm not overexaggerating this either, you can look up charts and graphs for stats on COH2 on google and you will see how imbalanced it is on larger game modes. You WILL lose more games than you win if you want to play the allied factions in larger game modes, I guess it is great if you want to play Axis, which a majority of 4v4 players do. So if you are at all competitive and wish to play Allied factions in the larger game modes, don't buy this game. Blobbing is also a problem in this game that bills itself as a strategy. Blobbing happens when you gather up all of your units, most of them of the same type, and send them across the map in a giant blob. Hardly strategic. Shrek blobs are blobs of rpg toting Nazi's that have been a problem for quite some time. They can kill everything, are a nightmare to deal with, and have helped skew the WL ratio the way it is. Blobbing is a problem across all factions though, and Relic have taken some tiny stabs at combating the problem, but they haven't done nearly enough. Of course blobbing is mostly found in larger game modes.What is probably the worst thing about all of this is that Relic has proven that they don't care about the larger game modes or the people who like to play them. That is even despite 4v4 being one of the most popular game modes. It has been two years since this game launched and still, these problems remain. In my understanding they haven't even acknowledged that blobbing or the WL ratio is a problem. And despite threads I've posted on reddit and on their own forums, I can't even get anybody to comment on it. For all the roadmap and their perceived ""communication with the playerbase"". Relic has even said that they balance for 1v1, leaving really no doubt how they feel about half of their game, so I guess maybe it will never be balanced.The idea that Relic does not have to balance the larger game modes is completely bizarre to me. They have an obligation to anyone who bought the game. The common excuse is that somehow they can't balance it all, it's impossible, like it has never been done before. The fact they can't balance this game into the larger game modes without a huge differential speaks of bad design decisions from the ground up. Why they even advertise 4v4 as a game mode when they won't balance it, or care about it at all, who knows.DLC is also problematic. The game has a warspoils system, wherein you are supposed to get bulletins (which are like small buffs in-game and cannot be purchased) and commanders (that decide what special units and abilities you can use) at the end of a round. Sometimes you get them sometimes you don't. It is completely random as far as I know, so you can get duplicates, you can get stuff for things you never plan to use or never have used. The commanders are $4 a piece, which is pretty pricey. Saying that you can get everything from just playing the game is a stretch, maybe if it weren't so random, you could play for a long time and get everything, but with duplicates you'd probably have to play for years upon years. This game also doesn't have any keybinds. A strategy game without keybinds?!?! Yep, it doesn't. Even though it has been a heavily requested feature for a long time. The community is horrible. I know that gets said about many games, but it's true. You are also unable to mute or block people in game.I can praise Relic and Sega for how they have handled DLC distribution. Maps are free to everyone (although there are not nearly enough of them), so as to not divide the player base, and even if you haven't purchased a faction, you can still play against other people playing as that faction so as to even further not divide the player base. Learning and improving, that's something we can all clap for. I hope it is something all other games adopt in the future because it really is the best way to do things.I loved COH and I've been playing COH2 since it's not so great launch. I have been a fan of Relic and I've tried to be a fan of COH2. The truth is that this is half a game. If you want the singleplayer or smaller multiplayer game modes, you'll have fun if you can look past the gouging DLC. If you are a competitive player who wants to play Allied factions in larger game modes, do not buy this game, you are wasting your money. Even if you'd like to play the Axis on larger game modes you really are wasting your money because the best games are the really tense, down to the wire ones and you hardly ever get those in 4v4. Thanks for reading, I hope you found it helpful.			"

												The game had a rocky start but it has improved quite a great ordeal as the devs introduced more patches and content.I'll start with the good,COH2 offers some improvements over COH1 most of which are small but quite significant.For insntace, You can capture points by holding your units within the limits of a capture zone instead of clicking on the pointInfantry can vault over small obsticlesInfantry can take cover behind vehiclesObsticles can block line of sight, vehicle tracks can be left behind, windows break when units first garrison a buildingThere is a hotkey for reversing tanks so you don't have to shift click in small increments behind a tankPoints can be capped straight from the minimapMaps can be downloaded straight from the lobbyYou can now automatch against AICoop campaignsMortars rounds don't take forever to land, trajectory is much lower, fire rate is higherModding support and map creation toolCommanders offer more variety when choosing a doctrine but it also has its disadvantagesThe bad:Sometimes you are in a pinch and try to take cover behind an obsticle, the vault icon appears instead and your units jump accross leaving them exposedYou cannot assign faction restrictions as host of a public game where you might want axis vs allies or american vs soviet only and what have youAI is not very intelligent, harder difficulty AI just cheats and gains more resourcesMost of the commanders are not unique instead drawing from a pool of abilities and call ins in different combinationsIntel bulletins are not very useful and don't offer anything interesting to the game besides minor stat improvements which are quite dullNew commander micro DLC offers new content however it can wreck the balance of the game's multiplayerGrindy war spoils system with plenty of duplicates dropping to entice players to buy the micro DLC at exorbitant prices.I do not wholy aggree with their buisness practices primarily concerning commander DLC, though overall I've found the game to be a satisfying experience, however it goes without saying that there is much that can be improved.

												This game is in no way bad but it deserves this bad review for disrespecting its customers and here's how:1- The game cost 30$, to unlock the other ""factions"" you need to pay another 30$, if you don't do so you'll end up playing as the germans or the soviets and nothing else, with a very small amount of generals and maps which becomes boring very quickly.2- You have to pay 25$ to unlock DLCs, now these DLCs aren't anything special, they're just campaigns... So far we payed 85$ to get a decent game with campaigns in it lol...Right now they're selling 1 and 2 for 60$ but these new ""factions"" and DLCs never existed when old players like me bought this game for 60$...The devs disrepsected their old customers by selling them Updates.3- Just like I said, there's a very small amount of generals per ""faction"", about 3 of them, which is absolutely nothing! And that's why they started adding more generals and now there's about 15 per faction but each general costs 3-5$...My Point:----------People like me who bought this game when it was released had to pay about 150$ to enjoy it because they started to add DLCs and Factions but we had to pay to get them which is just a pathetic move by Relic because all of these should've been Updates to the game, for free.For new Customers:---------------------If you want to enjoy every aspect of this game you need to pay about 90$ to get it with all its factions and DLCs, about 10 new generals and no skins at all.In Conclusion:---------------1- They disrespected their old customers and didn't give f*ck, they'll do it again.2- Don't be fooled by the price of the main game because, again, you have to pay an extra 60$(minimum) to enjoy all of its aspects.

												In the beginning there was balance: Wehrmacht trusted their superior hardware to defeat their enemies and the Soviets kepth them in check with their cheap basic units and tough special units. The balance updates were (usually) fair and the gameplay was fun.But then came the first wave of strife: they added Oberkommando west and Americans.The Oberkommando were fun with their fast vehicles, excelent infantry and brainnumbingly tough special units.The Americans were not so lucky with their unspecialized infantry, weak vehicles and no heavy vechiclesMighty Relic Entertainment desided to hepl the Americans by nerfing everyone else, making Americans more favourable faction.Players were outraged by this for now Russians had no damage output and German units were too expencive to compete with the now OP Americans. Relic didn't listen the pleads for balace update for their Sega overlords wanted all that sweet DLC money.But Sega wasn't satisfied but the sales that the Ardennes Campaing and the new factions brougth them.They wanted more, much more. Relic then made the Germans OP (for they were the most fun to play with) and the Allied community prayed a counter for their unstopable tanks and infantry. Relic answered those prayers by releasing the British: the faction with the superior defence structures and infantry.After Sega was contempt with the newest DLC sales, Relic nerfed the British and the germans were once again OP (for they were the most popular with their fun equipment and good commander rosters) Now there is only strife for Relic doesn't care for the community: they need more DLC to satisfy thei Sega overlords.Maybe the game could be saved with a German Campaing or a proper balance update but for now it is buggy, badly balanced game with nothing that Men of War series can't do better.Hopefully when Sega abandons this property it will be balanced like the first Coh currently is.

												As much as I want to enjoy this game as the 1st one, the business practices of SEGA for this game just sours the experience. Base game and the western front armies add up to about 70$ if full price which is rediculous in my opinion. Not to mention that there is a 40$ SINGLEPLAYER expansion and you have to purchase Fox Company to play within said expansion. They just basically put a DLC within a DLC. Also, a bunch of commanders/doctrines are DLC but you can get those for free by war spoils which are kinda like TF2 drops. I would recommend to buy this when a complete pack is released since they are dropping DLCs left and right. I would highly reccommend buying the complete pack for Company of Heroes 1 if you wanna have taste of the series. Edit: I am dissapointed by the fact that there are only two single player campaigns for the Soviets and the USA even though the British were introduced recently.  The American singleplayer expansion doesn't even include the multiplayer armies.			"

												I think this game has gotten way more hate then it deserves and would like to put some things strait. while I did not own the game in it's early stages and did not expiriance the problems it had out of the gate, what I can say is that the game now runs like a well oilled german machine with little to none bugs and glitches. As for everyone complaining about pay to win, while the dlc may have been op at first launch this has to the most part been resolved and I personally still prefer many of the standard commanders to the dlc ones, which merely offer differant units rather then an unfair advantage. As for the campaign I do agree that it puts Soviots in a bad light but if that really bothers you just don't play it. I can only speak for myself in saying I have spent hundreds of hours on this game and am still enjoying it as much as I did when I first started playing. So if you don't own this game and your intrested I suggest you wait for a sale and give coh2 a shot, which is in my mind the best RTS on the market.			"

												As a veteran of COH 1, I REALLY wanted to like this game, I even shelled out for the DLC, but this game is just a shadow of its former self, the balance is fundamentally broken, and the gameplay is a cheap knock-off version of COH1. As for the DLC I mentioned, there is A LOT! You pay full price for this and open it the first time and see...in game ads for DLC which covers MOST of the games content. All the best commanders and such you'll have to pay microtransactions for, which I don't mind in a game that FTP, but not one where I paid full price. If you want to do PvP you'll need to shell out again, as the DL'd commanders give a significant advantage (read, pay to win).			"

												i do not recommend this game because everything in this game is dlc! Like without dlc, you can only play 2 teams  but there are 3 more teams available they are just dlc's. And it's not just the fact that it's dlc, the dlc's are way to expencive. this game is like a burger with only bread, the rest is just dlc's.			"

												When you had a heavy tank in one doctrine or bombing and strafing in another with the original game, that gave a doctrine specific strengths to lever in battle without ever making the other doctrines feel weak or unnecessary. In CoH 2, Sega doesn't mind putting mid-level units and mediocre support abilities in a half-dozen commanders to make them less unique and useful, while adding new pay commanders around vital units like heavy tanks or bazooka infantry.Slightly nicer sound aside - better AI pathing aside - cold weather mechanics nobody plays aside - ""hilarious"" Russian story aside - No matter how many commanders you buy on a Steam sale (oh please don't) Sega will constantly update the game to make the current commanders obsolete and weak.That's amazing.

												Holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥they finally got rid of war spoils, now the only content that is locked behind paywalls are the new factions and campaigns. Meaning all commanders, intel bulletins, and skins can be grabbed with in-game currency rather than money. So as before, dont grab any DLC unless you end up enjoying the base game, and if you do, only buy the factions and Ardeness assualt. Sure balance is subject to change wildly at a moments notice but thats Multiplayer gaming in general, not just a problem with Relic			"

												So this is what happened:- Downloaded a modded map with unlimited resources just for the sake of it.- Got online with a friend and fought against 4 Expert AI- Map loaded. We were on the south, they were in the north. Only route to travel was a gorge in the middle.- Battle started. Entire gorge was filled with tanks, trucks, men. You name it.- Friend decided to sent out a spy plane.- The entire hill behind the gorge was literally covered in red by enemy troops, and it didn't stop until it reached the first command post.- We knew we were ♥♥♥♥ed.- Continue to fight.- Made a desperate push.- But were pushed back.- Friend pushed again with twenty T-40's. 19 were destroyed. One made it across.- That lone T-40 was the result of our victory.- Looked at the battle results.- And realised the battle took nearly three hours.Would definitely do that again!			"

												The game is fairly hollow, and it feels like you're playing a game demo if you don't have any DLC. For $5 you can get the original Company of Heroes and with the amazing mods for it like Blitzkreig mod it's more fun to play anyway.I just can't go from playing the first game to playing this and feel like it's actually a sequel. You're supposed to take the good elements of the first game and expand upon them but it feels like there's actually less content.Like many game companies nowadays, Relic is just here to nickel and dime you for everything they can. If you're looking for a WWII RTS just get CoH 1.			"

Posted: November 6, 2016
												So, after a few years with this game gathering dust in my library, and a recent Humble Bundle purchase, I decided to try and give this game a second chance. I already wrote a review about it once, and it was also negative. But I admittedly hadn't put much thought into my negativity towards this game, other than its completely stupid campaign plot for the Soviet Campaign. But really, there's more to this game that makes me dislike it, so let me try again, and be more in-depth about it.So, let's start with the gameplay. Actually, it's not as bad as I initially thought it was. I had to get used to the different Commander system, but I can at the very least appreciate how you can mix and match your ""loadouts"", to get a faction that you personally play best with in either way. They made a lot of little tweaks here and there that make the game more playable vs. CoH1, like the ability for units to vault over terrain, and to deliberately choose to move a tank backwards, as opposed to micro-clicking behind the tank to get it to do that. Units can fight while capping points, scenery works better as cover. It ultimately has what I loved about Company of Heroes 1, gameplay wise. The newer factions, like Americans and English, seem to be easier to micromanage, as there's no real base building anymore, and frankly, I certainly hope people are done pretending base building added anything. Does it really matter *where* the support infantry barracks is placed? Come on, don't kid yourself. There's also some blatantly gimmicky stuff like winter maps where soldiers can freeze to death. Graphics don't have much to talk about. I mean, they're great! Textures look marvelous, each model is super-detailed, down to the badges on their uniforms. Snow on the High setting has neat, Assassin's Creed III style, permanent deep footprints trailing behind anyone moving through it. You could practically feel your feet getting cold and wet just looking at the men running through it. Ice looks good, weather effects are convincing. Not much to say, though, aside from that. Game looks good. So, it looks good, and plays good, and yet I *don't* like this game. It's now time for me to elaborate why that is. Let's start with single playability. I'm a huge, anti-social dork, so yes, single player experiences matter a lot to me, even in RTS games. Apparently liking single player in RTSes makes me a big weirdo, for some reason, but I digress. The Russian campaign is, as famously pointed out by YouTuber BadComedian, a stupidly written story rife with offensive russophobic cliches. We've all seen the cutscene where a Comissar executes a dude for saving Captain Ibrahmovich's life, because he missed rolecall in-so-doing. There's really not much to say about it, other than that. Missions are forgettable, one mission was literally just a copy-paste of Carentan and Carentan Counter-attack from CoH1, so that seemed pretty lazy to me. The only parts I do remember are the stupid ones, like the mission where you set buildings on fire with civillians inside of them (truly a Company of *HEROES*), or the mission where you besiege a German town and go all Bitter Springs on the civillians trying to escape. What the ♥♥♥♥? Why did Relic make a game where we play as cartoonishly evil a-holes? There's also the Ardennes Forest (aka The Battle of the Bulge) campaign that I tried for a little bit. It looked fun in the trailers. The map reminded me of Dawn of War Dark Crusade, a game with a fascinating SP campaign. But no, it actually wasn't even close to being as interesting as Dark Crusade. Just a bunch of scenarios with poorly implemented campaign features like Company Strength and requisition to try and fool you into thinking you weren't just playing a bunch of random scenarios and maps with the same units over and over again. Nothing from Dark Crusade like Territory Garisons, or defensive missions against the Germans, or turn-based requisition gains, or special territory bonuses. I didn't even finish it, I grew bored very quickly.I'm sure some of you are saying ""singleplayer doesn't matter in RTSes"", but forget that. Tell that to Homeworld, or Company of Heroes 1, or Dawn of War 1 and 2, or Age of Mythology. If you can't craft a memorable singleplayer experience then that's a strike against you in my book. If you wanted to make what is essentially the Red Orchestra of RTSes, why even bother *having* a campaign then? I'm getting distracted again though, so on to my next point. Now for the final thing -- the thing that made me uninstall this game again, for good this time. The thing that makes me regret that I am far, far past the deadline for a re-fund. The multiplayer system. As I said before, I'm not big into the multiplayer games of RTSes, but hey, ""when in rome"", right? So I got into it. I saw that there were a bunch of unlockables. Commanders, skins, faceplates, and it didn't bother me too much because two of those three things are 100% pointless and you can just ignore them. So I play like 5 games in multiplayer, and I get my first loot crate. 500 ""Supplies"". So I mosey on over to the store, figuring I could buy a commander or something. One commander -- that's one commander out of like, 20 -- costed 15,000 Supplies. I don't even want to do the math, because I would just get angrier. Oh, but don't worry, guys! Just pay $3 bucks and you can get it now!The first comparisson that comes to mind is Freemium phone games, but even that's better than this despicable system. At least you didn't ALREADY PAY $60 for flipping Candy Crush! So, not only do you pay full price for Company of Heroes, but then Relic tries to swindle you out of even more money with this awful, Skinner Box ""war loot"" feature. That's disgusting, revolting, and insulting. It's not even like you can ignore it, like with Team Fortress 2, because there are commanders in game that give you an objective advantage over others. So, the game is rewarding those who would pay more money for better commanders. It's pay to win, but it's *not* free to play. That's unforgiveable. This can't be the same Relic that made Homeworld and the first Company of Heroes. I don't know what happened, but I don't know Relic anymore. This game fails as a single player and multiplayer experience. Play something else, something that respects you a little more, because this game is disrespectful to anyone who gives it their time.

												Best RTS? Amazing graphics? Best WWII game? Dont make me laugh, I spended on Company of Heroes 1 countless of hours, and cant even compere 1 to 2. Of course it have specific and new GOOD mechanics, but FFS. No one is mentioning that game is unbalanced, no one is mentioning problems with AI (I dont care who think what about playing against AI, AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and need to be fixed ASAP), no one is mentioning DLCs (that prices are joke) that shouldnt even exist. Go on MODDB.COM and look how many mods are for free  for COH1... Giving you whole campaigns, armies, new abilities, units, animations, maps, here? 29,99+ next 29,99 for freaking DLCs. Company of Heroes 2 is chopped into peaces game, its not worth its full price. Dont take me wrong, GAME IS GOOD, but not for a full price. Wait for steam discount or on moment when they will give it for free. I would recommend more COH 1 + Blitzkrieg Mod, definitly more fun then this. PS: Hope you like farming. This game is perfect for it, to get all the generals , skins and other sh** OR you can buy it..........			"

												They turned a perfectly good series into a DLC driven game. With very little improvement between the first and second game (the graphics hardly change, something they appear to have put minimal effort into improving), I'd suggest getting the original game over #2 any day; want Russians? Download the Eastern Front mod for CoH - you get the Western Front Germans and the Americans for free.Beyond the Eastern Front Mod, the original CoH also has a very large selection of mods floating around, offering a great gaming experience for just about everyone. You can get just about the same content as CoH 2 using mods, or more of equal or even greater quality.Blitzkrieg is a particually good mod for multiplayer and skirmish matches; an overhaul touching just about every single aspect of the game making it realistic versus arcadish (CoH 2: MG42 mowing down your men? Nope. They just get pinned. On CoH: Blitzkrieg mod, all LMG/HMGs are dangerous). So called 'Realistic Stratergy' is pretty damn unrealistic, and really doesn't deserve that label.For me, I often purchase games for the modding community and/or modding potential, so CoH2 was less attractive than the original CoH due to the lack of moddding available.This review will probably undergo changes as mods are developed (they recently released the mod tools), though future DLC will not affect this as I have no intention of getting any.

												Company of Heroes 2 is a decent RTS but isn't really an improvement over the original.It offers the same strategic experience as its predecessor, valuing map control above all else. You can win by destroying your opponent’s base but it’s almost always more beneficial to hold specific points.The campaign is unfortunately a bit forgettable, as it completely betrays COH's micro based gameplay. You're given a constant supply of sacrificial soldiers which remove a lot of the strategic elements of the game. The campaign doesn’t require a whole lot of skill and doesn’t offer much of a sense of accomplishment.The narrative is somewhat interesting but it isn’t up to par with some other RTS campaigns such as Warcraft 3 or Starcraft 2.The multiplayer is still challenging and strategic although I think the game would have benefited from having more factions to choose from as you can only play as Russia or Germany. There's also a limited selection of maps available and they aren't quite as interesting or varied as the first Company of Heroes. The worst issue is the microtransactions, which easily add up to more than the cost of the game itself. Anything from overpowered commanders, vehicle skins, and additional missions can be purchased which should have otherwise been included in the game.Overall, it's still a fun RTS but it’s simply a shadow of the original. For a more in-depth review, here's a video I made:

												Being a huge fan of the CoH series and a top tier player I aim to give a balanced review and dispell the undeserved negative user reviews. Please note this is my first proper review and any feedback is appreciated =).Do not be fooled by the hateful meta critic user reviews that score the game incredibly low. These are all largely due to patriotic Russians who exaggerate and claim the devlopers are Nazis as the campagin portrays the Soviet Union in a bad light. One such scene they are particularly angry about is when retreating russian soldiers are being shot down by their own machine guns. Granted Relic could have portrayed these horros of war better so that they could not be misinterpreted but they didn't set out to shame an entire nation. What the campagin really shows is the the story of the war through one man's eyes, showing the great bravey of the typical russian soldier under a ruthless poltical system and an equally terrifying invading German army. Which probably took more courage to do than that of soldiers from other countries. For those who worry about Pay to win I can assure you it's entire nonsense. None of the new content is aimed to give players an edge in multiplayer. Obviously when it is first introduced there might be some balance issues here and there but these are quickly resolved. The idea behind DLC is to give players more varitey, be that with skins or commanders it's down to your personal preference and you are no way forced to buy it to be able to compete.I can say that although CoH2 does not possess that same unique feeling that vcoh had, it is still a remarkable and incredibly fun game that continues to get better with each passing month. I have personally played over 600 hours on the beta and current version combined and I still find new ways to play and each game is never the same. You have to remember that the orginal CoH series has had 7 years of patching and improvements whereas CoH2 has only been out for less than a year. Therefore I believe it's unfair to judge the sequel so harshly at this stage. Within that time period the developers have added a huge range of content including; Steam Workshop with user created maps and mods, offical developer created maps, new units, commanders, leaderboards, chat rooms and with plenty more on the way.Notable improvements over the original include: Better Graphics, Bulletins, Variety in choices that makes you stand out from the crowd ie commanders, skins faceplates etc, New Features like Cold Tech and True Sight which add more tactical elements. For instance you must now keep your troops warm during a blizzard by placing them near a fire or in a house otherwise they will freeze to death.Now on to the game's flaws. Currently I believe the developers are pre-occuiped in bringing out more dlc content then spending the most time balancing the game and improving performance. Fair enough that they have to make money but I'd much rather they focused on tweaking the current game first then adding dlc like theatre of war missions. The variety in commanders is great and all but loads of the abilities have been reused in other commanders which takes away the uniqueness of certain commanders. Theres still quite some work to do before it can be considered a proper ESport as the replay viewer still needs additional features however it is constantly improving. Compared to something like Starcraft 2, CoH2 just doesn't have the player base or the resources unlike blizzard. I honestly think that if relic promoted the game and advertised it properly it would have generated a lot more interested. As it happens the advertising around the launch date was literally non-existent.ConclusionScore: 8/10 Current StateAlthough this game has got a way to go before it can be considered to be a worthy sequel to the first, I believe that over time it will get there and even surpass it's predecessor. Relic has been listening to user feedback and many of the new features are a result of this. So if your either a fan of the old game or looking to try out a proper real time strategy then look no further. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												A tragically failure of the Company of Heroes series.Factions are unbalanced and have bugs come out of their ears. And if you check the changelog of the patch of this game, you real found that there is one faction have been weakened every single time and it is very rarely strengthened through the patch. You can go have a look for yourself. Plus the AI only have an average IQ of 20. Sometime when you ask them to move to certain place, they will deliberately pick the long way around even if there are more enemies to encounter. And sometimes they turn left and right, cant' decide which road to take.Another AI issue for example if you put your unit near an enemy unit which is not a threat to you, a building for example which can't shoot back. Without giving them order to attack, they will automatically attack that building. There is nothing wrong with that. But after that, if there is an enemy unit that come along which can be a threat to you, a tank for example, your units will NOT turn back an engage the threat and continue to attack the non-threat target unless you give the order, even though you didn't give the order to attack the non-threat to begin with.Also all AI players will eventually stop their movement if the game last for a while, let's say about half an hour. Making the game unendable. Because your allies will not attack and you will end up as the only player advancing to your enemy. And you will never beat your opponent due to the sheel number of your opponent. So far this bug has not been addressed.The Sega's approach to bug report is also an issue. Unlike the EA, your bug usually can be solved by a live chat on spot. The Sega support only offers contact through your Sega account by posting an issue directly to Sega technical support staff. They usually only respond you about once per day or 2. And they rarely solve your problem. Sometimes they ask me questions that I have explained twice in my previous posts. It almost feel like some kind of Phone Sex Text. Except they don't get your money based on each text. So why would they ask you questions that you have explained before is a mystery. Probably pretending that they are working on it, or probably they never worked on it and forgot what you have said earlier.I have been trying to find out a way to overcome issues like unbalance and stupid AI issues. So far, no luck.And many unethical practics in this game's making. For example, when I pre-ordered this game, they told me that if I pre-order the collector's edition, the future 3 threater of the war DLC will be free for me. But after game was released, they told us that they have changed their minds and only the first threater of the war DLC will be free and we have to pay for the rest like everyone else.Secondly, this game is a pay to win game to start with. In the earlier stage of this game, it advertise many different commanders who provide you different exotic units to use in the game. After you bought those, they suddenly turn this game into a mod friendly game, which everyone can make mods include ""All units mod"". Once again make you spend your money for nothing.Just check on the ""only negative review"" button and you will see there are clearly way many more players who gave this game a thumbs down than players who gave it a thumbs up.And as far as I know, the Sega have been paying people (mostly their employees) to give this game a better review. One evident to support my claim here is that if you check some of those people who have wrote a possitive review, they own no game but Company of Heroes 2. And some of them has no gaming hours or very few hours. And if you check their profile, some of them joined steam of this game's release and own no game but this, and in the same time they played very few hours of this game and wrote a very good review and then, they never come online on steam again, as if they only bought the game and registered steam account just to write their reviews.

												After a couple of years playing this game and its forebearer Im pleased to say this is by far my favorite game, ive played excess of 2 thousand hours (some arnt counted for odd reason). After burning through the missions for both the Soviets and the USF and hours of comp stomping i thought i was done with the game, i then tried mulitplayer, and after a couple of games i was hooked. Each faction has its weaknesses and strengths, USF can steam roll early but their tanks seem to have forgotten to bring armor for tanks. Whermacht is by far the most versitle and rewarding faction able to adapt with the tools on hand once past the early game. Soviets have a sheer f-you advantage of numbers that sometimes you just get 6 conscript squads rushing all over the place (dont blob or you will get nuked by german uber weapons). Even the OPW has some perks, though noob faction they are to play ( I mean please, i havent seen any other tactic from them besides blob volks, into spam arti, then bring out one of the kings) Each game is fun, some you might curb stomp the enemy or get stomped, but you have those games each day where every battle is fought tooth and nail clinging to land youve taken. The game has its faults, plenty of it, each patch its a different flavor of one unit or whole factions having a leg up over the rest, balance is all over the place but when no faction is an exact clone its acceptable. The day Relic rolls over and makes the Panzer hit just as hard and equal as the Sherman and makes the IS 2 hit the same as Tiger is the day the game is dead. If you want to beat the OPness #adapt find a weak link, use what you got and stomp the enemy into submission regardless the cost.""For the Rodina Comrade""TL:DR great game, multiplayer community is solid, only a few bad apples, easy to play; hard to master great game for any cost, but sale makes it worth "

Posted: June 16, 2015
												Company of Heroes 1 was a (mostly) great game that covered the early months of the Allied war effort against Germany on D-Day and beyond. As far as RTS games go, it was superb in just about every way with my only issue coming from the ""Tales of Valor""campaigns being of a far lesser quality than the original one or the two from Opposing Fronts. Also I never really played the multiplayer. I got to the game a bit late for that, and i've not been keen on RTS multiplayer since the early 2000's (Warcraft III).CoH2 had some big shoes to fill, and first impressions seemed a little mixed because of the DLC spam and the historical narrative. As a long-time player of the Total War games, I am very much aware that SEGA is among the worst offenders when it comes to having too much and too highly priced DLC. I got this game and some of it's DLC as part of a humble bundle, so I sit with most of the complete game with still some bits missing.Truthfully, all I have done in this game is the single-player campaign, so that's all I can talk about. I'd heard before playing this that Russians hate this game's campaign story with a passion, and after having played it I understand why (even if I don't entirely agree). To try to keep this short, the Soviet Union's ""Great Patriotic War"" was and remains a highly politicized conflict where the official narrative is one of a hard but glorious struggle to extinguish Nazi Germany. The uglier side of the Soviet War effort is basically ignored or shouted down as lies by the uninformed and the nationalists. This game does not shy away from bringing up things that Russians would prefer to pretend didn't happen. While the whole ""sending men into battle without weapons"" bit was mostly BS (The USSR's war production vastly exceeded the Germans), and Order 227 ""Not a step back"" was a feature of the early months of the battle of Stalingrad (not the entire war after it as the game depicts), the rest is largely true. ""Penal Battalions"" consisting of ""enemies of the state"" to be thrown at the Germans (or even used as human minefield sweepers), the outright murder of Polish partisans and the USSR leaving the Warsaw Uprising to die, massive press censorship and executions, and the Soviet tendency for butchery when it finally entered Germany are all things that actually happened. I suppose Russians and Pro-Russian sympathizers should be glad that the Soviets horrific treatment of its own liberated POW's (most were considered traitors because they gave up instead of dying or becoming partisans) and the mass♥♥♥♥♥♥of German women are not found in this game.I'm not here to have a debate over these things. These are unpleasant facts about Soviet conduct during WW2. The US is also fond of portraying WW2 as a noble struggle against evil, but their record is hardly clean either (see Operation Keelhaul, racial segregation, the tendency towards ""Terror bombing"" of enemy cities, and, of course, the nukes). CoH2 might have won more friends if it didn't include things that are so politically sensitive in Russia and the former Soviet nations, but it would have been a bit disingenous as well. Though it might have helped if the game had also made more of a point of featuring the Germans own behavior on the Ostfront that rallied the Soviet people to fight back and ultimately cost Germany the war. The War in the East was a terrible example of the truth of that old saying: ""You reap what you sow."" A bit more focus on the fact that much of the Soviet war effort focused on revenge for German crimes might have been better.I probably shouldn't have typed all that. Sorry. History nerd who had a focus on the war between the Germans and Soviets for many years. XDSo... game. It's fine I guess? It seems fairly similar to CoH1 to me, and that was a good game. Again i've not tried the multiplayer and probably won't, so you will have to find someone else to tell you about that. But for a single-player experience covering the horrible war between the Germans and Soviets? I'd say this game is just fine. :o(I'll probably update this review on a later date once I play more of the game and feel less of a need to play history teacher. XD)			"

												This game is fun and CoH1 used to be a revolutionary invention of a strategy game. Matches can be exciting until the very end since you can recover from heavy blows if done right. There is a ton of micro managing involved and less macro, and what makes this game different from other strategy games is that there is action and battle all game long, hardly room to breathe, and aggressive playstyle is heavily encouraged. Also, no base building.The game should be enjoyed in a not overly competitive setting (ranked is fine, but don't play it for money) and here is why: while most is based on raw skill and finesse of a player, the realism aspect (no perfect 100% accuracy etc.) can completely turn the tide of battle based on mostly luck. Example: I was bombarding an occupied building with a mortar. It was about to collapse so the squad abandoned it. Right as they left the building, before they could even spread out, my mortar round actually missed the building and hit the entire squad and wiped them out in an instant. Another example: tanks make an extreme difference in this game but sometimes whether they get destroyed or not depends on rng - does the AT gun hit the last shot before the heavy tank can retreat? Does it miss my tank so it can escape to safety? Those can be game deciding factors. There are some community tournaments taking place but other than that there is no competitive scene for this game, which is partially due to the random element this game has to it. I just wanted to mention this. For me it's neither a negative nor a positive aspect.However, I cannot support the decisions they made when they created and published this game. Which is a bummer because otherwise this game would be WAY more popular. It currently has a decent playerbase/count, but the numbers keep falling steadily. Back to what I dont like about this game.3 out of 5 playable factions are DLC. Balance issues take too long to be addressed so DLC factions often stay overpowered for quite some time - right now the balance is in a decent place, though, I'm happy at last. Campaigns are DLC. And the game, a game you pay full price for, has microtransactions for items which heavily define and support your ability and playstyle in matches, so that lacking said items would put you at a large disadvantage. I don't like calling it pay to win since with enough time investment, you can buy those items yourself (ingame currency and random loot), but...it is close to p2w. I'm sad about it and I hope if they ever release a CoH3, they show that they learned their lesson. IF they do it better next time, I'll be here - playing the game a crap ton and recommending it to everyone because then it has the potential to become big.			"

												Lets make 1 thing clear, I have currently over 900 hours of COH 2 logged so my review is serious and not from someone who tried it during 3 hours...This games is AMAZING, even after 900 freaking hours its still fun. It deserve more love. I played Starcraft: brood wars for multiple years, I was very good at it. Same for Warcraft 3. I played a fair amount of time of Starcraft 2 as well but COH 2 really did put Starcraft 2 in the trash for me if we talk of the same era of time.It's more funMore tacticalMore intenseA good games against opponent of the same level can last 1 hourMore new (yeah sc2 is way too much like sc1 and i played enough year of it, why they did not made something more refreshing..)I will play this game until COH 3 come out even if it take 8 years, just like Brood war did it.Most of the bad reviews about this game been made during the early days of the come out with the bugs etc. This game keep getting patched and balanced after 2 years. Its completely another game now in term of game play.You can now get the hand on this game when it is in sale for about 10$ If you love RTS. It will be the best 10$ invested ever. Dont forget to pick up the extension at the same time while it is in sale.See you in the game and good luck :PAnswers to comments:For those who said it's more than 10$ investment on this game. Well... I mentionned 10$ because it is the entry price to play the game. Obviously if you enjoy the game you will want to add more faction but once again when it is on sale WFA which include 2 faction is only 5$. You can even just buy WFA for 5$ to try this nice game since its a stand alone. That's amazingly cheap for what you get.Relic are not stupid, they know that if you try the game and love RTS you will love it and buy the new content when they come out. at only a 20% discount like the new British faction comming out in 1 month. Thats how they make their money.I just pre-ordered the British faction myself, i could have wait 6 months to get it on sale of 50-75% but i think the 10$ entry price for it is fair. They keep the game up to date with new content. I have bought 2 commander at about 1.25$ each before they implemented the War spoils system. I have no plan to buy more commanders. I play a fair enough amount of time to hope to get the one im missing from the war spoils. The commander that are not included are not stronger anyway, they are just adding content to a nice game. Someone who would want everything to maximize his fun would only need the 5 faction (the fifth will be out in september 2015) and i'm sure that at the xmas sale 2015, buyin all of them will be 20$. We are no way near the exagaration as some people may have mentionned in their review. If these guys cant afford to pay 20$ for full content, they should just play free to play game like Dota. Who cares of skins anyway, they dont make the games more fun and the you can still get them from war spoils drops.			"

												I am a huge WWII fanatic.  I played a lot of this game, as you can tell by my hours. I recently came back to the game after taking more than a year off.  When it came out, I paid the full price of $60 at launch, plus $12.99 for each new faction and $3.99 a pop for a bunch of commanders. I come back now, only to find British Forces added, $12.99! Tons of new commanders! $3.99 a piece! The only other thing, aside from a few minor gameplay tweaks, that they've updated in a year is the title screen - to include pop-ups and ads to buy more content. Even now, if you want the full game with all of its content, you will pay over $200 US. They hide the commander DLC on a separate store page within the game to deceive you. New buyers won't know that they actually have to pay even more to have the full experience until it's too late. Each commander, some of which are pay2win and you will need to stay competitive in the game, costs between $2.99-$4.99. This game is the most cash-grabbing pile of trash I have ever seen as long as I've been a gamer, and it's not even that good.  It's not worth $60, let alone $200.  They charge for content like it's a free to play game, but you pay full price up front, too.  Relic are so far up their own asses; I would love to see them go bankrupt from corruption. You can help by not spending your hard-earned cash on this garbage.			"

												I really could have recommended this game for it's mutliplayer, but I can't. The fact that Relic is a greedy money-♥♥♥♥♥ has to be taken into account. So what makes ths game so bad? I mean like the multiplayer is pretty fun, isn't it? Well yeah, it is, sort of. You know how there are several DLC factions? Well guess what, in order to get some of the commanders, you have to cash out to get them in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in-game store. Why on earth would you add microtransactions to a game people already have paid for? And in some cases, these commanders are ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered.So alright, you decide that you don't want to play multiplayer and get the game for the campaign. Well you're in for one of the worst campaigns in a game I have ever played. Not only is it historically inaccurate, it is also boring as hell. I couldn't get myself to play through the whole thing even. In conclusion, I'd recommend to steer away from this game if you want a singleplayer experience. Otherwise, if you have some friends to play MP with, sure, pick it up, but wait for a sale. This game is in no way worth the full price they're charging for it.			"

Revision for post release of Commonwealth Forces (British):Company of Heroes 2 continues to be a money grab and if it wasn't for the fact that as a heavy beta tester that I receive most of the content for free I wouldn't spend time other than to get the achievements. Since the last three major updates, the game still goes through massive ring around the nerf hammer which hits Axis forces more often than Allied forces which means if you were looking to play as Axis a lot, prepare to be dissapointed in most logical situations.There is no historical balance or logic to the combat mechanics of the game and instead relies heavily on an RNG mechanic for ""to hit"" ""damage dealt"" ""cover saves"" and ""armor saves"" which means even if your unit is incapable of realistically damaging the target, chances are you still can and vice versa.A great example of this is dedicated anti-tank units and self propelled guns taking multiple hits to destroy light vehicles, normally the same for all units regardless of vehicle class. IE: Jagdpanther Veterancy 5 can hit a light scout car and deal only 50% of its hp threshold in damage yet on a frontal armour penetration against a T-34/85 it can deal almost 60%. Logical? Not in the slightest.If you play against the AI, it has access to all doctrines at the same time but does a very good job of hiding this unless you pay attention to the globals it uses. For example the Russian AI will almost always have access to Propaganda Artillery Strikes even if the Commander they use doesn't have access to it. When playing against the AI, it's recommended you use one of the ""All Unit"" mods which at least make the game somewhat fair and balanced.When playing competitively, it's best to just do smaller player counts because most factions are not balanced on late tier games seen in 3v3s and 4v4s in which certain factions are punished heavily such as the USForces only having one premium doctrine that has a heavy tank compared to all the OKW and Heer having access to multiple heavy tanks regardless of doctrine.Certain units are still bugged such as the crewing and recrewing of abandoned units on certain maps will result in the unit disappearing and being unable to be commanded, destroyed, or pulled out of combat. While rare, it's still in the game and it was a problem since beta two years ago. Tanks still can't aim on elevation which means if you want to really♥♥♥♥♥♥someone off, go up a hill and shoot down, 90% of all shots unless the player decides to manually control will go straight into the ground right in front of said vehicle.Only buy this game when it is on sale for 60-80% off. If you are smart, don't buy any of the DLC unless it's 75% off or more. There is occasional free commanders at different times of the year so if you are patient, you can rack up some decent ones in addition to random drops. (Which don't even give you drops to your faction half the time.)			"

												I tried to like it. I really tried. But there were just too many poor design decisions. So first I shall start with the most objective: The multiplayer is exceptionally poorly balanced to account for the commanders they want you to buy with real money (about $3 each). To unlock a commander you need 12,000 points. To have a chance at getting 500 points, or a random commander, or a vehicle skin you need to earn 6,000 experience. To get experience you need to play a multiplayer match or skirmish (1500xp for playing + 500xp for winning each) So to have that chance at obtaining 1/24th of a relevant commander you need to either win 3 matches or lose 4 matches. You see why this could be problematic? This means that to unlock ONE commander you need to play a minimum of between 72 and 96 matches. For every commander. For a game you paid money for.""But supposing I don't want to use those fancy commanders, surely a strategy game would depend more on one's strategic ability?""You'd think that wouldn't you? As it turns out the answer is 'no.' Now this part might vary for you as I am definitely not a good strategist however it became immediately apparent that of the two factions you are given in the vanilla game, The Soviets and the Wehrmacht Ostheer, the Russians are inferior in nearly every aspect. Theoretically they are supposed to dominate the early game which might have been true when this game first was released but now they merely dominate the morgue. The initial moments of the game usually involve sending out conscripts to get resources and to die from machine gun fire. To deal with the machine gun you either send a sniper team and have them die from wandering too close to said machine gun on account of not being able to see the gun due to the sight radius conveniently being barely outside the machine gun’s range, or you try to flank with conscripts and remember bolt action rifles are only slightly more effective than spitting in their face, or you send in a scout car with flamethrowers and have the basic german infantry fire a Panzerfaust at the apparently tin foil engine, or you grab a mortar and wait for them to die of old age while you announce your waste of manpower, or you ignore the one MG to try and cap everything else to find he used his engineers/grenadiers to cover all his other points with machine gun bunkers and kill you, or you can attempt to throw a Molotov and get shot because apparently the only guy who knows how to throw one was in absolute dire need of a nap and decided to take it right when you ordered him, alternatively finding out that its tiny area of effect damage over time merely tickles the now repositioned machine gun team. But eventually you figure something out and dislodge the MG to advance and run into Panzergranadiers which are superior to all of your infantry in every way. You don’t even get automatic weapons outside of commander specializations while these assault rifle wielding ubersoldatten can be upgraded with panzershreks and kill half your tanks in two hits. Meanwhile, it takes a dedicated Soviet anti tank gun 9+ shots to annoy a panther heavy tank. That’s not even mentioning the dlc factions.I uhhh… should probably stop now. You get the idea. Its bad. Don’t get it.			"

												Strategy is involved. The workshop has some great maps, and the AI let alone multiplayer is fun. Smarter buy when on sale. DLCs add a varietability you will enjoy after campaign mode and several AI matches. I would argue while slightly slower in resource collection game plays out like SC2 with strategy and once you have a firm grasp on your factions build, multiplayer will become less enjoyable and more like a math problem. That being said; the house to house battles are fun and if you are a WWII buff or history major, you will find an appreciation for this game.			"

But the constant in mid-game disconnects from relic servers are extremely frustrating to the extent that I have to answer steams bipolar review options with a ""Do you recommend this game = NO""If there were a scale for the reviews where you had the option to pick a score between 1-5 I would probably give it a 3 or 4. I like the game but Relic hasn't learned from CoH 1 and still keeps on enforcing their stupid DRM policies which punish us paying customers. The pirates play on private servers using fakesteam software anyway, so it doesn't help. Please Relic, either increase the tolerance for bad connections or remove the requirement to be connected to the relic servers all together. This is ridiculous, I wouldn't accept these issues on any other product I buy, and I don't do it on software and games either. "

												Cant give this game a thumbs up until they balance teamgames and matchmaking.The gameplay really varies, sometimes its very fun while being challenging at the same time, and other times you get teamed up with noobs (not even 50 hrs total playtime) and lose brutally because of that. This happens especially with the allies since almost all of the more experienced players choose the axis factions (because they have units and abilities that really overperformes compared to the allied conterparts), left on the allied side are only the newbies that have barely played the game.Yes, I know, this game can be really awesome at times (by far best RTS game I have played), but these two things I mentioned makes the multiplayer experience... not so good. You will often be screaming out of rage because of the numerous imbalance issues the game has.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is a great game, however, SEGA's dlc practices are really bad. The Commanders System is almost like a semi-p2w system at times, as certain store commanders may be better than some of the commanders you get from purchasing the base game. It's not a huge difference, but it really should not be like this. With that being said, the game's combination of tactics, unit diversity of the factions and gameplay mechanics make it one of the most addicting modern RTS games. The cover system in particular deserves praise, and playing MP is fun as hell. Pros-Graphics.GameplayCover System.Cons-No singleplayer campaign for the Brits.DLC practices.By the way, what's with all the 'We need Chinese' reviews?			"

												This game has given me 3 years of joy, even with its flaws. I just cant seem to put it away in favor of other games. It has been my game of choice since the night of release in june 2013, and I dont see that changing anyitme soon. To address common issues:The balance can be bad, but only at the highest levels. Before that point, its a matter of learning how to play.The bugs can be NotLikeThis FeelsBadMan too, but for the most part relic is currently actively working on or has fixed alot of them, there are no game breaking bugs at the moment.The game is still regularly patched, so if there are issues they are usually fixed.The optimization, well dont play on a potato and you should be fine. I never had an issue with optimization. During my first year and a half of play, I played on a ♥♥♥♥in' potato laptop and I had to run the game on minimum. I got a job, bought a computer that didnt suck, and I can run the game on high just fine. I can even play on maximum/highest if I want to sacrifice some frames. You'll likely have to run the game on medium- minimum settings if you want perfect FPS, or if your computer isnt the best. To be honest, the game on minimum still has beautiful visuals. Especially in comparison to other RTS games.  Its critically acclaimed company of heroes at its core, after all. Matchmaking is bad you say? Play during european hours an you should have no problems finding games at your level and in a timely manner. Your first 10 games will likely be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they're placement matches to find your play-level. Just stick with it and learn. Coh2 was my first online RTS, and I'd say im doing pretty fine nowadays, even though I struggled out the gate.The campaign was released 3 years ago. So if it still hurts your feelings, and you're a compstomp scrub, L2P multiplayer already. I can help you. just add me.TOW is not updated, and was basically dropped.however if you insist on being a comp stomp n00b then modding is fun, if youre into it. Ardeneess assault i wouldve given a 3/10 for its cost a year or so ago, but since its much cheaper now its a fun playthorugh for what it costs.All in all, coh2 is a solid 9/10 would play again. Almost 5k hours and counting now, and like I said, to this day I've still not found  game i'd rather play over it. Hands down the best RTS out there, especialyl for those that like WWII(including me)			"

												Its not perfect, but we love it!Now to clear up some cashgrabing confusion some kids have been ranting about in the reviews section:-War Spoils update now makes it totally easier to get commanders without spending a dime (Not to mention that default commanders for most factions are already good enough to begin with and all commanders are more or less balanced anyway)-Theres faction DLC yes, but every faction is extremely different and detailed, you wont find such diversity in other nonRelic RTS games. Not to mention that every faction DLC is standalone, meaning that you can only buy that one and already experience CoH2 multiplayer wihout ever owning the base game. I do not understand the cashgrab rants, we always had faction DLC in relic games yet noone complained. Sure maybe campaigns are not added anymore to them, but theyre cheaper because of that.-Just dont listen to the negative rants too much, buy the faction you like the most, should be quite cheap and try playing them in multiplayer or skirmish for 2 hours, you can always get a refund if you do not like the game.-The game is well balanced. Yes, some things are stronger then others, but only in few percents. Here are charts if you do not believe me: http://coh2chart.com/9/10 - An amazing upgrade on Company of Heroes 1			"

												Terrible regress after classic vCoH...An excellent example when the sequel, made by other team, is a way to lose franchise. They have worsened every part of strategy: slow animation, awful generals system insipde of classic doctrines, pointless levels (ranks) and absolutely random survival of the squads...Do you remember fast flankings, do you remember few mg's covering each other, the power of infantry, excellent explosion's graphics?

												Well where to start, I have been playing the game since release and it was brilliant to start with however the developers have simply began to spiral out of control with every faction added, no clue how to balance the game anymore every patch or new commanders they release seem to break the games balance even further.Remember the times when the game was all about skill actually using tactics and using your brain ? Gone are those days the majority of games you play is a horde of 4 infantry squads upgraded with weapons being attack moved across the map which leads to a very dull game that gets boring quick .Matchmaking has become diabolical constantly matched with team mates who are very new to the game so get crushed within 5minutes then preceed to leave and on that rare occasion you do get put against someone of the same rank they just exploit flaws in the games balance to troll to victory.Relic in my opinion has a absolutely gem of a game here the fact they don't listen to the community or play the game themselves online is whats killing the community and the game unfortunately will drive off the most dedicated players for good,  they have the chance to turn it around in the next 3-4 months but after that I see this game being more of a hindrence to them while they work on there next project.

												War spoils ruined this game and made this potentialy good game a grindfest, gold drops are too low for the ammount that the ingame store charges for fluff is absurd, Game is mostly p2w you can grind (and will grind for a long time) for ingame currency but most of new stuff is pay with real money only like:New commanders you have to buy £4-5 You can earn ingame currency but you only get 500 and you only level up every 4-5 games and drops are random (may be a skin, may be money, very very rarely a commander).Vehicle Skins cost 22-23k gold (ive gotten 6k after 200hrs due to crash and if server disconnects you, (happens alot) you get nothing. Alot of new skins are pay only 4-5 bucks same with commanders unless you want a faceplate you still need 7500 gold.If you want to pay 60 bucks + 20 bucks per dlc for a incomplete game with all the content ripped out and sold back to you this is the game for you.

												I want so badly to enjoy this game, but the developer's ignorance or incomeptence ruins it.Recommendation: DO NOT BUY.Pros:Sounds the US rocket plane call-in makes. PSHEW PSHEW PSHEW!Cons:It's 2015 and still no customizeable hotkeys. I have to use the keyboard arrow keys to pan the camera but all the hotkeys are around WASD. I have lost so many units from trying to panic retreat/backwards move and misclicking right next to the on-screen button causing the unit to be deselected. I refuse to download some third-party application to remap the keys just for this game.It's 2015 and still no mute button for in-game chat or pings. There's way too many toxic asshats that play this game and I don't want to hear their BS.Team weapons will randomly get stuck as in they freeze and refuse all orders until something kills them. I reported this bug over a year ago. No fix. It breaks the game so badly.Every once in awhile you'll hear a really loud gunshot noise that will scare the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Most likely sound buffer corrupting from the memory leak.The developers publicly stated on one of their streams that they do NOT balance the game towards 3on3 and 4on4. To me, the game is 4on4. And it's an unbalanced cluster♥♥♥♥.Walking stukas.Panzershrecks.Allies aren't allowed to have nice things.Matchmaking is a joke.The game crashes regularly.The game is a memory hog with a blatant memory leak (probably the reason for most of the crashes). Windows cries tears of joy after exiting the game as it can take a couple minutes for it to reclaim RAM.This game is unnecessarily CPU heavy. I get roughly the same 30-40 fps at the lowest possible graphic settings vs high settings. It could probably benefit greatly from GSync/FreeSync and DX12/Vulkan.Whoever thought that blizzards were a good idea should be ashamed.If you don't like micro hell, do not buy this game.			"

												UPD: It's been a rough year in Ukrainian warzone. I realize review is outdated, so proceed at your own risque. I did not edit the text below and I did not have the urge to return into game despite hearing lots of things (both good and bad, last patch WAS GENUINELY BAD THOUGH, EVERYONE WHO THINKS OTHERWISE IS NOT UNBIASED SANE PERSON, really, changing OKW resources penalties to zero, taking kubel suppression away (hey, faction has no other standart suppression units, have fun with controlling the blobs) and making other QUESTIONABLE balance changes (again, as I stated below, I'm no cold-hearted numbers-thinking expert, I just describe my feels as player, well, former player).PS. Also bear in mind that Relic is not the same developer who brought you Dawn of War and CoH, they had major staff reshuffles, even after that big thing with THQ bankrupcy. Folks, please, THINK before you HYPE.This here is a perfect example of anti-fun. And I am not even talking about balance. Or rough bulletin system. Or harsh matchmaking. It's bugs+random, plain and simple. Because it gets really, REALLY frustrating when you shoot down an aircraft and it lands on your troops with most lethal results that artillery corps can't even dream of; or when you can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥about enemy Half-Track with your anti-tank guns, but your anti-tank gun gets ♥♥♥♥♥slapped by MG with armor-piercing rounds (yeah, Jackson, I'm talking about you): or you can't demolish T-70 Light Tank with 5 shots in rear armor, because the main gun breaks instead; or when cover system screws up and squad is placed in negative cover which wasn't there a second ago; or when retreats go though the middle of opposing force; or sniper misses ten shots in a row; or Ivan throws the bottle not upwards but under his foot being a german spy all along, I assume. Ugh.Had to make an update about me and RTS games and potential assumptions about my low skill level. Hey, surprise, I'm not GOOD at RTS, I'm what you call an average player. So yeah, the point of me painfully playing this game in multiplayer was learning something from better player. Theorycraft here usually helps, but due to commander system and lack of good wiki (srsly, the only one non-outdated I could find was japanese, what kind of sorcery is this) won't help you - you'll have to watch streams and replays, which some reviews suggest. And I watched. And, hey, folks there are often sound infuriated because of the same reason of randomness and bugs, but they have skill and that helps them win the game despite the Gods of Random will, THAT kind of skill, neither I, nor you, if you wanna buy this game, won't have. Hell, I even have been placed against the persons whose streams I watched on a couple of accasions (which is kinda creeping me out considering my in-game amount of time). Oh, I promised not to talk about matchmaking. Shutting up now.I've won my fair share of fights, even versus players better than me. But then again, it was thanks to same randomness. For some reason my grenades oneshot obersoldaten, or my mortars were unnaturely accurate, or my panic AT grenade utterly destroyed the engine of a Tiger Tank which let me easily deal with that wunder of Teutonic engineering.So, I do not enjoy an emotional torture this game provides. It is a perfect simulation of horrors and chaos of WWII (which is kinda funny, because devs were working on Dawn of War series, featuring mentioned chaos and horrors). But in matters of being a ""game"" it just doesn't work. There are a lot of wonderful things people are writing in ""pro-purchase"" reviews about, but they forget to mentions those things, like graphics, physics, cover, sight and snow mechanics often do not work properly, thus leading to endless train of dissapointment.

												If you loved the first one then sure, play it. But i wouldnt call it a sequel. Theres very little evolution from the first one (other than slightly nicer graphics) and it feels more like an update or a large DLC pack than an actual sequel. I played it all the way through, but it left me wanting more. It feels like they made it that way on purpose just so they could push content that should have been in there from day one, as DLC and charge us more for it. I suppose theres replay value in MP, but im not a fan of RTS MP so no it holds little interest for me. I think you have to be a die hard fan of the series to spend all the money they are asking for it. And honestly, I feel a little disapointed.

												I have 600+ hours in this game and easily had over 1,000 hours in COH1.  In Summary,  I believe Company of Heroes 1 was superior to this game in every way except for multiplayer custom lobbies (mix and matching armies), and two other very small new features. I like this game and will continue to play it but can't really recommend it as a purchase.I'm not sure what's happened with Relic but the balance of this game is quite off-putting. (UPDATE: Balance has gotten significantly better since this was written, however regular major patch updates still make balance volitile and unpredictable.) Axis armies are extremely easy to play and have great units. Allies require extreme amounts of micro-management and will generally still lose. Its quite frustrating. I am a veteran RTS player and have never experienced such an imbalance as present in this game. I've tried very hard to become formidable as the US Forces and to a lesser extent, the Russians. However, Axis are simply the dominant armies in the game (particularly, OKW). If the game was a bit more balanced I could really recommend this game. Queueing up for a match will reflect this as 60-80% of players will queue as the Axis (Wehrmacht and OKW). Nor can I recommend this as a competitive RTS title. Competitive RTS players should defer t0o StarCraft 2. But if you are looking for a casual fun title and have an interest in WWII, this game is veru suitable. However, I must beckon you to consider Company of Heroes 1, as it is superior in nearly every way.This game as been released with a greedy loot drop system, commander DLC, and campaign/skins/coop mission DLC marketing strategy. Some of the best campaigns, cosmetics, and commanders in the game must be purchased seperately to use. The ones you get for free are good, but you will not be able to play some of the best commanders or campaigns in this game without purchasing additional content. You can unlock them as a free drops but that is extremely unlikely to happen, as they are based off randomness and rarity. The armies that were including in the previous Company of Heroes 1 titles are not all included in COH2. You must purchase USA, OKW, and now UKF (The United Kingdom) separately. So It seems clear that they never intended to release a successor (in content and quality) to COH1. That makes this game feel like its just an update to COH1 rather than a true sequel with vision and ambition. Despite this, there are some welcome new features in COH2. The game is updated with a new engine and higher resolution graphics. There are only three new game mechanics included in COH2: fence vaulting, snowstorms (update: snowstorms are now disabled by default), and true vison. You can research these further but none are really significant upgrades to COH1.COH2 is a inferior product in nearly every aspect when compared to Company of Heroes 1. The atmosphere, sound design, and style of COH1 is actually superior to COH2. Yet, Relic has really used this release to nickel and dime their fans. I could elaborate further on this but I feel my review is getting long winded. If you do not believe me, please take a look at the ever growing in-game store and notice how many DLC packages are included for this game. With glaring issues in army design and balance, it seems Relic's current strategy with this game is not to sell a high quality well-made RTS, but rather to sell DLC and segmented content. COH1 with its expansion packs has better balance, the same amount of armies (minus the Soviets unfortunately(although the Eastern Front mod exists for this), a better campaign, better voice acting, better graphic style, better music, and a better Relic. In a few years (around 2018) I think this game may be a better deal if you can get a complete edition on heavy discount with all content. I cannot recommend it over COH1 for the reasons I have listed. COH1 has a large selection of community made maps and mods (Europe at War) that really add value to the game. COH2 has excellent workshop content but is not worth the price and fundamentally broken meta of the game.			"

												Campaign is decent, even though it truly fails at conveying the bigger picture of the war on the Eastern Front. They could've done a lot more when it comes to explaining how the war progressed. As it is, though, the campaign is adequate. Still a very small number of troops to command, unfortunately.The addition of the new line of sight system works well, good job on this one. Vaulting over walls is great, until you realize you have to manually command the soldiers to do this, otherwise they'll still go around a knee-high fence like drones. Overall, the gameplay is adequate, but not a great improvement over the first CoH.Graphics are, again, decent. Nothing to write home about, and they could've included better textures. This is a PC game after all, you have more than 2GB of graphics memory on the graphics cards that are powerful enough to run this game at maximum settings. The sound is overall bland and forgettable, with very few exceptions.The multiplayer, however, is by far and away the worst thing about this game. After dozens upon dozens of patches, the developers have yet to balance things properly. DO NOT get drawn into buying DLC commanders in order to be able to field the Tiger I tank, it is by far and away the most useless tank in the game. This doesn't seem like it will change anytime soon, as the last time the developers tried to ""fix"" the Tiger I, they nerfed it into oblivion. Overall, if you want a pleasant multiplayer experience, this is not the game you're looking for.			"

												After putting in a lot of hours on the old COH i feel that this game has made some improvements to an already good RTS. i've clocked 370hrs which may look like child's play to some people's hours but i've tried every part of this game and enjoy it to say the least. It's the only RTS that i can play for hours and not get too bored. But my only problem really is the lack of maps in the game (with out using workshop content) if feels a little empty as far as good maps go and the  modeling is good apart from the brits with late WW1 unit skins . Other than that i'd say its worth the money the overall unit command works well 10/10 from me			"

												Not worth full price.  Buy on sale.  Bit of pay to win going on.Loved the first one, not so much this one.  Some nice additions, line of sight is nice, weather conditions make it more interesting.  But significant balance issues.  Commander choice is bland and often not significant.  Most players are just going to build one or two types of units and spam a special call in. An observation, the developers seem really keen on making this accessible to the e-sport community, but it feels to have a detrimental effect on the game over all. It feels as if they want the matches to be over in 12 minutes. To but it bluntly the developer seems to want to make the game competitive but this does not necessarily mean engaging. I am waiting for a significant DLC before I decide if I am going to uninstall.  As is, I recommend you buy this if its $30 or less.			"

												What was a fun game has turned into a seriously bad grindfest with little to no rewards unless you pay cash for them.  The premise of drop rewards is a farce when you see a new level 4 player get 3 rewards even when they never left their base and the level 80 player who carried the battle vs AI gets nothing at all.  The multiplayer imbalance issues have persisted through every update with one faction or another being made the supreme combatant who easily defeats the other factions.  Case in point, when an armored car catches a mg team moving in the open, and the mg sets up, and then destroys the armored car even while under constant fire from it the entire time.  Things like this happen all the time where a poorly positioned or vastly inferior unit destroys the more powerful unit when it shouldn't.  Buy this for the solo campaign alone since the multiplayer game is still badly in need of some serious attention to fix the long standing problems.			"

												A visually beautiful game with many interesting units and exciting gameplay, but multiplayer has some serious balance issues that don't seem to be addressed. Almost all of the heavy tanks are on the German side, and the couple of heavy tanks available for allies are doctrinal only and easily defeated by even medium armor. What it means is a much higher level of skill needed to play as allies, while Germans need only to survive into the late game in order to obtain tanks and faceroll everything.When matchmaking, Relic shows the percentage of players waiting in line for each side. I rarely see over 40% allies, and it is often even 5% allies and 95% Germans. It makes for frustrating gameplay and ultimately let to me uninstalling this game.I'll give it a shot again once the next patch is released, but with how long this game has been released for I would expect such a basic issue to be resolved.And I didn't even get into the pay to win issues around buying commanders...

												Sadly this game is a failure if it wants to be a competitive RTS game. A small amount of RNG in strategy games can be good, but it feels like a board game where a dice is rolled EVERY TIME a unit does something. You basically have zero control over the game. If a unit feels like it, he will hit tanks/infantry. If the unit drank too much the night before, he will act like someone who never had proper training. I've played more than 200matches and I still have no idea why cant we have any damage or hp numbers on the Wiki. No specific information is given about what covers do in terms of + and - defense. How much is the penalty for a moving thing to hit another? You have no idea what the f*ck your soldiers can or cant do. Oh and if you think you know what your toddlers are capable of, the RNG was just favorable. I had games were a single conscript squad killed nearly 2 pioneers in close range. and i had games were these conscripts were eaten alive by just 1. AND THE CURCUMSTANCES WERE TOTALLY THE SAME.In an RTS you need to rely on information. In this game, you have nothing. There are also bulletins which increase certain stats but sice you dont know the basic stats, they are worthless.And the Imbalances thats units have, oh man. Dont get me started on that one.Btw I have no idea why did this game ended up like this.Modders made the Blitzkrieg mod and it was glorious. It still had some rng, but it was just SOME, not the ENTIRE GAME.All it was needed was some god damn matchmaking system, and it would have been good to go.Now they are pulling more money with these ""new factions"" becasue they know their game wont make any on its own because its garbage. This game will never reach the competitive scene, or be something other than a game on a really bad LAN party. They ♥♥♥♥ed up. BAD. And they are still hosting events and other♥♥♥♥♥♥ to cover up the games massive faults.Well time to go back to COH1 and other REAL RTS games.Dont waste your time and money on this guys.

Playing with friends or by yourself the game is never the same.Controls - Simple and easy.Cons Pathfinding - Sometimes your troops take the most difficult, dangerous path you can think of which usually ends up with them being killed.AI - Basically useless without your commands.Despite all, I never get sick of this. Didn't like it at first but once I added British and American troops the game took off for me. Me and my friend never get sick of playing this game. The detail and battles are amazing.

												May Sega rot in hell for what they had done in the early stages of its release but oh, well, they did try to redeem themselves later on. Also, Relic is one of the most veteran developers in strategy genre & which is exactly why i wish they hadn't made the blunder of forcing this game to be an e-sports material. They just made more of a mess & couldn't retain the fun factor that made CoH1 so widely popular.Now, with that being said, the strategical aspect of Company of Heroes 2 bundled with new factions, frigid new landscapes, countless new units, improved visuals & the continuous harrowing sounds of bullets & shells is still pretty darn enjoyable & immersive itself. The game, namely the multiplayer is no walk in the park; it has a pretty steep learning curve. Complaints about the imbalance that the community made when the game was released have also been fixed more or less.Ideally, if the campaign of the first game & the multiplayer of the second had married with each other, we would have the perfect love child. Sadly, it didnt happen in this case, much like real life but whatever it was able create, it stands vehemently on its own.			"

												COH 2 has incredible balance issues that make for an un-fun experience. German forces are vastly superior to Russian forces in every regard. While this might make the game historically accurate, kind of, it makes for a bad gameplay experience. When two conscript squads totalling twelve men cannot kill half of a four man grenadier squad, all while being more expensive than them, I have issues. Tanks absolutely break the game. German tanks level much faster, and it is nearly impossible to kill a panzer 4 even with two T-70. I keep coming back to this game once and a while as new balance patches are implemented, which may eventually make this game fair and worth it. This game also has a pay to win element to it with DLC payable commanders that add new abilities to you in game. Just type ""COH 2"" into the search bar on steam and wade through almost 4 FULL PAGES of payable DLC. This is absolutely not acceptable. If balance issues are properly addressed and DLC is made cheaper, I'd pay 99 cents for a new commander but the current price is 4 dollars WTF, this game may be worth 40 dollars. As of now though its not worth your time.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is just a former shadow of its predecessor, Company of Heroes 1. While one could argue that this isnt a remake of CoH1 which is true, however, CoH2 is lacks in content of its predecessor while the game felt dumb downed in so many ways where the Command Tree from CoH1 has been replaced with a system that is similar to Call of Duty's perks system. Rusians felt like a reskinned version of America from the first game in some ways. The campaign is not as fun as the previous game as it felt like the entire campaign is just a lengthy tutorial as the game does not seemed to trust you with its arsenal, unlike its predecessor.To make things worse, Sega decided to fill the game with microtrasactions that are pretty costly that ranges from harmless cosmetic skins for vehicles to paid only commander with new units and abilities where you only can obtain it by paying your hard earned money. There isnt any way to unlock these content by playing the game. Unfortunately, this game felt like it is the paid version of Company of Heroes Online with all these microtrasactions. To make things even worse, Sega decides to hide these microtrasactions from the Steam Store while you only can find these microtrsactions inside the game, just like an In-App Purchase (IAP) in a mobile game. The only microtransactions that Sega did correctly were the DLC content packs such as Case Blue where these packs provides some pretty decent new solo and coop missions into the game. One could argue that these content are optional but having these microtrasactions are a notion by major publishers to put more and more paywall into game content to encourage gamers to pay more for lesser content. As a conclusion, buyers beware. If you are looking for a multiplayer RTS, look elsewhere. If you are a predominantly single player RTS gamer, Company of Heroes 2 might give you a decent experience. As a Relic game fan, Company of Heroes 2 is a disappointment as this isnt the Company of Heroes sequel that most are looking for but a cynical attempt by Sega to include questionable IAPs into the game that were abused heavily on mobile. I thought Dawn of War 2 was average at best, but seemed like Relic has made Company of Heroes 2 even worse than Dawn of War 2.I highly recommend one to get Company of Heroes 1 Complete Edition instead, then, get the Eastern Front mod to play as Rusians. Alternatively, get World in Conflict with Soviet Assault expansion or get the latest installment from the Wargame series if you want a more realistic tactical RTS.EDIT: Here are the links to the in-game DLC store page that can be accessed from the game.http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Company_of_Heroes_2_Vehicle_Camouflages/http://store.steampowered.com/sale/Company_of_Heroes_2_Commanders/ "

												An absolutely amazing game with a thriving community of modders and map makers.Sadly, the game is marred severely by it's Pay-locked ""DLC"" content. You literally have to pay real money for the right to use content you already paid for.The base game consists of a weak, single story campaign and an online mode which locks 3/5 factions behind an absolute pay wall, while letting you select them as A.I. just to pound home the fact that the content is hatcheted out with a bent, rusty cleaver.Beyond the base content, the main things of import are these 3 factions. Factions for which you must pay more than $10 each. Factions which are already in the game and should have been present from the base game. Factions which add the basic amount of content required to justify the basic cost of the game.This is dispicable and untolerable. Even should it be that this decision was not made by Relic, they made the decision to go through with it. It would have been far better to have canceled the game, terminated their contract with SONY and started work on a new I.P. It really is a shame too, since the rest of the game shows they are good at this. Even if they can't be arsed to give the modding community the ability to upload their own 3D models...			"

												Too arcade and fast paced/hectic, meaning planning and strategy are often not rewarding enough. Controls are clunky and there is a considerable amount of micromanagement. I'm not against micromanagement, but it is not a pleasure here. The game also feels too zoomed in, thus claustrophobic. These things makes simple tasks tedious. loads of little examples like: no 1-click ungarrison option. Have 4 cannons selected and ask for artillery barage? Only 1 cannon fires. Rotating a building you want to build, what a tempramental pain... You can't re-bind the keyboard in the menu. If I compare this with say Cossacks, there the controls are a breeze. Just my opinion. Levels load slow, and then still stutter a bit.But, with practice, you might get used to the flaws, and then its an ok game, and multiplayer can be fun.			"

												Awesome game concept, most of the game mechanics from coh 1 have been taken and put back in a more recent game.however, don't except to get a funny game online because of the balance.A dlc policy from the game developper RELIC COMPANY made the balance completely rubish. Most of your victories and defeat are because you didn't chose the few meta commander or the overpowered faction in the current patch.Relic has completely given up on the support of its game, 3 years after its release and is now focusing on its new game DOW3 which force me to tell you to save your money.the game won't become better and currently, it's really not enjoyable online, even against AI (which is completely dumb and rely only on cheat to gives a bit of challenge).Better wait for IRON HARVEST, or get MEN OF WAR : ASSAULT SQUAD 2 which is less casual but far more enjoyable in long term.If you still decide to buy this game, i wish you good luck and hope you won't get disapointed too fast.

												If you're not familiar with Company of Heroes, the game focuses more on combat and tactics and marginalizes base building. So, the game feels more faster paced and there's a lot of action.  The graphics and sounds are also great; it's awesome seeing a Tiger Tank obliterate everything.The gameplay is excellent and the community is very active.  The developer Relic has also been supporting the game since the game's release in 2013.  Unfortunately, the total cost of the game and DLC are way overpriced, but the base game and the DLC go on sale often. If you like RTS it's definitely worth it for 75% off.There are commanders you can also buy, or things that give your more strategic options. I'm not a fan of this... in my opinion DLC should be limited to only expansions and cosmetics, not things that let you buy more stategic options. You can also get these commanders in drops like in TF2 of CS:GO, but it takes a long time.However, most of the active playerbase agrees that the commanders are not pay to win and you can do just fine with the default commanders.If you're interested in picking it up, you should check out the Reddit buyer's guide because it's confusing to know what you might want to get.  https://www.reddit.com/r/CompanyOfHeroes/wiki/buyguide **TL;DR: Pick it up if you like RTS; It's an excellent game that a lot of people love despite having a questionable business model.**I'll be playing this one for awhile!

												After playing this game for so many years i d say stay away from this game. Game devs at each patch change the game causing horrible balance. Matchmaking has always been horrible. If you want to spend your time and dont care about winning or loosing go for it. If you are a true gamer enthusiast stay away from this horribly balanced game.			"

												When COH 2 first came out the excitment was obvious, the hype was vast and the expectations were heavy. After a fairly promising start however the game has been mutilated by the developers who constantly react to community moaning and groaning - for example: ""the T 34 is much better than my panzer IV!"" (what a surprise, its meant to be; and historically was the better vehicle) This then leads to nerfing and counter nerfing of practically every unit in the game, not to mention the horde of DLC commanders that add content which probably should have been in the game since its release. Therefore do yourselves a favour and do not buy this game on principle, instead turn your sights to the far more satisfying and realistic Men of War series, namely Assault Squad 2, this will provide you with hundreds of units and vehicles that actually play as they should and are not nerfed on a daily basis by the developer. An absolute shame as its predecessor was one of the best RTS games ever concieved for the PC.			"

												I really love this game, im a huge coh fan. But like the first game they totally destroyed this one with their patches. It was nearly perfected balanced, but then they intruduced the brits and like in coh 1 they same faction broke the game. This company does not learn from its mistakes or it doesnt care as long they get the money for those factions.I really really want to recommend this game. I played over 700 hours multiplayer at this point. But again after years of cool gameplay they somehow break the balance. After 2 years they destroy their own game i just dont get why.If you're into abusing the most op faction buy this game, search for the op that is in the game abuse it. Make more ppl de-install it, the game deserves that. If you're like me and really want competetive gameplay with balanced factions. Do not buy or wait for their balance patch. But this will take time, the broken patch is now running nearly a year and they're not doing♥♥♥♥♥♥about it.			"

												Wonderful RTS game with spectacular visuals. One of the most popular games with my friends and I.5 Factions (With DLC), Soviets, Amaricans, British, and 2 groups of Nazi called Wehrmacht and Oberkommando. All play different with strengths and weaknesses, and with quite good historical accuracy. Units range from Infantry, Mortar teams, Snipers, Machine gun crews, Light vehicles, multiple kinds of Tanks, and Artillery.For you WW2 buffs out there, or just RTS fans ready for a fast paced, action filled fight, this is your game.

												Hard to recommend a sequel to the highest rated metacritic rts of the 21st century, which changes (for the worse) and removes many of the original's features. From a singleplayer aspect, the ai is more intellegent this time round and provides more of a challenge. However the storyline is lacking and doesn't appear intwined very well from mission to mission. The theatre of war game modes add a nice change of pace to the standard gameplay, and lead to some nice co-operative scenarios, perhaps with inspiration from the Joint Operations mod for coh1. Again however, it isnt very well executed with some simply being skirmishes with slightly altered units depending on the timeframe.Multiplayer matchmaking has also changed. Gone away with the lobby system, with just automatch left; this feels like such a step backwards. Removing of such core features leaves you with a small amount of customisation. You can create custom matches, but you will have to invite other players from steam to fill in the gaps. No longer can you tell whether you are competing with and against equally skilled players, with the new xp orentated level system which grants you xp for simply taking part (also accumulated in single player). No longer are there any statistics such as total online players, number of players searching as axis/soviets, how many are looking for 4v4s, 1v1s etc, leaving you feeling as though there are not many active players (percentages searching for a game jump erratically)In game leaderboards are now gone, however have been instated in the Dec10th patch via a weblink. This feels really low effort and looks too much like an afterthought compared to the original coh1 leaderboards. I guess it is a good sign that Relic are listening to its customers as it was a highly requested feature by the community but should have been implemented into the game from release.Gameplay wise, it hasn't been messed about with too much which is a good thing. Weather affects have been added such as blizzards which can cause your units to die from the cold, and mud which severely affects unit speed. The amount of units availiable to each army seems rather small which can limit your countering options and often leads to lack of variety on the battlefield; many players opting to use the same units because many are currently obsolete. Doctrines have been replaced with commanders which share many of the same abilities, meaning that your choice feels less centralised to one strategy; for good or bad. As with many modern games this leads to microtransactions. Commanders, skins and even faceplates are just some of the (rather overpriced) options available on the steam store. Why these are not available already to everyone, or just included in patches is poor and shows the direction in which this game is going.To conclude; the main things that this game does well at, were already in place in the original game. Company of Heroes 2 takes away so much and yet adds so little. Adding the soviets as a playable faction in this sequel was nice, but was already done (very) well in the previous game via the Eastern Front mod. If you don't aready own the original (and its expansions) I thoroughly recommend you get that first. However if you've racked up 4digit hours playing the original like me, and you are itching for some more Company of Heroes, I can only suggest you don't pay full price. Honestly, I feel that this game is worth about a tenner, £15 max. Definitely hold out for sales on this.2/5			"

												well you may say how you can review a game with only 20h of gameplay, but let me finish my review and at the end you will decide..this game came a long way, through fall of THQ and a halt in production to acquiring by sega and a complete U turn in terms of game policy..during the announcement of the game, it had a 100$ Deluxe Collector bundle which had a kind of season pass in it with bunch of other stuff, and if you are an old fan relic you know their expansion policy (See Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of war 1) so it was a obvious choice for me. then the unthinkable happened.. THQ went down and game status with it too. no message from the Devs until sega showed up. at that point fans were relived that the game is saved, but they didn't know that it was doomed... after the purchase of sega, the Company of Heroes 2 page on steam was no more and it gave everyone freak.. what happened? with the return of the page, we were all shocked.. all those season pass and other stuff promise was no more and in exchange you would receive bunch of skins and commanders ""Extra to the original version"". so I paid 100$ for nothing (and sadly there were no  izi refund like these days). when the alpha and beta kicked out, the true nature of game showed itself. commanders that can be purchased through the game and can give you special units or abilities.. this was taken to the alpha forum of CoH but the devs were like ""Relax it will be ok and don't worry"".. sadly the bugs and OP units was there too (like 120 mortar of soviets could one shot almost everything, even tanks!) but the Relic fixes was in a strange way.. it kept one side more powerful.. for example update 1 soviets was op then update 2 germans were op..you may ask why I told you this story? cause the game is still the same.. expansion ( which are dlcs that add 1-2 army and cant be compared to WH40000) stormed the game beside the skins and commanders.. some units are OP and some of them useless..tl;dr Go buy CoH1 and enjoy the glory of the golden age of Relic and THQ..

												I don't often comment on this platform. I have just come here to give this game what it deserves. Mixed score is way too harsh and without justice. This is one of the best representatives of what left from RTS today. Comparing to COH 1, it forces the player to a more dynamic play. AI is again challenging and fun. The ammunition is more available during the game so special skills of units are used more often. Winter dynamics add a new dimension to the game. Game atmosphere with audio, voices, visuals are supporting the escapism (except for the British voices, hearing jokes while your fellows are dying is a big disturbance)I didn't play the campaign fully, since it was made for the casual gamer (click here and there) but skirmish alone is enough to enjoy it. Definitely recomended.			"

												There are many things wrong with this game, just some are:-The path finding is awful, if your units don't reverse towards the enemy they'll block anything else that has a shot. Before anything moves it rotates on its axis for a bit to make sure the AI can finish it off. The AI is pretty much god and can see everything on the map resulting in some awesome sniping with AT weapons. Snipers are pretty useless as everything seems to outrange them. Oh and sometimes when you click to perform an order it will simply deselect the unit, usually resulting in it being killed.I find it impossible to play this wthout raging about how stupid it is, somehow it's just totally unenjoyable on every level. AI on easy is too dumb, but the next level up just cheats to such a degree to make the experience a chore. The AI cheats at everything, it'll do more damage, take less damage, move faster, produce faster, oh and gain veterancy just for walking around pretty much. I know cheating AI is nothing new but here it just feels like a lazy way to make the game difficult.Throw in the fact you need to buy DLC to complete the game and I find it hard to see how the developers could have got it more wrong. No wonder the publisher went out of business.			"

												The game seem less like a step back, as some have said, as it is not a step forward. The graphics aren't overmuch improved and the extra detail almost makes the game look more muddy and nondescript. Think Battlefield 3 type 'realistic' pallete. This makes reading the screen harder than it was in the first game. For a RTS, being able to quickly observe and analyze the playing field is crucial. I often have to really study the screen a few seconds to figure it completely out. Also, the new engine seems less efficient than the CoH original and despite the relatively minor graphical upgrades the game is much more power hungry. Bring a powerful computer and video card to this firefight. With a AMD Phenom IIX4 and HD6850 l must turn the graphical options almost halfway down to get a solid 30 fps. The game was playable at maxed out settings but I found the frequent frame lag very upsetting. Some have complained about the new implementation of doctrinal forces. I like them. You have a healthy number of commanders at the start with several unlockable as you progress in your rank. Others may be bought online for a somewhat immodest 4 dollars apiece. I haven't played any online opponents and I've heard complaints about certain DLC commanders being overpowered and upsetting gameplay balance. Just a caution.Each commander has a handful of doctrinal options that vary between them. Some commanders share doctrinal options with perhaps only a couple differences between them. Some are starkly different. Having the option of choosing the commander at any time adds a nice touch of strategy as you can either get started early on the doctrinal options or hold out until you decipher your opponents strategy before locking in a choice. You are allowed to choose 3 commanders from your deck to carry in-game. This element is nice and makes for some fun fretting and fussing trying to figure out which ones suit your playstyle best.The torrential blizzards that will ultimately kill your infantry if not in shelter or around a fire isn't as big an imposition as it sounds and actually adds yet another nice touch of strategy to the mix. Risking the lives of your men in a surprise blizzard assualt is one the enemy probably won't expect as it carries a large gamble on your side to get the drop on them.In game physics and sound effects are stellar as ever. You'll feel the boom of explosions and the lumbering sound of tank treads crushing through the forest in high fidelity is a real treat to the experience. To cut this short I will still heartily recommend this game since the price has dropped considerably down since release. If you owned and enjoyed the first game you will enjoy this. Just don't expect it to be leaps and bounds better. If not slightly worse for wear.Thumbs up.			"

												As a person who purchased this game's DIgital Collectors Version, played during the beta, and played the first game, I sincerely have to say that this game is a disgrace to both SEGA and Relic.To start off, the beta was severely unbalanced. To be more specific, Germans had an edge with cheap and OP Panthers and Tigers storming the map easily. As the beta progressed, the severe balance was fixed however since then Germans have always had the upper edge in their versatility and superior units. Balance patches come slow and sometimes don't fix much, and most cause new problems. Along with this, the connection in multiplayer is often immensely unstable, so playing multiplayer is not reccomended, unless you want to play as germany(Which 70-90% of players are always searching as, so it is hard to find a game as them)Second of all, the DLC. You will get royally hoodwinked if you buy the DCE, or this game at all. Relic Entertainment promised no pay2win and no game-changing content. They at first kept this promise, and gave the DCE buyers the skins and commanders. However, they soon started releasing overpriced commanders which had custom content, breaking their promise and creating severe pay2win issues more than once. They also did not give the new content to the DCE buyers, ripping them off by giving them useless content(commanders with no new things, skins, and cosmetic things) and then forced them to buy the pay2win content to enjoy the game.Last of all, singleplayer. Singleplayer has been heavily critcized for it's immense unhistorical way of portarying the soviets; and many players were absolutely livid about this(check the metascore). The campaign tells a terrible story and portrays the soviets as people who kill everyone they meet, including half their own army. The ending doesn't make any sense either.To conclude, all aspects of this game are complete rubbish and I fiercely do not reccomend buying this game.			"

												With the amount of awesome stuff in this game to write about , i'm not even sure where to start! While i wait for a game to be found with the match making system , i can write a review until it sends me into my favourite mode (only) VP round. Compared to the first game , coh2 does not really do anything for me personally due to  the fact that DLC has killed it turning it into a pay to win , AI / pathing in this game also never cease to amaze me with such examples as your tank driving backwards towards an enemy making sure to expose its lovely♥♥♥♥♥♥to then completely ignore the main threat and shoot a single passing conscript.Input lag is also more noticeable with some units remaining stationary as they burn to death and retreat at the last possible moment , most times they don't even retreat because ♥♥♥♥ it , it's -41 on the eastern front. I also do enjoy the moments of waiting whilst some guy lags out the entire game resulting in you being kicked , so prepare to watch units drive around in circles (if you are lucky) and die alot with the occasional good luck kick.Campaign was nothing too great but wasn't bad either , can't really fault it , ToW is just the same thing over with different locations and scenarios and even that isn't good , a huge disappointment being the , Tiger Ace mission which is nothing  compared to the original.Wrapping this up , i think most people who were avid Coh 1 players will find this game to be very poor and lacking. As most reviews point out , you might want to spend some cash to enjoy a game in all its single mode only Victory point fun.			"

Post-British update 04/10/15:A solid faction to bring some variety to this stale game. Once the novelty wears off you realize the state of the multiplayer might be the worst it has ever been.Basic functionality remains a mess. Game has been severely unoptimized since original release and post-expansion crashes are more frequent than before. Memory leak problems remain, micro-freezes/lag spikes unfixed (from 2-3 seconds every few minutes to up to 6 seconds now). Main menu capped at 30fps but sinks down to single digits after first game. During gameplay framerates are usually solid, but every now and then performance suddenly dies when loading into a new game.Company of Heroes 2 is the UPlay of RTS games. Would you recommend UPlay to anyone ? No, I wouldn't either.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Grief, misery and frustration are some of the core elements present when dealing with the online experience in Company of Heroes 2. They do come without an additional price tag, unlike so many, many other things in this game.CoH 2 is a prime example of the DLC craze.This is the current breakdown of DLC content for the game:Theater of War additional mission packs - 20€Faceplates (cosmetic)                             - 8€Vehicle camos (cosmetic)                       - 92€DLC Commanders                                   - 59,5€That is a base game of 35€ + an additional 179,5€ worth of possible DLC content.Now of course, cosmetic stuff is a non-issue, but the DLC commanders include several important units, otherwise unavailable in the game (and more commanders are already on the way).DLC and minor unit design annoyances aside, now a year after release, the game is still plagued with drophacking, sync-errors and constant p2p lag, turning wins into losses and once playful and happy kids into soulless empty vessels, longing for justice.The familiar Company of Heroes gameplay experience is there with good sound design, decent visuals and ok maps, though leaving us wanting some great elements from vCoH like night and rain.I can only recommend this game to the brave and most loyal CoH/RTS fans who can stay hopeful for the future and understand, that skill only gets you half way to victory.

												I have owned this game for a few weeks now, and unless you can buy this at a significant discount ($15 or less), my recommendation is to NOT buy it.Reasons:- In addition to the $40 (or $80 for a version that already contains some DLC) for the game, they offer you all kinds of DLC (downloadable content) that should have been part of the game in the first place, and was released on the same day as the game itself. Lots of little extras that add up to more money than you paid for the original game. Some of them are useless and expensive (skins for $3 a pop), some give unfair advantages to players that are willing to pay to win.- short, boring campaign that is Russians only. I bet there will be DLC to add a German and other Allied campaigns in the future- in games where humans play vs. the computer, RELIC made the computer cheat in order to win. All kinds of treads on different discussion forums point to several ways that the computer cheats to win, making it extremely frustrating to play even in standard difficulty (which is the 2nd easiest of four levels available). Cheating includes advantages in resources, advantages in damage and hits taken by units, ignoring the fog of war, etc. It simply NOT FUN to play against the computer, since it will eventually overwhelm the human players. Every time. Without fail.- even though this game got really good reviews from the ""professionals"" (magazines, review websites), it is overwhelmingly criticized by the actual players who had to pay to be able to play (vs reviewers who get the game for free). Check out the user reviews here: http://www.metacritic.com. Overwhelmingly negative reviews.- atrocious pathfinding for your units. You will lose many battles and units because the AI will waste time getting the units where they need to go, or get them stuck somewhere on the way.- Game camera is zoomed really far in and cannot be zoomed out far enough to see more of what's going on on the screen. You can zoom in to a very low level of detail though, which is USELESS.- Units will wait to be slaughtered instead of turning to fight the enemy. Machine guns and anti tank gun crews will not move their weapon to face the enemy and get annihilated within seconds while you micromanage every unit to do basic things they should do automatically. Given that you cannot see most of your units due to the ridiculous zoom level, they will die before you get a chance to adjust their firing angle.I could go on, but you can see why this game is not worth $60 PLUS ridiculous amounts of money for DLC, which can easily push you to $100+ for a poorly designed game that offers almost nothing over the brilliant Company of Heroes 1. I own four copies of CoH1 to play on multiple computers with friends. I wish I could return this copy of CoH2 because it's a thoroughly frustrating disappointment on many levels, with regards to content, AI, game code optimization, graphics, etc.PASS on this one.			"

												Really disappointed with this game. I loved the first 3 CoH games, but this one feels like they gutted it in order to create a lot of extra revenue with DLC. I don't have a problem with publishers trying to generate more revenue by tacking on DLC, but in this case it feels like they built the game, and then the bean counters came through and chopped out large chunks and set them aside for DLC. I suppose if I purchased all of the DLC it would be more enjoyable, but I'm not willing to pay all the extra money for sections of the game that should have been included from the start.I'm also not fond of the RPG element tacked on via the customization you can do with your Generals. It just doesn't fit very well in this game, in my opinion. I don't like spending a bunch of time browsing through dozens of generals just to gain an extra 2% HMG penetration or crit chance or whatever. I guess maybe it works out well for the PvP crowd but to me it's just a pain in the butt.			"

												DO NOT BUY ANY PART OF THE GAME UNLESS 80% OFF!So I bought CoH 2 full price upon release as a huge fan of CoH 1.  In general I was unimpressed as the graphics looked the same although they ran heavy, and the gameplay felt dumbed down.  A full panel of ""Store"" options made this look like a MMO.  After countless patches, this has improved somewhat.  With only two factions to play, I suspected that an expansion, as in Opposing Fronts for CoH, would add two additional factions.  With the release of Ardenns I recently picked it up thinking that this would allow me access to the additional campaign and multiplayer access to the two additional factions played in that campaign.What an idiot!Apparantly this full priced DLC (as expensive as the game itself) was only the single player campaign.  If you want to play those same factions in multiplayer, you need to purchase them seperatly.  Yes, purchase each faction seperatly.  The fun doesn't stop there.  Do you want to play the iconic rangers of CoH 1 as the American faction, PAY TO WIN by purchasing them seperatly!This is disgraceful.  Do not buy this game unless 80% off, because you will need to purchase all the other core aspects of the game, which they call DLC's, on top of it.			"

Singleplayer CampaignThe anti-USSR message shoved in the player's face during the campaign is insufferable. I play video games to be a part of epic battles, glorious tales of heroism and so on. Not to have a game tell me how to look at the world via the cheapest means possible; practically verging on Homefront levels of lazyness in the propaganda department. Except here the narrative is trying to convince you that you are the bad guy and you should feel bad, because the Soviet Union is bad okay, remember communism is bad, and Stalin is satan and... stuff... SOVIET UNION IS EVIL, REMEMBER THAT PERSON PLAYING THIS GAME. RUSSIANS & COMMUNISMS = BADGeneral StuffThe units aren't anything more interesting than the original's and it feels like there are a few basic roles missing, as if they couldn't be bothered to add more units. More than half the generals are ""premium"" aka you need to buy them. Visually it's hardly up to 2010 standards if even, and there is no shortage of Relic DLC whoring to the point of charging for faceplates.MultiplayerPublic custom lobbies aren't even an option, so if you liked playing Annihilation don't plan on ever playing it with anyone but someone on your friends list. After playing a few auto-matches, so far the Germans have won almost every time. Every single one of those times, their victory could be described by the two simple words: Panther & Tiger. And I've played about an equal number of times as either side, no matter what it's always the same thing. At best the USSR dominates from the start and often gets run over by tanks in the end. After six months I expect far better balance in an RTS game, never mind the lack of any multiplayer options beyond 1v1 to 4v4.It's also plagued by performance problems, as within almost every match there is someone who is ""lagging"" and some matches have even frozen at 00:01 seconds into the game. There have been instances where a little message would come up saying I've been lagging and actually kicked me but given that I have a powerful gaming PC and currently a 59Mbps download, 12Mbps upload, and a ping of 11ms; this is clearly a problem on their end. Again, this is inexcusable after half a year.ConclusionWait until the Deluxe Edition(full version) costs $15 or something, better yet just buy the original Company of Heroes. This game is riddled with performance issues, blatant historical inaccuracies, has a unit/building roster far smaller than the original, and is generally a pitiful excuse for a sequel. If you really want to play as the USSR or have them in CoH in some capacity, there's a mod that adds the Red Army to the original game that can be found HERE.When it comes to the story, they could have easily managed to damn the Soviets without ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on every last person who fought on the eastern front. All they had to do was introduce an element representing the power structure. A single character, a mission or two that doesn't shove a THESE PEOPLE ARE EVIL message in your face constantly that get's the underlying political agenda of the Soviets across. But they didn't bother, they just lazily copied parts of the movie Enemy At The Gates and pasted them into a few missions.For those want an explanation of the campaign's lazy anti-USSR propaganda.

												The people complaining about DLCs are in fact just angry on principle. You don't actually NEED the DLCs. All the content the game comes with is easily enough to win in multiplayer. The DLCs do exactly what DLCs should - give you some more interesting options to play around with when you've played the living *#$% out of the rest of the game.As for the gameplay, multiplayer is quite excellent, primarily because the factions are so interestingly balanced. Germans are by and large easier to play, but once you get to high levels of play, this is no longer an issue. Relic isn't perfect, some unit designs are bad (such as paratroopers), but overall the faction designs are deep and very interesting.If you are so short sighted that you can't possibly enjoy anything that's not a carbon copy of CoH1 then nevermind. But CoH2 is groovy game. 8.5/10			"

This is what Sega have done to Relic.COH2 is the first monstrosity to come out of this, updated with all your 2016 favourites, like microtransactions, broken steam workshop functions, pay to win commanders, horrendous custom game lobby system. As someone who loved COH 1 I am severely disappointed by this game. In the ever driving attempt to make the game more competitive, a huge amount of the 'FUN' element was removed to make way for this.And quite simply this game isn't fun anymore.			"

That's just insane. Basically I get the impression that they started work on this game and sat down to plan and the first thing put up as bullet point one was ""How much can we squeeze the community for with this one guys?"". And the then spent 3 weeks concoting the most mixed up and convoluted method for overcharging yet to be seen on PC.			"

												A grandiose waste of time and money. We have snow now, great. We have a completely messed up interface that leaves me as a COH 1 veteran dumbfounded. We also barely have any advances in graphics or gameplay compared to its predecessor. But hey, I can buy a new style of menu border. Best idea ever. The campaign takes the very worst of Hollywood History and depicts the bloodiest conflict in human history in a way that seems oddly familiar to anyone who has played C&C Red Alert. Except that this game tries to take itself serious. With extra war crimes by evil commies thrown in for fun and profit. Don't expect the slightest hint of historical accuracy. Don't expect a halfway realistic simulation either, like COH 1 was at times. This is an utterly generic RTS with a WW2 setting, dumbed down for supposed mass appeal by ignorants who probably based their research on a handful of awful war movies. Go and play COH 1 instead. Get a mod if you're bored. Avoid this game like the plague, you'll be happier.			"

Or get Men of War but not this and if you do then please dont buy the ridiculous DLC.Some of the new features are nice, truesight is fun and the others are interesting but the blizzard mechanic is just an irritation and they dont make a huge differnce normaly.The campaign is fun it is very cinematic and not supposed to be realistic (although relic claimed it was) its also decent length and makes for a fun time sink and the mission packs are also quite nice mini-campagins however the meat of the game, the multiplayer, is just worse than CoH1.With the addition of the map editor it may get better and i will no doubt go back and play with the editor but not the game it isnt worth it.

												BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE! BUYER BEWARE!  (DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING ARMIES SEPERATELY.... BUY GAME IN FULL AND ON SALE!) I made a moronic decision and spent almost $80 on a game that is constantly on sale for under $10.  They sell the armies seperately for purchase which is kinda a good idea, until you realize that 2 of the factions(Germans and Russians) can not be purchased seperately!  So you could spend $30 on 3 armies, expecting to get other 2 later for around $20....but guess what you have to buy THE ENTIRE GAME to get the other 2 armies.  And the ENTIRE GAME already includes the armies you purchased seperately!  WHY the hell does RELIC trick people into thinkining they can buy this game in pieces?  You can only buy half of it in pieces and when you try to buy the other half you have to buy the entire game which you should have just done in the first place because you would HAVE SAVED $30!  Relic is purposely trying to be deceptive or they are just too damn lazy to release 2 armies seperately! Imagine if Valve released DOTA 2 for $50 and it included 100 characters...now lets say charged $.50 per character.  Now imagine you end up buying 50 characters, then you go to buy your 51rst character and its not available.  Well it turns out that valve only sells half the character seperately and you have to buy the entire game for the rest of the characters!  You buy the game and realize that the game includes all 100 characters!  Valve just tricked you into wasting $25....you spent $75 on a game that is $50.  This is exactly what Relic is doing. I should have done my research and looked into it or waited for a sale like usual, but its just such a fun game.  I loved the original and many more people play this and it has cooler unlockables.  But in comparison to original this game is kinda trash compared to the original though.  Not really trash, its a good game overall...but it has some major issues.  For one its graphics are nearly identical to company of heroes 1 that came out in 2006...but for some odd reason this game runs about 20x worse on 20x more powerful hardware!  Same resolutions and around the same polygoms, only addition is weather effects and some fire effects.  You can run COH1 on a pentium 4 at 700mhz probably, but you will barely get this to run on a 4 core 4ghz processor from a couple years ago!  You also need a pretty beefy graphics card to run it decently and I would actually suggest 16 GIGS OF RAM!  It runs fine on 8, but after a few matches the game will start to slow down because Relic is too lazy to clear the RAM inbetween matches.Its a very fun game though.  Its a fun game because it is pretty much identical to the original...it just runs worse and you cant run over people in tanks.  Definately worth a buy at around $10-$20, just please buy the full game!This game should actually sell for $10 normally and like $2 on sale.  It is simply just a MOD of the original.  I'd imagine it only cost Relic about $20,000 to make the game....they probably wasted the rest of the budget travelling to Europe to do ""research"" about WW2.  Playing the single player game....you can tell they didnt research♥♥♥♥♥♥  They took an American history book from 1958 and a German current events book from 1944...they combined what they learned from the 2 books and this is how they created and depicted the soviet army and their storyline.  It is pretty offensive really....I dont care because I am not Russian.  But if I was Russian I would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...it pretty much depicts every soviet soldier as a coward or psycopath.  They are literally running away or murdering their own civilians for no reason.  The only heroes they depict in this game are the nazis.  So...Story/single player = 0/10Gameplay = 10/10Multiplayer = 9/10Optimization = 0/10Price = .0000000000001/10Overall = Good if you dont play single player and buy entire game for under $10.			"

												I am extremely bitter about my purchase of this game. I was one of the people who pre-ordered the original DCE, and at the time I felt it was a good deal. No longer. They completely shafted the DCE owners, substituting actual extra content in the form of the first 3 ToW packs with worthless skins and commanders. I payed 100 dollars for 12 commanders who bring nothing new, 25 skins of which most are just the same one for heavy, medium, or light vehicls, ONE of the promised 3 ToW DLC, and a faceplate. I have never felt more betrayed by a game company than when I saw how they had changed it. The sheer amount of DLC in this game astounds me, as the base game itself has very little content for a successor to CoH1. I would not recommend this game. It's still fun at times with friends, but nothing can get this bad taste out of my mouth.			"

												Huge disappointment...I am a big fan of the franchise but this watered down addition isn't worth its full price. Campaign missions felt short and offer little to no replay value, with the exception of Tiger Hunting which I found to be the highlight of the campaign.New multiplayer maps are dull and seem to be designed to serve the snow and blizzard mechanics; vast snowfields dotted with bonfires. It fails to compliment the original mechanic of how dynamic maps were meant to be, the beginning of your game could involve skirmishes between a maze of hedgerows and villages and end with battling out in smoldering ruins and craters. Steam workshop could redeem this with CoH 1 maps getting fan-made revivals.The removal of the commander talent trees is what cripples the game most. No longer are the 3 distinct commander choices  that each serve their own playstyle and tactics but now DLC centered commanders that blend into eachother, the same off-map abilities and additional units rearranged and passed off as a seperate commander.The lack of commander variety will mean each game will start to feel like the last. Every game eventually leads to tanks vs tanks, grenadiers and conscripts end up serving no purpose but to rush enemy tanks, disable them with an anti-tank grenade the go capture a point while your tanks pick off the disabled enemy tank. Theatre of War scenarios are a joke, they are simply AI skirmish matches. 1941 scenarios let you play with even FEWER units to choose from. Dont expect to see Stonewall or Panzerkrieg game modes from ToV, they'll probably be DLC down the road (hopefully steam workshop will beat them to it).Company of Heroes 2 does not live up to its predecessor, fewer units, bland maps, mediocre campaign, and the biggest killer   is how the game is now entirely centered around DLC. I'm sad to see my favourite RTS get strangled by the DLC demon but steam workshop could be its salvation. "

												I feel cheated buying this game on its release date; after paying 59.99 USD I still cannot enjoy the full content of the game I purchased and will have to work on all the achievements for int. bulletins. Also, the sum of cost of DLC commanders/skins is another 59.99 USD. I know its quiet common that game industery uses DLC to jerk money off its customer, but everything should have a limit, and I must say SEGA-relic has breached my limit.May 12th 2015, adding something up:1-The optimization is poor and graphic requirement is ridiculously demanding for what the game demostrates. I can play something like Elder Scroll V with all the mods installed and graphic setting sets to maximum for like 50 or so FPS, but even if I set all setting to minimum in CoH2 I start to lag like hell AFTER the first match, and the only way to fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥up is to restart the game. Updating my driver doesnt help either, everytime I restart the game after the update the warning of ""you are using an outdated driver"" still pops up-- well outdated my A S S, that was fuxking 3 minutes fresh!.2-unit pathfinder is still as broken as it was first released: saw a penal shoveled a 4 secs demopack, tried to pull my infantry away the very instant, the totally healthy and unpinned inf squad roll, crawl, jump, hop, and doing everything but move away from that demo, and BOOM, they were all dead. FUXKING BRILLIANT, RELIC!3-getting repeated commanders and bulletins past 3 from warspoil is stupid, as you cannot trade or combine or do anything with them. Needless to say, that's one thing even paying money wont save you. 4-either buy at 80% off or buy CoH1, offers similar if not same game mechanics but less bug and frustrating moments.Oh, and also, CoH1 doesnt censor your swearing in team chat with sh it s like ""garden"" or ""goodboy"".Relic made a poor game and now they want to take away our rights of swearing, so be it.FUXK YOU SEGA RELIC!

												I still remember, every game i played in COH 1 was a memerable experiance. When i started COH 2, i was surprised by the command tree. Later I realised that, more commands are available as DLC. When i was about to invest on them, i tought 'why should I invest on such an unbalanced  game' . C'mon SEGA, you've made very bad choices. You've turned a game with 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews into game with 'mostly positive' reviews. Even DOTA has ' very positive' review and not 'overwhelmingly positive'. I believe that excessive DLCs and P2W features are major culprits. When i started COH 2, i was in a feeling that i'm very bad at this game. When i realised that one could buy 'OP' commanders and have strategic  advantage, i felt so bad!Just imagine, if COH 2 was like COH 1+ balances - P2W -too many DLCs, this can easily beat MOBAs like DOTA or atleast come near to them in ESL. You could in turn make lot of money in that way Just like CS:GO. Moderate price, proper patches, no p2w element will surely take this game to next level. This game has such a potential. After spending 3k hrs on Dota2 (that's not much, i know), i still feel the pleasure in playing coh but not as much as before.Please SAGA, learn your lessons and bring back the glory of COH. I bet you, this one will rule ESL once it gets the desired popularity which can be acheived by doing as i said above.Hope you'll undertand your mistake and this review is not meant to hurt anyone.

												This game is neither a worthy follow on from COH or a realistic WWII strategic simulation.  It’s a vulgar imitation of strategy that is designed to entice the player to buy DLC.  That is to say that everything is flashy and pretty but is made to be destroyed in no time.  No one unit has any worth and you will feel like you are just producing AOEII pikemen the whole time.“So your units aren’t holding their own?  Buy the new commander he’s got better units.” COD meets COH. "

I've spent so many hours playing this game, I've purchased DLC for it and it was such a waste of money and time. This game is fine as a standalone, but if you want a complete game don't buy it, because they expect you to pay over $100 for a ""finished game""			"

Then you can buy all the DLCs, so you can keep this horrible game able to birth another monstrosity. Weak graphics, predictable AI and boring, boring, boring gameplay, this game is not a good buy.

												I will first start off by saying: Don't buy this game at the $10+ price.  Wait for it to be really cheap, by cheap I mean past the $10.00 count.  It's sad to see a sequel to a game take a turn for the worse.  With all the advertising going into it's launch, the public discussions from developers about the mechanics and unique game play and art.  All that pales in comparision to the majority of the games main feature: Multiplayer.This is the frist time (and hopefully last time) I've ever heard of or seen an RTS game require pay to play in it's multiplayer function.  I have never heard of such a thing.  I expect the P2P from an MMO, that's understandable for server maintenance and other specs.  But to give P2P gamers an advantage over F2P gamers is not only an unfair advantage, it's an insult to both the game and the community.  I remember when Relic made amazing RTS style titles.  The most memorable for me were Home World, Home World 2, Dawn of War, Dawn of War: Darck Crusade and Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior.  As well as the original Company of Heroes 1.  So it truly breaks me heart and destroys my faith in a company that would take such an approach to their fans and the community for the multiplayer approach.  Aside from the unbalance approach of P2P vs F2P.  The units lack any proper A.I. responses to the heat of battle.  This involves, tank movement away from heavy fighting, moving troops away from grenades before they're thrown and the attack response time for squads when a target is sighted.The Campaign itself follows the Russian point of view.  Playing out as a flash back.  I won't give any spoilers, but I was hoping for a bit more time in game play.Now while the use of a snow and ice environment is a unique and well thought out tactic for the game, such as damaging lakes of ice, areas of belwo Zero to freeze troops and so on.  These fetures don't really make up for the major problems of the game itself.  While I admire Relic's attempt too try a fresh take on the U.I. it feels more complex and difficult to master, especially when in the heat of battle when you feel RUSHED to get something built or try using a squad ability.  Again I would say DO NOT BUY unless it drops beyond the $10 price range.  Instead look for the original COH and it's expansions.  Company of Heroes 2, sadly, does not live up to its predecessor.			"

												Coming from an old Company of Heroes player who has experienced all expansions from the original, CoH2 was a let down to me. The innovation is lacking, which wouldn't have bothered me if they got the core mechanics right. Optimization is mind numbingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the connectivity issues galore. The new winter addition and fire mechanic feels like a gimmicky addition that could certainly been added to CoH1. I dare not speak of the campaign which is meh, but if you are a particular history savant and happen to like Russia, skip the campaign. I'd give it a 5/10. Would be 6 if it wasnt for the micro transactions from day one in a full priced AAA game.			"

The commanders in this game give it a grander feel than limiting each faction to only 3 commanders. Graphics are well done. One of my favorite RTS games.			"

												Another ""complete game"" oriented to rob you during massive DLC production, it wasn't bad at the gameplay part at all, but it's the only good part in this game for me. And there is something special for the most of people lived in USSR, the part making all of us delete this sh!t and never play it again - perverted history and demonisation of USSR during the ingame company, so ""normal"" this days. We had a billions of our people died there, defending our country and whole Europe: our fathers, mothers, brothers and systers, a lot of them died at war and in german concetration camps, during torchuring and other sadistic actions. I had a grandfather and grandmother who saw all as it really was there... And what do we see here? Some bunch of fuc**rs showing us USSR as super r3tarded and vicious power, which didn't even care about it's own people. Suckers don't even care who made most of work in WWII and taken most of the German agression according to the simple western plans - collide USSR and Germany, let them kill each other as many as they can, while western world were passively looking and waiting, especially USA, waiting for the end to join club of the winners (they totally deserved ""Pearl Harbor"" for this). Why they don't making game about amount of casualties US had in short time they were acting in WWII, because they were bigger than some of western giants lost during all years of war, isn't it r3tarded, especially when Germany were loosing all it's positions and were demoralised? Or maybe we should make a game where Japanese making fun during Chinese genocide as it was sometime ago? No, because it's unethical, no one making games where US sucked hard in Vietnam napalming villages and jungles, killing people without weapons and the simillar sh!t.So when we are meeting political order - we are loosing the game, that's what we lost here.PS Metascore rating is escecially sick - some of their ratings are really hard to understand, maybe those guys making it for money sometimes, who knows... So 80 - what for?			"

												A worthy successor to Company of Heroes, the penultimate tactical RTS (after the Men of War series), that improves on unit variety, core mechanics, and graphics. Company of Heroes 2 is not a flawless release, suffering from early balance issues, but undoubtedly deserves the large amount of critical acclaim it has received. Company of Heroes 2 releases with 2 factions, the Germans and the Soviets. Fans of the original will be comfortable with the teching paths, veterancy, unit selection, and gameplay mechanics. All of these have been tweaked in one way or another, but all are well crafted, mostly intuitive, and largely balanced. Most welcome is the contiuance of directional cover and complex damage and accuracy mechanics from the original. Every bullet that leaves a rifle or tank shell that leaves a cannon has a complex series of calculations behind it that influence accuracy, penetration, and damage. A tank shell fired at another tank could miss, miss but still hit something, hit but not penetrate, hit and penetrate, or hit and penetrate with some critical damage. Everything from range, movement, cover, angle of armor, and more is included as variables in these calculations. These complex mechanics make Company of Heroes more than just a game of numbers, but a game of tactical placement of units and appropriate application of firepower that stresses the importance of flanking and misdirection.In the end, Company of Heroes 2 is a game that released in solid form and has potential to grow even better in the months and years to come. The solid framework of the original was kept and improved upon, while the developers spent a substantial amount of time making the game beautiful in its violent craft. If Relic can continue making timely and moderately aggressive balance patches, this will be a highlight chapter in the RTS annals for years to come.  "

												First of all I am coming from over 200 maybe 300 hours of Blitzkrieg (for reference search for ""Nival Blitzkrieg""), so I am kinda picky in terms of WWII-RTS and even the first CoH was merely ""meh"" in my book.Yeah it had its moments but overall it was a game I felt lacking in terms of real strategy and tactics and it felt more like a StarCraft in WWII then a real tactical experience.And now we have CoH2 which seems to focus more on competitive gameplay (you can link a Twitch-account for streaming and the whole menu seems to focus on online-play)StoryFelt kinda wrong. Yeah sure it was bad how many people died during WWII on the battlefields but why do I have a commander who complains about the methods of the sovjet army when I`m free to send gajillions of conscripts to death without him complaining. So the whole ""soldier finds his conciousness seems false but never failed to bore me throughout the whole campaign. The missions themselves were actually pretty god and had variety. And then we have ""Theater of War"". Instead of giving us DLCs/Expansions with seperate campaigns we get watered downed Multiplayer-Skirmishes and single missions..pretty weak in my opinion. 4/10GraphicYay the engine is more stable now! While I had to turn off some features in Coh1 because they were too demanding, I can play the game here with better graphics and greater stability. No crashes, no bugs. Very good. It seems atleast some developers actually improve stuff in later installments (Looking at you DICE). Graphic looks gorgous, especially during blizzards etc.9/10 GameplayFeels unbalanced and arkward, atleast for me. In the few scenarios I played I could almost every time surrender when the Sovjets had KV-1s on the field, cause Paks don`t do♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game. I don`t think the game is balanced well, but maybe it has to be that way online. It just feels wrong to assault a Pak with a Tank and win.And why did they removed the DMG values? Now it just says ""Effective against BlablaBla"" instead of showing me how well it does against certain types of units. It was more of trial and error and the yellow texts could also read ""This is tank, it has treads and shoots boom""4/10So and now a personal note. Why 3 DLCs á almost 20€ + the possibility to pay for skins? For effing mothertrucking skins which are 2€ each. It is not as outrageous as other games but still. This is wrongPlus the bulletin stuff you unlock by playing the game. So player who play the game for longer have an advantage over others, even if it is not significant but still. This is not okayFinal verdict. 5/10Beside the graphics and some nice campaign moments it had nothing really to offer for me (Not interested in online, and it seems the focus was on that this time) Was nice to try out for a weekend, but nothing I would pay for. In my book the first one is better			"

												I don't know if I should love this game or hate it. The gameplay is fun but its not realistic.The cameras toggle ability is too low. It feels like reading a book with an eye-book distance of 5 cm. So you can read a sentence but you can't overlook a page. The beauty of the game is still there and it conveys the atmosphere very nicely. You pay money for the game and you still need to purchase skins and commanders. My outrage about this in the comment section below. Luckily there is now ingame money. So it doesn't hurt as much but playing for getting ingame money to get new content to get fun isn't the way I wanna be treated when I buy a game on launch.Balance problems and unfair mach making are a nuisance or a challange. However you wanna see it. The community is ok and the workshop is packed with a lot of good content. The Level editor is more fun then the game itself in my opinion.In short this game is something for masochists. The game is like your exgirlfriend. You know she's gonna hurt you everytime but you come back again and again anyway.			"

												sega only looks for emptying youre pockets. They dont care apperently for the players. If they can rip you of they will.I preorderd Coh2, wat do we get in return for that. A slap in the face. They sell the preorderd version in stores at the same price after the release, so  u have a actual dvd. + all the the extra's people got for preordering. But the preorders only got a download on steam and no actual dvd. So, again money in the pocket for sega. An other example, a friend of mine has this game to, i bought the case blue package way before him, he bought it recently. Since i bought the case bleu dlc sega updated this dlc with some extra commanders, which is nice, but i didnt get those and if i want them i need to buy again the bleu case dlc at about 11€ when i already payd about 8€ for the previous one or i can buy the 2 extra commanders for about 4€ a piece so that makes about 8€ for 2 commanders and no option to upgrade my case blue dlc for a descent price. + they sell alot of other commanders at about 4€ instead of selling them in one package, let alone the other stuff they sell for pretty high price's (camo, faceplates, ....).  sega dustnt want our money, they want our whole wallet. If i could i would shovel my collectors edition badge up to there asses and put my foot so hard in their nuts that their nuts dengling out of their mouths.If u want to get ripped of, buy this game.  Al the people that preorded coh2 should come together and sue their asses for selling crap. If THQ still had Coh2 this all was not needed to wright, i'm sure of that. So f*ck u sega, i hope people pirate all youre games so mutch that u never make a profit. Scammers that u are.			"

 I'm conflicted as whether to reccommend this game and I'll tell you why. The reason is that it's not as good as it's predecessor Company of Heroes. The gameplay is solid, it's fun, it can get anger inducingly annoying but that's mostly due to human error. The maps are great, but not as great or as memorable as the Company of Heroes maps. I can name a dozen maps from CoH off the top of my head easily but when it comes to CoH2 I start to struggle. They're pretty generic and I feel it's because Relic couldn't just remake the old maps again and attempted to make new maps which were more generic and more samey than the CoH maps. The snow really grinds my gears, I avoid snow maps as I would the bubonic plague or mosquitos. They're anti fun and really dampen the mood during an intense game. The tanks however are improved I feel. The sides you can choose feel more balanced too. The new commander addition to the game isn't as good as the doctrine/company choice of the last game. They are all too similar whereas in the last game there were real differences such as the stark comparison between Airbone company and Ranger company. Each of those had their own strength and weakness and counter picking was a lot more important then. The online lobby is improved however I do miss one feature, the feature to tick up.Overall, Company of Heroes 2 on its own is a good game and would be worth a purchase. However since CoH is cheaper and superior I can't reccomend it over that, and thus I've decided to not reccomend this game.			"

												Though a very fun game, the multiplayer scene is dominated by DLC ""Commanders"" that make it unfair. Balanced or not, it's just unfair to go up against opponents that have paid for a bombing strike, or a massive tank that force you to change the way you play. COH1 had a winning formula and was the better game. Most my time on this has gone into me and a buddy playing against AI, for that I recommend it. For competitive multiplayer, I do not.			"

												Not realy your classic RTS formula, resources gather automatic no need for harvesting, but they can be increased by capturing points and building resource points. Units can reinforce if close to a reinforcement point, lil like the wh40k unit system. Besides that unit variety: a lot. Even more with custom mods. Campaign ya well, wish there was also a German campaign but overall it's decent. Additional campaign with Ardennes offence wich is also pretty decent. Game can crash sometimes when loading the after match report but that doesnt happen too often. If you've played CoH1 then this one will not dissapoint, except maybe for the great ammount of dlc for sale (also mods for that lol). Online players are usualy friendly and most of the time u will have an enjoyable match, of course u will also encounter the few unpleasant exceptions to that. Good thing also: theatre of war, custom missions that can be played solo or coop. Only downside for me is the loot system wich is pretty much random play for 10 min or play for an hour, win or lose u never know when the loot is going to be coming your way. Difficulty: easy (real easy) the ai doesnt even move unless you strike first, normal the ai only moves when you capture a point, hard the ai comes for all your base, and fast, expert u need to be faster then the ai with everything because otherwise f*ckin forget about it, u dead. So would say difficulty is well done.Advice: vanilla (standard) is maybe  not the best experience but with some custom skins and tuning packs its well worth it.			"

												           Company of heroes 2 is one of those games based on world war 2 that really makes you think about the situations created during WW2 and after by giving a indepth expierience on the battlefields of europe. The expansions are a little pricy but they go on sale almost every other week, and i recommend if you do buy this game that you get the add ons. Being a WW2 buff i fell in love with this game the dame i bought and almost got on one knee when i bought the expansion for the battle of the bulge.        For the base game you get to play as either the Wermacht (german army 193? - 1944) or as the Soviet army in all its glory. For starters every weapon and unit that bose sides posses is EXTREMELY accurate with historical means. As The germans you can construct basic pill boxes and sand bag lines.While the russians only make sand bag lines but make for this by having larger squads of troops.        Thats another thing as well. If you play as the germans you have better trained squads and units but they are in small numbers and rather pricy to be relevent with germany's army size and production capabilities, but thats the boring old infantry side. Now lets jump to germany's incredibly advanced vehicles which range from thier basic mg32 mounted patrol cars to the mighty Tiger Tank from the later stages of the war. The vehicles are your strong point as the germans where you can easily overwhelm the Soviets tanks, but keep in mind the german tanks are rather expensive and slow if you're working with the larger models.        The Soviets on the other hand are capable of building massive infantry and Tank based armies with thier larger troop count per sqaud and cheaper tanks. This is only hindered by the lack of sheer armor on thier tanks in comparison to the germans. Another determining factor for victory for the Soviets is the T-34 medium tank wich is both cheap and fast. Its 76mm cannon is powerful as well, but when faced against heavy armor its not very effective.       That covers the general game so far as id like to rant on about, but now ill og into detail on the campaign expansions where you play as the americans on the ardennes assault. This game also made me realized how royally screwed our ground forces could have been if it wasnt for hitlers incompitance in the later part of the war. As the americans you get rellativly large squuads of troops and vehicles. Namely the Stewart light tank and the M4A3E8 Sherman Bulldozer tank. another great vehicle for dealing with the new german faction The Ober Commandos (Rommels forces) is the M10 tank destroyer which is almost your only method of dealing with tigers because its the only american tank with a powerful enough gun to pierce its armor without the use of dangerous tactics. Back to the troops as the americans you actaully have 3 choices to play. You can play as the infamous Airborne whci lack general utility but make up for in rapid deployment, The armored division which by far is the heaviest of the three in tanks, and finally the U.S. Army rangers the most skilled and infantry focused goup that excells in making your enmey hurt when they least expect it.           Now you're enemy the Ober Commandos are as powerful as its gonna get. They start off with no base because they follow Blitzcrieg(Lightning War). Instead you call in support trucks that convert into buildings with various abilities and troop selection available. As the Ober Commandos you get access to the most terrifying tanks of WW2. The mighty Tiger II and the feared Panther. Both tanks apeared late in the war but had oustanding success little to late to win the war for germany. These tanks have no equal on the battlefield and require your opponent to devise stradigies just to deal with them alone. this alongside of airsupport and large numbers of troops makes the Ober commandos a force to be respected and feared, but enough of me ranting PLAY THIS GAME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SOLDIER!!!

												They tried to make COH into Dawn of War II. It didn't work. They should have left it more like the original and concentrated on innovating the AI instead of making an Arcade WWII RTS. Shame they missed so badly with this one. All visuals and no staying power. MP is unbalanced and the mp DLC adds nothing worthwhile. There's not much to recommend here except picking it up on sale to play the campaign.Doesn't stand up to its dated predecessor as the stronger title it ought to be.			"

												Having loved CoH the first version I thought I would take advantage of the free play weekend.As many others may have done, we have eagerly awaited a sequel to what in many people’s minds was, and still is a brilliant game. Brilliant, I thought, I can try for CoH2 for free. Oddly I was reminded of the days of old when we would buy a PC magazine with a CD attached, we  could go home and install it, play the game demo, and away you go you would either want more or you would leave it. Anyway, I digress.I downloaded the game etc etc. Clicked start and was immediately struck by the superficiality and lack of real depth. We are hit with a simple cinematic (perhaps this is a stripped Steam version I may need correction here) and bang we are in, no real atmosphere or scene was set in contrast to the quasi story personalised as in the original CoH. To immerse yourself fully you have to have some prior knowledge of this conflict to really appreciate the fundamental change in tactic that goes hand in hand that is required by the player to understand this expansion. In sum sacrifice is the mode of the day.  As another reviewer aptly summarises; the days of CoH allowing for an individual approach to gameplay such as defend, or inch by inch ground gains are gone in this release, hence the flavour of individual gameplay so loved in the original is overbearingly crushed by the mechanics of this expansion. Whilst trying to capture the spirit of expendability synonymous with the military approach of the time, little consideration was (supposedly) given to impact this may have on gameplay when transposing this approach to a RTS platform.However, at $16.99 on steam free play weekend you would think it would be a steal, considering the relative time between its release and now right? Wrong, very wrong. Please do not get caught by this as it is as close to a legal scam as you will get. Yes, I mean DLC, and there is lots of it.I'm sorry, even at the budget price of $17 there is no way I am touching this game, even with the deep affection I have for the first one. I really feel Sega and Relic are hoping to cash in on an emotional attachment that many of us have for the first game. One reviewer mentioned a bait and switch scam, which I have to agree with as that is what I might feel caught by if I buy into this DLC horror. "

												Good at first, then sank in the realisation that this game is extremely repetitive in strategy if you want to win, and is an empty shell compared to its predecessor. I was very disappointed at the lack of defensive structures in the game, since I enjoy fortifying strategic points. I was also disappointed at the lack of units such as recon motorcycles etc. and honestly thought they were going to add more units/structures down the line, but they haven't. There's alot of reasons why this sucks, but lets just say I prefer to play the original COH when in the mood for some WW2 RTS, rather than this 30% Game 70% DLC abomination.			"

												Pros:+ Gameplay;+ Graphics;Cons:+ Ridiculous storyline;+ Mockery of the Soviet & German Armies.The technical part of the game is great. Recommend it for the multiplayer / skirmish, but for all that is holy - don't try out the campain if you value your sanity =)A ""tragic"" (read - stupid) tale of some officer sent to the Dreaded Penal Batallion by an Evil & Incompetent Comissar. Cliche, really, made all the more annoying by the way this traitor to the Motherland shows us the Sinister Truth About War, painting in♥♥♥♥♥♥the defenders of Stalingrad & Leningrad and the participants of other major theatres of war.Slightly redeeming part of the story (so it seemed at the beginning) was that is encompassed not only the usual Stalingrad, but also many more fronts and battles. But the way the Red Army and Wermacht are pictured... damn. Just damn =(In essence, it is a typical uneducated outlook on the war, formed by american propaganda cartoons, with little to no concessions to reality. A shame =(			"

												Probably my fav WW2 RTS ever thanks to the intensive multiplayer, immersive sound and graphics and interesting loadout/commander system that allows you to tailor your playstyle the way you like which is quite unusual for RTS games normally.This game can be really enjoyable if you give it time to learn its mechanics and unusual metas, though i do recommend that you play it with friends since that increases the fun factor drastically.Only complaints i have about it is the questionable balance (you unfortunatly gotta play in certain ways in order to achieve success since everything is not viable nor are some factions rationally designed to begin with, but nevertheless ive found alot of success in experimenting with commanders and unit build orders You just gotta make sure you fill every role with your builds, AT and AI.)Another complaint is the ingame store, although the commanders are the only DLC that matter, its a bit sad that it had to go this way with paid commanders for 2-5 euro each. Although i can see why it happened since Relic doesnt make a whole lot of money due to the coh 2 sorta failing to appeal to the majority of its fanbase and RTS market alike. So personally i do not mind paying for commanders in order to help Relic and keep this game alive since i love it.			"

												Not really worth the money. Graphics are good, but if you're into non-competitive gameplay, this is not the game for you. Ive been playing hundreds of hours CoH/OF/ToV, especially since the Blitzkrieg mod is available. So heres what really pisses me off about CoH2:No Mod Support. They do have implemented Steam Workshop for missions, but the most important things they forgot. How are we supposed to enjoy beautifully built custom modifications like blitzkrieg or eastern front, when the developers work actively to prohibit such developments?-DLCS: too many of them, with mostly no more content than a camo pattern or a commander. Those things are supposed to be in the game already, how can you possibly ask for more money?-Maps are too small.-Population cap is 100 only (unless it is on one of the workshop maps, if it is set in the map)You want large fights, with multiple machine gun squads, assault troops, pioneers, field artillery and whole tank platoons simultaneously? not in this game.-Diversity of Units: Panzer IV, Tiger. maybe a stug III. thats all you get when playing germans. with blitzkrieg there's different versions of the Panzer IV, Marders, Hetzers, Jagdpanzers, light Tanks like the Hotchkiss. -Zoom: Like to zoom out to get a good overview over the battlefield? Not in this game-Command trees / Skill trees: You like having the decision on what to get next to have the right thing for your next encounter. Well, heres the thing. The skill trees of CoH2 are just trunks - no branches. you get 5 or 6 abilities and/or units and thats it. and you get it in the order the developers intended to. You only decide which commander to choose. Do I need to cite Blitzkrieg mod again?-Deadlyness of weapons: Can you imagine a machine gun shooting at a group of infantry right in front of it, in the open, and not killing any of them for 10 minutes? Hell, this game helps you out. You dont even have to imagine it, its right there. When you want to kill infantry´, use mortars or flame throwers. You dont need rifles, they do♥♥♥♥♥♥ all of them.But, there's something positive about this game:-Possibly well balanced for esports leagues (I dont do esports, so who knows).-WW2 Theme			"

												The perfect game to play if you want to experience the joy of having infantrymen who are made of porcelain despite being in heavy cover, whereas your enemy is able to eat bullets for breakfast in an open field and live, happily murdering every single last one of you.This would be fine if you had more men than him. You don't. Every single match I've played, the Germans have been able to outnumber me, even despite initial territory gains. They also get tanks before me because their huge doommobs of infantry and MGs are able to take every single point on the map, depriving me of fuel. And I wasn't charging across fields, either - I have had German grenadiers kill two squads of conscript infantry in heavy cover with every advantage available to them. This game just doesn't make any sense.In fact, I tested this - I went and played a match versus a Standard AI, cranked out nothing but conscripts, captured every single bit of territory I could, and the Germans still had more men than I did in the early game and chewed me up and spat me out, given their units were more numerous and just plain better in every way.I don't know what this game is smoking. Germans better than Russians at mass attacks? T-34s that cannot go head to head with the Panzer 4, not even slightly? What in Marx's name were they thinking?TL;DR: The side balancing for this game is lopsided, makes no sense, and makes the entire game thoroughly and entirely unenjoyable compared to the first one. Give it a pass.			"

												Yes i still play this game, and probably will for a little while just because theres simply no real rts alternatives.  I do have over 200 hours into the game which shows that its got at least some appeal to it, but my overall experiance has left me swearing more often then not, and i have to acknowledge that the game really is a waste of time overall.Unit response is so sluggish your units die unneccessarily (and seemingly wait until death is assured), units can magically go into 'miss mode' where you can have 5 tanks shooting at one that is at 5% health that doesnt die no matter how many shots are fired, or unit pathing that really seems to be doing its level best to get your units killed and goes anywhere but where you want, seems to go straight at the enemies needlessly, and exposes units backsides for no reason at all.  Tanks far too frequently need to stop completely and then completele their turns which has a tendency to get them killed. edit: and with the new tank pathing its even worse, and this is honestly the most unresponsive rts (and maybe game of any kind) in history.  It simply doesnt take commands at certain points or does the worst thing it possibly could when it FINALLY does (like deciding to go in reverse everywhere, which was supposed to be the point of the fix, but they made it even worse somehow).  I wish i was exaggeratting but coh is simply record breaking in how bad units respond or their pathing.  It really unbelievable in scale.Then there are only 2 factions, and those 2 factions are not balanced very well, and even if they were there are too many one shot kill weapons or things that can destroy your army in a single click which in my opinion goes against everything rts stands for as the enemy cant dodge this attack (see the aforementioned unit response sluggishness) and has no real defense against it except using cheese back on the enemy in turn.Player stats and much statistics are limited to missing altogether, and they keep removing more information about other players with every patch.  Also this game is THE camping/turtling rts, which is widely regarded as the realm for noobs anyways.Overall if your desperate for rts in this day and age and HAVE to have your fix and you can find this one sale for $5 then go for it, but overall its a pos and a monument to the failure of the modern video game industry.  Heck even coh 1 seemed like it had more going for it then this game, and you can find mods for it still and people to play against.Oh and last but not least (altho not limited to, there are certainly other things to gripe about in this game) this is a borderline pay to win game.  If you dont have the pay commanders, prepare yourself to always be at a MAJOR disadvantage.Really wish this wasnt the only real rts alternative today, and its a bit of a metaphor that relic went under after making it.  Honestly the more i play the i wonder why i havent uninstalled it yet, but a few  weeks later i will be missing standard rts.			"

												Well this game looking at it SOLO is quite a nice game. But, being a big fan of Relic Games, and being playing them since i was teen, kind of means i know what they have done in there past success's. That said, I've managed to rack up over 6000 hours on COH, sadly this was even before steam took part with COH, so my steam account doesnt show this information, but since having steam it shows currently only 1600 hours. But anyway, as for COH2. I've only put in 600 hours, and this includes the time in BETA, as i have the Collectors edition, also when it was on the pre order stuff, i managed toget 10 others players to aquire the game, to help THQ threw what ever the mess it was in, All this said. After COH2 arrived on release, it was nice game. but always missing something.  Slowly after each patch the game has been getting more OUT of BALANCE, and even so bad that you can only now obtain no more than 5 tanks in your army. They current publishers are really nerfing the game so its unplayable. So much so, that i stopped playing it, And after hearing about the new Expansion, i got to thinking i should give them another try, Well here i am writing this review, and in even more disgust, i assure SEGA/RELIC. that you can definatly count me out, and i will NOT be recommending this GAME to Anyone.  I even think its made COH seems sad to play now.  If you  do want to buy this game. the only thing i can say thats nice, is if you didnt have the past versions. you might manage to make this fun, and maybe you will get 200 hours out of it before uninstalling. GL all. Happy Gaming.			"

												Stick with COH1 with Blitzkrieg Mod.  Not only does that mod have more units but plays as you would expect.  COH2 feels like a stripped down version of COH1 with game play mechanics that don't add any enjoyment.  The addition of paid skins and microtransactions makes it feel like a free-to-play game.  Also ran into my fare share of bugs on Win7 64bit.  While the graphics are nice, it is difficult to see units and tell what is going on at times.  Disappointed and recommend a pass.			"

But when I heard that RELIC Entertainment had done with single player company I was shoked. It looks like developers are schoolboys who missed their history lessons. Yes, there were special squads named ""Zagradotryadi"", who shot retreating cowards, but in CoH 2 Soviet soldiers are shown as murders. There wasn't any soldier in our country, who would shoot civilians. Armenians, Russians, Dagestani, Ukrainians, Belorussians-it was soviet people's war. Soviet soldiers were brave, there were a lot of feats of Soviet Army soldiers. I'm proud of my country and of it's history. To make a long story short, I wish Relic entertainment to finish their homework, go to sleep and NEVER TRY TO DO HISTORICAL GAMES WITHOUT KNOWING THE HISTORY.			"

												To say that CoH2 is ""Balanced"" is equivalent to saying that Hannibal loved the Romans. It's simply wrong on many levels due to many facts and evidence which states otherwise. Forget the ""need"" of flanking and pinning when your enemy can simply spam a huge amount of MG's and Anti-Tank guns in less than 10 minutes. And watch as an extremely cheap tactics and spams by the enemy causes a slew of insults from your ""teammates"", each saying that the other is OP.Also, money-grabbing DLC nonsense which range from Commanders who have access to unique and sometimes absurdly powerful/situational units like the Soviet IS tanks or Assault Grenadiers which cost USD $4 PER COMMANDER (Yes, not a bundle) to useless and sometimes neglible War Spoils system to the stupidly placed Intelligence Bulletin, Faceplate and army skins which all seems like a desperate attempt to make it look unique. In a nutshell, Relic's post-release business practices with this game is abhorring.In short, CoH2 is a step down from it's predecessor. It had so many potential in being one of the few if not only games that could capture the unsung heroes of the Soviets during the Eastern Front but failed miserably when Relic lost its way and followed other Companies with their DLC BS and Weekly Updates which frankly, tells how you broken CoH2 already is. In addition, the fact that they portrayed the Soviet High Command as ruthless commanders is simply stupid as It was basically Do-or-Die for the Soviets since the Nazi's pretty much was going to exterminate a high number of them due to their Non-Aryan status If CoH1 was all about 'MURICA, why cant CoH2 be all about 'RUSSIA when the CoH2 trailer itself gives you the feeling that this is going to be a game that tells you of the hardship and sacrifices made by the Soviet People during the war when instead you end up getting some cliche BS of a main character.I highly suggest you don't get this game unless you're tired of the generic same old America V Germans WW2 games in which case you're better off buying Red Orchestra 2 or something more in-depth like Hearts of Iron 4 which is still TBA.

												i cant believe u buy the game and then the cheeky  gets go and make it so u get less then half the content of the game almost .  If it was free to play i could understand that but the fact u buy the game u dont exspect to have to buy a million addons just for the basic functions like commanders. Absulute wrong what they done. i can understand making people pay for skins but not for classes on a p2p game. ITs like buying wow and them only letting u be one class and u have to pay for the others its total bs. Im not surprised that there is hardly no 1 playing this game. probably 50 people online at any time max wouldnt recomend this game at all. Go play something else this games nothing on coh. In a Nutshell u buy the game they have 25 ish commenaders what are the classes with unique skills which u have about 10 and the only way to get the rest is to buy them no matter how much u level u will not get them . So basicly u can play half the content of the game that u have paid for .			"

												Absolutely not, after playing the game for 300 plus hours the game is extremely repetitive. Sega/Relic even have the audacity to remove the highly favored custom lobby, which would allow players to select games to play with random people online at their own leisure, now the only thing left to choose from is the pathetic automatch.  It can easily be said that matchmaking is worthless along with being unbalanced, with your team either being a group of moronic third graders or your enemies being ""s00per l33t MLG noscope' pro's"" capable of wiping you out extremely quickly.  Looking for a long battle? Not here, not with the lovely VP game, in all my hours of gameplay my longest game of VP (including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4) was only a solid 35-40 minutes.Note: Expect an enemy to build something logical? Nope, they'll just spam cheap OP tanks with their purchased OP commander.  Playing as russian? Congratulations, you just won! Oh, unless you're playing against the Elite German Doctrine, which is also purchasable, who can insta rank his units up for a pitiful amount of fuel and bring in the unbeatable Tiger Ace mid-late game.If you're looking at Company of Heroes 2 for rich unit diversity and capable counters, along with nice maps, look further, like, way further, because this game isnt for you.  In Coh2 artillery isnt even that important of an influence anymore, maybe besides the much spammed 120mm mortar by the soviets. Also it should be noted there arent bridges anymore, atleast not bridge maps which if all or most are destroyed will effectively cut off your enemies from striking you.All in all I do -NOT- reccomend this game, it's a sad attempt to rake in the money with their over powered or worthless doctrines/commander DLC's. I think I'd even go as far as saying that you, the player/reader should try Coh1, considering the older game STILL and will probably FOREVER outclass its sequel.UPDATE, SEPTEMBER 2015:  GAME STILL ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS. ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE EXTRA L33T ♥♥♥♥ING DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.  DON'T BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE, DON'T BUY THE DLC.   ♥♥♥♥♥ ON THE FORUMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ♥♥♥♥♥ AT SEGA.			"

In this one there're no Allies (Uk nor us), the gameplay is repetitive, there's a lack of units and upgrades, you have to pay money to get items even after you bought the games (I'm not talking about neat items, I'm talking about commanders that let you change your commander powers)...I regret buying the game.

												FOV is too low, you still can't change it. Also commanders DLC is pay-to-win. Not really balanced in my opinion. Matchmaking still suffers for no automatch in annihilation mode.Original Company of Heroes is way better.EDIT: one year later.Still same issues, also menus are all messed up, matchmaking is still messed up, bulletins are messed up (I've bought the new US army and Oberkommando and I can't level them up quickly), mods can unlock all armies I've spent money, game menu is not optimized for every resolution that is not 16:9 (adding two black useless areas around... I got a 16:10 monitor with resolution of 1920x1200: that means that an area of 480x480 pixels are not used. As big as a chat menu).			"

												Одиночная кампания игры ужасное оскорбление памяти наши дедов, победителей фашизма. Самое удивительное что разработчики этого антисоветского кала позиционируют игру как ИСТОРИЧЕСКИ ДОСТОВЕРНУЮ - и это ЛОЖЬ! Эта игра запрещена к продажам на территории России и имеет один из самых низких рейтингов пользователей (1.8) на metacritic.Из-за плохих продаж разработчики перешли к продажам воздуха в DLC (это полное убожество), А баланс в сетевой игре просто ужасен, это не говоря о плохой оптимизации графики и постоянных проблемах в сетевой игре.____________________________________________________________________The single player campaign games terrible insult to the memory of our ancestors, the winners of fascism. The most amazing thing is that the developers of anti-Soviet feces positioning game as historically accurate - it is a lie! This game is banned for sale in the territory of Russia and has one of the lowest ratings of users (1.8) on metacritic. Due to poor sales, developers have moved to sales of air in the DLC (this complete squalor), and the balance in a multiplayer game is just awful, it's not to mention the bad graphics optimization and persistent problems in multiplayer.

												Don`t get me wrong, i like the game, I really have fun playing it, and i give it a solid 8/10-1 for the campaign being not really hard, and having cutscenes that look 5 years old.-1 for general bad changes, compared to the first part (for the engineers, why do only the soviet engineers have explosives? where are my much beloved tanktraps? why can`t the AI cut through barbedwire or repair bridges? )BUT:the DLC-politics, i really don`t mind paying money to get additional content for a game, like the ""Theatre of War""-Content, but 4€ for a Commander?? (Commanders are like the doctrines in the first part) And that Comander doesnt even have a whole bunch of new abilities, sometimes just one new ability!!Why not give the commanders with the ToW-Package??The Answer is simple: Profit...I get the felling they`re gonna milk this cow until it runs dry..Without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Politics i would recommend the game!EDIT:Dont`get me wrong, they changed a lot, balanced many things and one can only appreciate the effort put into the new Content, i love the US-Campaign, it`s challenging and due to the freedom of choice and upgrading, you can play it 3-4 times without getting bored.BUT:Once again i will not recommend the game, simply due to the fact that commanders still cost 3.99€I hate theese DLC politics and iam not gonna support it...I already payed for the Base Game, the Theater of War Content, and the Ardennes Assault.Please tell me why on earth should i pay another 40-50 bucks to get the remaining commanders?

												Company of Heroes 2 is the successor to the RTS Company of Hereos, and whilst I have played very little of that game and cannot judge which is better, I can still see the glaring differences. Company of Heroes 2 is not an RTS in the general sense; It has little base building, no worker management and a reliance on strategic points to gain resources. This system has turned many a person away from CoH 2 and Dawn of War II, Relic's other less RTS-like RTS, but are these things so bad? I'll discuss the pros and cons of CoH 2 and how well it draws it's mechanics from it's predecessors (CoH 1, DoW II and  DoW I).I write this review targetting those who have already taken an interest in the game and are yet to decide whether to buy it, consider this piece as a more in depth description from an aspiring, competant 1v1 player.The pros:- Company of Heroes 2 has good graphics: This is the least important feature of the game, it could look much worse and still be playable, but it's these graphics that immerse the player and let them believe they are in WW2.- The game has improved mechanics: Ever been annoyed when your Predator tank turns around when trying to escape on 100hp and gets shot in rear armour? Well luckily Relic improved this from DoW II and added a reverse function to vehicles, allowing them to reverse over long distances instead of short, frantically mircroed distances. Another example is climable cover, meaning cover can be long and winding, with units able to move across it without taking ridiculous paths. Showing enemy setup arcs, very small but very good for planning an assault with.- The range of units: Every faction has access to many units bought from base, ranging from mortar teams to riflemen squads to assault rifle armed Panzergrenadiers. This makes for the possibility of a wide variety of units employable right from base. But this is further augmented through the commander system, allowing for otherwise unavailable units to be deployed: Light AT Guards Rifle Infantry, Airdropping Paratroopers and fearsome Tiger tanks. The unit variety is excellent and makes for fun and fresh plays after many games.- The commanders: Evolved from DoW II's hero selection system and CoH 1's doctrinal tech trees, CoH 2 changes this dynamic to make it more flexible on the battlefield. Able to pick from three commanders during a game allows for situations to unfold before deciding the best tactical move. Do you want one that swarms them with infantry? One that buffs your infantry and provides artillery support? Are you churning out vehicles and looking for commanders who can repair/send out the big tanks? Although it doesn't have the two path trees of COH 1, it offers more variety between games with extra doctrines that can be mixed and matched.- Connection: The game allows users to reconnect to games if disconnected for whatever reason. This problem has plagued DoW II due to random drops and Steam disconnects which makes it a very useful feature.Micro: This is not SC II and it's 300 actions per minute, you can sit back and evaluate your strategy, which makes it more tactical with less emphasis on micro and more in-depth combat.The cons:- Optimisation: The term ""Relic lag"" has not evolved within the playerbase for no reason. The game occasionally lags for varying lengths of time for no apparent reason, it happens in base, it happens when your oppenent launches an assault, it happens just at the critical point when you might lose a vehicle but haven't moved it yet. Relic lag gets everyone, no matter how many supercomputers are running this game Relic lag will always persist.- Spam: I mentioned unit variety, well yes, unit variety exists, but functional unit variety does not. The same unit will be spammed all game because the meta and balance decree it so. Low level to medium level Soviet players will spam Maxims and Zis guns and simply camp the victory points, waiting for games to end whilst they sit and watch. They may also spam T34 tanks because they're cheap. Ober Kommando West players will 99% of the time use the dreaded ""Schreck blob"" technique, building four or five Volksgrenadier squads and outfitting them with Panzerschrecks. They level up so quickly and become so powerful nothing is safe from their attack move blobbing. Spam has been looked at in recent patches and tactics for facing it have become more viable, e.g. suppressing Light Infantry Howitzers and better overall Heavy Machine Gun AOE suppression.- Community: This is not the fault of Relic, and at least they put profanity filters in game to make insults seem farcical, but many players are silent tryhards or raging players who blame you for their lack of skill. The times when you meet talkative players are ones to be relished.- Commander meta: There are a fair few commanders for Ostheer (Wehrmacht in game) and Soviets, and whilst variety is nice to playa round with, there are definite strong and weak ones. Mechanised Assault/Elite Troops/Close Air Support for Ostheer, Fortifications for OKW, Rifle Company/Airborne for USF and Shock Rifle/Guard Motor for Soviets. These doctrines get abused for their huge early game pressure and late game dominance that doesn't offer any opponent room for manouver. Not to mention you can buy these commanders instead of having to wait to get them dropped. As of recent updates these commanders have been changed so they rely less on call in units that are more powerful than stock, meaning base units are more desirable and gameplay has been directed to make sure players get rewarded for teching to higher tiers without waiting for call in armour.- RNG: The Panzer fires it's last shot at the escaping T34, hoping to clear it up and win the day. But no, the shot bounces off front armour and your Panzer gets immobilised on a mine, and then at the critical moment when it dies, the crew decide to hop out and leave it abandoned for the enemy to take. The RNG is a massive feature, stray shells, tank accuracy, model kills. It makes for punishing plays that you don't deserve but the RNG gods like to inflict upon you. This is not skill, this is stupidity.- Irritating new mechanics: Certain units can spawn from any building on the map, vehicles can crush infantry and Soviet tanks can cap. Nuff said.- DLC: There is so much DLC, commanders, skins, missions, campaigns etc. This allows for Pay to win scenarios in multiplayer as well as huge money sinks like Ardennes Assault.In conclusion:Company of Heroes is fun but occasionally frustrating RTS/RTT with well fleshed out mechanics and interesting design descisions, just with poor execution. The game was in a fairly unbalanced state whilst Relic pushed more and more DLC out to the masses, allowing for pay to win and money grabbing methods, but gearing up to the Britsh Forces expansion the balance has been getting much better and Relic listen to the community when it comes to progressively balancing the multiplater experience. The game is fun, but the enjoyment can be spoiled by some poor map design (Bystraya Voda/Stalingrad), iffy (but much improved as of late) balance and cheap tactics with pay to win stratergies (Elite troops/Close Air Support). I am lucky that I can overlook most of this and enjoy the game.The verdict:I like the game, and whilst much work is going on to improve it, with the British expansion coming out there is much uncertainty as to how they might affect things. But one thing for sure is that such a large update will keep the game fresh for a while longer.UPDATE: 22/7/2015Things are vastly improved, and the review has been editted above. Relic are listening to feedback, they are making intelligent choices and the game is getting a much needed revamp. Shame it didn't come two years ago.			"

												To be honest, its a terrible sequel. There are few things that CoH2 introduces that do make it feels like improvement, but overall it feels like its more of a one step forward, two steps backwards syndrome.If there's one thing Relic(pre/during development) or Sega( this isnt the 1st rts that they screwed up) needs to learn and know, for the love of god, please let there be dedicated server for online matches. There's a reason(though not the main one) why most of relic games arent really relished by the online community, its the p2p system for matches, which makes the matches are ridiculously annoying and unfun to play with.Comparing to its predecessor, games are surprisingly short. Probably too short. I think Relic may dabble too much into DoW2 series and forgot CoH mechanics when making CoH2. It lost the 'strategic feeling' of CoH, but doesnt really capture the 'tactical feeling' of DoW2. So what you get here is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love child of both.The snow/blizzard system....its a gimmick. Is it good? Eh,... cant really say. I think Relic originally designed it to be a huge part of the campaign, it sure does wonder in the campaign. It does feel like winter in russia, which is freezing cold, chilling to the bone. But as a rts mechanic, I'd rather they do a working weather system, for all weather for multiplayer purposes. If you are getting this game, you better have a good connection if you want to play online, or pray that your opponent does. If not, stick to AI matches, or play with friends. The campaign and other features are okey, but I'd rather play the predecessor.			"

												After beta testing, throwing down a few hundred hours, being an idiot and investing in their 'DLC' (five bucks, but still...), I've come to the conclusion that this game, as painful as it is for me to say, is not for me.  There are far too many random events that decide the outcome of games... dice rolls that disable tanks, percentages that determine whether or not your grenades will affect infantry, among things.  Balance itself seems to swing wildly between patches, units exclusive to DLC, and the whims of the developers.  The UI is a number of steps backwards and in the wrong direction.  The UI designer himself was stubborn and refused to acknowledge the many, many problems associated with what he put out.  As a result, the final game suffers terribly.  The game was released with a number of basic functions not ready - an insult in and of itself, but because of the passion I had for the original Company of Heroes, and the unfortunate circumstances surrounding THQ, I was able to deal with it.  The UI eventually became, in my opinion, a whole new monster, as incremental updates were released and base features were more or less 'tacked on'.  The end result is an ugly, unintuitive mess that neither works or pleases.Their community manager has mentioned that there have been near twenty updates as of this writing.  Their effort is commendable, but I do not see much in the way of actual improvement.  It looks to me as a series of lateral movements intended to improve, but in reality, the game is far to embroiled in poor design choices.  There are far too many variables to balance, too many nuances to control, and again, too many random occurences to feel like your personal skill was the main factor in victory.By far the worst tragedy of this game is that the original went under and isn't getting the attention and care it deserves.Review Update :400 hours of game play later.  Also two years later. There are now leader boards.  Game was resembling something playable in August 2015.  This was more or less destroyed once the Brits were released in September.  The way that Relic abuses their player base is somewhat troubling.  A series of heavy nerfs followed the British faction over the next few months.  Relic slowly turned down the heat here and there but balance has truly suffered.Game build is shaky.  Heavy memory leak performance loss after a handful of matches.  Latest patch (February 25th 2016) broke veterancy.  Not entirely sure what the direction of everything is.  We were told that an American unit (the Calliope) was having it's shots reduced from 24 to 18 because it was over performing, yet a unit was released simultaneously that can fire 30.  For five dollars.If you can stomach the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that this company shovels out, the game is still fun.  As a balanced, competitive game, I can't say that it is.Review Update 2 :After hearing about numerous changes regarding playability and balance, I decided to give the game a try.  Again.  Once again, it's close but not quite.  Depending on how you look at it.  One two hour session was dented by rapid fire allied tanks (a bug introduced into a 'hotfix' for the June 21st patch).  After a little reading I realized that this was an easy to replicate bug.  If a match more or less boils down to a little bit of Russian roullete, depending entirely on the morals of your internet opponent... well... Fast forward, the rapid firing tanks are fixed... mortars are completely out of control.  Despite numerous warnings and protests within the community, we now have rapid firing mortars.  The sweeping changes they did to improve machine guns and general infantry play are completely undermined by mortars that are on another level.  There you have it.  My love for this franchise is slowly grinded into a pulp.  The first question that popped up in my head loading the June 21st patch was, ""What's going to be broken?"".  Rapid firing tanks and mortars.  In a nutshell, the game is still a sloppy mess.  I really would like to tell the devs I appreciate their efforts.  Despite that, their game is almost irredeemably broken in some way, shape or form.  And that is truly, truly disheartening.			"

												To unbalanced they try to fix it and it makes it even more unbalanced.  Also 1 Player can lag the entire match to a stand still which is almost every match. Response times to units being moved and them going the way you want them is also lagged and the pathing they decide to take isn't the one you want.  On top of that the DLC is overpriced for example when you do get a game that isn't lagging and your using one of the better commanders your luck to be able to call units such as the tiger ace because the match ends so fast so its a waste of money to buy the commander.

												Company of Heroes 2 is worse than Company of Heroes 1 in every aspect of gameplay save for graphical fidelity, weather systems, the ability to hop fences, and vehicle reverse.Company of Heroes 1 has more replayability, faction diversity, interesting player choices in the vein of tech pacing and it's doctrines, meaningful balanced asymmetry between the factions and their units, and perhaps most noteably, it succeeds in living up to it's name in every way, where as Company of Heroes 2 fails to deliver in it's demonization of the soviet union, and it's portrayal of every commanding officer being a monster with noredeeming qualities, and painting the infantryman of the USSR as cowards who would not fight if not for the gun at the back of their heads, despite the Wehrmacht killing their families and threatening to completely overrun their country.Overall, it's this gamer's opinion that you should just buy Company of Heroes one, look into the excellent Blitzkrieg mod, and enjoy a game that is much, much better than Company of Heroes two.

												good and bad points: 1. 1v1 and 2v2 is fairly balanced at the moment for auto match.                                  2. 3v3 and expecially 4v4 is so unbalanced atm in favour of the german faction due to german armour being very difficult to destroy expecially panthers .                                   3. things i think should be fixed are the conscript anti tank grenade against panthers which just constantly bounce off, i actually have more luck disabling the tiger engine then the panther which i find strange.su85 should get there original speed back since it was the only real counter to the panther for the cost value per tank.russian inf anti tank weapons are useless bring in the bazooka or something a little better than the rifle the gaurds have.Dissapointed not to have normal game lobbys like in coh1.   As u may have noticed i am totally 1 sided as i mainly play russians . but the point is i like 3v3 and 4v4 and now unless soviets own the whole map early on they stand no chance late game at all .  German factions just sit back and wait til all of a sudden 4 to 8 panthers roll on the field and its game over. If u like coh1 and liked playing allies and you are thinking of buying coh2 then i would suggest playing 1v1 or 2v2 automatch .i cant make many comments on the campaighns srry i havent really played them.

												Sickening how they turned this great franchise into a micro transaction pay to win mess...The base game is still great. I love CoH more than any RTS. My entire problem is with the way they have turned CoH2 into a huge micro transaction pay to win game where the more you play the better your troops/guns/vehicles are.So if you buy the base game you get several commanders. I can't remember specifics but the original armies from the first release gave you more options than the Western Front Armies. More commands. Six commanders for the Soviets because I bought the digital deluxe version and got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't get me started on what I got for my extra $40. Six extra commanders and some vehicle textures, oh joy! Anyway, it has been a long time since the beta testing and since I started playing retail. More on that a bit later. If I am not mistaken there will be three to six starter commanders for the Soviets (three of those are from the deluxe version I think), the German Wehrmacht came with three to six (again three extra from the Deluxe Edition I think), the Western Front Armies add-on came with three each for US Forces and the German Oberkommando West. I've logged one hundred hours of nothing but skirmish and online multiplayer. Though I tend to play skirmish mode mostly. At the end of the game you get random drops. Since purchase I have got ten Soviet commanders to drop. Nine Wehrmacht commanders. And one (yes, just one) US Forces commander to drop even though I have played mainly the US forces since the release of Western Front Armies.The problem? When we beta tested you got to picked the commander and their combat options or perks so to speak. With the retail release you don't have that option and even though the two base armies have lots of commanders and intel bulletins that randomly drop at end game the commanders are too similar in my opinion. And the Intel Bulletins are basically improvements to your existing options. So the more you play the better your sqauds/guns/tanks are.The add-on of the Western Forces gave very little. Random drops are almost non existant because they only have several extra commanders and they are trying to get you to buy them for $3.99 each. And there in lies the problem. Since Western Front Armies went live I have scored one commander and it was a cruel joke. His first perk is a WC51 Military Truck w/ .50 cal HMG mounted on the back that can't even pin down a squad of engineers. Not to mention they (any squad even engineers) can take it out so fast it is completely worthless on the battlefield. Does that sound balanced? Oh, but if I buy the other commanders they have much better options you say? No, thanks.I recommend buying the entire game if you can get it on the cheap. I regret paying one hundred US dollars for the so called deluxe version. I have bought the Western Front Armies and the British Forces but grudgingly. Like I said I love CoH and since the original CoH I can't play other RTS games because they are just weak. I love the franchise and the game mechanics. I hate the way Sega screwed us loyal fans with this micro transaction BS.			"

												tl:dr spend money on the first one and download blitzkrieg mod you'll get your moneys worth out of it.no just no, i tried it again played some of the story line then some skirmishes some with friends and then bots. but still no, then we went back to coh blitzkrieg mod again and had fun. this had the makings of a great game to be, but just fell short even the camera angle feels weird, maybe im use to the first one this one seems way to zoomed in. you hardly get any vechiles in the game as well maybe a few tanks here and there but nothing on a grand or epic scale like the first one. since relic was develpoing this game it seemed great but ever since they went under and sega took over and added their arcade style to it. the game imo fell threw the cracks either because sega didnt know how to continue editing it and just pushed out what relic had who knows.

												I've been feeling that I bought an unfinished product of which I have to spend some more money to get it finished. The worst thing is that there are some achievements I cannot use since I don't have the right commander to use them because i don't buy the necessary dlc. Also, gameplay is worse than i anticipated. You have to use same tactics in order to win and this is really annoying to me.In addition to these I am having performance issues. Well, my computer is not top of the line super pc and it is 2 years old however I cannot understand why i7 processor with 8gb ram and 2gb graphic card computer so much slowed down with every video settings turned off. I updated my drivers as the game requested but no performance improvement happened. It looks really bad and on the top of that it feels like playing a slow motion game.I am a big fan of CoH 1 and DoW 1&2, really good games in all aspects, however this game does not worth the money you have to spend so much. I cannot say this is a bad game, with a better computer it looks really good, but it does not worth all the money you spend because you need to buy dlcs for some cool units and for some stupid paintjobs.

												The graphics are excellent and in due course I hope to comment on the game play.  For now, however, I seem to be groping around in the dark because the developers seem to be following the latest fashion of providing neither a manual nor an immediately obvious walk through to take one through the basics.  Eventually I stumbled across the latter but it did not lead to a favourable first impression and frankly it would have been better if the tutorials had stood front and centre rather than promotional material for further DLCs, which I will probably never reach.

												Short Review:Bad successor of the first game.The first company of heroes had the main game and 2 Add-Ons, which could be played as stand alones. Comapny of Heroes 2 however released a ton of DLc's and Add-Ons, making the game a money milking machine to gain maximum profit, instead of providing the best experience to its players.You can buy extra skins, commanders, campaign packs, Armies, Perks...[the list goes on].Many of which grant you quite an advantage above your enemy. (i.g. producing tanks in seconds, making it possible to spamm your enemy with tanks -> very easy tactic to win the game in early stage)The variety of ""pay extra"" parts make this game absolutely unenjoyable to me. While i got the game pretty early at which not so many addons were available i still got annoyed by the paywalls. The new engine used for CoH 2 is imho worse than the original one and takes away a part of the feeling related with the series. The hp, aiming and pathfinding system is bad (applies only to you, not to AI) making the game feel sluggish and unfair when playing against AI opponents. Overall - not recommended. If you are looking for an arcadish 2nd World War Strategy Game, either go for Company of Heroes 1 (plus addons) or try out the a little bit more demanding Men of War series. 5/10			"

												The base game is pretty alright. Unfortunately the new Commander system ruins the game. Rather than having 3 to choose from just like the first COH, you now have several different commanders to choose from. The real problem though is that there are Commander packages and single ones you can buy from the store for around $8.. You can possibly get a commander in a drop after a battle (A drop I hear you ask? Yes it's ♥♥♥♥in stupid.. this is a strategy game not a ♥♥♥♥in free to play FPS game but anyway) I have played for a few months now and have never received a Commander.. only bulletins which are another stupid addition to the game, they are pointless little perks. E.g. Your conscript soldiers are now 2% more accurate. <This is such a small percentage that you won't even notice it. Every bulletin in the game is insignificant. There are some units in the game that you will never be able to use UNLESS you pay to get the Commander that holds them. ♥♥♥♥ the person that ruined this game. Greedy buggers.			"

												I've played the game since late beta and even preordered it. It felt great in the beggining, but when the yearning for a COH continuation wore off it was clearly visible how uncompetitive title it was. The sole essence of the series - the multiplayer mode is currently an pitiful strictly pay-2-win unbalanced nightmare. Just when you start to enjoy the game you are being slapped in the face by the sad fact it's designed as a moneygrinder. Almost everything requires cash, even the silly camouflages. Seriously, this is the downfall of DLC era - titles like that, demanding money for spamming tiny DLCs that normally should have been in the game already seriously make me hate the whole DLC distribution model.

												A game that can be fun, but I find the DLC and drop system very disappointing, especially since many ubiquitous units are locked to certain commanders.  Want to play Wermacht and have a tiger (not a tiger ace, just a tiger, though you need a commander for the ace too)?  Better buy/get lucky enough with the spoils of war system which usually drops pointless bulletins that have a nearly miniscule effect on your forces.I'd also recommend avoiding the mission packs as many of them have not been updated for balance changes and are nearly impossible for a casual player to beat, especially the Wermacht who have almost no way to beat Russian tanks in early war missions.

												I normally play RTS games to comp stomp, one reason being that I know I'm not as amazing as the majority of players, so I like to fight the computers.The main problem with comp-stomping on this game, is the fact that even on easy difficulty, they're so difficult it's not even fun, ever.Now, I'm not going to say to make the AI like Command & Conquer easy, where the enemy turtles with the first five buildings available in the game, and probably send the weakest unit in a pitiful attempt to kill you once in a while, because that isn't fun, I agree.But when you make it so damn difficult to beat an AI even on Easy and Standard, all the fun is completely drained, and you find yourself questioning why you wasted £15 or more on this game.Coupled with the fact you have to pay for commanders, which most of which have the same skills multiple times, it's not like they're all unique ways of playing, makes me wonder, why couldn't of they just stuck with giving each side one of 3 preset command strategies?I mean, seriously, what's the deal with that...?THEN, to add insult to injury, they've gone and made the entire game just domination from most FPS's, let me state that I hate domination, I've always been a, 'it's not over till you've destroyed their last unit' kind of guy.  So, the fact I don't even have an option to do that, unless I make a friends only custom match just upsets me even more...It's a shame really, because I enjoyed the first game, I also loved the way the British played differently to the other factions.  It completely fitted the way I played the game, with movable bases to help push forward where ever it was safe.  That's all gone, no way whatsoever of playing like that...Also, the really good wave defence co-op mode from the first isn't here, which, if they had that, I would probably recommend this game, because I love to defend rather than go offensive.It's a shame really, the game looked so promising, and Relic just failed to deliver what I, and probably quite a few of the playerbase wanted.Just to clarify, if you're into the PvP part of the game, I can't comment on that, it's not really the part of the game I enjoy, I'm basing this being a casual RTS'er, who wants to waste a bit of time fighting a challenging AI, than to struggle and get frustrated everytime he plays.

I decided to buy this during the winter sale when it was 66% off, thinking it was a good deal. In reality they butcherd the game. Graphic wise they are the same, but it use a HUGE amount of memory this time which causes crashes for low end computers. The game play is horrible. Unit icons are small and too similar to be able to be quick decissive desisions. They took out the cammand tree. Sniper are absolutely usless now. They can only be in camo when they are in cover and present no significant role on a battle feild. They story of campaign mode has alot of people calling Relic Nazi lovers due the depiction of Russain soldiers being dogs and the officers killing them left and right. I play this game until level four when I decided to look at reviews and saw the same things I was seeing on Metacritic. DO NOT BUY, EVEN IF IT'S ON SALE. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. STICK WITH THE FIRST ONE FOR THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE!!!!			"

That low? Performance test: alright, although it doesn't look much better than COH1 it's definitely slower.Anyway, keep default settings & onto the campaign.

												While the freeweekend amazed me for it, I regret wasting the money. While it's a modest game, the Soviet army has basically no distinction for it's infantry, cardboard tanks, and bland stock commanders. The German army is is the same for the first except you don't buy veteran troops anymore and the Tiger tank rolls through everything for a good 20 mintues. The campign is bland but playable, if you like switching between throwing everyone with a gun at the enemy and hidding a cabin so your squad doesn't die becuase command doesn't want spare naymore of infinite conscripts. I haven't touched online multiplayer but battling the bots can take an hour and all the good commanders are dlc only, so it's essentially pay-to-win. Not mention a miniscule amount of stock maps, but luckily the steamworkshop is there. If you want a real Company of Heroes game, go get the first one.			"

												Overall, the second installment of the COH series is a disappointment. The first game was such a classic. I felt it really revolutionized the genre of RTS, allowing for a unique gameplay. I'm not much for rushing/spamming strategies, so the original COH was a challenge, in that I was always pushing for resources, not allowing me to remain in my comfortable ""turtle"" style of gameplay. It never felt overwhelming, or too hurried, but rather just generally rushed, like a pitched battle would. The second edition has not changed all that much from that recipe. There are some neat whiz-bang things like cold, and ice, and the ability to jump obstacles. However, these do little to add to the authenticity of the game. Instead, they just clutter up your decision-making with additional selections to be made each time you want to move a unit. Now, rather than selecting a squad and advancing to a location, I find myself micromanaging each squad. Sprinting from fire to fire to keep warm, or ensuring that they assault over walls rather than going over them keeps me from focusing on the big picture. Trying to manage three separate forces in a winter map? Good luck. You'll be hard pressed to track a few units, let alone forces spread across a map when a snowstorm blows in. As far as balance is concerned, Soviet conscript doctrine seems to be vastly overpowered. The ability to produce nearly 3 units in the timeframe makes playing as the Soviets far too easy and against them far too difficult, on any setting. The Germans cannot keep up with the Soviet onslaught, and as a result are very dissatisfying to play. Perhaps this is true to life, but it certainly makes for an unappealing faction in this game.The Command Loadout function is probably intended to help with this... but I've not been able to understand it. I cannot determine what I'm changing, what the changes are affecting, and how they will assist my game. There seem to be far too many options, many of which appear to be cosmetic (do I really need to pick from 5 different camouflage patterns, none of which do anything to help conceal my equipment and Soldiers?) and of little value. The graphics appear to be exactly the same as the original COH, though what can you honestly do with tiny little figures? I won't fault the maker for that.Overall, I'm under the impression that Relic took a great game that was becoming a bit stale, slapped a new face/ generals on it, cluttered the UI, made it more difficult to control the battlefield, and ensured that anyone just coming into the Series will be thoroughly confused. Not worth the money I paid for it at all.			"

												Definitely not a sequel. Obviously not an improvment on the original. Even simple comments like retreating a squad leaves them standing there as you click the retreat button and you watch the squad just stand there and get killed. Tank battles are impossible. By the time you have built a tank factory, you get rushed by 6-10 tanks. I was expecting a similar experience to the original, but it is not even close. Even the skirmish matches are laughable. I had all three flags at one point with 500 points and the enemy had no more than 3 sectors, but had enough resources to tank rush my base with 10-12 tanks, and legions of troops. I had them at 5 points, but because they smashed my base (with no resources), I lost !!Most skirmishes last 20-30 minutes as you get overrun by the enemy. There is no balance at all. After 5 minutes of setting up your base, they appear on your doorstep with 3 tanks ?Seems the developers put all their time and effort into DLC, skins and other ""features"" that hold no interest to those that look for gameplay and realism. It is not a game any more. It has no depth and does not build on the legacy of the original. I should have kept my money and just played the original.A real disappointment. Save your $ and stick with the original. At least his has gameplay and realism.			"

												What a shame. Somehow Relic thought it was a good idea to make Company of Heroes *more* difficult to play and introduce more unit micromanagement to players. Having to babysit an army of units across a lush and detailed battlefield left me feeling in awe of the war torn beauty but feeling completely overwhelmed when I lost entire squads because they were pointed in the wrong direction. Often there is so much happening that it just adds to the frustration and confusion when I'm trying to manage a battle of dozens of units. If you're obsessed with micro-management in RTS games then this will likely be your cup of tea but it just wasn't mine. Pass.			"

												This game claims to be the successor of Company of Heroes, but is just a diluted version of the former made for selling tons of useless DLCs.The game itself could be good, but the addition of unbalaced paid units makes it unplayable in multiplayer.It lacks a lot of features that any game after the year 2005 should have and that its predecessor had, like game lobbies, chatrooms ingame, mod support, etc.In short. The game isn't worth its price. Even if you found the game cheap in steam's sales, the multiplayer experience is terrible unless you waste a lot of money buying overpriced DLCs.Do not buy. Stay away from this game. Don't support these gaming business policies.			"

												Awful successor to one of the best games ever made. CoH2 has no soul, would not recommend.Edit: After about 30 hours and completing the campaign, I'm keeping negative review.-DLC everywhere, and it's crappy overpriced DLC which are basically AI skirmishes or a mish-mash of the old opposing front armies from Coh1-The voice acting is terrible, I recognise one of the voice actors from titan quest, in that game he was putting on a Greek accent, in this game he's putting on a Russian accent. He can't do either properly and just sounds like a Mexican putting on funny accents-The Russians are portrayed a lot worse than they really were in WW2 in my opinion. The campaign just makes it look like they only fought because they had a gun to their heads, and I'm pretty sure commissars didn't go around executing entire platoons of fighting troops on the front for the lulz-I can't seal off areas with tank traps and sandbags like in Coh1, I know this isn't a huge deal but I prefer to be able toCoH2 gets a 4/10 from me2016 Edit:After putting in another 30+ hours I'm keeping the negative review, although there is a defence mod now to add tank traps and stuff which is real nice, and I do enjoy playing the British in multiplayer games, both those nice things are offset by the Ardennes Campaign, which is basically a bunch of skirmishes with randomly applied victory conditions. Even on sale at 7 euro I think I overpaid for this crap. It's also hilarious how, after paying for the Ardennes stuff you are immediately prompted to buy a new commander for 5 bux for your new DLC.

												237 hours in, time to finally write a review.-More DLC content than base game-There's literally DLC for DLC, I'm not joking. Buy a faction, they buy the commanders to use that faction's good units, then optional skins but I'm not even going to count those.-You wanna get all the DLC? Over $100 and that's not counting skins.-You want to hear more BS about DLC you need to buy the King Tickle DLC complaint DLC pack.-Relic Entertainment bullies people who criticize their game, via deleting comments and banning on their official forums.-Also emphasizes all positive comments... Relic? More like Reich Entertainment. -Reich Entertainment barely even cares about the game, leaving the game unbalanced and censoring balance complaints until things get bad enough for them to finally fix something in a patch. -Slight Axis bias. Yes, for the longest time and even a bit still now the Axis factions (Wehrmacht mainly) have had more utility and stronger units/abilities that give them the upper hand. Calls for balancing were of course censored by the glorious Reich Entertainment. -Finally, the game itself is fairly lackluster in entertainment unless you have a group of friends to party up with. Online matchmaking can only last so long for the solo gamer and getting over ranked by the countless prestige 3 level 100s happens more often than not. Frustrating and lackluster sums it up nicely.Conclusion: I've given up on the game other than private matches with friends for fun. If you want more info and less sardonicsm in a review I highly reccomend you check out Optimism's review, he breaks down the game more and is also one of the friends I party up with.

Overall, this game is tanked by some of the, sadly, increasingly common mistakes made by the gaming industry. Day One DLC, online sign-in for single player, lack of real improvement from previous game.It really shouldn't be surprising, though. After all, Relic is no longer what it was after the death of THQ, having been sold to Sega during CoH2's development along with the loss of most of the staff.

												Purchased when it was on sale, otherwise I'd be furious...The game itself seems alright, unfortunately I get about 4 FPS even with all settings down as far as they go and running at 1280 resolution. Many others have complained about the performance, and seeing as the game has been released awhile, this will not be fixed.My machine should certainly be capable of running on at least minimal settings. Quad core, GTX260, 16 GB Ram, server grade SDD. Sega also lists the requirements as significantly below what I have. TL;DR -- If you loved the first game and have a top top top end gaming machine, you will think this game is alright. If your  machine is anything less than the most elite, you will be disappointed with performance. I've read about users with machines newer than mine and still having to deal with single digit FPS.

												So far, I can finally say that I've had my fairshare about this game. Yes it does have its faults, and what faults (hopefully) you may be asking?Pros+ The game has spectacular replay value+ The game offers so much as for tatctics+ The graphical Fidelity is BEUTIFUL+ NOT intirely a pay-to-win process, more like TF2 and it's hats, you can find one just about every 2 months as a random drop, or you can go ahead and buy it in the in-game market. Same thing applies to Intel Bullitens and Commanders and Unit Skins.I could go on, but at what cost....Cons- The game is very demanding in terms of Computer Hadrware, ranging from mass CPU usage, to requiring a pretty powerful GPU.- To play beutifuly on the game, it is recommened that you have 16 GB of RAM, due to things, from the map it's self with the addon of dead and alive units, and Phisycs having to be rendered.- This has to be a DLC King, reason being is that DLC's litter the place, Unit skins and skin packs, to commanders and their packs, to the Theater of War DLCs to the Factions/Armies.- Low grade PCs will have anurisms trying to run this game for mid-game, early game.- Your given two factions total win buying the base game, the Soviets and the Whermacht, the other three you have to buy in packs, $20 USD for 2 more Armis, including he $12 USD for the Bitish/Common Wealth? Strange times we live in.Personally it's hard to choose a side for this game, I mean once you have all the DLCs, you feel content almost, or complete. With the additive to having those said DLCs, you have Variety for your gameplay! I have a PC that can hand the game at Max Graphics, minus the antialiasing, which takes a huge chunk out of performance for an excellent picture, but by me having a PC that can handle this, I have no negative outlook on the game in the section of Frames (if I can even incude that).Alass, I'll leave it up to you weather this game is fun or not, my 400 hours plus says something, but I'm on an unbalance sadly.

												Damn ! I buy only a standard game without the DLC. But do you believe it ? The DLC contents are still in the game, of course I cannot use it, but it's still there seem like some unlockable content but there's no way I can unlock it because it's a ♥♥♥♥ing DLC, I feel like Relic just put that in the game because they just want to insult me because I cannot buy the full DLC game... For example: US force and British force still in the game even you didn't buy the western front DLC, you cannot play as both of those faction but you can choose them as an A.I allied or enemy in customize battle. When you click in the campaign mode, you can see two campaigns one for soviet and one for US force, but you cannot play as US force because you hadn't bought the DLC yet, you cannot play it but it's still there to make you feel uncomfortable... Damn you Relic I felt sorry for you ! Because it's was a good game, the original company of heroes was a great game and for my opinion company of heroes 2 was a good game too if it's didn't make me feel like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ !!!! You are Evil ! Relic. Now you are nothing more than a bunch of Mad developers just like EA, Ubisoft, activision and Square Enix.			"

												Company of Heroes is a fast-paced RTS game. Which is perfect for a teamwork-based group of friends that like to play games together.I feel like this game is a more remarstered version of Company Heroes 1, despite it being an amazing game already, Coh2 provides some great graphics for intense and difficult battles.-Pros Good Graphics for a fast-paced RTS. Well optimised for low-end computers. Lots of mods for the game. Competitive structure for all skil-levels. Great AI difficulties provide some unexpected challenges.-Cons DLC is slightly overpriced. In-game shop is also overpriced. Too fun to play with friends.I personally rate this game a 8/10			"

												Unbalanced dismal rush only multiplayer, a completely forgetable single player and so much paid DLC that SOE and EA look like saints next to the BS Sega is pulling here. This game is so bad they needed to make DLC to try to basically turn it back into CoH 1. They failed. The entire feel is so very differnt which while not always a bad thing in this case makes the game feel more like a political statement then a game.I have put alot of hours into this thing and alot of money for the Officers, I can say without a doubt that I hope they don't make a CoH3. I played with friends for hours upon hours in CoH1 and we still quote the game ""Denickolose Williams Weapons and AMMO"" ""Conrad tie your damn laces."" We have nothing to quote excpet OOORRRRAAAAHHH over and over......The banter seems like a small thing but with the Americans ♥♥♥♥♥ing about corprate greed at home all the time and so on and so fourth it drags the whole game into a ""I don't want to be here."" mood that really makes me at least not want to play it.

												Well, it could have been a great game, tbh I really love the visuals here even the enormous ammount of lag but that is not the main issue of this game. BLOODY GREEDY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S OF RELIC that is the real issue at hand. You might say how can u ""not recommend"" a game if you hardly played half an hour of it. Well the game didn't let me play more because u see, for skirmish I have only 1 army option that lucky enough came with a bundled dlc otherwise I wouldn't have had that even, you must pay to get another faction options for skirmish. I said to myself well okay let's go to the campaign then and see if the storyline is any better and maybe it will even unlock some of the skirmish stuff for me. WRONG I have chosen the campaign I want, set the difficulty and was amazed to see that instead of a 'play' button there is a 'purchase' button. That's right my friends you have to purchase even the campaign so that is unplayable as well. Lastly before I head right for the uninstall button and hope that Relic die in agony for the greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s they are I decided at least to give the ""Theater Of War"" mode a try, so what we have there are four famous WWII operations, so I chose ""Barbarosa"" and guess what no bloody ""play"" button again instead u get the f'in ""purchase"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so, yes you must buy those too. End of the day what do I get for spending my bucks on this game - well you get Menus Simulator 2014 and some nice menu background music that sadly gets repetitive after the 5th loop - I guess you must buy a different tune as well. So bscly if you are not prepared to spend almost another full price on top of the full price u already paid for the game to be able to barely play it - STAY AWAY FROM IT ! And curse Relic into oblivion where they belong...			"

												Wether or not you should by this game depends on what you like, but I'm going to say some of the problems I have with this game and its developers. And its gonna be long, but If you're serious about getting this game I suggest you read through it.Balance:One of the most important things for a developer should be game balance right? Should come right after mechanics on the list of things to perfect. Well not Relic, its just content, content, more content, had enough content yet? And its like, yay thats good right? Long game long life? well no. Despite having ""beta"" tries before releasing large content updates (most recently the UKF) they still blatantly miss so many clearly unfair advantages that factions have. The list is too long to put here. Although they do usually fix it eventually, it takes weeks and even months for problems that clearly should have been patched in the beta.Mechanics:Anyone whos played this game will tell you that unit pathfinding is sometimes the most infuriating thing you've ever seen. Tanks that do donuts, scout cars that go around the map to get to the other side of a bridge, Mortar getting up and walking into the enemy line when you tell it to fire, etc. While one of the core aspects of Company of heroes is to require a lot of user input so your troops don't get shelled, having to check to make sure your units actually do what you tell them to do is just frustrating.Multiplayer and Map design:The Multiplayer ranking system that pairs you with opponents, while initally is helpful, eventually will put you at a rank where you can get paired up with people new to the game and people that haven't stopped playing since 2013Most of the really good maps in CoH2 are not available in multiplayer automatch.Content, oh god, the content:You'd assume a lot of content was a good thing, but just to put things in perspective, if you were to take all DLC to date for CoH2 at full price, including the game itself, you would spend over $370. For a game that still has mechanic failures and glitches, thats just sad.Developer Abandonment:The are numerous units, abilities, commanders, maps, game modes, etc, that the devs changed way back in the day, and never touched it again, rather than balance current content in the game, they just release unbalanced new content.Random Number Generator:Unlike some other RTS games, Like Age of Empires or Supreme Commander, when any units engage each other on the battlefield, while there are a number of factors as to who will win, a very large part is simply wether the game decides you win or not. This game is more luck based than any game I've seen short of card games. It is entirely possible, extremely unlikely, but entirely possible for a T-70 light tank to kill a King Tiger in a head on engagement. Wether your tank hits or not is up to chance, and wether it actually goes through is also up to chance, and wether pathfinding will let either tank run away is up to chance.And most importantly,Developer Greed: This game is an obvious cash-grab, but it didn't start out that way. Now take a look at their plan. They release unbalanced content, and don't fix it for weeks-months, so everybody buys it, because they want the advantage. Almost every single DLC to date has followed that pattern. They have a drop system for in game items that is so rare, and so inconsitent, so out of your control that you are compelled to want to buy a doctrine you want to try because you know you'll never get it otherwise. I know its a dying game, but if you like the RTS genre and WW2, get Company of Heroes 1 and its two DLC, it has its own balance issues, but it's more well made than this game. It was made back when the developers actually gave a dam.			"

												It's like that one Ubi game everyone loves but then they realize it was made by Ubisoft and hate it. Relic were good people but my affiliation is swayed with this iteration of Company of Heroes. This and its predecessor are marvelous games, and I highly recommend them. Just because there is a lot of DLC doesn't mean you have to buy it. Call it a money grab if you want, but it'll only take what you give it, and the base game is worth 30 bucks easy.			"

												Okay so ive played both the first one and the second one. the first one was great, actually insanely epic !!! when the second one came back in 2013 i was so damn excited. i started playing and was abit dissapointed, but ive now been playing it for a few years and i absolutely llove this game. it is abit monotonous with its one and only game mode but putting that aside the factions are great. this time CoH2 really challenges me with its AI, given im not that great but i can hold my own. with the added mods this game is even better adding more modes and maps etc. i must say though if you do want the full experience of the game the DLCs have to be bought, without them the game can get a little dry. im not going to go into depth about the game i just wanted to add my 2 cents and say that if you enjoy strategy WW2 games this is definitly a must buy !!!!  i would give this game a 7/10, if they just added more modes and a few extra features this game could be a 10/10			"

												The AI in this game is atrocious. Co-op computer teammates will park their troops in your base while the opposing AI team runs amuck on the battlefield (this even happens when you place a higher level difficulty AI teammate on your team. IE: You + Hard AI vs. 2 Standard AI). High artificial difficulty poses a serious problem because the game relys too much on the ""rock-paper-scissors"" style of troop effectiveness. It forces you to play reactionary because the AI always rolls out a counter to what you have put out on the field.			"

Posted: September 6, 2015
												First of all, I've played the orginial Company of Heroes a lot. I had around 200 hours into the original Company of Heroes game (not reflected in steam hours due to me having it played a pirated version with friends untill I finally bought the game a few years later on) which I've been playing from time to time on an amateur level for around 4 to 5 years. That being said, I'm just the average player in Company of Heroes.Now, I have conflicting thoughts about Company of Heroes 2.THE BAD:- Poorly optimised:This is a big issue, I'm running this game on an i7 2600k processor with a gtx770 graphics card while the game is installed on an HDD, (mid-tier pc). Loading times are crazy, even if you have this game stored on an SSD, your opponent might not have done the same so you will still be forced to wait untill both of you have loaded in.The framerate is also terrible, I first played this game on 'recommended' settings and noticed my framerate going below 60 a lot. In the recommended settings everything was pretty much changed to normal, the game on normal settings looks even worse than the original CoH (sarcasm.. or is it??). So I tried max settings, to see what it would look like. Strange enough after I've maxed out the game (a part from AA, set that on 2x) I surprisingly had a higher FPS, wait what?- User interface:The user interface is a mess, all sorts of icons of different colours and artstyles everywhere, they are not fitting together plus common usage of extremely ugly colours.The visual assistance in the maps also looks terrible when it comes to territory control, each flag has a circle around it with a colour which represents the team which is holding it, but it also has another outline which is indicating the border between said point and other points. This makes it look messy, should have stuck with the orginal Company of Heroes design when it comes to that. The minimap is also extremely bad, it's hard to find units on there.- BoostersNow, I used to be a Counter-Strike player, I'm extremely font of the idea of only offering cosmetics for money, nothing else. A game should also be extremely balanced and both sides should  have the exact same chance to win if they would have the exact same amount of skill.This game rewards you with playing by giving you boosters every now and then, which means they are rewarding good players with perks such as having a tank deal more damage, or infantry having more accuracy. Cosmetics is what it should stay at, never reward players by making them even stronger, their experience itself should make them strong enough already. Sad part is that you can even BUY these boosters together with commanders and other things.THE GOOD:- Still has most of the great mechanics and concepts from the original Company of Heroes, they have made a few changes here and there, such as having green cover while infrantry is walking next to heavy tanks etc. Really great improvements in general a part from a few things which I've mentioned here above. The multiplayer system is also pretty decent, you can earn XP for winning and losing matches, you can unlock cosmetics and slight boosts, the cosmetic part is fine but the boosts are absolutely not, e.g commanders and the other assets which slightly improve a select amount of things. (e.g riflemen have 3% more accuracy).- The matchmaking system is pretty great, I've played multiplayer a few times, usually matches me up within 30 seconds against a player of similair skill. Had a few mismatches a few times but that I don't mind.- Nice visuals if you can run it, eventhough it's poorly optimised, the game looks decent on max settings. Really gives me a kick sometimes when I call in an airstrike with lets say rockets to take out hostile light armour.My common sense is telling me I shouldn't enjoy this game due to it's way of making money and poor optimisation, but this is all outweighted by the good old Company of Heroes legendary gameplay mechanics.

												I've wasted 37 hours on this game (as of the moment when I made this review- I guarantee you that number is going to skyrocket over time), and I have not regretted a single moment of it. I have no regrets about every second I spent, desperately drowning the determined German advance with tides of equally determined conscripts as I buy precious time for my T34/76's to make it to the frontlines to crush that StuG pounding that machine gun nest suppressing that sniper attempting to kill that squad of engineers as they repair the machine gun nest, while a trio of Panzers attempt to smash through the right side offensive spearheaded by a trio of American Shermans with two British Crocodile heavy tanks, and a M10 Tank Destroyer right behind them with German 8-cm mortars falling about the armor engagement as infantry fight and die all around them in the muddy trenches of Hill 331. Yeah, it gets pretty hectic.This game also has workshop support, meaning you have mods. And thank the God-Emperor for those, as the most enjoyment I've gotten from this game comes from two mods- the More Units mod, and the Resources for Players mod. Both of these have added more playtime on this game dramatically for me, and I've spent too many weekends in a single game for an hour or more, deploying intricate defensive networks and minefields in order to destroy any possible hope the four expert AIs have of dislodging my 500 population cap tank force inching bit by bit up their territory as I build up dozens of mortar positions on my side of the map with barrage units, to crush their pitiful 'armies'. Oh. And OKW and British can be ridiculously powerful when played right. OKW has some of the most powerful heavy tanks in the game alongside Russia and Wehrmacht, while British use some extremely 'interesting' units. The base game comes with only two factions, the German Wehrmacht and the Russian Red Army. Both are just as powerful as the DLC factions, as all factions have their strengths and weaknesses. Wehrmacht generally follow a early to mid-game infantry offensive with a gradual inclusion of armor, while the Soviets turn out hordes of expendable infantry in a grind to get to it's formidable armor forces like the daunting KV2. OKW uses powerful but expensive forces overall, and it's early-game infantry and vehicles are devastating against other armies. Late game, it struggles until it reaches it's most powerful heavy tanks which can turn the tide of battle. More then just the units though, OKW relies heavily on how you play it, as many of it's units are highly situational, such as the thermal searchlight halftrack which can reveal enemies hidden in the fog of war, which is best used on the offensive with fast moving armor units.British play somewhat differently from their COH1 version, but many principles are still the same. They have access to the Sherman Firefly which is essentially a Medium tank, given the firepower of a tank destroyer. Pretty neat eh? It also has access to some of the more decent Allied heavy tanks, in comparison to the Russians and Americans. They also use some really powerful defensive positions like the BOFORS gun, which can rip and tear through infantry and light vehicles alike. Finally, there's America. The US army plays a somewhat intermediate game style, and depending on your doctrine, it can cater to several different playstyles, ranging from an airdrop heavy playstyle that can shred an unprepared opponent, to a slow and methodical armored push backed by artillery support. None of it's units are particularly spectacular, but that's because of the fact that the US Army has some of the best unit verastality currently available. Late game pushes with the US generally follow a mixed force doctrine, especially if you play a certain doctrine which allows vehicles and infantry nearby each other to coordinate fire, and to move faster. I personally play OKW and British the most, due to their heavy tanks and bombardment options. There's just something that is so satisfying about dropping a Stuka Fuß bombardment square on the enemy defenses followed by a Schwerer Gewher artillery strike, as a King Tiger and two Jagdtigers smash their way through the enemy as Panzer IVs blaze through the devastated cityscape behind them, leaving nothing but ash and rubble. That or sending a spearhead column of Crocodile tanks as they illuminate their way through thick undergrowth with spurting jets of flame as airburst artillery shells smash through the treeline, vaporizing infantry and light armor alike with HE shells smashing apart what few armor units there are with devastating accuracy. All in all, 9/10. I would recommend this game to anyone, especially if it's on sale.			"

												What is Company of Heroes 2? A freaking mobile game?!There are SO many high priced DLCs that feel as though they SHOULD have been in the base game. Only two base factions? One short campaign? A decently good multiplayer? Really? The US Forces are DLC, a second Germany faction is DLC, the British are DLC, the US Forces campaign is a DLC... And they're not CHEAP DLC either. They're selling you DLC for full-game prices. So let me break this down for those who aren't catching on.Multiplayer DLC                                            US Forces               $13                                                    2nd German Army    $13British                     $13                                    Campaign DLCUS Forces               $40British next???ExpansionsUS Forces Campaign, Single squad (FOX)Several missions for the original gameMiscellanious DLCTONS of skins for vehiclesTONS of perks that barely boost your performance (highest I've seen is a 3% increase)Several different leaders (different special units and abilities)You have to buy the US Forces TWICE! Once for their campaign, once to use them in multiplayer! Why?!?! The campaign is $40 as it is, and then you throw a $13 multiplayer charge on top of that? PLUS there's an expansion for the campaign that costs money as well? And it's only a new US Forces squad? I really do not mind the use of DLC to expand the experience, but it really feels like I'm being ripped off by purchasing CoH2. Even though I got it on a great sale. I bought the sale bundle and got DLC that I can't even use without the US Forces Campaign DLC, which wasn't included in the DLC bundle. Seriously? So now I either buy a $40 DLC, or I live with the fact I bought DLC I literally cannot use. In all honesty, I enjoyed CoH1 more anyway. There are a few improvements to CoH2, but not enough for me to justify telling anyone to buy CoH2 and ALL the DLCs being made. Stick with CoH1. You'll get the full experience of CoH2, but at an affordable price. :)			"

												Its very unfortunate that there is no other WWII RTS that can come close to COH2 or the first COH for that matter. This would be the only reason why i still play this game. On with the gripes now.PROS= Neat little ""true sight"" adds a depth of realism and strategy to the mix of RTS. Cleverly placing a bunker in an alley facing outwards with a mg42 can trap soviet infantry real quick. This is WWII and Coh baby and thus nice things happen. Things happen like hearing what sounds like a tank rolling around near by making you feel as if your that soldier. ""Tiger!!!"" lol. Or plowing a Tiger through a wall  and spooking the hell out your enemy. Sound is amazing especially if you have a sound system or a decent pair of headphones.Now with the map builder theres an endless amount of maps and game modes available to you and honestly you dont have to touch it. Just hop on the Steam Workshop and Presto your looking at creative map from players like you and me.I do like the variety of generals and the different supports they offer but... theres always a but. Cons= ... I dislike that theres always one support you want that is not on the general you need. You cant pick and choose and you always have a support that you will not use or that is usless to your playstyle. There still seems to be glitches here and there. one of them that is quite annoying is the german mg42 will set up and not fire for some time. a couple seconds nothing to crazy but thats all it takes for soviet infantry to rush up and throw a molotov. Today I sat in a game and had to tell my pioneer squad to rapair my PZR4 5 times!!! NO!! i need that repaired like YESTERYEAR! Multiplayer. Multiplayer. Multiplayers nice. If you mind waiting for at least 10 min at times. Other than that its quite fun actually. The biggest problem though is within the ai itself and that is blamed on the creators. Im not going to lie I only play Germans since i picked up the game during beta. The last two updates have beefed up the soviets pretty good. Mortors now no longer need a scout. infantry spam is plentyfull and boy do they use it. molotovs are a cheap commodity and is also used. QUITE OFTEN! and i dont frown upon that. During WWII soviets had more than double the infantry compaed to the Germans. The only thing that differed though is training. Im pretty sure an MG42 team will mow down the hell out of 2 squads of soviet infantry thats 5 feet in front of them. but no soviets somehow have that finese to run straight up almost every time and toss that flaming bottle of love. The  harder you choose the ai the more it will cheat. I played regular dificulty and i could manage on my own and if i screwed up i can regain the map rather quickly. Now that is not true. Ill get infantry spammed, and before i get my first tank out the enemy will have 2 and plenty of support. ???? seriously! and its just the same with 2 players vs ai. Actually its worse because 2 tanks turns to 4 and infantry spamming and molotov spamming doubles. I like doubling coupons not molotovs or tanks grenades. -_- soviets had numbers and cold(and Vodka). Germans had training, tactics and better tanks. oh and yes DLC is a pain. Sure they need to make the money and all but theres a limit. The least you can do is offer everything to those who pre ordered way before to kickstart the funds. -_- greed is the fire that burns our soul. Wait to buy this game when its at a lower price "

												This has become one of the larget homes for trolls on Steam. People seem to have competition to see who can be the biggest jerk. Relic lost their original staff and threw together a cheap staff of mediocre programmers. I have gotten better quality code from Patreon games. Their game balance designer or whatever is a clown.If you put together a solid defence the game will stupidly rush lots of units at your defences. This is a lot of fun to watch. However the game has a lot of flaws. You will tell a unit to move straight 10 meters and it will fail. I don't know how you can screw up moving in a straight line but Relic can. Your troops are programming to be stupid. Rifle units will fire on tanks and ignore infantry. Tanks will fire on infantry and ignore tanks. You have to super micro which can be entertaining and frustrating.			"

												Way too glitchy and, over saturated with detail to the point that items become obscured, they should learn from Civilization V that hyper detail is not needed for efficient gameplay. The original COH was vastly better in almost everyway. While COH 2 offers some new features that can be listed as improvements the overall feel of the game is less fun, the interface is also convoluted, as is the introduction of paid for upgrades like commanders. The paid for upgrades is a huge fail that might have worked if the game was anything as good as the original COH. We'll see this game perpetually on sale even less than a year after release why? Because it's simply not very good. Over detailed (yes believe it), cluncky, glitchy, with a handful of improvments, but hardly the rightful succesor to the original. 5 out of 10.			"

												This game was extremely disappointing, as a huge fan of the first Company of Heroes. Being a fan of the First CoH and even taking part in the Fileplanet beta back in 2006 Company of Heroes 2 was everything that the word disappointed embodies. The game has no real content that sets it apart from the first one. The game play is not just banal when compared to the original title but when comparing it to other RTS that were inspired by this title. One thing I noticed early on was their was no ""WoW' moments and the AI seems to be worst. Digressing back to no ""WoW"" moments. In the original CoH  when playing a hard long fought out match or maybe even early game and someone uses a smart flank or tactic that you over looked or didn't expect, maybe someone builds or calls in a unit that makes both teams have that ""wow""moment. Those moments that causes both teams to be re-energize. Sending both teams on a emotion rollercoaster to hold or defend or revamp or rethink an attack or withdraw or maybe a full retreat of a area they have held the whole game. If you're looking for that then this is not the game for you. I would recommend the original CoH and or just the stand alone expanation packs.			"

												This game is pretty terrible.  Don't listen to these reviews that give it a good rating cause it offers almost no fun to the player.  First off the the overall scale of the battles is pretty large so you think you would be able to scale the map out a little bit.  However the game doesnt allow you to do this and therefore you have to rely on the minimap or worse your soldiers yelling im under attack and then trying to figure out which one it is.  GL playing the germans cause the russians literally overwhelm you with conscripts that are way to overpowered for how many and how cheap the russians can get them.  They run up to you under gunfire completely unphased and drop an incendary grenade and its GG thanks for playing now buy another unit so they can do it again. The only good thing about this game is the graphics other than that its pretty terrible.			"

												Some may miss the American vanilla units but you can buy them if you want to. The newly added snow/cold weather mechanic is interesting mechanic which adds a layer of depth and something to be mindful of when playing those maps. The core gameplay is stronger than ever, and while it may not be revolutionary like CoH 1, Company of Heroes 2 is still a terrific RTS with a ton of content that no fan of the genre should miss.			"

												The campaign is so-so. If you truly want a good single player experience in this game, buy the Ardennes Assault expansion. The muliplayer in COH2 is really very good, Co-op being my favourite. Just be aware that there is a tonne of DLC which can be obtained for free through the warspoils system ingame. So, although it could probably take you a year of more of constant playing to get exactly what you want, you do at least have some semblance of recieving it for free.There are some toxic players, even in Co-op, but them's the hazzards in any game. If this is on sale - buy it, it's worth it.			"

												The game starts out very fun, a nice updated graphics pack compared to the original.  You develope good strategies and then get hit very hard  and are forced to adapt and develope new strategies.  All in all, this is good as playing the same thing again and again gets mundane very quickly.I don't know if there was an update that did this or if it was something that I didn't relize until the last month or so of playing; however, the pathing mechanics of vehicles seems to have gotten very bad.  What I call idiocy will happen with tanks when they are trying to fall back where they will either back into something, stop, turn 90 degrees, move, then turn back to continue to fall back; get clustered all together shortly after the order and effectively ram into one another; or they will ""butt wiggle"" and move a meter, turn a bit, move a meter, turn some more, move a meter and continue on this process until they manage to make it to where you want them to go minutes later or (since the order to fall back was given) are shot and blown up.Most everything about this game is good but I do take exception to the pathing mechanics mostly of the vehicles, though squads can do similar things and retreat forward/into a satchel charge and be annhilated.  Given that this happens at intense times of fighting and typically several times a match, I think there may be an issue with the code somewhere; however, it has brought enough frusteration for me and those I play with to uninstall the game entirely.

												An excellent Sequel to an Excellent RTS.It refines on the gameplay of the previous game while adding in new elements like truesight and vaulting which at first sight may seem minimal in effect but as you play the game reveal themselves to have a much greater impact and offer a great deal of tactical options.The Campaign is fun. Nice and long. But it does suffer a bit in my opinion from the fact that it tries to cover the entire thing from Barbarossa to Berlin and ends up being a bit unfocused. Personally think it would have benefitted much from focusing on a single event like Operation Bagration.Multiplayer as always is a tricky thing in regards to balance as things generally change as new ideas are mixed in. Was with CoH and so it is with CoH2. But overall balance is great there's always an option for a clever player and generally i don't feel like you're shoe-horned into a specific response.So overall. A most recommendable game and a must play if you were to ask me.			"

												To win this game you use the same repetetive strategy, build a sh-it load of tanks and march on to the enemy base. The other parts of the i really like capuring points to get more resources and strategicly taking parts of the map to secure victroy, well at least up untill you build that army of tanks, there is nothing the enemy can do then. The worse thing about this game is that i was not able to play the game. Company of Heroes 2 is very poorly optimised and i could not even play the first campaign because of the very poor framerate. My computer should run the game fine but it dosen't. There have been people on the internet saying that they have high end PC's but they still get a framerate like mine. Take the risk on buying this game for yourself, but if your computer refuses to run the game, then i told you so.If you do buy this game than prepare your wallet, it takes parts of the games away from you till you fork over more cash, reminds me of every EA game i have ever played.If i would have to say do or do not buy the game: I would say don't.  Just get the first Company of Heroes. The first game was better			"

Any decent player out there can do well without paying for any commanders. This is one of the best games I have ever played. I like it much better than the first COH. Once you become a dedicated player and really understand the game, there is no going back. If you come from the first coh it does take some getting used to but overtime you will start to realize why COH2 is so much better. I can't think of a better game out there and I am addicted to COH2. I can't wait to get back and start playing again.			"

From active, competitive multiplayer, to two very large, fleshed out single player campaigns, to an assortment of AI and Co-Op challenges in all difficulties, Company of Heroes 2 really seems like the RTS I've been searching for to keep me busy for the next while. For me, this game fills the void of being both a challenging and stable game: something Men of War: Assault Squad 2 just couldn't satisfy for me. I would completely recommend this game for anyone that is looking for a solid real time strategy title to learn and grow upon, and that can catch it on sale during this Winter/Christmas season. It's a real steal at $15.			"

												This game gives me mixed feelings. The community is great but the developers Relic couldn't care less. So first, the positive things. The game is RTS and it provides nice graphics, four factions (DLC for two more) and a lot of decent maps. Balance is usually an issue with RTS games where you have different factions. So is the case for COH2 as well. Relic Entertainment also managed to neglect fixing obvious bugs in the game and focus on releasing Adriennes (single player campaign) that VERY FEW of the COH2 community will enjoy. TLDR; Game has bugs, dev knows but doesn't fix them. Dev release DLCs instead of fixing bugs. Standard reply by Relic is ""We constantly work with fixing bugs and will to everything we can to fix them"". Still nothing happens.			"

												At long last, after so many months, THQ bankruptcy, and many hard moments for CoH community, this game is finally here. Its hard to believe, really. Game is above any of my expectations, regarding hard THQ times and limited budget. I dont know whats the point writing a review about the game which everyone had a chance to try on Steam these past weeks. As a result CoH2 is top seller on Steam atm. Because it sucks? I dont think so. This is not the game where it was insanelly overhiped (cough Bioshock Infinite cough), and you bought it blindly, and later complaining to fall on critic scores. CoH2 had Open Beta, and whoever wanted it he got it. Troll den, such as Metacritic, will be a heaven for those, hardly that insanity from Steam forums wont spill here: ""OMG, this game is just an expansion, CoH 1.5 at its best, rip-ooooooff"" ""OMG, this game is nothing like CoH, its completelly different"" ""They are showing us (Russians) as monsters"" ""They are using commies to show them like heroes, and theres no Americans in this game, boo-hoo"" ""Russians are completelly OP"" ""Germans are OP"" ""You can buy skins like DLC, this is pay 2 win gameeeeeeee"" Not to mention StarCraft 2, Men of War, and World in Conflict trolls stalking forums and You Tube comment sections. Some of them are submited their reviews already. Great visuals (vehicles are more detailed than in most other genre games), Great voiceover, just like Im used from Relic, and epic soundtrack. This game isnt perfect, I would give it 9, but Im forced to give it 10 because of these reasons.			"

												Relic really out did themselves with this one, CoH2 has greatly improved on the base that was set by the original CoH, there are subtle visual improvements and numerous hit-or-miss gameplay tweaks as the series moved focus from the West to the East. Of course the original CoH has held up remarkably well too. (if you havent played it, I absolutely recommend you do) The Campaign of CoH2 is great but the games true strength lays in its multiplayer and its great workshop support meaning there is never a shortage of maps to play on.As more and more games move into a modern focus its refreshing to play a WWII game, even more so when it isn't just about America and England vs Germany, this is all about the great patriotic war the Soviet Union waged against the Nazis.Great game, great rts, worth owning(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)			"

												The game looks and feels awesome to play, but unfortunately it is plagued by technical issues that, in 2016, I cannot accept. My inventory is full of fun Linux ports, I don't have to take this from devs any more.The most annoying ""feature"" is the fact that alt-tab (or moving to another workspace) will in 90% of the cases crash the game leaving you with two rogue processes you must kill manually in order to start the game again. (it leaves you with ""running"" in steam, even though the game has no window)It has no option to run in windowed mode, you'll have to edit launch options in steam. Even in windowed mode the game managed to crash when the window lost focus, again forcing me to kill the game processes manually.Too bad, otherwise fun game, but it will be refunded since it is broken beyond what I consider acceptable for a stable release.

												Company of Heroes 2... This game is really the best RTS game of all time. So I think its the best if I start with the positive components of this game, not atleast to justify my thesis.Relic really tried to configure this game very realistic, and yeah, in this point they were successfull. The models and textures are just perfect fitting into a WW 2nd-based game. Now we have 5 factions in this game, with the main idea to create the game that there is always a faction for anybody. Each faction just feels very different during playing, so the ""spectrum"" is very large. The so called ""true-sight-system""(the engine always calculates the line of sight of all units non-stop) of this game -which is excellent- allows very very much tactical possibilities, I say more than in a usual and more public RTS game. This makes this game so special compared to other RTS games, and in a ♥♥♥♥ing good way :D. Many people say, that the faction are unbalanced at the moment. I can`t really share this thesis. Especially in the early game, factions like OKW or British Forces seem OP. The reason for this is that they cannot be countered like other factions, here you need another strat. I am notsaying that this game is perfectly balanced. but saying the whole game is just unbalanced is wrong.And now the negative components...For me, the most annoying thing of this game is the fact that the matchmaking system is just ♥♥♥♥ing broken. Way more than a half of the games are extremely unfair, and it`s no matter if you compare the Rank-game-ladder-level or the level of the ""prestige/star-system"", you have very much of those matches. And I think newcomers become a bit frustrated as a result of this, when they have many matches vs top-players, and decent players become annoyed and start getting mad on the newcomers, when they loose matches because of them. Of course I know that it`s impossible to make only fair games in a multiplayer game, but the rate of unfair games is just a bit too high for my part. Thats just my thesis as a result of experience. Another component, as I already said, is the balance system of the factions. Basically, it is really ok, there are just still a few units that allow very very lame strats (e. g. King Tiger + Jagdtiger combination).CoH2 is my very favorite game. But to be honest, the negative components I summarised are not so ""hard"" for experienced players like me, newcomers suffer more because of them I guess.			"

												Honestly, the blitzkrieg mod for Company of Heroes 2 blows this game out of the water. There are not a lot of units to choose from and play around with. There is only one emplacement for the American team (machine gun nest) and it more or less immune to small arms fire. One guy with a .50 cal in a sandbag circle should not be able to take 10 minutes of fire from a half track from 10 feet away. The ""tech tree"" is almost non existant, making leveling up useless. To be straight to the point, the only thing I like about this game is on the American side they have supply tents with different weapons. Once you unlock these weapon tents your troops can walk up and grab a gun out (for a price) instead of having to wait for them to upgrade after waiting for them to deploy, and that really helps in a pinch.

												First up,i bought this game on special for 10 bucks with all the DLC.bargain.this is no *combat mission* and if you are familiar with that series you will know what i am talking about.this is an RTS in the style of C&C or similarfast paced action with really good art and animations ,excellent detail of units and enviroment.excellent sounds toosuprisingly deep game play,with quite alot of hidden perks and quirks,that only really become evident after playing games and gaining experience and knowledge of how stuff works.COH2.org is well worth the time to visit and read up on the stuff you will need to know.gameplay is fun and exciting and has multiple options for online play and number of opponents.plenty of replayability,get involved with human opponents and you will be playing for years.as i said ,its an RTS,so that means hitpoints and health bars to manage,and is pretty good implementationit is also a race to get to the top tier units that require time and resources each battle to unlock.very much a rock paper scissors implementation,which means you can counter any army with your own build strategy.the hard part is learning what to build based on what you have seen of the enemy forces throughout the early part of the battle,again,experience and hours played will help decide.Tactical positioning of units and a good understanding of your enemies forces, is very  important for a chance at victorygood solid rtswell implementedfast action,easy to get battles onlinegood value at 10 bucksonline ♥♥♥♥♥♥ factor is low8/10			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is just as great as CoH1, even better, I can't find that much negative to say about the game, only positive stuff. Great game, Great moments, Great community. Has one of the best campaigns I've played, minus two of the missions which aren't my type of mission. Stealth and Strategy doesnt go hand in hand. It does put both sides (axis and allies) in a bad light, but it's war, both sides did terrible stuff. But it also shows heroes, and you create the heroes in the campaign, why else would you have to capture a tiger tank with infantry? TOW (Theater of War) is also a great new thing for the game, and really adds to the CO-OP side of the game. some missions even allow 3vsAI which is cool. TOW also lets you play on both sides (DLC doesnt, Case Blue is german side while Victory at Stalingrad is Soviet) So you can say there is a german campaign aswell, and it can be played in coop mode. MP (Multiplayer) is also quite fun, I havent played much multiplayer myself, but playing with friends against the AI is so much fun, and that is what have kept me playing. the DLC is great, despite some of it being overpriced its worth it. And thank you Relic for sometimes giving the community some free DLC.TWFA (The Western Front Armies)Is also great, even though I've only spend about 10 hours I can already say that the expansion is worth the money. The Oberkommando West is not like the other factions and really shows germany's economy problems at the end of 1944 with high priced vehicles, and resources being more valuable, but also gives us some of the heavy armor we've all been waiting for in a game, who would of have thought that we would see a Halftrack with infrared lights?The U.S Forces are great too! really gives us some new toys, That we didn't see in the first game, and the ability to de-crew vehicles on command, that really leads to some interesting tactics, the downside is playing with the AI and seeing it steal your decrewed vehicle... Maybe you shouldnt let the AI get too close with their own vehicle crews?AA (Ardennes Assault)Dont' buy this campaign if you're not a SP player or intend to only play it once.The campaign itself is broing, not much of a challenge. There is no strategy to the metamap. All you have to do is walk around the map with any company and win the mission. It doesnt matter whether your company is cut off or anything, you can do as you please. The enemy does also not get any penalties once you cut them from a supply line. The missions themselves are also not that great, most of them are regular Victory Point games, so just go play skirmish as USF? They try to make these missions more interesting by adding in special handicaps, so you can be so unlocky you have to wait for 5 minutes for resources, again boring. The descriptions of the missions are also very misleading, they make the mission look way harder than they are. They do also make it look like some of the missions are timed, eventhough they aren't. You can play the campaign three times, if you have all 4 companies, before you'll start to find it very boring.The downside of the game is the war spoils (something like that), it works like the Team Fortress 2 drop system, only worse, I guess its bugged. But other than that its a great game, great graphics and great performance, mostly, sometimes delays appear when giving a unit an order.Please update the mod tools Relic!			"

												Englisch, Francais ,Espanol,  Deutsch.Actually CoH 2 bear aright the name""Game with the most bad play balance"".The Values of attack, the values of defence, the quantity of shots per minute,the strenght of perforation, the availability of an unit, are change constantly due to gigantic balance problems of CoH 2.Instead to create a counterbalanced game where the values of all units are fixed from the beginning to the principle-each unit has a counterunit wich is available at the same time, CoH 2 proceeds at the principle"" I create a unit and if this too powerful I change its game values and its availability"".This principle leads to the fact that each section has a certain aggravating advantage compared to an other section.Each new unit,generally with costs, or each new section with costs ,elevates the chaos.The games very often end with a mass attack, with as much troops as possible with advantages compared to other infantry to counquer recources points and victory points as much possible or with an immense building up of fuel depots wich help the player in possession of  a lot of tanks to overroll his adversary without a possibility of defence.Actuellement CoH 2 porte a' raison le titre ""Jeu avec l'equilibre la plus mauvause"".Les valeurs d'attaque les valeurs de defense, le nombre des tirs par minute, la force perforation, la disponibilite d'une unite, sont changes en permanence a la suite des problemes geants de balance de Coh 2.Au lieu de creer un jeu en equilibre ou des le debut les valeurs de toutes unites sont fixees au principe-chaque unite a une contreunite qui est disponibilite au meme temps-CoH 2 procede au principe""Je cree une unite et quand cette unite est superieure je change sa valeur de jeu et sa disponibilite.""Ce principe mene au fait que chaque groupe a un certein lourd avantage comparer a un autre groupe . Chaque nouvelle unite introduit, en general aux frais imposes,ou chaque nouveau groupe introduit aux frais imposes augmente le chaos.Tres souvent les jeux se finissent en attaque en masse, avec beaucoup de troupes d'infanterie que possible qui ont des avantages comparer a d'autre infanterie,pour conquerir des points de ressource et des points de victoire autant que possible,ou avec la construction immense des entrepots de carburant qui aide le joueur en possession d'un grand nombre des tanks de maitriser l'adversaire sans possibilite de defense.Actual CoH 2 tiene de derecho el titulo""Juego con el equilibrio el mucho malo"".Los valores del ataque , los valores de defensa, la cantidad de tiros par minuto, la fuerza de percusion, la disponibilidad de una unidad, son modificado permanante de CoH 2 a causa de gigantesco problemas del eqilibrio. En vez  de crear un juego equilibrado donde los valores de todas unidades desde el principio son fijado a el principio-cada unidad ha una contraunidad la que es disponible simultaneo-Coh 2 actua a el principio,creo una unidad y cuando la unidad es muy poderoso cambio sus valores de juego y su disponibilidad . Esto principio guia a la causa que cada seccion tiene una cierta agravente ventaja frente a una otre seccion.Cada nueva unidad introducido , generalmente pagando, o cada nueva pagando seccion, aumenta el caos.Mas muchas veces los juegos terminan con ataque en masa con muchas fuerzas infanteria que possible con ventajas frente a otra infanteria, por conquistar puntos de fondo y puntos de victoria tanto que posible o con la construccion imensa de depositos de carburante que ayudan el jugador en posesion de una grande cantidad de tanques de vencer el adversario sin posibilidad de defensa.CoH 2 trägt zur Zeit den Titel "" Spiel mit der schlechtesten Balance zurecht."" Die Angriffswerte, die Verteidigungswerte, die Schusszahl pro Minute , die Durchschlagskraft und die Verfügbarkeit einer Einheit werden Aufgrund von gigantischen Balanceproblemen von CoH 2 ständig geändert.Anstatt ein ausbalanciertes Spiel zuschaffen in dem die Werte aller Einheiten von Anfang an nach dem Prinzip , jede Einheit hat eine Kontereinheit, die zur gleichen Zeit verfügbar ist , geht CoH 2 nach dem Prinzip vor , ich schaffe eine Einheit und wenn Sie zu übermächtig ist ändere ich Ihre Spielwerte und Verfügbarkeit. Dieses Prinzip führt dazu das jede Fraktion zeitweise einen bestimmten Vorteil gegenüber einer anderen Fraktion hat.Jede neue meist kostenpflichtige Einheit oder jede kostenpfhlichtige Fraktion erhöht das Chaos. Die Spiele enden sehroft mit einem Massenangriff mit möglichst vielen Infanterietruppen mit Vorteilen gegenüber anderer Infanterie um möglichst viele Resourcenpunkte und Siegespunkte zu erorbern oder einem massenhaften Aufbau von Treibstofflagern mit dem der Spieler mit einer großen Anzahl von Panzern den Gegner ohne Abwehrmöglichkeiten überrollt.

												Honestly I regret spending that 20€ I payed for CoH2 during a sale until today. Not because I did not get a proper “value” out of that money but rather because I don’t like it one bit to have supported this kind of half arsed, crappy game developening style that Relic & SEGA pulled off.They basically re-skinned CoH1, just with worse performance, put in microtransactions, a few more units and still managed to make the game feel older than warcraft3, feature wise.They have pulled every move possible to milk as much money from this abortion of a game as possible with the least effort possible.The sad thing is, the majority of people who seem to play this game are really into CoH. I rarely see anybody who has not put 900h+ playtime into coh2. So that is a dead-set fan, which would indeed explain the just way, waaay to good ratings this game has. But then again, CoH1 has 95% positive ratings and coh2 around 75%, so that is at least somewhat of a statement. In theory CoH2 is a ""ok"" RTS, nothing outstanding or new, just simply an ok game. In reality however, it’s a half-arsed game that is an obvious money-grab, with tons of bugs, incredibly bad performance overall, micotransaction and a mind baffling amount of RNG.Honestly after 230H of playtime, I’ve seen enough that I can say with certainty that this game plays & feels like a alpha or beta version, but sadly that’s indeed the finished product I’m experiencing.I can only recommend anybody to go and find any other RTS. I'm serious, any other RTS will do better than this sheit.Warcraft, Starcraft, AoE, Codename Panzers... just look around. If you seriously can’t pick any of those X other RTS games that are around and are dead set on getting CoH2. Please for the sake of everything, only pick it up on a sale.Even if you want to buy CoH2 only for the singleplayer. Just don’t, it sux.First thing you need to know: this game is Pay2Win.There are 5 armys, each army should have 3 commanders.Commanders cost 3 - 4€ each. The commander’s you get by default are mostly garbage & the good ones you need to buy for € or grind with ingame currency. Grinding a single commander will take you around 80-hours, yes eighty hours, for a single one. And yes, commanders have enough impact on the game to be the decision between a win or a loos.Second thing you need to know: this game is heavily RNG based and even if you outplay your opponent and are winning by quite a lot, a single bad RNG outcome can turn the game right around. Now before you stop reading here and think: “that guy is probably a noob”, here are my ranks at the time of the review: http://i.imgur.com/8y1ZGTA.jpg  those are worldwide ranks btw. (more to that later)Anyhow, I could easily write an entire review just on how stupid the RNG in this game is, but I’ll just give this short example: You let 2 tanks fight against each other, exactly the same unit, no micromanagement. They just stand there and shoot each other. The outcome can variate from close call up to one tank wins with 60% HP left.Almost every single unit in this game works this way. They have % chances to hit/miss and then armor (vehicles) or cover (infantry) adds additional modifiers. It’s like a slot machine, you pull the lever you win, you pull the lever you loose. Enough to make even the worst kind of players win some games from time to time. Which is especially cancerous in team modes, when you get to play with/against people who are just in your “skill level” because they got lucky a bit in the last games.As the active player base is small with an average of 5k people online at all times, worldwide, this is a legitimate problem.Also to note, this game does not work, at all. Performance wise.It has: -memory leak (which will also make the game crash if you don’t restart all 3-5~ games played) -Random disconnects of players at the beginning of a match.-lots of players do have incredibly long loading times for no reason at all.-FPS drops no matter your hardware. (every DLC made the game worse apparently)-stutters at always the same time / “thing happening” in a match.-Graphic settings don’t do anything on “good” PC’s: ingame benchmark all settings maxed: 43FPS minimum, all settings on lowest: 50FPS min. - and all that while never seeing my CPU go above 30% and the GPU above 75% usage on either of the benchmarks (I7 3770 @4.3ghz, GTX 970 @1450mhz, 16GB Ram, game on SSD)Look at this cancerous performance:http://i.imgur.com/aSLakCH.jpghttp://i.imgur.com/hQKQE7D.jpg-the menu, due to extremely poor background design, is capped to 30FPS and sometimes will drop as low as 10FPS (some people do report 5FPS and less)-everything in this game takes forever, changing your loadout, opening a menu, switching game modes, waiting for a game to start, waiting for a game to end. You need to wait a good 15~ seconds until the game will display you the match overview for example after you have seen the victory screen.Pathfinding of units & how well units respond.Command & Conquer from the ‘90s is laughing at how f*ing bad CoH2 is in this aspect.Units will ignore commands from time to time and not move at all, they will constantly block each other if vehicles are involved. Even if you order them to do something, like to go behind “this” cover in “this” formation, they sometimes won’t do it properly as you did order.Vehicles are even worse, they are.... let’s just say a 10 year old is driving a tank, that’s the amount of “intelligence” you can expect from an vehicle. They need to be microed constantly, into the tiniest detail. Which is may or may not appealing to some. Reality is, the AI is so brainded, that they will, instead of reversing back as ordered, just do a 180° spin because the other tank behind them didn’t move away fast enough, so instead of waiting or slowing down a bit and continue to reverse, a 180° spin it is, which takes like 10seconds to execute.This game, honestly, has the worst AI I have ever seen in any RTS game, ever. Bugs..CoH2 is full of them. Units getting stuck behind fences or buildings in sandbags or such and can’t move anymore.Vision bugs giving you vision on enemy units you are not supposed to see.In every patch relic farts out they manage to bug a unit, which in turn will become OP and it takes weeks to be fixed.Games will get “sync errors”, so everybody looses and gets a loss counted to they’re stats.Visual bugs ranging from soldiers not being animated up to random “artifactcs” of your screen.Vehicles will warp backwards a few meters if they go full-speed and get a new order.Random crashes, random errors, random delays....Surrender sometimes gets bugged and you cant fix it.Well what else is there… let’s finish a short list.-One server for everybody. EU, US, Asia.. all will be teamed together happily. Performance or proper ping? Nah, f* that.  - Remember when I said “more to that later”? That’s why ranks are worldwide.Its also utterly fun to get teammates who dont speak a word english.-Chat censorship, this game is 18+. The units in the game curse. The chat replaces F*ing with “gardening” and does the same with other curse words. Because adults of legal age need monitoring.-Matchmaking is crappy most of the time. There are barely any close games, it’s mostly stomp or get stomped. Also the game does not give a f* if you are a premade or random team.-You can not make your own keybindings in this game or even rebind any keys. These are the controls you have, get used to them.-There is no report and/or punishment system for cancerous players. Like trolls, teamkillers, leavers, people who are just AFK or kids who tell you to get cancer and wish that your family would die. Good thing we at least have chat censorship, right?


Obviously this thing is ment to be there.

												After putting in over 100 hours into this game, I guess I'll do my personal take on it. Company of Heroes 2 is in my opinion, a great RTS. There are some design choices that the company went with that I'm not too happy about, like all the paid DLC. However; I guess we can't escape the gaming of today, since all of it revolves around paid content afer release. Anyways, aside from the obvious things, this game is fantastic. It's fun, fast paced and very strategic. I do believe they took it a further step in the right direction vs Company of Heroes 1 as far as mechanics go. The cover system is improved and it doesn't feel as RNG as Company of Heroes 1 did during battles (Even though RNG still haunts this game -_-). I would recommend this game to any of my friends that enjoy the Real Time Strategy genre. However, I would hold off on purchasing this title if it's not on sale, simply due to the fact that there is so much DLC.			"

												In short: Buy the Original.I wanted to like this game, I really did. I love the first one, it's well balanced, tactical and not just Age of Empires without the resource gathering. Oh and yeah it has no micro transactions. COH 2 is simply a case of whoever has the most infantry wins untill tanks come along and then who has the most tanks win. However thing is you don't get access to the full tech tree, you only get access to certain units past the basic 7 or so, to get access to more you unlock with your commanders of which you only can have one per match. Like the first game right? Nope. In this game there are heaps of them and you get three commanders at the start for free, (which you don't choose) and they give you a couple of units, every other one you have to buy with real world dollars unless you get lucky and get them as a reward and of course these are the ones with fun and powerful units. Want a KV flame tank? That will be $6, a Pershing? Another 6, want British Engineers who can salvage scraps? Time to get the credit card out and pay some more. So basically if you like pay to win micro transactions, spamming infantry in a numbers game then this game is for you. Otherwise buy the first one.			"

												Im just gonna keep it simple.The game is way too expensive, especially when there selling serperate faction dlcs for 12 dollars and commanders for 4 dollars. This is literally outrageous. The game is worth 40 dollars when the dlcs become free and commanders get lowered to a dollar each. I dont think that Relic realizes a lot more people would be happier and a lot more people would buy the game if they did this.			"

 The Process of Taking Cover Arguably the most important thing in any armed conflict is taking cover. How did a game that focuses on micromanaging troops in combat screw this up so badly? 1.  First you have to click on the unit. Sounds simple enough, but for some reason I had a lot of difficulty with this. For some reason, units would not always select / de-select on the first click, sometimes it took two clicks or box selecting the unit to do so. That is just unacceptable. It lead to a lot of wrong orders, wasted time, and deaths. How can a game that is two years old not have that figured out? 2.  Order the unit to take cover. The fact that I have to babysit each unit to order them to take cover blows my mind. How could they not code the most basic of human instincts of taking cover when being shot at? It would be one thing if the cover was far away, you did tell them to move to the open location, but if a stone wall is just 5 yards away and they are under machine gun fire, why do they wait for your command to take cover rather than just moving? 3  Now make sure they actually move. In addition to waiting for a command that should not need to be ordered, once it comes, they don't always follow it. Sometimes I had to repeat orders to take cover, not because they were being pinned down by supressing fire, but because they were so busy standing and shooting they ignored me. 3.  Once they actually move, make sure they take the correct positions. For some reason, my units loved to hop over and ""take cover"" on the wrong side of the wall. W...t...f...? At first I thought I was clicking on the wrong side of the wall, but I was not. They take cover on the right side of the wall and then jump over to chase retreating units, a command I neither gave, nor desired because there were still enemy units holding the line that quickly targeted and killed them. 4.  Even though they are now in cover, you still cannot relax. One of the great features of this game is the distructible environment. The infuriating aspect of this is that your idiot troops don't shoot around cover, they shoot through it. Yes, you read that correctly, when hiding behind a wall, your troops will attempt to shoot through the wall rather than around it. Judging by tracer rounds and riccochet / impact effects, about 33%-50% of all rounds hit the wall. If they are behind a tank or truck, it's more like 50%-75%. How can they be so stupid as to destroy their own cover and shoot their own allies? How can they not figure out how to shoot over the wall or around the vehicle? I wouldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if they hid behind the wall, closed their eyes, poked the gun out, and blind fired the entire mag aimlessly and never even came close to the target, at least they wouldn't be aiming down the sights at the wall and still shooting it. Within seconds, the wall will crumble due to the combined friendly and enemy fire and your troops will be out in the open. 5.  Now that your troops have destroyed their cover and are out in the open, return to step one and repeat the process. Don't forget about your 15 other equally stupid units, they all need micromanaging too.If this seems like your game, go for it. It's not all bad, there are some great features like weather, map details, destructible environment, and the visual and sound effects, but they all sit on the core of the game, which is ordering troops to take cover. Whether they are advancing, retreating, defending, or supressing, they need to be in cover, and because that is broken, the whole game is.Needless to say, I do not recommend this game and am grateful I never bought it and only played on free weekends.

												Despite the terrible state of the game at launch; this game has seen vast improvements and polishing. Many new maps and commanders have been added into the game, which was the main problem at the launch of Company of Heroes 2. But on the other hand, the adding of all this content has created quite an imbalance. It seems soviet players are at a bit of a disadvantage. At the rate the developers are working on the game, I definately know this is going to be finally fixed and polished, so everything works out well. With the addition of western fronts, the game might actually become a worthy sucessor to its prodecessor, Company of Heroes. Which, is arguably one of the best RTS games ever made. After playing around as much as I have with the game since launch, I definitely recommend Company of Heroes 2.			"

												This Will Be a Short review on why this game is very good. As you may have seen other negative reviews , the problem with this game isnt the gameplay , its the Game Dev's being greedy and adding a Swath of microtransactions and Dlc's.What i Recommend is simply buying it all when on sale , which i did for only 20$-30$. Ok , now to the review. The Gameplay is very refreshing , theres base building , Most maps are symetrical with different terrain modifiers (Snow , Mud , Forested areas , all having penalties on tanks , infantryman). Unit models are gorgeous , From Tanks to the Gun in a soldiers hands , it all is very well done , and i find the Unit Portraits Well done. The Base game comes with 2 factions (Wehrmacht , Soviet Union) with another Dlc (Containing 2 others , American Forces , OberKommandoWest) and the final with the British Forces. As im still learning their Pros's and Con's , i suggest you look them up yourselves. Multiplayer is extremely challenging , but rewarding if you can win a match , theres 1v1 , 2v2 , 3v3 , 4v4. This is Just a Small review , i hope you find it helpful. Peace Out			"

												This game is no better than the first COH game and their expansions. It is a mediocre real time strategy with good elements and experience system but the gameplay struggles. Very small piece of the map and units are viewable from the game camera, atmosphere has new developed parts like cold weather storm, doctrines and commander system is better but the gameplay is not good enough plus you have to update it so often.  The game has better NETWORK communication and multiplayer technology but COH 2 gameplay has not made it yet. We purchased it for 40 USD and it is not worth it, I would rather give it 10 usd for now till they develop or change it as I mentioned above. It was not what we have excpected and it deserves not to be played. (and they have just made the game near 10 usd now)...:) Hope system requirements are lower for the other players. My score is 62 /100 ! but it is no better than the FIRST C.O.H  right at that moment. Enough game but we have many more other better choices.			"

												If you've never player the original Company of Heroes then this is a decent game, unfortunately if you have you will know (if not admit) that CoH2 lost most of what made the original special. This one feels less responsive and strategic, the only thing this brings to the table is the winter maps, apart from those it looks and feels like a step backwards instead of a sequel. Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor sadly seems to be where this franchise peaked, I advise you to get that instead, plus you'll save some money.			"

												For my blog http://gamoha.eu I wrote an article in German about Company of Heroes 2: The Western Front Armies. I will sum up the results of our review and like to invite you to visit our blog:Company of Heroes 2: The Western Front Armies is a well done Standalone-Addon. The developers have created the game with great attention to details and the game will provide a high fun factor for experiences and new players. It challenges for individuals and team players alike, even though you can lose overview to the battle very quickly.  Another argument buying the game is that you can play together with other players who only got the retail version. New player will need a little more time to discover the various style of using units and their abilities. The combination of units which is a key element of the Company of Heroes games will need practise and experience. For the future we would like to have better balancing of all fractions and additional content.

												The game had potential and can be fun sometimes, however, expect to pay a lot of money. There is tons of DLC and then more DLC for that DLC.If you have nobody that is willing to throw money at the game with you, I would say avoid it. There are many more WWII and even more better Strategy games out there.-----------------------------------------------------Extra Information about paid DLC -----------------------------------------------------The theaters of war are small maps that are most of the time regular matches but with limited units. They are meant to be played by a single player, though sometimes you can play some with more players for Co-op but they have to have wasted money on it too.I would not recommend them. The Ardenes campaign is fun, but can be fustrating to beat on hard, it is also kinda weird but the paid DLC is almost a must for this DLC. It is another single player mode but this one is not bad.The skins and faceplates DLC are useless and grab only if you want to be fancy looking or be smart and use one of the Free ones from the Community. (They Might break the game, with bugs. That's their punishment for not buying their skins, I suppose.)Different Factions brings a lot of diversity to the game and perhaps the only DLC that I would recommend. However, expect to then be baited to spend more money buying more stuff for each faction.Commanders, More DLC for DLC, Instead of giving you the whole faction they want you to throw more money at them for no reason. Some change the way you play drastically, some just don't really do anything. Buy at your own risk, or just wait to get them for free when they rarely are given to you after a match.			"

												Ok, where shall we begin with this...Company of Heroes is a series I grew up with. I played the first game 10 years ago and no matter what, I always came back to play some more of it. Up until some months ago when I ran out of patience and eventually stopped playing. Here is why.Generally speaking the game is great fun but there are several specific factors that make the experience especially bad and irritating. Note: I will mostly talk about multiplayer since this is the main mode of the game, but my statements apply to the game as a whole, more or less.-RNG. Too much RNG. Especially when it comes to abilities regarding anything explosive. From grenades to heavy artillery support. The amount of times the number generator changed whole matches is overwhelming, it can deem whole strategies or plans useless.-Imbalances. I do understand that relic wants to deliver every faction with a completely different build and purpose. That is an incredible idea. But this also requires looking into every unit and every ability within a faction very very carefully. Since NO faction or unit is a copy of another the balance has always been a nightmare. From underpowered but costly units to utterly broken updates. (USF/OKW Release, UK Release etc)-Matchmaking. If you desire to play anything except 1v1 soloqeue the matchmaking is basically...non existent. Completely random. This makes new players to either go to unorganised custom games or just patiently wait for the very long learning curve of the game, to be able to compete with others. From personal experience, and the experience of the people from my gaming group we've seen ourselves countless times play against teams with average playing experience of 1 000 hours, where our own team of four did not exceed that in total! -Learning curve. Combining the overall complexity of the game with the utterly broken matchmaking system, the learning curve of this game reaches a very high ammount of hours needed. From the experience of people from my gaming group you need several hundred hours only to be able to understand all aspects of the game and use them with average effectiveness. -Generally a very DLC monger game, but since most of them add a considerable amount of content and that nowadays the game is sold in collection packs one can overlook that.Final words-----Now, what makes me sad is that; this is a very good game, or at least it could have been. But the negative points are so obvious and irritating that reqcuires you to just constantly suppress your anger. Not because you are a bad player...but just because a random grenade detonated in the middle of the enemy squad, right at their feet without killing any of them, or just because you have to lose a match or two (and 30-45 minutes of your life) just to be able to play another match that you can enjoy, with equal opponents.I love the series, I am twenty years old now I play these games since my childhood. Having to give a negative review makes me sad and nostalgic. But truth be told, at it's current state, the game itself needs to be abandoned. I am waiting for CoH 3 with great anticipation.			"

												I am a Turkish citizen and this game is  reaaaally biased towards russia and the eastern front. While the majority of the evil stupid and bureaucratic as hell soviets did their very best to lose their homeland, there were only a few non soviet crititics and free thinkers that gave soviets the victory. if this game was published in 1942 nazis will use this game as a propaganda tool to educate their kids. Executing a soldier who performs great bravery to save his lieutenant ?!! The were no heroic moments in the game except for the polish nationals. Seriosly !? In previous title relic entertainment portrayed a waffen ss battalion as simple people who defended their motherland but you denied russians  a sliver of glory for defending their motherland in spite of great logistic and technical inferiorites  !?  I cannot agree more with bad comedian in this matter(justin bieber guy you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off ). Even everything this game portrays is true and factual (I highly doubt it ) storytelling method for the game is really something hitler youth would come up. Why relic entertainment  didn't showed the brutality of nazi germany when soviets entered and liberated (sorry relic they really did ) and fed those prisoners  just to have a balance (your claim not mine) ? as I stated earlier I'm a turkish guy and  not responding over national instinct. I am a big fan of world war 2 lore but I am sick of how mainstream media portrays american and british soldiers as heroes and patriots and full of neccesary sacrifices  but russian front  as a mere zergling swarm because socialism is baaad. I didn't buy ardennes assault but I am sure we will be playing the ""good guys"" there.			"

												Alright you maggots, are you ready to get involved in possibly the greatest war second only to THE Great War? , well too bad.Yeah if you came here looking for a historical look at WWII through the eyes of the Soviet Union or even the United States, you'd be a fool. You'd also be a fool to buy this game at full price like I did, and it's DLC, for full price like I did, trust me boys and girls and everything inbetween it's better you just buy this and everything for it when it's in a Summer / Winter sale.Now hold on don't go let me give you the review so for anyone looking for a number I give this game a 6/10 slightly above average / average.Alright to the real review!Graphics: The graphics are overall pleasing, I feel like some of the textures could've been higher and to be really honest, the Animations are only really decent, they hardly went all out on them, after all if you pay close attention to a soldier reloading his fingers don't move and the ammo he's reloading sort of just clips into the gun. But otherwise they're still nice, and in fact if you play it as intended, zoomed out a little and flying like the all seeing eye the game looks rather great, trees and foliage need a little more work but I've seen very few games make them adequate in my eyes. Also I personally would give this warning, Do NOT play this game if you do not have a high end / upgraded PC you will have a very hard time playing it, the graphics on my PC are pretty good and even then I have some problems.Sound design: Oh I must admit I looove the sound design it's really good, and the voice acting for the characters and vehicle drivers is probably my favorite bit of this game, but it is CRIMINAL to not mention if you want to hear a better bit of the sound design you should have a unit engage then pan to the edge of the map and listen to the far off echo of the gunfire. That was a lovely little touch and I wish it was more a part of the game since it comes off as ""just ambiet noise"" and it's not, it's still lovely to listen to a .50 cal firing a quarter mile away. Gameplay: The gameplay to CoH II is actually very fluid for the most part, infantry combat can go either way and generally speaking it comes down to which faction you're playing, how experienced you are with counters , cover, and concentration but that's really only going to be important in multiplayer, Skirmish is a blast though in my opinion, here's a quick rundown of unit types for those of you fanatics out there like me who wanted to see what they tossed into this game to make it interesting, let's just throw some Soviet units out there : Basic infantry - Conscripts, Engineers, Penal Battalions. Weapon Teams - Maxim Machine Gun Teams, 81mm Mortar Teams, 76mm Anti Tank Gun Teams, Light Vehicles - American Lend Lease Armored Car, American Lend Lease Half Track, Russian T-60 Light Tank (37mm gun). Medium Tanks And Light Artillery - SU-76 SPG / Tank Destroyer, T-34 Medium Tank, SU-85 Tank Destroyer, Last but not least the favorite of any tank fan , Heavy Tanks - The IS-2, KV-1, And KV-8 (A KV-1 with a flamethrower and 47mm short barrel gun.) Overall the list isn't too shabby, but obviously there are going to be problems with people's expectations and what you get, but I think the unit list isn't too bad.Now I won't talk about the Campaign much I'll just say this, it's not great, in fact I'd say if you played it for the story, if you have Russian Lineage that served in The Great Patriotic War, you'd probably be offended by it, but to be fair, this was a Canadian look at the Russians, Long story short I think the game is getting a lot of negativity without it being brought on about the game itself, I'll agree the price tag is outrageous, I'd call it a 20 dollar game at that but the DLC chopping is pretty bad too.. there are a whole 3 factions in the DLC waiting to be brought back to the game, and one of them (The Oberkommando West) was both uneccessary, and clearly not balanced well enough, even to this day it's hardly a finished faction so many problems are brought up with that faction, for instance they have such a vastly superior group of infantry that the Russians practically can't fight them without Shock Troops or without massive blobs of Conscripts but the problem isn't just in their infantry it's their ability to be the faction with the fastest ""tank"" roll out in the game, by that I mean they can start building and have built a tank by about a 4-8 minute lead on the other factions, and it's just utterly moronic to have to deal with it if the person controlling it knows what they're doing. Personally I wish they had added literally anything other than ANOTHER German faction, sure putting the Italians in there would've been hard to do what with their lack of armor, but look at what they did to the poor U.S. , the U.S. has a massive arsenal to choose from and they put a Tank Destroyer in the main Tank building that wasn't even mass produced, they don't even put the Hellcat in there, they put a Jackson in there though!, what!?Arrgh now that I think about it this game is a bit irritating, but only really in Multiplayer, the story is trite but no one should buy it for the story. Skirmish is fun though, and the community is busy making maps so it's always a fresh new bit of gameplay to try a map you've never seen before.Hopefully this small essay didn't turn anyone away from the game without at least looking up some gameplay on YouTube of it to see if it's your thing.

The basic mechanics are fun to play , even one of the best of the industry but the balance definitly breakes this game , if you want a competetitive and fair RTS do not buy it , seriously . i would suggest Coh1 instead but that game is broken beyond repairs with the online server.Relic , you should feel ashamed to deliver a game in this state.

												9/10The gameplay is in its own sense unique, and what I personally feel why most people do not like it are unbalances within the gameplay (I agree with this), however that forces the player to be more tactical and competitive. Most CoH1 players were expecting CoH2 to be more or less exactly like the first CoH only with Russians added into it and new German doctrines/commanders. This game would be a solid 10 for me if (I hope) they add a foreign troops faction in the near future.2016: Still no Romanians or Hungarians despite LELIC wanting to 'capture the significance that is the Eastern Front'			"

												Company of Heroes 2 comes off strong with its new campaign, and it packs an impressive amount of extra features. Standing on its own, it is an impressive real-time strategy game, but there are people who want to know what makes this better than the beloved original Company of Heroes. The simple answer to that question is that it's more of what they love.The sequel brings a new campaign, new multiplayer maps and units, new co-op modes, more explosions, more units on the field, and deathly winter combat, all presented with the gameplay that made the first such a hit. It stays true to its roots while bringing in enough new, compelling content to make it worthwhile.The sequel to one of the best strategy titles out there, Company of Heroes 2 lives up to its predecessor. The game focuses on the Eastern front of World War II, and during the campaign the player takes on the role of the Russians. It's a slow-paced RTS, with a big emphasis placed on unit placement and having troops stay behind cover if they want to survive.The utterly fantastic campaign is among the best I have played in a strategy game. Missions are varied enough that different tactics have to be used to win each one. There are some defense missions that are so hectic I had to constantly readjust my troops to face new attacks coming from all sides. One mission takes place in the snow, and you have to prevent your troops from freezing to death by moving close to fires, or keeping them inside.Another one of my favorites involved hunting down and destroying a Tiger tank, which I ultimately accomplished by luring it into a series of mines I placed as a trap. There are 14 missions in the campaign, and each one takes between 20-60 minutes to complete depending on the difficulty and how terrible you are at playing.All of the new mechanics fit well with the Eastern Front setting. Lots of soldiers will die, and CoH2 does a brilliant job of making it expensive to lose troops.Taking over an enemy territory will certainly require you to sacrifice a lot of men, and sometimes you'll have to do it knowing you won't be able to replace them easily.I was always faced with some form of a choice with each unit. ""Do I have them run in and face certain death, or do I hold back and wait for a better opportunity?"" Better opportunities don't always come, and sometimes the only way to win the battle is to lose a fight.Alongside the campaign, there is the ""Theater of War"" mode which includes a series of co-op and single-player missions and scenarios. This mode is meant to provide more battles along the Eastern front that don't tie in directly to the campaign.The scenarios are tightly-focused missions revolving around one aspect of the war that year, and they are some of my favorite missions in the game. Company of Heroes 2 shines the brightest for me when I have three squads and keeping them alive is insanely hard. The co-op missions are large-scale battles that pit players against a computer opponent; the rest are simply single-player missions that use the multiplayer maps and have a computer opponent.There is a competitive multiplayer, of course. It's what gave the first game such a long life, and it's just as solid in the sequel. It plays out the same as in the first game, either with players fighting over control points or simply trying to demolish each other. This time around there are all new maps and units, which is enough to make me want to play the same style of game. If you are a classic fan of the series and you're only interested in the multi-player, it's hard to say if you'll find enough here invest in this if you already played the first.Company of Heroes 2 brings the classic gameplay of the original game into the modern era. It has all of the familiar mechanics while embracing new technology to make everything look and respond better. The physics are very realistic, and just about everything can be destroyed.All of the cover can be destroyed if the other guy has a big enough gun. Hiding behind a fence might be great for stopping bullets, but tank is going to destroy the wall and everyone behind it.Company of Heroes 2 is an excellent real-time strategy game. The campaign is challenging, varied, and true to the setting of the war. The atmosphere is intense and filled with bass-rumbling sounds, and an orchestral score that provides the perfect background. It's visually impressive, yet manages to run at a smooth frame rate.Company of Heroes 2 is shining example of what an RTS game should be: a mix of classic mechanics with new features and technology.

												Company of Heroes was an amazing game, and this sequel is worthy of the title. AI battles keep me playing years after release, and new content/patches continue to be released. Definitely worth purchasing, especially if you can find it during a sale. Highly recommended.			"

												Summary:[+] This game is a wonderful one. It's fun, has a lot of small things to take into account and a great variation depending on which team you play. The small things matter which is always lovely in a strategy based game. Many maps and a hell of a war-feeling to it.[-] However, the current state of the Matchmaking system, is seriously broken and will put you up against people with 10-20 times the in-game hours you've got.Verdict: Don't buy this game unless you're prepared to spend numerous (hundreds) hours playing against bots. Because the MM will show you just how bad you are at the game and you won't get a chance to turn the games around or understand what you did wrong, because the good players are so beyond your level of play that you'll be a bleeding kitten swimming in a pool of hungry piranhas.------------------------------------------------------------------At the moment I've invested 31 hours into this game. I played CoH back in the day and had a lot of hours and know the game mechanics fairly well. When me and a friend (40 hours played) search for matches, we get matched with people who've prestiged one, two and sometimes even three times. How can they claim the MM-system is a working one?I have yet to have a game with people at the same skill level as me. At the same time they claim that the MM-system actually is fair and should match you against players at the same level as yourself.How come it doesn't then?I see a lot of posts on the internet regarding this, some people (good at the game, many hours) defend this, because if they get matched with a good player(s) they will have a chance because of their skill level. Many people (mostly not so good, few hours) are complaining they simply can't use MM at all because of the uneven matchmaking that currently rules the games. I will lose interest in this game way before I reach that level. It's simply to challenging and not fun to be matched up against players with 700+ hours. At the same time it's not realistic that a game forces you to play 200 hours against bots before you can even try to make a difference in 2v2, 3v3, 4v4. The 1v1 is pretty much 50/50. Sometimes you get a player closer to your skill level, sometimes you get one with a hell of a lot more time invested than yourself.I'm sick of this and I have yet to find a post from developers that take this criticism seriously, no matter how constructive it might be.I'm sad to give this a bad review as I love the game, the feel and everything around it. The MM-system is what's broken and has to be fixed. I rather stay in a queue for 25-30 minutes than get matched after 5-10 against opponents who will stomp with ease.			"

												Original CoH easily a contender for my fav strategy game ever. I'm finding it hard to even say this one is ""as good"". It is a good game, but it is so ♥♥♥♥ing bogged down by items that take the rest of your life to unlock and dlc that in some cases has more dlc inside the dlc. Overall experience suffers by being surrounded by constant ""hey you wanna buy more? More? MORE MORE MORE???!?!?""			"

												I recommend this game who likes WW2 RTS.s Its the best one out in the market. Many of the people are complaining about balance but also ALL of them ignore their opponents experience/game play.I bought this game pre-release and since then I play the game. Sometimes I play well and sometimes I play bad. Balance issues are mostly solved, there may be some units OP and some UP but it is how it is in real lie. A King Tiger can outrun 3 Shermans. And US riflemen can outrun Wermacht soldiers in the distance. "

												This is an excellent successor to the original COH. COH2 is a world war 2 RTS game where you capture control points to get fuel, munitions, and manpower. You can play as different ww2 factions which have different units and strategies. If you've ever had any interest in WW2, you owe it to yourself to play this game.The multiplayer is a very strong part of this game and I found it to be enjoyable. It's especially fun to team up with a friend against other people and have a good time. There is both a serious part of the multiplayer ladder and a casual part, so every skill level does well. My one complaint about this game is the pay to win commander selection. Commanders dictate which special abilities you get (for instance a special tank call in or an air strike). Some of the commanders you get by paying for them or being very very lucky and getting them in a drop.			"

												Highly recomend this game. Kinda absurd how much I like it. It feels like when I first got my hands on CoH1. The amount of fun this game brings is insane. Definitely one of the all time greats of the RTS series. At times it feels like a rehashing of the same old CoH1 stuff but for whatever reason makes you enjoy it. I went ahead and picked up the base and all the DLCs for a decent price. A bit overpriced in my opinion but for CoH fans.....worth it 100%. The amount of units at your disposal is really refreshing. The whole choice over commander thing is nice as well other than the whole buy exclusive commanders thing. The base commanders are really ""meh"" but they get the job done. The negatives are there, few but they are there. Tank traps being a commander ability for others than the US EWWW, Allied forces seem underpowered (primarily the US), Pathfinding can be a bit of a pain, online player base can seem a bit childish compared to Coh1, and finally with all the interesting units I find myself angry because I simply don't have the pop cap to really exploit it.Overall 8.5/10 would buy again.

												Alrite. Now for all you people out there complaing that relic is being on a rampage cash grab, well please do think about it, you may buy on of these packs as a standlone nation and play it without the full game itself. How many games allow you to play a part of itself? Most game like CoD you cannot get acess to the newer stuff unless you buy that dlc? Sure it may lack some of the humour of the older game but still its pretty.Now about the in game store, yes it allows people to just buy ""overpowered"" commanders and go ham especially when you do a pvp one vs one, but if you really want, go download the 125 all units unlocked mod, get some friends to join you and you can have fun with all the units availe for your nation right from the get go, just commanders get a discount when summoning speical units. and you can still gain Exp from that! So long as you intend on playing PvE against AIs and with friends, the P2W gap really doesn't matter alot. so pick you posion.I would strongly recomend buying the other nations when there is a sale on like now.

Even known it does have some big flaws, like the terrible drop sistem, and the huge price of both the game and its sadly important DLC. It is hard to recomend it due to its huge price, but if you manage to get it on a good sale, like RTS games and you are interested in WW2 you would probably like it even known it has its flaws.			"

												Well, I only played about 1/3 of the campaing (I am about to finish it) and I suck at multiplayer like a pro porn star, but I still like it.Singleplayer has more variety of missions than a first game, just like different commanders in multiplayer make game a lot more fun than doctrines. Units are a lot less stupid (yet drivers of armored vehicles are still suffering by stupidity sometimes), covers work better, soldiers are able to jump across fences and walls (thank f♠cking god!) and stars of veterancy look so much more cool. Plus I have a better feeling about the game in general.Matchmaking is nonexistent, which is not so good for noob players like me, yet still playable. Yes, DLCs cost a lot, but when you wait for Steam sale, it's definitely worth it.			"

But it's just a constant source of frustration every time I check back on it.Micro transactions for OP Generals and imbalance in general are the main reasons why i can't recommend. I suggest playing the first Company of Heroes instead since it remains untouched by SEGA's greedy DLC ridden influence.Also if you voice your concernes on their forums/facebook page, expect to get banned from those.

												Well I was hoping they'd build upon the first COH and make it better but I never had my hopes high seeing how SEGA took over after THQ went bankrupt. On top of the countless negative reviews I read and they were true. The game itself feels so different from the 1st there's no longer any basebuilding when it comes to HQ buildings or it's been severely dumbed down. The voice acting isn't that great compared to the 1st. The tanks look horrible for the germans compared to the 1st game. Why? Because of the ""skins"" and stupid ""loot"" system they wanted to add that doesn't belong in a strategy game. So they make your tank look ultra cheesy just so they can entice you into buying skins... Yes there's a microtransaction store sadly... I also hate seeing advertisements in my main menu screen for the game. The game itself has the COH look to it but it feels like a horrible dumbed down early access game. I felt like the graphics were far more superior in the first game compared to the second. I also do not like the general/commander garbage they added. Snipers are complete garbage now.I'm hoping mods will make this a more enjoyable experience because the game itself is cleary lacking.Well if you play this I recommend getting these two mods (defenses for every faction, increased pop size/resource rate) :


Defense Mod 
A Workshop Item for Company of Heroes 2
By: iWaNN

			All factions now have most of the defense structures like tank traps, reinforced barbed wire fences and bunkers with trenches at the beginning.		





Resources-Population-LOS-Abilities-Camera UnZoom 
A Workshop Item for Company of Heroes 2
By: xxCOMPANY OF COWARDSxx

			Resources-Population-LOS-Abilities-Camera UnZoom Please read carefully how the mod works. All mods that change the incoming rate of the resources working the same way.		


It makes it a little more enjoyable but it still doesn't come close to the 1st game.			"

												This game is by far the most played game in my steam library, and also probably my most played game, aside from World of Warcraft. First off, the campaign is a it unrealistic since the soviets in many cases where not that brutal to their own soldiers nor their own civilians, but aside from that i found it very entertaining and you get to see a lot of the famous battles on the Eastern front. The contols are pretty much your regular RTS-game so if you are familiar with the genre you won't have a hard time to get used to them. Now, the best of the game is in the multiplayer, where you can play as fout different armies if you whave the Western Front Armies expansion. All these armies are varied and in my opinon well balanced, which gives a very enjoyable and competetive gaming experiance. There is also lots of different commanders to choose from which gives you five special abilities which consists of everything from an airstike to a heavy tank. Buy this game if you like tactical RTS-games, you will not regret it.			"

So I fix it, then run a performance test to make sure everything was good. My thought was:  ""I can run Planetside 2 on max settings, I should be able to run this."" And after 45 minutes of waiting at a loading screen, whilst playing Angry Birds, I got a black screen, the game crashed. And afterwards my computer froze up, and crashed, and it still remains sluggish. I need to uninstall this junk, if it still remains sluggish I'm going to sue Relic so I can get a new laptop.It's free, why the hell not? You can figure out exactly WHY it's free, because you'll either not be able to even get past the loading screen, or it'll be a horrible experience afterwards.Don't get this, even if it's free. It's garbage and Relic his failed all of us - No matter what those positive reviews say - Don't. Get. This. Garbage.			"

												Very disappointed, the game has so much downloadable content, I doubt I will ever purchase another Relic product as a result. There are actually vehicles missing from the standard multiplayer that can only be accessed by purchasing Commander Packs to unlock them. Spend your money on something else, there are better games out there.			"

												Just to clarify the game itself is not bad. It has good mechanics and gameplay. Things get really dire when you get outside of the vanilla campaign (or even when you start playing campaign if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ commie) and look for more content. What do you see you ask? Let's have a look. Ardennes assault campaign? Pay. New multiplayer factions? Pay. Another multiplayer faction? Pay. A bunch of missions to play with your friend? Pay. Wait he/she has to pay as well. A company in the Ardennes campaign listed above? PAY. The commercial model in this game is one of the worst on the market. From my experiense I can only remember EA games and CK2. Amount of greed and cupidity is just insane. I just imagine a conversation in one of the SEGA/Relic offices:-Hey why don't we give players a commander builder? So that any player would be able to build his own unique commander with abilities and traits they'd like to get?-Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? How will we make money then? We are to sell commanders for money. Does that affect multiplayer balance? Is it some kind of disrespect to add p2w stuff into the game players are supposed to p2p? I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care.Besides selling game affecting stuff and partialy content from the previous game for real money and it's expansions game is also relatively poorly optimised.			"

												Good for a quick game every now and then, options are very limited unless you're committed to leveling up or dropping $10 for commanders. Don't bother getting unless you got money to burn and getting it on sale. As for some of the gameplay its a little different from the first one, you don't get unit stats to help out anymore. There seems to be a big jump in AI difficulty when moving up from standard bots, a lot bigger than easy to standard. Honestly, with AI, if you're up against the wall you can hold out till they stop sending, which they will, and make a move.In the end I'll recommend you get the first CoH and skip this.			"

												The orignal CoH is a masterpiece of RTS design. No other game could reward players so thoroughly when they correctly anticipated an enemy's play. The sequel is almost the same, except where the original is sharp and pointed, everything in CoH2 is sort of fuzzy and mushy. In the original, each army had a number of different ways to play, with commander trees there were distinct and powerful. An experienced player might see a Wehrmacht opponent use Propaganda War in the early game, and know they should expect a King Tiger in the late game and plan for it. Now that every army has almost a dozen possible commanders who all mix and match skills, not only does your commander choice feel less distinct, but it removes an element of strategy and counter play. Plus, you level up linearly instead of with branched trees, so that element of planning is also lost.You can also customize armies with sort of ""achievement-based"" unlocks, but they just add to the fuzziness. Does a 2% faster machine gun reload matter? I can't really tell. Would I notice if my enemy had that power? Doubtful. It seems like they wanted to make your army feel personal, but didn't want to have higher level players stomp all over newer ones because their army was objectively better. The result? More fuzziness and confusion.There's also a lack of focus in some of the gameplay itself. Snipers used to be a counter to the units like mortars and machine guns because those squads were very small. But in CoH2, the Russian army mortar and MG squads are massive, so the sniper that would make quick work of them with a good player has a much, much higher chance of being caught before they make a dent in those support squads. CoH2 took a brilliant piece of counterplay and designed it straight out of the game.In terms of visual fidelity, the whole game looks either the same or worse compared to the original. But, the system demands seem much higher for no discenerable gain. You can still pay CoH on a pretty mediocre or aged machine, but CoH2 will choke computers that play Relic's own Dawn of War 2 without a hitch.I was really hoping that the British Forces pack would rekindle my interest in this game, but it's just more disappointment. I really like Relic and I wanted to like this.			"

												You may remember I wrote an extremely critical review on this game's release back in 2013, where I criticized some of the game's design choices, bad netcode, and DLC that made it extremely unpleasant to play.Going back to the game recently, it appears that at least the netcode issues have largely been resolved so (yay Relic!) on that part. A lot of my criticisms of the original release have by and large been resolved, though I will still point out some problems in the game.The publishers have taken the action of raising DLC prices on their in-game Store during major sales while giving discounts to make it seem as though you are receiving discounts off the item, which is not true as it is not only unethical and anti-consumer, but is also illegal in many regions. Should I also point to the fact that there are some fairly important bugs that were only uncovered recently despite the game having been released for quite a few years now (one being veterancy gained for reinforced squads).DLC I think is still a major issue for the game, but SEGA being SEGA... Some of the DLC do affect gameplay ever so slightly which can be fairly annoying if you're just starting out and don't want to spend money on the commanders.Last but not least, I'm happy they launched the game on Linux and Mac (though not too glad the multiplayer isn't cross-platform between Windows and the other two versions - explanation from Feral here). Hence, I maintain my stance giving this game a negative review.			"

												I feel a bit of resentment playing this game. First off, because I really enjoyed CoH 1, and in my honest opinion, I feel this game is robbed from what made CoH such a great game. The doctrine trees, the unit models and the realism, of course it might just be me wanting to actually see the soldiers getting blown to pieces by an artillery shell. Anyway this game feels different.. It does not make me feel like I play a Company Of Heroes game other than in name. The MP changes to a more comptetetive system is a great improvement, so is the difficulity in personallizing your own army, by choosing different traits or specs. It makes the game more difficult, but at the same time I feel it has lost it values.I'm not even going to get started on the market strategy that has been used here, because these DLC's are just moneygrinding. If they had done like they did with Opposing Front and Tales of Valor it would be just ok. As those games were cheap expansion, giving a great game content, to a good price. Now it has turned towards EA style money grabbing. I don't know if anyone agrees with me - or totally disagree. I just wanted to push forward my opinion. As I was really really excited when they announced this game, but when it came I got so disappointed. 17 hours was all I played, but the release of the British Army might turn that around. From a grumpy disappointed Stannis The Mannis.			"

If you buy the ardennes assault for 40 euros you still have to pay another 15 euros to be able to play the two factions in multiplayer. Not kidding. So after paying 55 euros you still only have 4 factions and a sucking campaign, forcing you to buy the last facction for another 15 euros. And after that youre still missing all the Commanders :-). Segas trolling us. -Both campaigns are a joke. Theyre boring repetitive and are only hard because the ai isnt smart but is straightup cheating. The ""cap a point and defend it"" thing is literally in every mission, where the ai throws neverending waves of units at your mgs to get gunned down.-Balance is not existing. "

The campain doesn't register that I have purchased the rack yet and wont progress the story line. Ive restarted the mission three times. Its always the same story.

But I have to say, the multiplayer community is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ As one who only recently installed the game and thus low-level, I regularly find it impossible to complete a game half of the time even with a defeat. Noob-hating and noob-bashing are the norm. In 1v1 I was told to ""try team games, because only pros do 1v1"". So I did a team game, and on the very first my teammate refused to leave his base from the very beginning because he ""hates playing with noobs"". And so on and so forth. I bought the game to have fun, not to be bashed while I crawl to lvl 80+. I played COH/OF until the very end and it was lots of fun, but I'm sorry to say I'm going to uninstall this one and I think with a ""community"" like this, the game is doomed to die out very soon.

												Company of Heroes 2 is a real-time strategy developed by Relic Entertainment and published by SEGA. It is a sequel to Company of Heroes.Company of Heroes 2, has many good improvements, but also many downside. Let's start with the good thing. Company of Heroes 2 new features include new faction, new off map unit spawn, better graphics, the new Theater of War mode and more. Gameplay is absolutely better, points can now be captured just by standing inside the capture zone so infantry can focus on shooting the enemy, infantry can also now climb fences or something like that, vehicles can be abandoned when badly damaged, so we can capture and repair enemy vehicles. There is also new commander and doctrine system which make the gameplay even more vary. Modding support are also better especially with the new Steam Workshop integration. There are more to see and you will be pleased to see them.Graphics of Company of Heroes 2 are better than the first game, quite the improvements and I gotta say it's beautiful. The explosion effects, the textures variable, snow effects and stuff. It's great. They has the new snow blizzard effect that also affect gameplay, in skirmish games on snow maps blizzard can randomly happen, entirely changing the situation. Units are even more detailed with many new animations and skins for vehicles. At release and some time after that, the performance of the game was very terrible. But now finally Relic has updated the game and the performance are far more better than before, at least maybe it's because the cap it at 30 fps.But not everything in this sequel are great. Bad things also present in this Company of Heroes 2. The campaign story. I don't know, I don't want to spoil it, but there are some things considered... what, inappropriate? Like did the old Soviet Union shoots their own soldiers or executing them for heroic act like saving their Captain who was in trouble?Well, overall, for the base game and expansion packs, I recommend this game, because it's good sequel.Rating 8/10			"

												A game that requires true strategy and tactics to allow you to hold the banner of victory over your people's heads. I have played over 100 hours of this game offline (it may say that I have only played 5 hours but that isnt true) and I have enjoyed every minute of it! Just watch out when playing as any faction other than the Oberkommando West, they will destroy you with the Sturmtiger tank and absolutely obliterate your forces and your soldiers & tanks can do almost no damage to them. You need the strategy of a general to win this game which brings out the what the game is extremely well.Did I mention that battle tactics such as General Zhukov's pincer attack can be useful in this game? Well the amazing thing about this game is just that, not to mention countless hours of fun against an AI that you can totally overpower or online against 7 other people that stand no chance against your mighty tanks and infanrty.2000/10 for this game!

 Why you always changing?This game used to be amazing and a 9/10 but since an update a few months back the changed how some of the units, not only how they can be called be called to the battle feild but also how many you have, namely the King tiger. It has now been moved to an almost comand ability and limited to just one at a time which has been a real let for one of my favourite teams. this coupled with ""improvements"" to AI means that they either do nothing or steam roll you in about 10 min., an option similar to that found in other games of this genre allowing you to select the play style of AI teams would, at least in my opion add a much wanted machanic. Over all though id still give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												I bought this game ages ago on a computer that could only run it like a slideshow. Until recently I have been able to play it with a friend. We have enjoyed playing the co-op and skirmish missions together. I bought all the DLC on sale and I can say that I have gotten my moneys worth.I understand the criticism about the DLC model and it is frustrating. However, if this game didn't have the DLC model it currently has, this game would most likely be unsupported 4 years later.  Personally, I have not played any multiplayer games online against random opponents.The graphics are fantastic and smooth on my system. The gameplay in the campaign, co-op battles and skirmishes can be intense and frantic. It is not a perfect game, there are imbalances and the DLC model is frustrating but there is plenty of content to keep me happy for many hours which is why I can recommend playing COH2.			"

												Company of heroes 2 is a great sequel to the first game! It always has a fun challenge even against the bots. Sure there are DLC's for different armies but they are worth the money! This game is worth the money because you will always be facing a new challenge in a beutiful map with cool vehicles and amazing game mechanics! I myself love to use the artillery to set the mood then I charge in with my troops and tanks to begin the epic fight. Also with the steam workshop you can download or create awesome skins to use or spread out. Compared to the first CoH games this game is about the same in graphics. (improved in CoH2) The only downside I'd say is that you need a good computer to let the game show it's full graphical potential but luckily there are some good settings yo save your♥♥♥♥♥on the FPS. Company of Heroes has been my faviorite game since the first one and god am I not dissapointed in this game. Buy all the CoH games they are all great WWII strategy games and they are worth every penny! I hope you find this review helpful in any way of getting this awesome game! And I'll see you on the battlefields commander!			"

												If you are looking for the best strategy game out there then consider buying this game.It strikes the perfect balance between number of units / micro-management / flank-rear-front positioning / tactical usage / occasional massing / using cover / unit abilties / resource management /choke-point control / etcIt isn't overly crowded like Age of Empires or similar gamesBut you have control of more than 1 or 2 single units.In an average game you are probably simultaneously trying to control 5 or 6 different units in pretty crucial micro-management situations. While this is quite difficult to master, it is extremely rewarding.For example:While you are simultaneously turning your machine-gun around to face a flank attack, you need to dodge the enemy grenade with your forward infantry, cancel your mortar attack, re-direct your AT, create a new squad of troops, and release covering smoke from your tank.-You will eventually get used to the intense micromanaging pace this game sets.It is absolutely amazing.+ Unlike other strategy games a soldier firing a rifle at a tank doesn't do any damage. Yes, absolutely zero damage. Which is reassuring to say the least.			"

But with the new Update whichs includes the british forces it is totally unbalanced and not funny to play. This nation can build bofor and mortar positions which are OP. The ability to reinforce these positions makes them almost invincible (Sturmtiger doesn´t do much damage to them). If relic will not fix this the game won´t be fun if you play against brits.			"

												Building upon their greatest work, Company of Heroes 1, Relic created a masterpiece we now call Company of Heroes 2. Company of Heroes 2 is by far the greatest strategy game I've ever played. The graphics are intensely beautiful when put to Maximum Settings. The explosions look realistic and captivating. The armor of all the units look very authentic. The maps have beautiful textures. Just like how Company of Heroes 1 was marvelous to the eye, Company of Heroes 2 provides the same role as one of the best looking Strategy games out there.First of all, you need to give Relic slack for even making a sequel to their videogame. These guys were completely bankrupt by THQ, who sold them to Sega. Relic suffered through some serious financial problems, but loe and behold, they had the heart to make the next greatest game. They couldn't do everything they wanted to do, nor did they have the funds to tweak the game to the point where the community wouldn't be upset. So please, if you feel that the game is rusty, give them some time.By now, if you're reading this. The game is already near perfection. The old days of overpowered units are over, and Relic is continuously, month after month, providing game changing balance tweaks and completely new content. I anticipate every month that they provide us with whole new maps, new units, new commanders, and balance tweaks.If you guys got bored of this game in the past, please give it another shot. And for the people who are skeptical about buying this game, this game is totally worth it! It's Relic, they made arguably the greatest strategy game of all time, and they are bound to do it again!And by the way... Metascore lies. That 80 point Metascore only considers Company of Heroes 2 at day 1 of release, not where it is now. It is a completely different game from what it used to be.			"

												Well to summarise the history:  It is 1941 and the beginning of what will become the most brutal conflict of World War II, as Germany launches a full-scale invasion of the frozen tundra of the Soviet Union which would result in over 14 million military casualties. Now you know all the historical details, you follow Lev Abramovich Isakovich (Yes, his name is Abramovich Isakovich, kinda like calling an American Kid, Johnny Doucebag) a Soviet Army lieutenant locked up at a gulag in Siberia in 1952. An Army colonel – his old commanding officer – interrogates him about his experiences during the war.Now onto the gameplay...This game does have repetitive features from the original Company of Heroes BUT, it also adds alot of new features as well, for example the addition of your men freezing to death if you don't make them go near a campfire or shelter for too long. Firefights in the game do get rather intense but as I said, quite repetitive from the original COH.Soldier: Comrades we must push forward through the blizzard because our Commander forced us to, it's for the best tovarisch. URA!Yeah sure the new features are new and creative, however the thing that bugged me was some of the missions were...unorthadox. Like burning Russian villages with RUSSIANS INSIDE THEM.Soldier: HAHA, BURN, BURN FASCIST PIGS! HAHAHAHHA....Hehe....Eeeehhh sh*t.I'm not sure where Relic gets these 'historical facts' from, but it sounds like they pulled it out of their asses.Lets not forget the beginning of the game during the tutorial mission, where at the end you're shown a cinematic of a Russian commander ordering a machinegunner to execute retreating Russian soldiers. Clap Clap Clap Clap Geez, you could've jsut sacked them or make them go into disciplinary action. But yeah you could just do this:https://i.gyazo.com/b7b2da0279b6d544af17a60f86acaa3e.gifNow the part that everyone loves, the ☭ Final Verdict ☭Apart from all the repetitive features that Relic just happened to slap on and call it a new one.Company of Heroes 2 does not lose its touch on fun RTS and commanding forces from either Allied or Axis troops.Positives:+Intense firefights+Excellent storyline+Graphics are decent (depending on what computer you have)+Adds new features that the original lackedNegatives:-Repetitive features from the original COH-Adds a bunch of DLC packs which are almost worthless-Great History .-.I rate this game a 7/10It's an OK RTS game, however as I said, unorthadox.

This game was balanced with the old factions and was fun as hell and was always at 50 50. for the most part.OKW screwed up everything. thats all i face now as U.S or Soviet. 4v4 always at least three OKW players. and once the game starts its just nothing but kubelwagans and pioneers with stg44s. You cant do anything! by the time my infantry fire a AT nade at them they fully surpressed by four wagans. and when i do it only takes half their life or no effect.

												If you like playing these kind of games and you like WW2, then this is a must buy game. I would recommand to buy it on sale since it's a few years old, but I would definitely buy it full price even in 2016. Amazing game. Great campaign mode, CoH part one already has an awsome campaign and CoH2 follows in those footsteps. The game is graphic a lot better than part one, also there are a lot more units. Multiplayer is also awsome, really fun. You have to constantly capture and secure points, the balance of battle can shift a lot in one single game. That keeps it always interesting if you play AI (apart from easy) or players of your own caliber. You have to micromanage a lot of units, that can be a bit difficult at first but you will get use to that pretty soon. I would suggest buying a clompete pack, so you can play all factions in multiplayer mode.			"

COH 2 feels like an COH 1 - mod with better graphics. Therefore you can now buy DLCs adding commanders or overpriced faction addons that are pushed out frequently instead of fixing obvious problems.I recommand you to buy COH 1 and its expansions instead of this.

												This game is a part of what we expected from a game. It will fill your hours they way you wish making it such a fun game to play. It will thrill you during online battles vs players as its so many ways to play make it great. The abilities units have are so much helpful and aid in strategic planning instead of useless micro. Now that the game has passed release stage and got decent as it gets patches when needed i reach to the conclusion, as i left it from time to time to see how it evolves in the long term as i had it from day 1, it has many elements of what demanding rts players will wish and its so well made to play that wont frustrate any player inthe scale of casual to experienced. Factions are getting increased in number and they have unique ways each, the game doesnt get boring at all and gets add ons when needed and these add ons are well made. The dlc are reasonable and not overated and think of that, when you go to a cafe you waste money on a drink that ends so fast and its not real good so why get mad about dlc existence ?Many blame this game be pay to win but it isnt at all, the ""good commanders"" are availiable by default as common item commanders, the dlc commanders are for noobs and you can get them as loot after multiplayer games. Also you dont have to buy all games to play, you can just buy 1 faction that you like to play multiplayert which is very cheap for such a GREAT GREAT game. MUST buy.			"

												Just finished the campaign and feeling horribly demoralized.... this is not company of heroes, it tries everything to portrait russians as villains in WWII, and makes the NAZI look like the victim.  It does seems like there is a hidden agenda here as it almost make the NAZI look like heroes defending a russian invasion, very deceptive indeed. This is really bad for kids that haven’t learn from real history books yet.  It sets the stage for mistrust in future generations.  I expect Relic to have better judgement since they have built quite a few good games in the past.  It is very disappointing.			"

												It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ I should've expected it. The signs were there, eveyrthing since dawn of war 2 has just been a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ downhill slope for relic, and this just confirms it. Forgetting about the legion of butthurt russians trying to imply the slighly glorified campaign events never happened (lol) the game fails to bring anything GOOD to the the CoH franchise. The tactics are the same or worse, gone is the well implemented doctrine system, instead now you chose a commander who shares half his abilities with other commanders, oh and there are DLC commanders so now you are 100% validated when you can claim others 'pay to win'. The UI is a hot ♥♥♥♥ing mess, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ugly and has everything taking up the wrong amount of space in the wrong places.			"

												Pros:1.  Exceptional graphics (I play on ultra quality) among almost all other WWII RTS on the market.2.  Drop of Goodies (not frequently but truly free) after sometime.3.  Realistic uniforms, tanks, planes along with historically coherent campaign4.  Strong community support (free maps, mods, skins for download from Modding Hub)5.  Every match is a unique one, every general is a unique one, everyone has a choice of their way to playCons:Price is expensive?            (wait for a promotional sale event, the ingame goodies are free and will drop from air) Balancing issues?              (all units can be countered by another unit,  skill matters over trivial complain on balance)Server issues?                    (seems to be it depends on the host's PC power, update comes once 3 months to address issues)This is a review from an experienced RTS player. (StarCraft 2, Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires 3 Collection, Command and Conquer Ultimate Collection)If you love strategy and team work,  this is one of the finest WWII RTS ever made! "

												All in all I do like the game, but there is a very big minus.The trend of providing DLCs is just a way to gain more cash out of a game, which I don't support.Sure, publishers and studios have to get money for their work, but...As long as there is no ""season pass"" providing a cheap collection of all mission packs, commanders, future upgrades, western fronts, and what not.. I can't recommend this game.I don't like the idea of buying half a game, I pre-purchased it long before I knew of the big number of DLCs.I already payed for it, and it is a great game, but no video game is worth more than idk.. 60 euros?This stupid, capitalistic trend keeps friggin me out, some publishers start to work on like ""PS4 exclusive version"" and what not..I want to play the full game, without having to SEARCH for all these DLCs and extra versions and all that stuff..

												This game has the steepest learning curve in recent memory. I've played tons of rts games including many hours on the original Company of Heroes and this game's difficulty is by far the hardest of any that I've played. On Normal difficulty (the one I'm assuming that most people will start on) the difficulty is far beyond that of any rts I can think of, this isn't a criticism of the gameplay mechanics or the AI's intelligence both of which are very good, the normal AI is simply too hard for most people who'd be new to the game or even those who are experienced in the genre. The AI even on normal is ruthless and plays with a remarkable degree of skill and utilisation of the game elements, often flanking, providing diversions and usings all elements of the game mechanics, and while this is a great display of the game's AI most players aren't going to be good enough to face off against the normal AI for sometime. While some people might say ""play the Easy AI instead then move up"", this isn't a viable option as the easy AI is borderline braindead, providing little to no challenge what so ever, and I'd imagine that people would learn little from playing against it for prolonged periods of time. To make myself clear, I'm not criticising the game for being hard, I'm criticising it for being very unwelcoming for many new or casual players.Like many rts games, the campaign isn't worth glancing at, a very linear scripted and generic line up awaits, not worth your time. This game's campaign gets a lot of criticism (wrongly so) from the portrayal of the Soviets, as bloodthirsty and cruel but apparently many people have never read a history book.			"

												Game would be great, except that you have to pay FIVE DOLLARS FOR ONE COMMANDER DOCTRINE. Not to mention the rest of the DLC. You give us three core commanders per faction, and we have to pay five dollars just to get one more. I expect a commander per dollar, or better yet, add them in as updates and make them unlockable by, say, completing a challenge or achievement. But five dollars for one commander is ridiculous. The rest of the DLC adds onto the piling of costs. There may not be a commander that just beats anything, but almost all of the buyable ones outdo core ones.			"

												THE COMPANY OF HEROES 2 REVIEW YOU NEED TO READ!(or not)(also i will be addressing only multiplayer here , and i think this is where this game really shines)First of let me apologise for all the bad english in this review.BALANCE SITUATION:This game gets a lot of hate form a lot of people  and some of it for a good reason .the dev tim had some really bad decisions concerning balance in the past , but now things are looking better than ever.So don't listen to trols  ,haters and 0.2 hour reviews that say the game is crap and that coh 1 (I am a huge coh 1 fan)  is batter because they are all full of crap . As far as strategy games go this game is really well balanced now and the dev team (such as it is) still pumps updates and new content very often . Most of the butt hurt Imo comes from new players who go online first game knowing nothing of gameplay mehanics of which there are many here , and get their butt handed to them .Not one faction or unit is op ,almost  everything is in the hands of the player .This is not Starcraft or C&C game where apm or spaming units wins games , its all about combined arms , flanking and conserving units, losing just one unit can spell doom for you. Go read up on some beginner tips before you go aginst other players .Also the matchmaker gets the job done fine , only the first 10 games will you go aginst players of diffrent skill until it determines your skill level.DLC/PAY TO WIN SITUATION: I spent around 20$ on this game during diffrent sales , bought base game and two aditional armies. Almost EVERYTHING  else I wanted I got form in game loot drops .The drops are random and you wil get something every 3 to 4 games. None of the stuff I got gave me any kind of an adventage and I have gotten and continue to get my butt handed to me by people who play with base game stuff (I consider myself an ok player and I sit around 60% win ratio in 1v1 games), the stuff you can get for 8$ when the game is on 75% sale and the game and most of the dlc are on 75% sale arount 4  to 5 times a year. Yes, technically you can spend hundreds of dolars on this game , but do you need to ? nope. If you want all 5 factions , thats base game + 2 dlc (western front armies for OKW , USF and Brit Forces ... for Brits) and that will cost you around 20-25 bucks during a sale , and you WILL WAIT for that sale because you are a cheap fagot like me .CONCLUSION:Company of Heroes 2 is easily one of the best multiplayer strategy games i ever played (I played almost every strategy there is). Every time I play even after 500h i feel i see and learn something new  . If you love WW2 and strategy games get it .The game is light years in front CoH 1 in terms of gameplay and balance , just take  your time read a few treds on army you want to play and on mechanics of the game before you go online aginst other players ,this game is very easy to get a grasp of but hard to master . There is a lot of great tips and tutorials online.  tl;dr :   1.Wait for a sale.            2.Get game for 8 bucks.            3.Fail miserably.           4.Rage on forums .           5.Git Gud.           6.Play for 500 hours.P.S: The game is badly optimized add runs like crap on older systems.

												Companies of Heroes 2 Honest Review+\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Verdict: *BUY when on SALE*Summary: Companies of Heroes 2 is a solid and enjoyable game cut into small bits of pieces from the main game in a bid to cash in on them despite the fact that those pieces could easily provided to the players in the first place. This is evident with the number of ""Purchase"" icon in game. Modding support is included however, though you may need to purchase certain major pieces* in order to fully enjoy the game. Knowing SEGA, DLCs includes two Armies (The USAF and the OKW) American and Late-German armies, a full campaign (Ardense Forest), Skin Packs, Commander Packs and many more. This is a huge disadvantage for users who is short on funds and is normally a bane for a non-free to play game like this one. Furthermore, Multiplayer online skirmish lacks any regulation nor penalties for abusive and players who abandon the game, ruining the fun for all who stayed in a multiplayer match. Overall, if you want to play this game, you must;1. Wait for it to go on sale.2. Buy the two western front armies and/or the British forces3. wait for another sales to add to your game.4. Prepare lots of cash.5. Stomach abusive players with no way of penalising them.6. Play an online skirmish with AIs when all your friends leave when 1 quit.7. Repeat Step 1 to 7. Especially Step 4.In summation, it is an enjoyable game mired with questionable business practice and no overthought on the multiplayer scene (Refer DOTA 2's mechanics for errant players). I must advised against buying this. Buy the first one (Company of Heroes) for a better in game experience.=====================================[INTRO]Companies of Heroes 2 is a solid game from the venerable Companies of Heroes and took on the eastern setting of the tragic war of WW2 in 1941-1945. Its a fresh new prespective playing as the Russian and looking from their side of the story. No spoilers though.THE GOOD:First of all, the gameplay is good and enjoyable, where it resembles the likes of Comand and Conquer series with a touch of Heroes and Generals on it. There is the infantry, support vehicle, tanks, artillery and specific comand vehhicle or emplacement made available by earning or purchasing commnaders in game. You start with 2 army, fortunately solid and versatile enough to not warrant buying the wetern front armies. The beauty of the game shines on the combination of all the game elements, voice acting, wonderful musics that captures the atmosphere and the tactics played by the veterans.THE BAD:Unfortunately, there is way too much negative aspects of the game that prevents this game from claiming glory. Firstly, there is the countless DLCs, that includes three armies, Oberkomando west (Germans), US Army and the British Forces, a full fledged campaign, skin packs for vehicles and Commanders Set Pieces. Some quarters complained that the commanders aspect of the game esentially made it play to win because each commanders provides players with additional abilities, vehicles and bonuses that the main game dont provide. Community is another aspect worth mentioning. Just like any other massive multiplayer games, not all players would play sportingly and in COH2, players could be abusive and dropped out from game with no penalties whatsoever. They could easily use Valve's Dota2 penalty mechanics in this game.SUMMARY:This game represents the best and worse of gaming. Solid gameplay but with bad business practice. Buy only after reviewing this review.			"

												After more than 2000 hours of gameplay COH2 is really good strategy game but:-after more than 2000 hours I have failed to get all commanders, skins and bulletins by means of spoils of war -a lot of dupes in spoils of war and relic failed to fix it because of greed-this game is a bit pay to win and the reason why is because having more commanders will make a player more flexible in his/her strategy for example UKF can only reinforce through there base or forward assembly as long as it is linked up to the base but you can reinforce at enemy territory by means of halftrack which can also provide piat/lmg and this unit is only available in paid commander and same goes to other units such as pershing, calliope, land mattress, churchill crocodile etc..-poor support, I posted on relic forums and steam forums about bugs that I have found such as my multiplayer achievement does not seem to progress and bugs such as sachel trouble bulletin does not work. these post are ignored and I felt they are rude			"

												A complex RTS game, Company of Heroes 2 requires a high skill set, ability to analyze both the meta and micro game, requiring patience and tactics. Whether you play multiplayer 1v1 or 4v4 (there is also 2v2 and 3v3) expect to find a wide-range of skilled players. With four factions to choose from, expect a breadth of resources and tools at your disposal to punish your enemy. But be ready to counter a great many strategies. The COH2 community has quite a few resources and members who can help you round out your game-play. Expect most people to welcome you to the fold. I still play this game regularly. Expect content updates throughout the year and a dedicated development team.			"

												I really loved COH and I also like COH 2 despite it's weaknesses.First of all, the game has great graphics and game mechanics. Especially on 4v4 MP matches this games become great on the endgame when you have tank battles like in kursk and you fight for every point as your tickets amount become low. You then face a sometimes little disturbing battles where many soldiers die for holding this point and you realise how hard war can be when a single salve of artillery fire kills 20 of your brave elite soldierts who did everything to follow your order.The singleplayer is also nice and I really wish they had spent more effort German and allied campaigns.Pros:+ Great RTS with many options and ways to achieve victory+ Cool mechanics and graphics+ awesome atmospherenegs:- Bugs (they are plenty of them)- Devs. not caring about bugs and prefering to sell more useless skins on 5 GB updates every week- every replay you save will become incompatible with every ""skin update""......- Not very popular, it sometimes takes ages until you find a MP game to join inConclusion:I love this game despite the bugs and greedy devs not caring at all. It would be nice if a company like blizzard was behind this project, then we would get a gaming experience that reaches levels you never expected but sadly, this will never happen.What ever, I'd buy again, but not the CE as I spend more than 100 € for it to have to buy every single DLC for like 20 - 30 €... Greed over quality.			"

												NEVER BUY THIS GAME EVER.COMP STOMPAfter playing COH vanilla for years then watching it slowly get ruined with each update.  I figured I would hate COH2.  I enjoyed the first several hours because I had little idea what was happening.  After that all you see is the same ole tired excuse for gameplay that COH had.  All of your vehicles will move slower than a slug on a hot day while the bots go 70 mph past your AT weaponry.  Your vehicle cant hit the side of a barn but the bot wipes entire teams with one shot from the edge of the FOW.  Your flame weapons do no damage but the bots wipes 3 guys instantly. Then kills the rest as they retreat.  The bot has NO FOW so expect death raining down on you from outside the FOW and its 100% kill everytime.  Bots will wander past your MGs and never be suppressed.  If they are somehow suppressed they crawl wherever they want to.  Someone farts on the bots team and all your INF falls to the ground and does nothing until you retreat them.SELLOUTAnd of course the disgraceful way they are selling little pieces of the game makes you feel like you just got bought a lemon from leisure suit larry.GOOD STUFFVersus COH, COH2 fixes a great many annoyances with the interface and worldbuilder.  The whole level making experience is fantastic!  Only reason I got the game.SHAMECOH original was awesome.  The mechanics were perfect.  The units looked like they were doing stuff.  It all felt connected.  Now you sit and watch the random number generator decide your fate.  What could have been a great game now sucks everytime.  Never any fun.  I have never heard anyone say that was fun after playing this game.  All you will hear is WTF I just lost everything in like 3 seconds???  Just watch the value graph to see when the bot decided it wasnt doing well and became invulnerable for a bit to balance it out.REAL PEOPLEOnly think about this game for playing against people.  But even then dont...just dont.			"

												Its a shame that an amazing RTS returns as a pay-to-win game. Only buy if either A) you liked the first one that much B) the game goes on sale for at least half off, or C) you have friends that play CoH2. I must admit that I love the gameplay, but it doesnt distract from the fact that I need to pay for the really good commanders at about $5 a piece. That much still discourages me, and that's not to mention that you have to buy additional vehicle camoflouges for more or less the same price.With the announcement of ""The British Forces"", I can also say that it's annoying to see the game's factions being sold piecemeal on top of selling commanders. Talk about raking in every last dollar. On top of all of that, Relic has turned all the modders loose on this game, allowing custom skins, decals, gametypes, and maps to be played in public lobbies with no repurcussion at all. In the unlikely event that you find a lobby worth mentioning, the game itself will more often than not be so buggy, it won't even function properly as a direct result of unrestricted modding. The CoH2 community was already toxic to newcoming players, but now they are literally ruining the game for everyone by breaking the system. This game has become a prime example of the community completely disreguarding caring for the game they love, and the developers only caring for ways to make another buck. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I will also post a review for CoH 1 here because you have to have gameplay for the old version.And I dont even recommend the original to buy, the community as a whole has ruined any and all online played and the devs simply will not do anything to fix CoH1. Anything that can be exploited will be exploited and the vast of majority of gameplay has degraded to choosing a map with only chokepoints, blocking them off, then rushing the heavy tanksIf you buy CoH1, you will receive a game:WITHOUT balanced factions and abilitiesWITHOUT clever gameplay and strategy WITHOUT a community that's not stuck in rut, doing nearly the exact same gametype and map                       more often than notWITHOUT the complete game, and DLC a la Carteand finallyWITHOUT dynamic gameplay as the game unfolds, contrary to what is advertised			"

Enemy at the Gates 
A Screenshot of Company of Heroes 2
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




Company of Heroes 2 is the second in a renowned RTS series of the same name. The game is developed by Relic Entertainment who, if you remember, were the masterminds behind the phenomenal Dawn of War series as well as other RTS successes. The game was published by Sega and releasesd in June of 2014 with a generally positive reception, although muddled by a bit of controversy about the portrayal of the Soviets. The game includes a single-player campaign and two multiplayer modes: Co-op scenarios and competitive versus. The main campaign has 15 missions and should take you about 12-16 hours depending on what difficulty you choose and how experienced you are with RTS games as a whole. The whole of the game is superb, if a bit cliche in some places, and was clearly made with quite a bit of love on Relic's part.“I told my mother we’d see Elefants, Panthers, and Tigers. She thought I was visiting the Moscow Zoo.”-Unknown Russian SoldierCompany of Heroes 2 is a different kind of RTS more in the vein of Dawn of War II than more standard games such as Starcraft and Grey Goo. In Company of Heroes 2 there is one main campaign and one DLC campaign, seeing as this is a review for the base game I will only be talking about the main campaign. The story starts you off with a mission to retake Stalingrad with a very Enemy at the Gates feel to it. After that point you go through many other missions through mostly snowy environments, with some exceptions towards the end, and even a forest mission or two. The problem is that most of the levels are designed to clearly use much of the same tileset so half the game is set in very typical wintery forests and towns with very little in the way of unique map design. However, this makes the maps that aren't wintery feel a lot more fun as they're your only chance to break from the mold. Seeing as the main campaign is completely focused on the Soviets i'll talk about how they work as a faction.

So every faction in this game has different abilities they can use on a little hotbar above the UI. These abilities include actions such as calling in a stuka fighter to do a strafing run or bringing in a squad of poorly-trained conscripts depending on the faction. These abilities are key to the campaign and can be the difference between victory and defeat in some missions. I feel the game could have some more interesting powers that affect the game in a bigger way other than just adding units to the fray or doing a basic strafe. As the soviets the gameplay is focused on the typical mentality of quantity over quality which I feel works incredibly poorly seeing as the Company of Heroes 2 as a game is meant to make every unit feel important. This directly counters the Soviet style of play and makes them incredibly hard in multiplayer and in some singleplayer situations because you end up trying to make miracles happen with infantry who's main use is to be disposable. The units are all insanely boring and begin to blend together between factions as they all pretty much have either the same units or very close copies. The co-op scenarios are just too slow and seem to be built around setting up ambushes and really playing strategically with your units but that's practically impossible against a cheating AI.TL;DRAs a whole most of the campaign is very boring and repetitive but there are just enough moments where a true RTS peeks out for me to recommend CoH 2.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												A complex RTS game, Company of Heroes 2 requires a high skill set, ability to analyze both the meta and micro game, requiring patience and tactics. Whether you play multiplayer 1v1 or 4v4 (there is also 2v2 and 3v3) expect to find a wide-range of skilled players. With four factions to choose from, expect a breadth of resources and tools at your disposal to punish your enemy. But be ready to counter a great many strategies. The COH2 community has quite a few resources and members who can help you round out your game-play. Expect most people to welcome you to the fold. I still play this game regularly. Expect content updates throughout the year and a dedicated development team.			"

												Really nice WWII themed RTS game. The capture point system is so much better than other RTS games e.g. Star Craft, etc. I've been playinh the CoH series since the first one came out and always loved it. CoH2 was pretty buggy at first escpecially the root finding but with the constant bugfixing it turned out quite nicely. The only downside to the game that I can think of is the fact that you have to pay for certain commanders who grant you access to different special abilities and units. Unless you're into competative MP it doesn't really matter, though.Really nice SP campaigns and hours and hours of fun in MP. Getting the addons is worth it.			"

Enemy at the Gates 
A Screenshot of Company of Heroes 2
By: Friedmudkips ツ #FreeMilo




Company of Heroes 2 is the second in a renowned RTS series of the same name. The game is developed by Relic Entertainment who, if you remember, were the masterminds behind the phenomenal Dawn of War series as well as other RTS successes. The game was published by Sega and releasesd in June of 2014 with a generally positive reception, although muddled by a bit of controversy about the portrayal of the Soviets. The game includes a single-player campaign and two multiplayer modes: Co-op scenarios and competitive versus. The main campaign has 15 missions and should take you about 12-16 hours depending on what difficulty you choose and how experienced you are with RTS games as a whole. The whole of the game is superb, if a bit cliche in some places, and was clearly made with quite a bit of love on Relic's part.“I told my mother we’d see Elefants, Panthers, and Tigers. She thought I was visiting the Moscow Zoo.”-Unknown Russian SoldierCompany of Heroes 2 is a different kind of RTS more in the vein of Dawn of War II than more standard games such as Starcraft and Grey Goo. In Company of Heroes 2 there is one main campaign and one DLC campaign, seeing as this is a review for the base game I will only be talking about the main campaign. The story starts you off with a mission to retake Stalingrad with a very Enemy at the Gates feel to it. After that point you go through many other missions through mostly snowy environments, with some exceptions towards the end, and even a forest mission or two. The problem is that most of the levels are designed to clearly use much of the same tileset so half the game is set in very typical wintery forests and towns with very little in the way of unique map design. However, this makes the maps that aren't wintery feel a lot more fun as they're your only chance to break from the mold. Seeing as the main campaign is completely focused on the Soviets i'll talk about how they work as a faction.

												This would be a great game is you didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it. Game companies nowadays are like drug dealers. They hooked us early with the good stuff, and now that we're addicted they've cut back on quality/upped the price. It's simply a smack in the face when the vanila edition of the previous game has double the launch content of its sequel.Even buying it on sale I still feel ripped off. For the love of God I hope nobody pays upward of $30 for lackluster content that should've been included in the stock version of the game anyway.			"

												This game has become nothing but utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Instead of balancing the game, all Relic entertainment-Err i mean racist bias Entertainment has done is nerf germany x10000 nd ban all german supporters from the forum claiming they are nazi's etc etc. Thats illegal aint it? (But hey insecure forum mods get away with a lot, right??!) They also nerfed kubel, and sturmpioneers to the grave. So that the POS allied players who are completely un educated can get free undeserved chances against pro, educated and classy german generals. The panther performs better then a jagdpanzer which is low profile and has sloped armor. The sherman has the same anti armor capability as the T-34 (WTF HISTORY?) The M36 Jackson will terrorize every german tank with it's ferrari speed, abrams satellite accuracy, and HEAT ammo. And there is NOTHING you can do about it because of the OP riflemen with 30cal/bar spam happening every ♥♥♥♥ing game while abusing their Rifle AT grenades on you. Immobilizing your armor and then decimating it with a OP jackson. Jacksons can 1v1 tiger tanks as well which is complete BS, germany never gets a single tank until its been 50+ minutes into the game now. Hell the tiger has become a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥in myth because of the LACK OF RESOURCES FOR GERMANY. Thanks to relic and their crap♥♥♥♥♥history department, nerfing the oberkommando's resource system. So no matter how pro you are. You will ALWAYS be behind the allied player in economy. Which is just simply disgusting and racist because this is not how war it's faught. All this game is, is just a stompfest for little allied children now, and the german players are currently suffering. If you want realism, go play men of war or a even better tank/warfare simulator. Because this is nothing but utter propoganda ridden RACIST interactive digital crap			"

 Honest Company of Heroes 2 review	Cons and Pros of the game in short summary.Pros:-Awesome battles-Destruct able battlefields-Beautiful RTS game-Nice progression in the gameplay from early to late game-RNG risk/reward feeling-Great multiplayer experienceNorms:-WW2 elements-War spoils-Some unbalanced features for the different factions-Less base building, and more focus on the battlefields-Mediocre campaignCons-Badly optimized-30 Fps lock in Main Menu-unpolished feels :´(-No crafting/trading-Lots of DLC-Terrible ranking system-No in game leaderboards-Isn´t really big in the competitive genre-Some clunky animations-No options to change hotkeys than Classic or Grid	Quick Summary Version: ""The game is good, just buy it okay...""""Now for those who might want to spend more time for this review, there is a full explanation bellow."" Explained Company of Heroes 2 review	 The game itself:	Company of Heroes 2 is one of the top 10 RTS games out there, it's an arcane RTS game with ww2 elements putting the axis vs allies in intense battles ranging from 1v1 battles to 4v4 in multiplayer and got a very mediocre campaign that I won't go into detail. Company of Heroes 2 has changed allot since its early days and is better game if it´s compared when how the game was back in 2013, which allot of people seem to cry about. The game itself got some of the base building stuff and teaching, though the game focuses more on the battlefield rather than the base building moment of the game. Another thing that company of heroes 2 got that other RTS games don´t have is the RNG element of the game and it´s destructible battlefields that give a nice element to the game.RNG means random generated number, what it does have to do with the game is to give this risk/reward feeling while you send your units into battle. When your units shoot their guns, the game will select a random number, depending if the number was good or not will determine if the unit made a hit or not. Sometimes a tank shell can destroy a whole squad because of that, and can be very frustrating, but also when you manage to do this against the enemy, it feels rewarding. Though some people might hate this RNG system that relic has added to Company of Heroes 2 as a feature, cause of the frustration it can give while you're trying to finish that last squad or tank and your units miss all there shots to finish the job. The DLC side and balance, +features:	Company of Heroes 2 got allot of DLC that's mostly just skins or commanders that give you a different playstyle, though nowadays relic has fixed the major issues the game had back in 2013 when some commanders were just pay to win, you needed to own these commanders to play decent against others players and the game has become much more stable since then. Relic has also added a ""War spoil"" system that enables all players that have purchased the game to get the DLC(expect Theater of war and new factions) while playing the game. Though, this system is very close to the drop system in tf2 and is very random. The only really garante for you to get all the DLCs for free is just to play allot over the time and hope you get the DLC you wanted for free. They haven't added any kind of a crafting system with the duplicates you sometimes to get while getting war spoils which mostly leads you to remove them because of the item limit with 1000 slots. They haven't added any trading system for players to trade items with each other which is a bit sad, though it seems like relic is hinting on adding these features with how they drastically changed their business model. Features it lacks:Though, the games got some unpolished features like: how the game lacks an ingame leaderboard to show players what´s there rank and relies more on you using a browser to check your rank from there website which is annoying. The game is also pretty badly optimized and really needs to be worked on. Even the main menu got problems with giving a very unpolished feeling, while starting the game up the screen will lock itself to 30fps cause of the movie that is played behind the main menu.Another issues is that some animations with the new factions are very clunky and gives a very unpolished feature to the game while playing also, I´m talking about the infantry units animations in the game.The game doesn't have a option to change your hotkeys which is a bit sad and gives you only the option to change between Classic Hotkeys(hotkeys from coh1) or grid hotkeys.  The ranking system:	The ranking system in coh2 is also very unbalanced and will sometimes match you up with a completely new player against players that have 800h+ ingame. Another thing is that they almost never reset the ranks. That means if some player managed to become maybe top 200 or so, it enables him to stay at the rank pretty much with just not playing. It´s a bit shame they haven't really inputted a same kind of a feature that Cs:go got with it´s ""accept to play"" feature. What I mean is that, when you search for a game and accept, you comply that you are gonna play a game for 30-60 mins, and if you leave, you're gonna get a punishment for breaking the ""accept to play feature"". This enables players to leave right when a match starts and ruin the fun for other players in 4v4 (for as an example), and make them lose right of the bat and decrease their rank thanks to him/her. Final verdict:	I would recommend this game for people that want something else than Starcraft 2 in the RTS genre and want something new with its own elements. It´s a bit sad that Company of Heroes 2 isn´t really that big in the competitive genre of games, and the game has the ability to be there, though there are some things that need to be changed before it can see that light of day.

												For those who have played COH1 and are still on the fence about buying this game, this review is for you:When I first purchased COH1, it was love at first sight. With 6 compelling campaigns and awesome mods and maps to play with after getting bored with the vanilla version, I got hooked real quick, I probably spent a good 200+ hours playing it off and on for the past 2 years.  The campaigns had the same feeling as the first 2 Call of Duties mixed with a hint of Band of Brothers.Since I loved COH1 so much, I decided to disregard the enormous amount of negative reviews and get it anyways.COH2 is originally set on the Eastern Front, which suffice to say is better than the Eastern Front mod for COH1 in so many ways. Mainly, I like COH2 more because it comes with a great campaign, and doesn't require you to force restart your OP PC every time you try to boot up a game.That being said, the campaign storyline in COH2 was a little better than if you compared them side-by-side with any of the COH1 campaigns. It felt a little more cheesy and CoD-ish than Brothers In Arms: EiB, but the same general attitude was used with great effect and had me compelled to play through the entire campaign in one sitting.Then there are of course the countless DLCs that come with this game. Mainly, most of these are microtransactions, where now instead of doctrines, there are commanders. As for the other, more formal DLCs, there are 3 more factions to choose from if you get them. Also Ardennes Assault brings a new kind of campaign that is extremely different from what you'd normally expect, It's sort of a Turn-Based strategy on top of the base game that plays differently each campaign, with ""special events"" where you can unlock certain vehicles for certain companies throughout the game. And then there's also mission packs, which can provide you with maybe 30 more hours of fun. So all in all, would I recommend this game? I personally would, but only if there is a really good sale on it. The microtransactions kind of turned me off, but it wasn't gamebreaking for me. The campaign is good too, and for some it can make you walk away from it questioning your own moral integrity. Hope this helped!			"

												I have played CoH 1 and 2 for years now and I can honestly say (like everyone else posting reviews about this game) that CoH 1 was in fact way better balanced. They have ""optimized"" this game to the point where my friends and I cannot really get the game to function unless we are all on the same local network due to the fact they are now using peer networking to run the game which dramitically increases latency and decreases game performace. To me that is pretty pathetic. If you are interested in getting into CoH then I would highly recommend looking into CoH 1 with all the expansions. Hint: just look at the metascores they gave CoH 1 and 2. I think it is pretty clear Relic dropped the ball on this game. It needs a serious overhaul.			"

Not just that CoH2 is pretty much a prettied up CoH1 balance mod, now they're selling you not just the DLCs, but also commanders, vehicle skins and (!) HUD frame borders. The new DLCs are the good old CoH1 armies repainted and re-mixed, the campaign is simplistic and unmemorable and un-challenging, the number of achievements (hundreds, most of which are ""Kill n-hundred unit X with unit Y"") implies you must have no life.So, you must be a cow then. Stay tuned, soon I will release a DLC for this review. For now - read it over and over for more achievents. For extra difficulty level - decrease the font size and read it again.			"

												There is a huge difference between admitting war crimes as a nation and doing Relic's job. In the first case, everything that was wrong with USSR was admitted by Russians in an awful lot of books and studies. It's all up for you to read. Largely explained, with many photos of those times. If you wish to explore it quicker, you can watch some documentaries on this topic. Most of which are made by Russians, by the way. Nobody else is as interested in rooting into WW2 as Russian people. This war took a lot of their lives. They took the hardest punch, went through it hand to hand with Allies and regular people, like you and me. Everyone was united by a cause Germans would never figure out. To defend their kind. Germans had a little..different ideals.What Relic did with Company of Heroes 2 is called defamation.Being Polish, you should probably know the term very well. (referring the guy in the comments section)So what Relic does is not only show us the 'dark face' as you might say, but instead of making an incredible story of a horrible event they make a propaganda-fueled movie in style of US movies of 1960. The 'bad commie' type of film.There is a huge difference between narrated storytelling based on proven facts with a huge pile of evidence, and making this crap.I love history. I love reading books, finding rare videos of those times, looking at old and exquisite photographs that might seem uninteresting to most people. Photos of regular people standing united by a cause. And no, I don't mean Nazis in this case. I'd say they were more divided in ideology than anyone.But I hate it when people who can manipulate masses blow the only thing they were supposed to do - tell the facts, and make them seem real. The drama, the horror of World War 2 should be in place. A mother burrying her own son, a man dying on arms of his fellow friends, children preparing for what they are going to face, people hearing the sirens, looking at the skies and knowing what is going to follow. All of this should be put in place.The war was fought by the real people. The real people died in this war, not those plastic figures for whom the only reason to fight is so they won't be punished by the command.  (As shown by Relic) Popular magazines who reviewed the game with scores of 8 and higher were probably paid to skip the campaign and rate multiplayer only, which didn't change much. I love the snow blizzard, but that's it. New units and tons of paid DLCs don't make a game. Well they didn't some time ago, now it's considered a really nice effort.Unfortunately, German propaganda worked too well, as Werner Naumann pointed out. It ricocheted against their own people, made their troops lose the war, but it works pretty well nowadays. For the most of people, that is. Like the Polish guy from comments below. Too many people are sheep who don't believe in things other than 'bad' or 'good'.When people grow up they start wondering if there is really black and white, or is there something beyond? If the time isn't right for you, if you just stopped playing Call of Duty with your 12-year-old fifth grade classmates, buy this game and enjoy the campaign to the fullest. You'll love it.			"

												I'm a huge fan of COH1, for is extreamly dynamic game play.  I enjoyed it for the nearly endless possible viable stratagies, such as the crazy engeer landmine and sniper statagie, or crazy flamethrower rushes, or the aggresive british trench rush.  COH2 is not a game I find enjoyble because it is very linear early game.  There are very few viable stratagies with out as much dynamic game play.  COH1, has 4 factions, COH2 has 2.  It's just not my kind of game.  However If you like simple and linear prediictable game play then COH2 will be very enjoyable.			"

												I played thousands of hours in COH one and I had high hopes for COH2. Having played some games in COH2 now, with regret, and no little disappointment - I find I hate this. Utterly spolied by the brilliance of COH1 and add ons and mods, I go in here, and find some cartoony version. The bleak eastern front is some disney coloured horror. The game for starters is too damn zoomed in. It needs at least an ability to zoom 30% more out from the battle field. They clearly kept too much Dawn of war involvement in this production. The game needs severe toning down on the silly over use of cartoon like colour. A better zoom. Even with this, so far, I've just not enjoyed it. I'll try some more, but everything is pop ups, and garish colours, and its missing a lot of feel from COH. Even the simple stuff like the map in the left bottom corner is just worse than COH, with more difficulty in simply map marking and so on. If you have none of these, really consider getting COH 1 and its add ons. I can't recommend COH2 at this time..			"

When this game lacks the ability to make more earning, Unlike the game was just released few years ago and have a good pontential to make a good fortune,  this old game now sold with low price and sega still need to pay for the online-gaming server .It's reasonable Sega doesn't care if they can provide a good experience anymore.

												I'm not recommending this game for most players, but for RTS gamers who love the WW2 genre sure go ahead.  COH1 is still a far better game with regards to gameplay, balance, and personally I would also say graphics.  Yes COH2 has more map detail but big deal, it only slows down the already sluggish gameplay.  COH2 is stacked very heavily towards the germans, and you see this by the number of players who play axis VS allies in MP.  I typically play the soviets for something different, but it's frustrating while battling OP stacked german teams.  Also for those that complain about DLC, you don't need upgrades to win, but for a game that's already poorly balanced its one more thing that can tip the scales in favor of the other team.			"

												Want to win more? Buy some commanders. Want to have a full and fair game experience? You're gonna have to pay for it. Want a bug-free, polished and immersive experience? You came to the wrong place, mate. Players should not have to spend huge amounts of money on DLC in the vain hope of fixing a game that should never have been broken in the first place.Probably, many of those who purchased DLC simply could not bear another minute of the disgustingly in-your-face advertising and constant prompts to pay for full access to the game that they had already paid for that they gave in and handed over more cash to make the pain go away. The commercialisation of this game is sickening and goes to show just how cynical, greedy and contemptful of gamers SEGA, and the big publishers really have become.      SEGA may not have dealt a death-blow to Company of Heroes, but with CoH2 they've left it curled in the fetal position begging for mercy. -----------------------------------------------------------------------Full Review:Company of Heroes was easily one of the best RTS games produced in recent years. The gritty gameplay, steep learning curve and atmosphere that Relic created in CoH:1 through the wartorn environments and spot on audio made for an impressively immersive experience. Tactical decisions felt utterly crucial at every moment, and it was easy to vicariously feel the terror and exuberation of your soldiers as they pushed through enemy lines or faced certain, crushing death. In CoH:2 the game has had a facelift and along with the addition of new vehicles, units and armies the scope of the franchise is greater than ever before. The addition of the Soviet forces was a much-needed expansion to the game's world, story, and gameplay and the developers have obviously set out with a clear vision to extend the legacy of CoH:1.Sadly, however, CoH2 is neither the sequel that CoH1 deserved nor the sequel that fans of the series deserved. The graphics have indeed been improved, but stunning artistic vision and attention to detail count for nought when a game's optimisation is mediocre at best. Expect janky performance when in the middle of a fierce battle unless you're playing on a remarkably powerful rig. It's not game-breaking, but it undermines the immersive fluidity that is so key to any RTS and which Relic did so well on in CoH1. Similarly, while the audio is as lush as ever to listen to, I've nonetheless experienced ridiculous mistimings. On several occasions battle music has started playing long after the firefight was well and truly over. Poor audio cues like this again undermine the immersive experience that made CoH1 and should have made CoH2 great. However, the greatest tragedy and travesty of CoH2 is the complete in-your-face, buy-buy-buy, spoon-feeding of DLC at every available opportunity. I loaded the game up for the first time in anticipation of a solid sequel and eager to see the changes from CoH1 only to discover that the most prominent change was a massive banner advertisement and constant prompts telling me that I should drop more cash on the game I had already paid for. Frankly, the over-commercialisation of this game is sickening. Sure, it's not straight up pay to win, but you can't deny that having more commanders and armies provides players who choose to pay extra for them with far greater tactical flexibility and thus opportunity (at least) to win. Commander choice is not determinative of victory, but it can go a long way. This is especially true when a DLC-purchaser knows you only have access to the standard commanders and they can therefore plan to utterly steamroll you with the commander they paid 12 bucks for.  The uneven playing field which the developers have intentionally created to make money off of feels profoundly unjust.This is especially true because of the nature of the RTS genre. I enjoy RTS games for the same reason I enjoy playing chess, cards or any other such game with friends, because it provides a chance to directly put your mental mettles to the test. The tendency towards pay to win in this game undermines that chance for a fair fight. I expect this from mediocre shooters, not from big name RTS franchises. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with releasing solid amounts of DLC for games where time and thought is put into them and (most importantly!) they don't undermine the experience of the game for players who exclusively own the core game. The problem is that on both these counts, and spectacularly on the latter, CoH2 is a failure. I can't speak for everyone else, but there's only so much callously in your face DLC-pushing that I can handle before I end up walking away from a game starting to feel sick in my mouth. This is not what I expected, wanted, or deserved from CoH2. It should not cost hundreds of dollars after the fact to have full and fair access to the contents of an RTS game. Sure, you could choose to sink a few hours into this game and you probably wouldn't have an awful time. It still looks and sounds good, and the core gameplay is solid enough. There are even some neat additions. But the fresh lick of paint that might have tricked you into thinking you just bought a mint new Porsche is going to quickly peel away to reveal the rusty 1976 Skoda shitwagon that SEGA have buried beneath.If you buy this game you're effectively lining the pockets of skeezy corporate salesmen who don't care about the consumer and just want to make a quick buck by spamming us with intrusive, underwhelming and game-ruining DLC. Don't fall for their tricks. Do not buy Company of Heroes 2.			"

												Company of Heroes 1 is just a much better game. The units selection and style of play for the factions in COH 2 feels arcadish and is horrible. The graphics are only marginally better but require signifigantly better hardware. The game does not feel polished and units seem to glide not move naturally. I think it be better to call this game something diffrent than COH 2. The unit selection for the American faction is so incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you feel like your playing in some alternate reality. The only good thing about this game is the winter maps.If you want to play best RTS of alltime buy Company of Heroes. If you want to depress yourself and frustrate yourself throw your money away on COH2.CAN I GET A REFUND?Also when SEGA is making Company of Heroes 3 in a few years can you hire a few historians and people who made COH1? Also fire any and everyone involved in COH2.Dont let my hours fool you I have played Alpha, Beta, and regular on non steam versions for many hours.			"

The core game is empty and has lots of DLC to make it a ""complete"" experience, where the first COH was much more finished. The campaign is boring and dull. The game is not very well optimised, where i could play COH (the original) on ultra, I cant even play this on medium settings?I have played this game for 50 hours, those are 50 hours too much. I want my money back and my time back. Do not make the same misstake as i have and buy this game. Stick with the first COH, superior in so many ways!			"

												To be honest, Company of Heroes 2 is a good game.However, they recently decided that loot should not be dropped randomly and made an overhaul to the loot system.I loved playing differently each few matches because I got awarded a different general which required a different playstyle than the one I was previously using.Now I have to play 3 matches to earn supply worth a wooping 1/30th of the cost of a general.I had no problem with the store when it was just a small shortcut to more customization, but now it feels like they force us to make micro transactions in order to keep the game replayable.The only thing keeping this game alive for me are the modders, who provide more content than Relic itself.So yes I think the game is good. But I don't reccomend it because the developers chose to change an originally great singleplayer experience into a grindfest if you want to want to unlock new generals which allow for new tactics.

												Very good RTS. Hours of fun!  Company of Heroes 2 is monster when it comes to micromanagement. It defines the RTS genre in which it requires actual strategy. The game plays much like a normal RTS game. The unit choices are interesting and mostly historical. Most of what you would expect in a WW2 title are here. Realistically speaking, the game is carried a lot by its graphics and physics. Calling in an airstrike and artillery for instance blows stuff up so spectacularily that it is hard not to feel a great sense of accomplishment. You can even call in paradrops and other support functions.			"

												Definitely for me the Original Company of Hero's is much more fun, But I prefer to play against the AI, the second version took out the icreased survival ability to where as they made emplacements weak and easy to destroy, not only that but they take forever to build. If you want something a little more realistic than the original version then COH2 is for you.			"

												Easily one of the best WW2 RTS games out there, graphics and story are nothing special but gameplay and online matches are where this game shines! I'd like to get into this game a little more but I was put off by its mediocre campaigns (which are only 2, the other one you have to pay for as DLC jeez) since I'm the kind of player that prioritizes plot amongst other things. I highly recommend this game to any RTS fans out there, but if you plan on buying the DLC's along with the base game I would suggest waiting for a sale, a really, really big sale like I did. The DLC's are way overpriced and if I didnt know better CoH2 resembles a skeleton of a game without the expansions and DLC's, I feel bad for those who bought this game at day one.			"

												Took me a bit to get into this game coming from being such a huge Company of Heroes one fan, but once I got the hang of it and they got some of the balance and bugs worked out, this game has proven to be a very enjoyable experience. The graphics are very detailed, the sound is excellent, the combat intense and the strategies required to win are never set in stone. It is a difficult game to fully grasp if you've no experience with an RTS like it, but features like destructible environments, cover, dynamic line of sight, and even things like armor facing make this an incredibly unique RTS with no equal. Don't expect this game to go easy on you - every little second and ability counts just as much as the units you pit against your enemy and your strategy on how to combat them. You must be able to multitask and micromanage very well all while understanding the dynamics between each unit. This is a game that is all about how you are able to deal with the cards you are dealt, not the kind of deck you build before the fight. In other words, its not so much about build order and timing as it is about positioning, reconnaissance, micromanagement, reactions, and being able to think on your feet. If that sounds like an interesting challenge to you, then I HIGHLY reccomend this game.			"

												I must admit, this game is awesome, but when it comes to dlc's its pay2win. And for some reason do they charge 13 euros for a dlc, that insane. And the new dlc ""British forces"" is pay to win, you can only use Churchill tank and dominate throu your oponent. That is not fair in my opinion, they charge you 25-30 euros and then they charge another 13 euros for an dlc. I think that this game needs to have more ""Free"" stuff, like new nations that you have to unlock to use. thats a better system in my opinion. I do not recomend to buy the dlc's to this game,All and all, i think that this game is one of the best rts'es beside Supreme commander, Age of empiers III and Star wars Empire at war.			"

Company of Heroes 2 Review:	Hello Community,I am a huge fan of strategy based games as they are full of content and amazing stories and this has to be not only one of the best WW2 strategy games out there but a brilliant story driven based game. You get the true feel of a World War 2 Commander whether its Allies or Axis as you order your troops/vehicles around the battlefiled. It has tons of replay value and full of War realistic scenarios!  If i was to rate this game, i would give it 10/10 due to the content and true realism factor.I hope you found this review helpfull!			"

												LOL  These whiney negetive reviews are ridiculous!!!! Come on guys really ""Its pay to win"" ""DLC everything""""Purchase game on a free to play platform"" ""Advertisements popping up in droves when I start the game"" ""Balance is terrible""""3vs3 and 4vs4 matches are impossible cause of balance""Holy ♥♥♥♥ are you people for real? Or did you just get spanked in a match and have to come cry on the reviews? wahhhI have over a 1000 hours in this gameThe ONLY thing I've bought besides the main game was the expansion pack which added the Brits and the Ober commandos which I rarely ever use. Yet regardless it was an expansion that added a ton of content and was released long after the initial game. YET you don't need it to play and you can still play against people that have the new armies. So it doesn't segment the player base or force you to buy it. Example of games that do force your hand and segment the player base would be like Battlefield 4 and the alike I play mainly Russian, and the commaders I use are ones that are INCLUDED in the regular game. I see no real particular advantage to any of the add on commanders. For anything they offer they also lack something else, Its all about your playing style and how a commander can complement that. If their is a commander in the store thats just driving you wild then buy it! its 2.99 and you have it for life, but you DON""T NEED IT.  Like I said they offer no real advantage over any of the other commanders. Sure you can purchase add on camo and cute name plates which do nothing to increase your odds of winning. If you wanna spend money cause you think thats cool good for you. Yet no one is making you.This game comes out with constant updates, and tweaking of the balance. Relic has not just said ""Hey it sold, lets buy a yaught and head to the Carribean and laugh at these suckers"" No they constantly are working to improve the games balance and remove any glitchs that may arise. Think back, Company of Heros 1 was a great game and they literally tweaked it and released patchs for it up and past the release of COH2. What company does that? Nobody  Bombardment of adds? I don't even know what this guy is talking about. On the main menu page their is a news thing that shows whatever been released new for the game and talks about community news. Their is nothing to close its just on the side of the main menu. When you go into a game type, all that dissapears. Far from shoving adds down your throat.  3vs3 and 4vs4 balance is bad? Is it? Wait a week and it'll change. They're constantly working on balance and sometimes it does seem to get lopsided but they always straigten it out. Also I play primarily 4vs4 games and it is awsome! I don't always win but I don't always lose either. Whenever you have a game which uses Asymetrical balance like this game their is gonna be alot of work involved in making it perfectly balanced across all player variations. Its not perfect but its always getting better. If you like real time strategy, games like Red Alert, warcraft 2, and Generals, don't listen to the nay sayers you're gonna miss out on a great game. Would I like it if COH had zero DLC? absolutely, unfortunately thats not how game companys make money anymore. The way that they've implemented DLC though I feel is fair enough since none of it, even the expansion pack, are neccesary to play against anyone else or to win against anyone else.Get a couple friends and get on multiplayer.  I'll see you on the battlefield.			"

												A beautifully designed RTS game, just like its predecessor! I have been a great fan of COH1, however COH 2 is much better than COH1 almost in every aspect. Especillay, the new Tank Warefare and the cold teck! COH 2 offers more freedom and more startegic gameplay! Plus, with the advent of Steam Workshop you can lay your hands on tonnes of new maps and mods! The only set back it is over priced, as compare to its other counter parts! Your best shot is to buy the DLC stuff when it is on sale! Anyways, this is one hell of a RTS game which I will definetly recommend!?			"

												From a historical perspective, this game leaves much to be desired. It's rather embarrassing, actually, that this game is based on actual events when it represents them this poorly. That said, gameplay-wise, it is smooth and pleasant. This game is recommended by me ONLY IF you download and play the Spearhead—Combat Overhaul modification (which is free). The vanilla game is not worth playing, and will likely result in bewilderment and frustration if sampled. I warned ya!			"

												COH2 is a bittersweet affair. The base game and gameplay is excellent; it is an improved version of COH's wonderful squad based tactics and vehicle combat, but it's split up into as many parts as SEGA could get Relic to create. COH simply had 2 expansions, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor which your could have bought with the base game for $100 MSRP, at release.COH2 has no less than 6, as well as dozens of DLC commanders and skins. The base game with minor expansions cost around $140, and the commanders would cost you nearly as much if you wanted them all. The skins I can forgive as they are cosmetic, but the commanders introduce new units and capabilities that ABSOLUTELY RUIN THE MULTIPLAYER.Take the Soviet Industry Tactics commander for instance, that gives you the capability to slam out T-70s and T-34s out so quick, the enemy barely has time to deploy AT guns. Or the Elite Troops Doctrine, that allows you to pay for veterancy in troops, as well as a Tiger Ace. Do you want the have the ability to use this against your opponents? You've got to pay extra, of course!This simply is unnacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone pay for such a shameful pay-2-win scheme.Now, with my gripe out of the way;COH2 has a great Soviet single player campaign, and the Ardennes Assault campaign is fun, although it has less personality being somewhat more freeform. I enjoyed all the missions from Case Blue, but haven't tried Victory at Stalingrad or Southern Fronts.I really, really, really wish they'd had a German compaign like in COH's Opposing Fronts. It was a favorite of mine, as well as the British Campaign. The fact that COH2 doesn't have anything more than a Soviet Campaign and American campaign in the style of Warhammer DOW Black Crusade is dissapointing. The Brits, Ostheer and Oberkommado West are completely left behind.As for the multiplayer, it's solid and fun. It allows for only 2 game modes, Victory Points and Annihilation, but games are typically fierce and fair. As long as you can ignore the unfair DLC commanders, you'll enjoy it.Overall, COH2 is a great game, but flawed by SEGA, an evil DLC loving publisher. It makes me sad that Relic fell under their corrupting and vile influence, but at least their games are still mostly intact. Without the disgusting DLC commanders, I'd give the game a 8.5-9.0 out of 10. However, with the current dispicable DLC situation, it's only a 7.5. Still a recommended game, and one of the best of the modern RTS games, but dissapointing for afformentioned reasons.			"

												Great game, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the RTS genre or WWII. Has some rather expensive and nearly pointless DLCs, but I can say at least the faction DLCs are worth buying if you enjoy the game. Overall this game is worth the cost, kinda easy to learn and has a potential to keep you entertained for a long time. 8.5/10			"

												Loved the original. Love the sequel. Would be so much better if relic didn't offer half the game in DLCs and the ""random supply drops (where you can get duplicates 75% of the time that are useless). Otherwise, would definitely reccomend. Very fun, challenging, and the workshop adds at least another 20 hours of fun. 9.5/10Edit: They fixed the supply drops. Buy this game.			"

												Better than the first one, I don't play campaign because I find Relic campaigns to be painfully boring but the multiplayer is solid. I recommend getting the the pop cap mod and the 125 units added mod to enhance the experience even further. The skirmish AI is pretty decent as well, hard is actually hard lol and I find frequently find myself on the defensive for a fair portion of the game when I play against AI. But the game is balanced.			"

												Overall I have been extremely impressed with Company of Heroes 2. Its a well rounded game with much thought put into it. It reminds me of the old Axis & Allies game from way back when. The grapics are great and with new maps coming out of the workshop daily there is endless fun. However I do not think much time was put into unit development or the addition of new units with DLC's. All factions could use additional units to add variety to gameplay. And I based on significant gameplay time, the map you play on in single player, placement of teams can greatly decide which team wins. But overall I strongly recomend the game and hope similar games come out by the developer.			"

												This is not your typical RTS. This rts is very unit and squad focused and makes you actually care for your squads moreso than any other RTS I have played. There is no building supply buildings, or gathering resources from mines. You gain resources by capturing and holding points so the battlefield is always dynamically moving, and if you do not have the correct units on the field you're ♥♥♥♥ed when the time comes. For exmaple unlike in starcraft where marines can kill dmg everything including big tanks. In COH you can't hurt tanks with regular infantry unless they have a certain specialization. This is not like any other RTS you've played, but damn is it worth it. Your units are your backbone, so treat them right becasue they aren't disposable.			"

												EXPLAINING MYSELFBefore I start my review,I will say that I played the first Company of Heroes with all its expansion packs(Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor) and that I had a rather enjoyable experience.The factions were diverse and unique and the campaign had some challenge in it.The multiplayer was the epitome of multiplayer strategy.ONE OF THESE THINGS IS NOT LIKE THE OTHERSo,what does Company of Heroes 2 offer that its predecessor doesn't?Well,the setting is different.Eastern front in the center of the game,therefore Ostheer(East German army) and the Soviet Red Army are the available factions to play as.The Germans have smaller squads but are generally superior in equipment and training(e.g.the Panzergrenadiers can be upgraded with Panzershreck to eliminate armor,none of the Soviet infantry has any upgrade to do so).The Soviets have larger squads,which gives them better chances to survive and reinforce(except the Engineers who have 4 and Sniper team who has 2,the rest of the Soviet squads have 6 men).NICE,BUT HOW DO YOU PLAY IT?The gameplay is the same as in the last game;capture point to get resorces and don't let the territories get cut off from your main base.However,instead of some points offering munitions,fuel or manpower, most points offer both munitions and fuel(in a smaller amount) with some offering just fuel or munitions but in a higher amount.Those that offer both may be secured to either increase their munitions or fuel output(but not both).Tactics such as taking cover,flanking,suppressing and vehicle positioning are important to win battles,since a heavy tank can be defeated if engaged with a AT gun while the bazooka team flanks and attacks his weak back armor.Overall,it's the same game,but...LET IT SNOWThe snow ain't just for aesthetic purposes.Heavy snow can slow down both infantry and vehicles,and in some situations your men will freeze to death if they are not in a building,vehicle or near a fireplace.Blizzarrds may occur at random(you will get a warning and a timer telling you how much is left before it hits).It lowers the sight range of all your units,while freezing the men,forcing you to take care of them.Vehicles and men leave marks on the snow so you know if someone passed there and where he went.YURI,WHAT DO YOUR BLUE EYES SEE?Tue line of sight is implemented in this game.In simple terms,your units cannot see behind walls or through trees,making ambushes a potent tactical solution(the first game didn't have true line of sight).It is a very fun mechanic that I haven't seen since the games of Stormregion(Codename:Panzers and Rush for Berlin).It makes scouting a neccessary maneuver to your strategy and smoke screens a life saver from artillery and machineguns(my Soviet Shock troops saved a lot of my men with their smoke grenades).An excellent addition to the game.LOVE IT!WANT TO GO TO A THEATER?Theater of War is and addition to the singleplayer portion of the game.You have solo challenges and coop scenarios.These can vary from officer assasination,holding a position,eliminating a armoured column during the blizzard and so on.It extends the life of the game and if you have a friend,some of the scenarios you can play with him.COMPANY OF FUNThe multiplayer is so fun I don't know what words to use.It's immersive and action packed,but smart action.You need to make decisions fast and smart to win.The user interface really helps here;on the bottor right you can select the production buildings,set a rally point and order a unit to arrive.this is important in the early stages of the game,when deployment to the frontline is crucial.The various maps also help in this,considering that they are different in sizer and terrain.SINGLE IS COLDI played the first three missions of the campaign and didn't continue because I ran out of time(I played this during the free weekend action).The campaign is inferior to that from CoH1.Whil CoH1 displayed the Americans,British and Germans as normal people doing their duty,the Soviet army men are portrayed as cowards who shoot their own men in the back.True,attrocities were made by the Red Army and the methods they used were brutal,but htere must have been some heroic moments.Sadly,the campaign doesn't show that,and the way the story is presented doesn't help.It is told via a flashback,which makes it feel detached from reality.Add in that the focus is on the bad side of the Red Army(and that the Germans are nothing more than obstacle,rather that a force),while showing nothing bad about the German army(they did attrocities,no army is safe from that) adn you get and rather empty and almost surreal story that is hard to believe or take serious.COMRADE,WHAT IS THE CONCLUSION?Company of Heroes 2 is an excellent strategy with excellent multiplayed balancing,a sizeable singleplayer content and a dull campaign story.If you're buying it for the multiplayer,you won't be dissapointed.If you're buying it for the challenges,missions and scenarios in th Theater of War you will get a kick from it.If you're buying it for and interesting story then you will get dissapointed with it.

												A beautifully designed RTS game, just like its predecessor! I have been a great fan of COH1, however COH 2 is much better than COH1 almost in every aspect. Especillay, the new Tank Warefare and the cold teck! COH 2 offers more freedom and more startegic gameplay! Plus, with the advent of Steam Workshop you can lay your hands on tonnes of new maps and mods! The only set back it is over priced, as compare to its other counter parts! Your best shot is to buy the DLC stuff when it is on sale! Anyways, this is one hell of a RTS game which I will definetly recommend!?			"

												LOL  These whiney negetive reviews are ridiculous!!!! Come on guys really ""Its pay to win"" ""DLC everything""""Purchase game on a free to play platform"" ""Advertisements popping up in droves when I start the game"" ""Balance is terrible""""3vs3 and 4vs4 matches are impossible cause of balance""Holy ♥♥♥♥ are you people for real? Or did you just get spanked in a match and have to come cry on the reviews? wahhhI have over a 1000 hours in this gameThe ONLY thing I've bought besides the main game was the expansion pack which added the Brits and the Ober commandos which I rarely ever use. Yet regardless it was an expansion that added a ton of content and was released long after the initial game. YET you don't need it to play and you can still play against people that have the new armies. So it doesn't segment the player base or force you to buy it. Example of games that do force your hand and segment the player base would be like Battlefield 4 and the alike I play mainly Russian, and the commaders I use are ones that are INCLUDED in the regular game. I see no real particular advantage to any of the add on commanders. For anything they offer they also lack something else, Its all about your playing style and how a commander can complement that. If their is a commander in the store thats just driving you wild then buy it! its 2.99 and you have it for life, but you DON""T NEED IT.  Like I said they offer no real advantage over any of the other commanders. Sure you can purchase add on camo and cute name plates which do nothing to increase your odds of winning. If you wanna spend money cause you think thats cool good for you. Yet no one is making you.This game comes out with constant updates, and tweaking of the balance. Relic has not just said ""Hey it sold, lets buy a yaught and head to the Carribean and laugh at these suckers"" No they constantly are working to improve the games balance and remove any glitchs that may arise. Think back, Company of Heros 1 was a great game and they literally tweaked it and released patchs for it up and past the release of COH2. What company does that? Nobody  Bombardment of adds? I don't even know what this guy is talking about. On the main menu page their is a news thing that shows whatever been released new for the game and talks about community news. Their is nothing to close its just on the side of the main menu. When you go into a game type, all that dissapears. Far from shoving adds down your throat.  3vs3 and 4vs4 balance is bad? Is it? Wait a week and it'll change. They're constantly working on balance and sometimes it does seem to get lopsided but they always straigten it out. Also I play primarily 4vs4 games and it is awsome! I don't always win but I don't always lose either. Whenever you have a game which uses Asymetrical balance like this game their is gonna be alot of work involved in making it perfectly balanced across all player variations. Its not perfect but its always getting better. If you like real time strategy, games like Red Alert, warcraft 2, and Generals, don't listen to the nay sayers you're gonna miss out on a great game. Would I like it if COH had zero DLC? absolutely, unfortunately thats not how game companys make money anymore. The way that they've implemented DLC though I feel is fair enough since none of it, even the expansion pack, are neccesary to play against anyone else or to win against anyone else.Get a couple friends and get on multiplayer.  I'll see you on the battlefield.			"

												if your reading this review instead of buying and/or playing it right now you are wrong. and make sure you buy the western front armies and the brits obviously or else you are just ugly. no seriously this game is the only rts i can even play anymore because its just the best one. i cant even play coh 1 anymore, and that was like the greatest game ever. i only play the multiplayer so i dnt have the single player expansions, but the multiplayer is where its at though. and the game isnt a super greedy money pit eating dickmouth that everyone says it is for some reason. if u wanna buy extra♥♥♥♥♥♥u can, it doesnt shove it up your♥♥♥♥♥though like people say it does. and idk why if they add a couple of skins and whatnot it makes some people get all high and mighty and stop playing because they say it ""ruins the game"". if the gameplay is good than who cares if some guy wants to spend extra money on aesthetic stuff or single player dlc? yea you can also buy commanders which you can unlock in-game anyway, but the commanders you can buy dont give you any amazing abilities that make the game unbalanced or give the enemy an unfair advantage at all, it just gives you different options or units, none of which are gamebreaking or OP by any means. most people still use the originsl commanders half the time anyways. so yea, buy this now, end of discussion.

												I must admit, this game is awesome, but when it comes to dlc's its pay2win. And for some reason do they charge 13 euros for a dlc, that insane. And the new dlc ""British forces"" is pay to win, you can only use Churchill tank and dominate throu your oponent. That is not fair in my opinion, they charge you 25-30 euros and then they charge another 13 euros for an dlc. I think that this game needs to have more ""Free"" stuff, like new nations that you have to unlock to use. thats a better system in my opinion. I do not recomend to buy the dlc's to this game,All and all, i think that this game is one of the best rts'es beside Supreme commander, Age of empiers III and Star wars Empire at war.			"

Company of Heroes 2 Review:	Hello Community,I am a huge fan of strategy based games as they are full of content and amazing stories and this has to be not only one of the best WW2 strategy games out there but a brilliant story driven based game. You get the true feel of a World War 2 Commander whether its Allies or Axis as you order your troops/vehicles around the battlefiled. It has tons of replay value and full of War realistic scenarios!  If i was to rate this game, i would give it 10/10 due to the content and true realism factor.I hope you found this review helpfull!			"

Its constantly parading VERY OVERPRICED DLC in front of you and it just wont leave you alone about it. And none of the DLC is worth the money, unless its on sale for super-duper cheap. And also if you dont have the DLC, its quite hard to be effective in the multiplayer, so it is kinda pay-to-win.So all-in-all its an amazing fun game thats amazingly overpriced in all aspects.			"

												COH2 is a bittersweet affair. The base game and gameplay is excellent; it is an improved version of COH's wonderful squad based tactics and vehicle combat, but it's split up into as many parts as SEGA could get Relic to create. COH simply had 2 expansions, Opposing Fronts and Tales of Valor which your could have bought with the base game for $100 MSRP, at release.COH2 has no less than 6, as well as dozens of DLC commanders and skins. The base game with minor expansions cost around $140, and the commanders would cost you nearly as much if you wanted them all. The skins I can forgive as they are cosmetic, but the commanders introduce new units and capabilities that ABSOLUTELY RUIN THE MULTIPLAYER.Take the Soviet Industry Tactics commander for instance, that gives you the capability to slam out T-70s and T-34s out so quick, the enemy barely has time to deploy AT guns. Or the Elite Troops Doctrine, that allows you to pay for veterancy in troops, as well as a Tiger Ace. Do you want the have the ability to use this against your opponents? You've got to pay extra, of course!This simply is unnacceptable, and I can't recommend anyone pay for such a shameful pay-2-win scheme.Now, with my gripe out of the way;COH2 has a great Soviet single player campaign, and the Ardennes Assault campaign is fun, although it has less personality being somewhat more freeform. I enjoyed all the missions from Case Blue, but haven't tried Victory at Stalingrad or Southern Fronts.I really, really, really wish they'd had a German compaign like in COH's Opposing Fronts. It was a favorite of mine, as well as the British Campaign. The fact that COH2 doesn't have anything more than a Soviet Campaign and American campaign in the style of Warhammer DOW Black Crusade is dissapointing. The Brits, Ostheer and Oberkommado West are completely left behind.As for the multiplayer, it's solid and fun. It allows for only 2 game modes, Victory Points and Annihilation, but games are typically fierce and fair. As long as you can ignore the unfair DLC commanders, you'll enjoy it.Overall, COH2 is a great game, but flawed by SEGA, an evil DLC loving publisher. It makes me sad that Relic fell under their corrupting and vile influence, but at least their games are still mostly intact. Without the disgusting DLC commanders, I'd give the game a 8.5-9.0 out of 10. However, with the current dispicable DLC situation, it's only a 7.5. Still a recommended game, and one of the best of the modern RTS games, but dissapointing for afformentioned reasons.			"

												This game got good and bad sides.the campain is ♥♥♥♥♥♥er then the first1st. The campain feels like propoganda that all soviet did under WW2 was bad, the campain never showed some bright side only dark and evil thoughts. never like example Yuri tells dimitri a joke, or that when they win the war and we go back home he will be a farmer or something only some♥♥♥♥♥♥like, IAM YURI I SAFE YOU♥♥♥♥♥2 sec later PISTOL TO FACE CAUSE YOU TRAITOR FOR SAVING ANOTHER. and i find it hard to belive every second of the eastern war was like that. iknow that the soviets wassent as clean as snow but niether was the others.2nd. the story is also a mixed truth (SPOILER ALERT) at a point you get orders to equip flametrower and burn houses WITH F***ing living ppl inside and weapon fields where you BURN your comrades an at the end some weapon trains escape that town and then some others ran to get to a brigde there explode right in front of there faces so they die to the nazi.wich could happen but stuff like that happens in all endings of cut scenes, at another point the soviet promiss a small gruop of polish rebel group some supllies after they done some stuff for them no surpirce evul soviet shoots them in the back while they look at the supplies... it was like he said you can see the bullets but you better aint touch it cause then BANG but i will do that anyways what are friends for!3th. If you compare this to CoH1 then all deaths were heroic or they where talked like they was heros in CoH2 they are all where just some meat there need to be grinded with either the enemyes or yours MG that was how almost every cutscene was. why could at least some of them not be hey comrade i aint that hungrey to day have the last piece of bread i got left.reality. COMRADE STAND STILL SO I CAN SHOT YOU WITH MY NEW GUN THE PPSH-41 SO YOU BE GOOD MEAT TO EAT!!!!!(note this action never happen there was no sign of canibalisme but its should wonder me they thought to add it!) the campain is♥♥♥♥♥♥cause in CoH1 things about the Nazis and US/UK where more fair it was not like USA DOMINATE it was pretty much fair, but in CoH2 its clear they liked the nazis alot better then the USSR the way they make the cutscence, and its not like there is some parts of the game you are german. so they could not fix it up so it woulden feel like Soviet union is just evil.i can say do not buy this game for the story it sux for that i give it 1/10the Multiplayer: i have not played that much ranked matches i have more played me and my friend VS bots and it was okay, the Cold mechanisme works pretty well, there are some snow maps where some times there comes a storm and your units will freeze unless they are close to some heat source or in side a house ELS they will frez to death, it could be nice if they did like the soviets had that anvantage that they could be more out in the cold since they had MUCH better winter uniforms then the germans since most the team where a little unbalanced at some points it just felt they where MEGA OP cause they easy could get in hands of weapons there made your soldiers go Pin down. the most importen things for them where Munition,and fuel.but the soviets where good in the start because they could faster get in hands of cheap and a bit effective units, but when the germans had got to many supplies then the Russians where more or less f***d. but me and my firend got p with a okay tactic(against bots) where we fast took as manny points to get many supllies and when we coulden hold them we falled back to base where there was 3MGs,3fieldguns and 2 rocket barrage and later some heavy duty attelry there at veterancy 3 could bomb some part at there base or dmagde there tanks.over all i will give the Multi player 5/10and a total score of 4,5/10 the reason to 4,5 is because that i could not decide if it should be 4 or 5. in my opnion the game is only something worth if its on steam sale for 50% or more and if you got some friends to play it with but over all its feels kinda cheap but it could probaly be worse if they didnt delay it. but there was one glitch when i played it there did so the enemy soldier would not die so he just lay on the ground bleeding out and all your units just focus fired on him wich was pretty annoying whit me and my friends tactic.

												Ardennes Assault Review:As a long time fan of this series, it pains me to point out that this franchise has devolved into a series of cash grab, DLC schemes. Ardennes Assault could have been built as a dedicated expansion, similar to Opposing Fronts (the best CoH game by far). Instead, Ardennes Assault is chopped into various peices of DLC (Multi-player armies, campaign Fox Company, etc.) which are sold seperately and which are not individually worth the price. This game is not at all worth full price. Furthermore, the franchise has simply given up on their fan base. Save your money and play Opposing Fronts or Tales of Valor.			"

												I have to say I am not impressed with this game. I loved Company of Heroes but this, you just can't compare the two. This game does not have the feel of Company of Heroes. It was poorly made and like everyone else said, runs on very expensive DLC. When I played this, it was simply not fun. The idea of all these commanders instead of doctrines sucks. And just the overall look of the game is poor. The vehicles in this game compared to the ones in the first look crapy. They seem very unrealistic. And to all Company of Heroes fans, I recommend not buying this game. It is a poor sequal and makes the first seem far better. As a matter in fact, buy the first with all the DLC, download the Eastern Front mod, and boom, Company of Heroes 2 but better. Please, don't make the mistake of buying this poor excuse for a Company of Heroes game. It's just sad to see how this turned out.P.S: The pictures and trailers make the game look to be far better and nicer than it actually is			"

												I find this game difficult to recommend. Not because it's bad, that's certainly not the case! It's actually very enjoyable. My gripe with it is that, in almost every aspect, it pales in comparison to its predecessor. Company of Heroes 1 is still a fantastic game, one with (arguably) more content and better balance. It's also much, much cheaper than this sequel.Company of Heroes 2 has some interesting additions to the incredible RTS formula Relic have forged. Cold weather means warmth is a new resource to be considered, frozen lakes crack under bombardment, and units are slowed during blizzards. Slight changes have been made to unit control, too, so now players can vault soldiers over cover, and split and merge squads at their will. These new elements are fun, but ultimately don't add a whole lot to the game. The same can be said for the new maps. I honestly find myself enjoying the selection of battlegrounds included from the original more than the new content. They don't have the same edge, and really, that can be said for the entire game.Players new to the franchise will likely have a great time playing this game. Returning players may find themselves a little bit disappointed. Regardless, Company of Heroes 2 is a solid game, I won't deny that. I would just encourage anyone who reads this to opt for the original with its expansions.			"

												Despite loving the original Company of Heroes games, I feel like this game is made purely to make money.Without buying the numerous DLC you are severely limited to what you can play - campaigns are even off limits until you buy them separately. This makes the game unplayable - it leads you on to think that you are able to play a certain mission, and at the last possible point will inform you that you need to buy it.Quite frankly, unless you're willing to spend atrocious amounts of money on this game, it isn't worth it.

												This is not your typical RTS. This rts is very unit and squad focused and makes you actually care for your squads moreso than any other RTS I have played. There is no building supply buildings, or gathering resources from mines. You gain resources by capturing and holding points so the battlefield is always dynamically moving, and if you do not have the correct units on the field you're ♥♥♥♥ed when the time comes. For exmaple unlike in starcraft where marines can kill dmg everything including big tanks. In COH you can't hurt tanks with regular infantry unless they have a certain specialization. This is not like any other RTS you've played, but damn is it worth it. Your units are your backbone, so treat them right becasue they aren't disposable.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is the latest installment to one of if not the best RTS series of all time. Set in the Eastern Front experience the brutal battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad. Many of the core prinicples and mechanices still are present here. Cover, flanking, suppression, etc. are all still important concepts to master. However you not only fight the enemy but the weather as well. You constantly have to ensure your soldiers have a fire nearby or cover to protect them from the cold. Its this new dynamic that sets COH2 apart but also can lead to some of its biggest frustrations. Leave your soldiers exposed for too long and they will die from the elements. This concept makes sense from a realistic standpoint. However in practice it can make a game that already requires a significant amount of micromanagement to be awkward. In the end Company of Heroes award winning blend of real time combat and territory control return with new features that make the harsh soviet winters just as deadly as the german war machine that you face. **DLC**The DLC for COH2 thus far has been ...alright. While I appreciate being able to play as the american forces and the OKW; I find it odd that these factions were released as standalone multiplayer addons when they usually would have been included in a standalone expansion with a story campaign. Perhaps even more baffling is that after OKW and US forces were launched as standalone multiplayer factions? They then did release an American campaign. Ardennes Assault is pretty solid and offers a unique campaign that plays a bit like an actual war where your missions/battles gain you territory on a tactical map. Now the British forces are again getting their own standalone multiplayer DLC. I have a feeling that when I buy these 'campaigns' I am being charged for something I have already bought in the multiplayer DLC.			"

												This game is NOT a cake walk RTS; hard to beat Standard AI without sound tactics, full engagement with game interface and a decent (patient) partner.  I really like to Western Front forces  I hope that moremaps are modded and provided for Brit forces, especially in North Africa.  I would suggest that newcomers take the time to take advantage of watching replays, campaign scenarios  and practicing often against on-line bots.  Even playing with a friends 2v2 against the computer AI will likely seem like a futile exercise unless you review and adjust.  Graphics and sound are pretty good, and  newly added spoils/ rewards encourage you to keep at it.   Yes it is fun, if you don't mind losing as you learn!			"

												I haven't put the most amount of time into this game, As shown by my hours, But i thought i'd take the time to review it.Pros:+Great graphics for an RTS.+Fun, Addictive, And mostly easy to get the hang of, Although weaknesses and strengths of each unit can be a problem.+Large unit diversity, They really thought about what would counter what, Especially in a world war 2 background.+Well thought out story, I wont spoil it for you, But it has its own mix of mystery, action and well, War.Cons:-Unless your very experienced, Random multiplayer is a problem, Due to them turning ranks into loot drop metres, Its hard to find players that your matched with of skill.-Quite a bit of dlc, Forcing you to buy other factions and an extra campaign.-Quite an old game, Therefor not alot of people are on it anymore, But there are SOME.Conclusion:I think Company of Heroes 2 is a well-thought-out sequel to one of my favourite RTS game franchises of all time.I reccomend it but its not everybodies cup of tea, Most people prefare other rts or just none at all.And on that note, Always remember: To war comrades!

												This game is awesome, if u are a ww2 enthusiast or are just interesting in the fighting in ww2 this game is for you, it combines starcraft and ww2 in to one game with a werry interesting campaign and werry awesome gameplay. I totally recomend, but before you get in the game there is one minor flaw- in game purchases, they arent werry big chuncs of the multiplayer game and they can be earned by playing the game but its a similar algorithm to the hextec chests in LoL, u can get the stuff for free but it will take you a LONG time. Have fun with the game and if u want invite me for a game or two.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is a fantastic, albeit it slightly rage-inducing multiplayer experience. The singeplayer - i.e, the campaign and the mission packs that go with it in Theatre of War mode, is pretty lacklustre with not much to show for itself other than a narrative storyline driven by a relatively novice approach to the Eastern Front and some interesting cooperative missions for the Case Blue ToW mission series.Multiplayer is where CoH2 really comes into its own. I feel the game is in this respect vastly superior to its predecessor, but it doesn't come without flaws. As an Ostheer player, the game breaking nature of the British Forces addon often results in boring, repetitive gameplay, wherein a British player need only establish a collection of mortar emplacements and Bofors guns to hold strategic locations, making them impenetrable without the right tools. In many cases you'll end up having to field medium tanks such as the Panzer IV to make any progress against these positions as the hitting power of the 8 cm Granatwerfer 34 (standard German mortar) is not sufficient except in large numbers to quickly get rid of the British mortar emplacement, which is static and fortified, and fires quite rapidly.If you want this game to provide a realistic experience of the Second World War, or a balanced multiplayer, don't bother. Both the Ostheer and Oberkommando West require a decent level of skill on the part of the player in order to function correctly. If you're relying on someone you don't know - either in 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4 setups - you might find yourself losing games repeatedly, which can be extremely frustrating if you feel you're doing well. Allied and Soviet units such as the SU-85, Jackson, and IS-2 are big threats, since their build can more or less carry even the most incompetent Allied or Soviet player in the mid to late game. As the Ostheer, you'll find yourself commanding skilled but in many cases inadequate units against hordes of American riflemen with BARs, Tommies with their green cover rapid firing bonus, or just Soviet conscripts in large numbers. To counter this you have to be quick off the ball, with an effective reaction time and an understanding of which units trump their counterparts, and so on. All in all I enjoy the game, and I would recommend it, though it does have an abundant capacity to make you utter every naughty word under the sun.			"

												Haven't been playing long CoH2 for long but certainly compared to CoH1 it does make me feel that I have to work that bit harder to win my favorite custom skirmish maps. The largest 6-8 (I assume players I think, I could be wrong I'm still learning). Just recently I found out by straffing the enemy with a small fast armoured tank would pretty much wipe out all the bazooka weilding enemy units in quick succession. Just been playing as the Russians for now and I don't have the luxury of Bazookas and they were doing murder to me tanks. There is a lot more to this game than the original and will make you dig deep, but no matter how many times you get pushed back, eventually you will prevail.Anyway it's certainly not about numbers but more about using your noodle, which makes for a refreshing change. The first game I could pretty much win by a continual barrage of mortars on each map, but not with this the cheaper mortars aren't as effective/powerful (damn), and the enemy will find every opportunity to flank you (very scary) or kamikaze straight in to a small pocket of resistance..there goes a few machine gun posts and mortar squads in one foul swoop by a rogue enemy tank.I loved the first and I'm really enyoying this, but there is a worrying trend to only sell you half a game (Star Wars Battlefront I'm looking at you), but thankfully I got this game dirt cheap in erm GAME store, talking about £5 here.I have tried a mod map download but unfortunately it crashed having tried to load a saved game...shame.PS When I stop having fun playing custom skirmishes (could be a long long time as I'm having to much fun) then I'll have a go at the campaign. The first I feel was the finest WWII strategy game I've ever played (Sudden Strike was another fave) and the second seems to living up to those standards. Just a bug on a mod so no problems with the game, very solid, well made, lovely piece of gaming delight. Hard though, or I'm just a bit crap lolPS Blizzard conditions are really cool, have to make little camp fires otherwise I get told off for letting my troops freeze to death lol.I certainly recommend this game plus try and get the game in a sale because I feel companies are fleecing us somewhat at the moment. Battlefield 4 and Skyrim I feel are the only games that I can remember recently of getting my monies worth (Excluding this one of course).Got the Western Front Armies cheap too....smug mode..   "

												Highly recommend! While certain factions do suffer from having slightly overpowered commanders (I'm looking at you, British Forces), I still think this game is extremely well-balanced. Each faction plays entirely differently, yet all require a good eye for strategy. This game's campaign isn't mind-blowing, but does serve well to introduce you to tactics you might not have considered previously. The cutscenes are a little laughable though, and worth skipping if you don't wish to lose interest in livingOnline matchmaking works exceedingly well, with matches ranging from 1v1 to 4v4 (both in PvP and co-op against AI). The co-op scenarios are also a lot of fun too!Cannot recommend this game enough if you are looking for a new strategy game. Having come from Rome 2, the learning curve was steep for me but thoroughly rewarding!NB while the store did appear to offer ""pay to win"" commanders, they have revamped the store so that it is possible to grind up and pay for these commanders/skins with in game currency (which can gained from playing a lot of matches) - a system similar to that of Rainbow Six Siege's store.

My favorite part is when armour hits the battle ground for the first time, the whole game changes to a new pace. Fan of Age of the Empire games, this is just with bullets and tanks.

												I've always liked RTS and WW2 themed games, so when I saw CoH2 came out, I bought it immediately. Turned out it kind of disappointed me. While CoH2 is a solid game, and many people may like it, I personally did not enjoy it as I expected.The good things of CoH2: the graphics are quite solid, the sound effect is good, the AIs are not dumb, the campaign is fun to playThese are the reasons why I said CoH2 is a solid game, down to its core, it would be still quite enjoyable to play, if you really get a hang of it. But this is my problem with CoH2.CoH2 is not really friendly to new players to the game. I grew up playing C&C series, so I would say that I do have a general understanding of how to play RTS games. But after seven hours of gameplay, I still wouldn't say I get a hang of how to really play CoH2. The tutorials don't really help. And now, with numerous new (PAID) content came out, the interface of the game become even more confusing.Despite this, the core game lacks content. You can only build few structures and few different kinds of units. If you want more, pay for the DLCs. I might give this game another chance after I cleared up all the dusted games in my library, but with the impression it has given me now, I cannot recommend it. "

												Para mi uno de los mejores juegos de estrategia en tiempo real de la actualidad. Sigue una linea propia que no se ve en otros juegos. El nivel gráfico somo siempre es superior a muchos otros ademas de su jugabilidad, tambien creo que han avanzado mucho en lo que es la inmersión en el combate, es mucho mas realista, mas brutal. Aunque por supuesto tiene sus cosas malas, al menos para mi. EN primer lugar decepcionado con el sistema de DLCs, me parece una salvajada que pagando 50 euros por el juego, venga ala mitad, ya que si quieres camuflajes o comandantes los tienes que comprar, para tener el juego completo a parte de los 50 euritos que ya has pagado deberias abonar otros 54 euros en dlcs, en definitiva una sajada. Tambien como siempre, pàra mi gusto hay poca variedad de unidades, en la segunda guerra mundial habia muchisima variedad de vehiculos y de unidades, no digo de poner 200 unidades diferentes por bando, pero se echa en falta por ejemplo algo de artilleria autopropulsada, algunos tanques, y por supuesto la pieza antitanque de 88 mm tan famosa. Tambien echo en falta algo mas de personalización, creo que se podria avanzar mas en ese aspecto aunqeu bueno poco a poco. Un modo solo infanteria tampoco estaria mal.En definitiva a pesar de los defectos, si es un juego que recomiendo, aunque le qeuda un largo recorrido de trabajo.Un saludo a todos.			"

												Overall, this is a good game. However, the first one is still much better. Below are the reasons why: 1. In-game microtransactions (HATE THESE)2. Unlocks for your army. This means that more experienced players have an even greater advantage. Absolutely no reason why these are necessary - make every fight fair, regardless of player ""level"" 3. Weather system is really the only change, and is more annoying than anything. Having your troops freeze to death because they chase an enemy 5 feet from the fire and can't find their way back sucks. 4. Only 2 armies, compared to the 4 in the original game. 5. Duplicates many of the maps from the original.Honestly, save yourself the money and just go play the first one again. Nothing (and I mean virtually nothing) has changed for this version. It feels more like an expansion than a sequel. Sad to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this one, as the CoH1 is one of my favorite games ever. "

												This is not a worthy sequel to the amazing epic super awesome Company of Heroes. Relic has managed to completely ignore the aspects that made CoH 1 a really great RTS game, like command trees, good micro/macro balance etc. Instead they made a DLC heavy ""pay to win"" with shiny graphics. Recognize the concept from Dawn of War series? Booyeah!Is CoH 2 better than it's predecessor in gameplay? No. It only looks prettier (if you have a top of the line PC that is...) and is more expensive. Even though it's super cool when I can zoom in to see the wrinkles on my Conscripts uniforms it does not in any way compensate for bad gameplay, only micro and no macro, lousy pathfinding and a frame rate of 20 fps. The only real improvement from the first game is the option to choose grid layout for key shortcuts. To get good stats for your units you also need to grind grind grind xp to level up certain abilities. Yuck. I tried to give the game an honest chance after the initial disappointment, but I could not take more than 4 hours of this crap.So a recommendation to you all: get the good old CoH 1 with expansions and download some of the excellent mods out there, like Blitzkrieg, Eastern Front etc and get down to some serious WW2 strategy! :)			"

												An excellent game, If you wish to purchase it I reccomend getting it during a sale, and getting the bundle that includes the expansions.So Company of Heroes 2 adds many new features that the original CoH lacked, these include snow/temperature that will affect your infantry and how you use them, and being able to capture vehicles if the crew are killed. Ive found the gameplay to be excedingly fun and, although ive only played against bots, the enemies can be a challenge unless you know what tactics to use against them. I strongly reccomend this to any CoH fan or anybody looking for a WW2 RTS game.			"

												Best. Game. Ever. Made.It's a grown up version of RTS Games, because everything matters. Weather, Cover, Ressources Management, Strategy and: Lots of Tactics.Theres a lot of Commanders to Start with, you can choose three of them to take them into Battle, then you choose from one of those three on the Field.Each Army has a lot of Units to use, so without even choosing a Doctrine (Commander) you have a lot of diversity to play against your oppononent. With your choosen Commander, you even get more specialised Units, to make your Army better for your Strategy. But none of this really matters, if you dont use your tactical advantages. In the end, its all about micromanaging your troops, to lure your opponent in traps, flanking him, whatever you can use, to win the game. Even if it means, to steal enemy Vehicles or Teamweapons, its all tactical decisions you got to make during the match you play. Theres a lot of complaints about the Commanders you can buy, but in the end, this Commanders are very specialised in one or another way, which means, they got a lot of disatvantages, just because theyre so specialised. So what i try to say is: Theyre useless, if you dont know how to use them right, or if your opponent knows about your disatvantages and counters you the right way.I played the first one surely for more than thousand hours, and im already played lots of hours in the second one, which in my opinion is better, because of hopping over obstacles with your troops, and the fact, that theres the truesight, which you can perfectly use to lure your enemy into traps, because the cant see whats behind the House or behind the Forest. Or even behind the Hill. But because of all this, its a very hard Game, its still unpredictable, and no single game is like the other, its always different.Only thing i would complain about this game is:The war spoils system is very strange. You get a lot of the same Commanders and stuff all the time, but you cant give it to someone, nor can you sell them. You just own them a couple of times.Sorry for my bad english :)			"

												Company of Heroes 2 without any DLC is a traditional RTS. With DLC, it starts to change things up a bit. I honestly really like playing this game and right off the bat, recommend you give it a shot, now let me tell you a little bit about why.+The Graphics are astounding. The visuals during snowstorms, of any and every terrain, splendidly done.+The sounds are near-perfect. Just about everything sounds right. From the gunfire, to the explosions, to your poor infantry unit screaming in agony as he crawls away from his dead squadron, both of his legs blown off. Someone, PLEASE SOMEONE! Just the poor guy out of his misery already!+A truly immersive experience in terms of animations and ""impact"". Every unit you kill or injure. Every base or building you destroy, everything just feels right. It's satisfying, terrifying, and depressing, all at the same time. The game pulls off playing with your emotions without even trying.+The controls are done just right for every faction to play smoothly, gameplay is quality.-Optimized JUST poorly enough to notice unless you're packing a $2000 dollar computer.-No multi-GPU support. So you can't even make up for that lack of optimization.-A typical boring and aggravating campaign. It starts out fantastically, don't get me wrong, but as you get further in it feels like less effort was put into it. Towards the end you'll be begging for it to be over.-The most annoying marketing strategy I have ever seen. $40 for the game, $20 for the US and OKW (or $13 each separately). $13 for the British. And $40 for a US campaign! Not to mention $5-$10 for misc DLC. The entire game will cost you a whopping $143 full price. Stop charging us so much for extra content when you won't even optimize the content you already have.The game's real hit game modes are its 4v4 PvP or PvE matches. Most of my 48 hours I've played upon writing this review were spent there, and I know yours will be too if you pick this game up. I give this game an 8/10. It's fantastic, but the lack of optimization and multiGPU support, plus the lackluster campaign and ABYSMAL marketing strategy knocked it down from being the best RTS I have played in a long time. I'd still recommend it however, but do yourself a favor. Unless you have money to spare, buy this on a holiday sale. Don't fall for Relic's greedy marketing strategy if you can help it.			"

												Overall, this is a good game. However, the first one is still much better. Below are the reasons why: 1. In-game microtransactions (HATE THESE)2. Unlocks for your army. This means that more experienced players have an even greater advantage. Absolutely no reason why these are necessary - make every fight fair, regardless of player ""level"" 3. Weather system is really the only change, and is more annoying than anything. Having your troops freeze to death because they chase an enemy 5 feet from the fire and can't find their way back sucks. 4. Only 2 armies, compared to the 4 in the original game. 5.

												Para mi uno de los mejores juegos de estrategia en tiempo real de la actualidad. Sigue una linea propia que no se ve en otros juegos. El nivel gráfico somo siempre es superior a muchos otros ademas de su jugabilidad, tambien creo que han avanzado mucho en lo que es la inmersión en el combate, es mucho mas realista, mas brutal. Aunque por supuesto tiene sus cosas malas, al menos para mi. EN primer lugar decepcionado con el sistema de DLCs, me parece una salvajada que pagando 50 euros por el juego, venga ala mitad, ya que si quieres camuflajes o comandantes los tienes que comprar, para tener el juego completo a parte de los 50 euritos que ya has pagado deberias abonar otros 54 euros en dlcs, en definitiva una sajada. Tambien como siempre, pàra mi gusto hay poca variedad de unidades, en la segunda guerra mundial habia muchisima variedad de vehiculos y de unidades, no digo de poner 200 unidades diferentes por bando, pero se echa en falta por ejemplo algo de artilleria autopropulsada, algunos tanques, y por supuesto la pieza antitanque de 88 mm tan famosa. Tambien echo en falta algo mas de personalización, creo que se podria avanzar mas en ese aspecto aunqeu bueno poco a poco. Un modo solo infanteria tampoco estaria mal.En definitiva a pesar de los defectos, si es un juego que recomiendo, aunque le qeuda un largo recorrido de trabajo.Un saludo a todos.			"

I think you should pay for game once and have 100%, with COH2 you buy a game and you get very little with it, for all the rest is extra... Payable DLC should be optional, like skins/cammos and stuff liike that. Not items affecting actaul gameplay.			"

I want to love this game, but the game is horribly and frustratingly imbalanced.  The AI is equaly  awful. Unfortunately the developers do not bother listening to the reviews of their game, because this game is as bad as it was when it first came out.   Not worth buying at any price. : (			"

												Ok game but DLC commanders are extremely overpriced for the benefits they offer. Other DLC for extra scenarios seems a bit overpriced as well. As far as I'm concerned I will not be buying any DLC until it goes on sale, even then I'll think twice about it. As for the main game it never seems like you have enough manpower either stockpiled or flowing in. AI battles on harder settings feel as though they have an infinite amount of resources while you are struggling just to send throw away units to keep them at bay long enough to call in bigger units. This game definitely needs some balancing tweeks. With the overpriced DLC I would suggest only getting this game if you plan on playing by yourself most of the time. Otherwise, save your money and buy 3 or 4 other better games for how much you'd be pouring into this one.			"

												I remember being sad and angry with the choices Relic made when playing the beta of this game while still being very much a fanboy of the original. Bought the game after it matured a bit and saw it for what it really was. An, allthough not exactly the same, experince akin to the original COH. An RTS with focus on smaller engagements and zero to none focus on basebuilding. Good grahpics, physics and a steep but very satisfying learning curve. Good game for just wanting to build giant tanks and artillery and utterly destroy the enemy in a compstomp or to really get your tactical/strategic itch scratched in very tense and stressfull 1 on 1 matches in automatch.Downside of the game is the multiple DLC. The new factions offer more than enough of new contact, however each faction has extra commanders as well which in theory you can get by playing the game for free... this will take some luck and a lot of time. If you want to play a specific commander, be prepared to spend some extra cash or invest a lot of time.It took some time, but this has become a game not onyl worthy of the name ""company of heroes"" but has also added on to that legacy.

												Ok game but DLC commanders are extremely overpriced for the benefits they offer. Other DLC for extra scenarios seems a bit overpriced as well. As far as I'm concerned I will not be buying any DLC until it goes on sale, even then I'll think twice about it. As for the main game it never seems like you have enough manpower either stockpiled or flowing in. AI battles on harder settings feel as though they have an infinite amount of resources while you are struggling just to send throw away units to keep them at bay long enough to call in bigger units. This game definitely needs some balancing tweeks. With the overpriced DLC I would suggest only getting this game if you plan on playing by yourself most of the time. Otherwise, save your money and buy 3 or 4 other better games for how much you'd be pouring into this one.			"

												I don't quite know how they got there, but Relic & Sega managed to pull back CoH2 from the brink of a major RTS let-down - and get old CoH players (like me) - back inline.The core issue I think was with the vanilla CoH2 release. It featured the well documented Eastern Front struggle between the Germans and the Russians in WW2. As savage and tragic as that campaign was (from both sides) - it didn't necessarily make for a good RTS game. Frankly, the Russian side was boring. It used units that unless you had some specific interest in that arena of WW2, meant very little. Worse, the developers seemed to take the stance that there were endless streams of Russian infantry cannon fodder to take on the German might. While there may have been some historical truth to that - again, it didn't make for a good RTS game. Added to that was the awful, awful 'freeze-factor' where your troops had to maintain a proximity to a camp-fire, otherwise they would freeze to death. The final nail in the coffin were the system requirements. Despite having a PC that easily surpassed the recommended spec for the game, CoH2 ran very poorly indeed.CoH2 was initially a MASSIVE disappointment for me. Having put in around 500 hours into the original game, including completing the excellent campaign modes several times over - CoH2 just left me cold. The base building that was such a central, yet small part to CoH had now simply been left in as a game function. It was a legacy addition - as your new units crept in from the side of the screen, with little bearing on the building that they 'should' have spawned from. The buildings also looked (and still do) - very weedy. Like ramshackle constructions rather than a dedicated factory for producing units and machines of war. Gone were the little turreted Germans atop of buildings from the Fortify Perimeter of the Axis Defensive Doctrine - ones that provided the ultimate last-ditch defence and reminded me in a fond way of the Sensible Software classic - Mega Lo Mania.CoH2 was uninstalled - and for quite some time. I purchased the occasional DLC, retried it, but the old demons and natural anti-bias against the game that I had built up, quickly made me remove it from my hard drive, yet again.More add-ons came over time. The Ardennes Offensive was added, as were the new units of the US Forces and the Oberkommando West. Still, the game didn't drag me back - even when strangely I decided to purchase the British Forces DLC (why buy expansions for a game that you don't play? :P). I gave in several weeks ago - CoH2 had been out for a considerable amount of time and Windows 10 was now installed on my PC. A recent update patch came on the update list, so I decided to give CoH2 one last try....I chose the British Forces - as they were never a favourite of mine in the original game and I wasn't expecting much anyway. A quick-fire skirmish resulted in my win over an Easy German side. I retried it - this time alone against two AI and I won again. The familiar paper-scissor-rock mentality of using units started to come back. Not only that, but Relic had added some immensely useful shortcuts within the game and being on Steam, the Greenlight community was in full swing.My all-time favourite map from CoH of Achelous River was faithfully recreated and freely available for download. Knowing that map intimately, allowed me to take time and try out different units and combinations in the new CoH2 front-end. More of the game made sense - and more importantly, it began to flow.Since then, I've fired up the Ardennes campaign and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. It's different, subtly so against the benchmark set on the previous CoH campaigns (Opposing Forces itself is a example of RTS structure genius) - but it still ticks all the relevant boxes. The attack/defence balance is never too far away - stretching your probing units to dangerous limits, or conversely, setting up the perfect defensive kill-zone. Do you churn out units en masse, or reserve and protect small concentrations of highly skilled units?It's taken a while, but CoH2 is certainly back on track with the Company of Heroes franchise. Currently, all RTS games have to acknowledge what CoH represents and has achieved. Even if you have no interest in the WW2 setting, from a game mechanic and progress position - give it a try.All I will say to Relic or whoever may read this for CoH3 is......- Where is the Pacific campaign of the US and Commonwealth forces against the Japanese?- Please, no more Russian sides - UNLESS you bring CoH3 up to a fictional WW3 backdrop8/10			"

												One of the greatest RTS games of all time following on from its successor who still holds the title. CoH2 allows for the largest range of play styles at all but the highest levels of the game. An engaging and game changing single player campaign in the Ardennes Assault is not to be missed and fans of RTS would be remiss motto add this stellar game to their collection. Do play the tutorial first and do play with friends or vs the comp on easy before you jump into competitive multiplayer. This game has action, fun and skill in spades, will you change the outcome of WW2?			"

												I fully understand why this game gets quite a few bad reviews. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLC can be a big turn off for some. I feel that some of the commanders are Pay2Win (Elite Tiger anyone). Paint skins look nice but the price you pay is silly. I also feel the base game should have came with some of the extra factions, but of course we'd only have that In a perfect world.Though, I still enjoy the game. I have played a bunch of games as each faction and I enjoy all of them. Each has a different flavor. I also think there's a fair amount of units for each side. Playing against the AI can be fun for a while, but they get really predictable. Online play is hit or miss, sometimes you'll have a good round, sometimes you'll have a round with rushers (this can make the game unfun).In closing, I would recommend this game to people who enjoy action RTS games, WWII games (and cold war-esque games), and Michael Bay (just the effects).But as a tip, i'd get it, and any DLC on sale. 7.5/10 "

												I like how people with 300+ hours give this a thumbs down, if you don't like it why play it so much?It's great, requires you to actually think about your attack, plan how you will strike and then counter your opponent. It's not a game where you just spam the same unit and go. It doesn't matter how many buttons you press per minute, what matters is your brain and experince as a commander.Victories are earned and defeats are crushing, the graphics are highly detailed down to the paint scratches on tanks and the spent brass from a rifle. The sounds are frightning and the unit chatter can be quite funny! I recommend the Standard Edition as the Collectors just has extra skins and commanders that you can unlock by playing normally.			"

												***Updated Review***After playing this game for a good amount of hours now I can assure you it's not pay to win, here's the problem.You get commanders either through:a) buying them from the in-game store.b) getting them from the terrible, terrible drop system.a) can get a bit pricey, and b) is just a joke. Relic has stated numerous times over the years that they would look into it, but no progress.That being said, having a slightly better doctrine (there aren't any premium doctrines that are stupidly overpriced) does not make you better at the game. I bought a ""good"" commander for 5$ but I actually started playing worse. Why? Because I was relying too much on the doctrine's super cool tanks and crap. Good doctrines compliment a good player but can't turn you into one.That being said, the game IS extremely expensive for what you get. You'll probably want to pick up all the factions, so the final total is rather high. However, the game and dlcs go on sale for 75% with the winter and summer sales, so I suggest you pick them up then.All in all it's a good game, just buy what you want at the price you think Relic deserves.

												War spoils system became progressively worse with time. For a game that cost a lot of money on it's own, I would at least expectt not being forced into the purchase of new commanders and the like. Getting spoils in game is a joke. I can't help but feel somewhat angry at the current situation. The game has potential to be great, but its execution has proven to be too commercially motivated for my taste.			"

												Even on free weekend its still not worth it. Granted there is nothing glaringly wrong with this game (except the over $200 in DLC, that are basically on the whole just skins, which was something that I had free access to in the first game via mods), its just that its the exact same game as CoH:1, except a few years later, without the benifits of the range of mods that were avaiable for it. The new stuff can we wrapped up with: Snow, Ice, men can abandon tanks. If you liked the first CoH, you can probably get a few hours of gameplay out of this, but once the inital fun has worn off, there really isnt any meat to keep you interested.			"

												All one needs to pay attention to is the gameplay mostly but the story makes it more interesting. It is a great real time strategy (RTS) game and even if it is not too accurate in some details of the campaign, it is about playing the game and seeing all the hard work  the developers put into the game to make it fun for the players to play. It is not about learning about the history and World War II. This was created for people to actually enjoy playing the game itself, beat the campaign and then challenging others to multiplayer matches. This game offers more tactics not in the first Company of Heroes but less content but don't let that fool one that this game is nothing compared to the first game. This game was released about seven years after the first game and could still have more updates and downloadable content waiting, yet to be released. The gameplay should be the main focus and I personally think that the content in the game is already great alone! This game has a good made up storyline with good gameplay content, nobody should compare the storyline to the actual history.			"

This game is still, as always, fast-operating, accurate, and ruthless, very fast, very accurate, and very ruthless! COH2 is a awesome game, those who love playing Warhammer should not miss it. Although THQ closed down, but our uncontrollable love toward RTS will never crush out. I recommend every single Sega game, it has a huge number of DLCs, but all of them are worth buying. SEGA is a good developer, it always offers a discount to those who preorder. It is much better than Square Enix, Capcom the bitxx, etc. Later I will continue playing SEGA's masterpieces. I am not an advertiser, an advertiser will never have such a good patient to type out nonsense like this and translate it, after all I have a public ID. Buy with no fear, buying is earning!			"

												With having to buy comanders, being restricted to the eastern front unless you purchase The Western Front Armies, having poor combat and actual strategy involved, and not having much control over a squad. I personaly think that if you are looking for a good WWII RTS game I sugest taking a look at the Men Of War games since they provide more controll over units in a squad, better and more realistic combat, and requires more skill and strategy rather than unit spam.

												Let me say I love this game and really do enjoy playing it.However I do not enjoy this pay to win with commanders and so on. now before people start saying ""you can win free commanders"" I know this, however it is rare and almost never the ones you want. also I might be wrong this but from oberservation some of the commanders you win I dont think you can Buy and maybe you cant even win all the commanders.    A rare commander will cost you £2.79 which i think is it overpriced but what really annoys me are the bundles.There is currently a bundle in the game store with 4 commanders for £11.99. 1 commander   costs £2.792.79x4=11.16so basically its cheaper to buy it seperatly, but they wont tell you that.Dont get me wrong its a fun game and if money isnt an issue then sure its great.but all these commanders, dlcs and even the other forces costing £10 each. I really feel that this game just trys to milk you for all that you have.			"

												After a rough start during It's first year, COH2 has now become my second favorite game, I have played many RTS games and none of them have stacked up to COH2, I find myself really enjoying just the Ai by myself or with friends, I'm not one that ventures off Into MP games much anymore but when I do I find them enjoyable also, The developers behind the game listen to their community, and the bugs from what I have experienced have all been addressed, the game has a great community backing It and plenty of new maps to always download from the steam workshop so your never tired of the same maps, I have all the DLC'S and while I'm not too big on paying for dlc myself like most people, I do enjoy there DLC, If you like the game as It Is I also recommend some of the faction based dlc as they are great additions, each faction Is different from the other, not just unit or country wise, but gameplaywise, each has many different ways of building forces and progressing.Moving on to some gameplay reviews.I like what they have done with It, as I have stated before I mostly play against the Ai but from what I have experienced the ai In this game Is no push over, the ai seems to know just when to use their assets and abbilities, they utilize the commanders and whatever units they may have at their disposal well, The ai knows how to flank, how to use artillery and to get under your skin In everyway possible, They have totally re-done the ai from when they first started, friendly ai will park a half track or truck next your Injured units and expect you to use their vehicle to replenish your own units, they will also repair your vehicles or defensive postions on their own If In the area.Gameplay Is really what you would expect from an RTS, build up your forces and destroy the enemy from your top-down camera, command a variety of units and take over the map, most units have special abbilities that make them stronger and better In combat, this can vary from weapon upgrades (new rifles) moral upgrades or others such as anti-tank capabilities or an mg to help with enemy Infantry, It has conquest and total destruction game modes, In conquest there Is 3 flags that If captured will cause enemy tickets to lower, however all over the map are little flags that provide supply points, funds, fuel and munitions, all required to build your forces up and use abbilities, taking these points also provide friendly borders so you can setup some defensive positions such as mg nests and other crucial structures such as medical and reinforcement positions, some maps are heavy on urban combat, while some are In the open and make for great tank battles, however the game Is a bit more fast paced than Men of War assault squad, while there Is a lot of multi-tasking, It's not on the same level as MOW where you actually have to load the correct ammo type for a unit, so really you could say COH Is a arcade styled RTS In a certain way but personally I enjoy COH2 a bit more.Total destruction sounds just like It Is, wipe out the entire enemy force to win.A couple mods I recommend are all units unlocked (so you can use all units such as other commander-based units In a single game, you still have to buy them through the recruitment buildings of course) and If you want an epic huge battle, I recommend population cap setting mods, that would allow you to use more units In a single game and not be limited.All of which can be downloaded via steam workshop.Regardless though, the game Itself Is a solid one and I can't recommend It enough.There are a lot of things I haven't covered but If I did this review would be way too long so I'm just going to keep It a simple review.This game from me gets a 9.5/10			"

												This was a good game. A very good game... But after the unbalanced-balancepatches (funny isn't it?) it became unplayable, because for some unknown reason they moved the game from the few-units-manouvering-way to the blob armies. They removed the blizzard feature which was unique and gave everything to the germans and nothing for the allies. The fact that the Third Reich can produce the heaviest units like the USSR the T34s is very laughable... Sad story for a title that was told the best... Don't play it anymore.			"

												In terms of mechanics it retains the core elements which made the original game such a hit, along with a number of minor changes. Some of these are improvements, while others are a step backwards. The much-touted weather elements add a nice atmosphere in Singleplayer but serve as a major annoyance in multiplayer with most players vetoing winter maps. True-sight is generally an exciting mechanic but doesn't always function as intended. Bulletins are an interesting but ultimately insignificant introduction. Being able to constantly monitor the health of all units is great, the cluttered UI full of useless information is not. Problems from the original - high micromanagement requirements and poor vehicle pathing - have not been fixed.There is some enjoyment to be had for solo players, but if that's all you're interested in there are plenty of better options (CoH1 being one of those). Single player Campaign is a reasonable length but the missions themselves are pretty flaccid. Story is the same old Stalingrad/bad accents/Commisars killing their own men shtick told through a serious of bland (but thankfully skippable) cutscenes. Skirmish AI is OK, but then who plays skirmishes these days? Multiplayer is where the bulk of the enjoyment is. It's fast-paced, sometimes exciting and ever-challenging. It's mostly well-balanced in 1v1, and 2v2 is good aside from a few map and faction combinations. Anything larger than that is much easier for axis and that situation looks unlikely to change. Pre-arranged and random teams can play against each other, so if you don't have a partner for team games you're going to have a bad time. There are still a good number of players in ranked automatch while custom games are pretty dead. As in every WW2 game Axis are more popular with players, but for some reason the ability to select a random faction has been removed so you have to choose between a short wait with allies or a longer wait with axis. So while the multiplayer is fun for a while there are two major issues which make it hard to recommend. The first of these is the faction, commander and unit design. It's obvious relic didn't have a clear vision for each faction, and the result is a wacky mish-mash of units which synergise poorly and make teching feel awkward. There are a number of highly situational or simply useless units, with the game balanced around a few OP units and abilities. The only logically designed faction is the Ostheer, which by no small coincidence are strongly influenced by Wehrmact from CoH1. Many games involve one or both players stalling with low-tier units in an attempt to skip the mid game and go straight to heavy call-in tanks. There is also a big reliance on indirect fire and AoE weapons, which leads to a random and frustrating experience where wiping an enemy squad takes far more luck than skill.The second beef I have is the micro-transactions and general money-grubbing that surrounds the game. The base game, western front armies, AA singleplayer, and commanders are all separate purchases, and all overpriced. Particularly bothersome are the DLC commanders, especially because of the way many commanders hard-counter others in the current meta. While they can be obtained without paying the chance of this occuring is pretty low. When the community was crying out for a balance patch, instead we get another singleplayer DLC noone wanted. When players are frustrated by lack of balance problems and BS commanders, Relic goes ahead and brings out even more. I have no issue with paying for quality DLC, but the way it has been handled with this game is pretty poor.Bottom line: Despite its flaws I would recommend the game to those who enjoyed the original or like RTS games in general, but not until it receives a heavy drop in price.

												Don't waste your time stay with CoH 1. The amount of micro transations in this game is jaw dropping you have to constantly spend money to unlock maps, factions that should be in the game and units. I remember when you bought a game you had the whole game and expansions were little extras made after production so the player can have a better experience for a little bit of money. But devs have now thought lets release half a game and charge for the rest. Lets make the game half as good as the last with fewer factions then add the same factions in this game for a quarter of what the game costs!! Not to mention the AI is terrible. Try playing a skirmish 4v4, your team is so incompetent and build riflemen against heavy tanks... Not only that you practically cant beat the enemy. Being 1v4 is hard due to my allied AI just running straight in and getting shot up but when you finaly get round to destorying their base  the enemy can constantly spam units and land grab whilst you're running out of munitions and units. I played for 2 hours before I raged quit as I had repeatedly destoryed their based but trying to destroy 4 bases by yourself is impossible as they keep reappearing then somehow even though their bases are practically gone they are all able to spawn King Tigers and Jadpanthers and just abliterate your units from existance (normal difficulty). It's a poorly made cash cow game and it shows.			"

												Lovely looking game. SOME good mechanics. At release, wasn't balanced, now it depends on how much $ you will fork over.Commanders are 4 bucks a pop, and a set for ONE OF THE FIVE factions is ~60.Read that again, roughly 300 bucks after your purchase for commanders, not even the DLC.I will not buy another game from relic because of this. Sure I have a plenty of hours, mainly in attempt for my money to feel validated. It doesn't. Buy one of the many other WWII RTS out there and you will be a much happy camper.And maybe this is why nobody respects SEGA.			"

												The reason why this game is so good is because it is unlike any other RTS out there. It is not so much about base building but it is all about micro managing the units. Which can be fantastic or horrible, depending on whether you like micro managing or not. It can get very difficult managing your troops on 3 different fronts. CoH2 makes you feel like an actual commander in a war battle.Single player consists of war battles that really happened in WWII, which is very interesting to play through. Many different scenarios are also available. And of course there is a multiplayer that you can play with friends which is the highlight of the game. ESL matches from players that know what to do are very fun to watch. This game is a must have for any RTS fan.			"

												At it's core, this game is but a shade of the original.Positives:Innovative and neato additions the game include capture ""zones"" instead of actual direct capture points.Many weapon and tank types, including 5 different factions.Negatives:THE DEVS KEEP MESSING WITH THE GAME.Every month or two, a new patch is released that promises to balance the game...however...THE GAME HAS ONLY EVER BEEN BALANCED WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY RELEASED AS WEHRMACHT VS. SOVIETS.USF are a joke.Ober-kommando West is the most OP faction ever...(kids who play this faction faithfully will deny it)DLC Commanders.   Do I need to say anything else about this?  (Pay to win!)Furthermore, if you want decent commanders for USF, you need said DLC Commanders.War spoils system was promised to be fixed and is still broken years later.I have installed/uninstalled the game at least 8 times because I find it so incredibly frustrating and not fun. (If you know how I can get a refund for this game on Steam, please tell me, because I only re-install because I want to make sure I get my money's worth)Game suffers from horrible imbalance issues!!!Players who specifically play one faction favored by these issues will deny the existence of imbalance, but if there was no imbalance, then why do they feel it necessary to update the game every month with massive nerfs/buffs to different units?If you want to play a fair game, look somewhere else.  Maybe at the original...(even though that is plagued by the British Forces and Panzer Elite itself)Source:  500 hours of gameplay.Don't buy their garbage. "

												Company of Heroes 2, the sequel to the famous first COH is in my humble opinion a 'interesting' game but is it all that and a bag of chips?   Well whether or not a game is good is subjective to the individual and what exactly your looking to get out of a game.The Good:- Modding Support through the Steam-Workshop offers all manner of mods, unit skins, decals, Player made maps, and more all for free and easily aquired with the click of a button.- Unit Diversity.  A counter for every move and with over 31+ Commanders to choose from per faction as opposed to the original COH with just 3 Doctrines to choose from per faction,  Each army has a distinct theme from focus ranging from Heavy Tanks, Specialized Infantry, Artillery, Aircraft and more!- Enviroment Matters.   COH2 offers unit bonuses for taking cover behind pretty much anything,  Destructible enviroments mean that a wall or house can be blown away to create new avenues to flank your opponent!   Weather can freeze your troops to death in the cold blizzards or slow them down as easy targets when they get stuck in deep-mud.The Bad:- DLC,  Sega is rather heavy about DLC.  For example that fancy Skin you want for your tanks?  Or want a Tiger Tank but don't own the commander that offers one?   Gotta buy them.   DLC ranges from 3 to 5$ (prices vary on your region) but this can be mitigated both by the fact that COH2 is frequently on the Steam Sales where you can get the DLC for as cheap as 1$  or just download a Mod from the workshop that offers them.- The Single Player Campaign.   I have mixed feelings about the campaign.   The Soviet Campaign (which is free) was dark (which is IMO good) but the characters were boring,  I felt no passion to empathize with characters and the mission objectives were generic and rather basic,  What you would expect from a RTS.....   SEGA fortunatly learns there lesson when they introduce the American Campaign ""Ardennes Assault"" Giving us more interesting characters and unique mechanics for a Story,  making the campaign into a RISK or Total War style where you only have limited resources to conduct the entire campaign.   Unfortunatly this absolutely amazing Ardennes Assault campaign is DLC:  10$ on its own,  5 or 3$ during a Steam Sale.- Vanilla Gameplay is Boring,  Game ballance is about as fair as Starcraft,  but just like Starcraft that same  rock/paper/scissors can get boring.  IMO Get a realism mod from the Steam Workshop such as Spearhead or Wikinger just off the top of my head.   The All Units mod can also appeal if you don't want realism & don't want to buy the DLC.- Axis vs Allies.    This should be a common theme,   however where  the Allies are diverse between the Soviets, Americans, and the British.... the Axis are just Germans with a east & west theme.  SEGA has rich options to choose from between nations like Vichy-France, Italy, or Japan and yet they have been reluctant to pool from it despite showing they can with units such as the Ostruppen pooled from the various nations that were absorbed into the German Army.   COH2 has great potential if only they would do more then just present Nazi-Germany as the only overarching villain.In conclusion,  COH2 is not a game for everyone,  I'd reccomend it only to WW2 Enthusiasts who want a plethora of options to choose from, and I would highly reccomend players wait for the Steam Sales (COH2 g oes on sale extremly frequently),  The game's not worth full retail price.  Bu with that said I find boundless enjoyment out of this game and still play it even today as my fallback enjoyment.			"

												The campaign is short and the rest of the game has to be bought in pieces.  A lot of what should be in the game are separately sold DLCs.  It is not at all clear what this game adds to COH1.  It somehow feels less of a game to be honest.The campaign itself is not fun to play though.  It is not only morbid but offensive.  It desperately tries to find a way to make the Red Army somehow look worse than the Nazi occupation.  Frankly the overall tone of the game is undoubtedly disgusting for anyone who is familiar with the Eastern Front and had family which fought on it.  Its almost an anti-USSR propaganda piece, but strangely produced decades after the USSR's collapse.  I don't really understand what the producers were thinking.			"

												If you're a fan of the RTS genre but can't compete at the starcraft diamond level this is the game for you, it beautifully blends RTS elements with the world war 2 atmosphere.There is almost no resource management no building mines, no farming vespian gas, there are three different resources Manpower, Fuel, Ammunition all 3 of which are obtained by holding territory on the map.The game is a huge struggle to control key points on the map called VP's (victory points).In the game you start with 500 vp and capturing 2/3 of the points will start to drain your opponents vpoints.The western Front armies added two new armies the US and the Ober Kommando West adding even more levels of play to the game and offering a cheap price point to jump into the game at as you can buy just the army you want and still play against everyone.I HIGHLY reccomend this game for fans of the genre and ww2 games it will not dissapoint.If you need to be shown the ropes feel free to add me and i'll catch you up to speed :).See you on the battlefield Comerades.

The AI's troops are alive while yours are a bunch of zombies. You have to take care of them like children. There is also the manufacturing issue... Instead of the bulidings to rise on their own with a click of an icon, you have to build them, meanwhile your zombies are geting crushed by the AI. If you build a unit and then change up your mind, there is no icon to claim them back, so you have to send your unintended product to the enemy to get destroyed.

												Sad to say it but this game has been the biggest disappointment ever. I definitely do not recommend this flop of a game. The only reason why I managed to log 33 hours on COH2 was because I wanted to like. I tried to like and played it thinking that I will get into it. Clearly it did not happen. The leveling system is very strange and not competitive in the slightest. If you lose, you still rank up. I personally do not find any fun in that. Game play is pretty dry and units can take quite a long time to kill now. For some reason there seems to be a lack of variety in regards to the amount of units that you are able to build which I find a bit odd. You would expect there to be more in a new game but this is not the case. Furthermore, the teams are uneven and everyone chooses the Germans because of their tank superiority which crushes the Russians so easily. Even the factions/commanders that you get to chose are terrible and do not add much to the game itself. In regards to the single player, I would not even bother. enough said. Company of heroes 1 and all of the expansions such as tales of valor and opposing fronts are amazing games and I still play them. So much better then COH2. Therefore, if you are looking to play a company of heroes game do not spend a single dime on COH2. Spend your money on COH1 instead.			"

												Brilliant! The pessimists and naysayers won’t agree with me, but that’s what they do. I thoroughly enjoyed CoH. The whole idea of adding value to single squads’ life and tactical advantage, as opposed to the usual, mass hordes of troops and storm the enemy, was refreshing I’m glad that they kept CoH 2, nearly, identical to the original. Everyone is right! They hardly changed the mechanics and that’s what makes it so beautiful. Why change a, already, “polished” game? That’s why so many of us loved the original. I can see it now. Relic could have changed so much more but, then the same “critics” would have complained about those exact changes and why the original CoH was so much better anyway. We should be glad that they’ve kept this gem so close to the original. So many companies are over doing things today with too many frills and make-up. This game is still CoH. It still captures the essence of what CoH is. It is the new and old, improved, CoH "

												You play for hoursYou have your greatest battles, you even suffer sometimes to winAnd then, very rarely the game reward you with - usually - one war spoilAnd it's... a f**ing armor protection for a weak vehicle, that can only be called in by a commander you don't have. And you already have that bulletin... twice!Or, or, maybe it's a bulletin for the US! Oh wait, you don't have the US forces? Well though luck.The game's reward system makes me cut my wrist.Especially when I hear my friends say that before the war spoil system you got bulletins for achievements.I can't even remember when I got my last commander. My friend has a bunch of them, and before a battle he can browse them. Me? Well, I got a few, half of them is lame, so there's not much to choose from. Especially with OKW and the British, where I only got 3 / nation.But you know, you can buy those commanders. Because you know, this is a freemium game! Oh wait, you paid for this? Well, nevermind!Have fun with your bulletins, you will get the lamest ones again and again! Cheerio!BTW the game itself is nice, it's not a realistic game so don't hope for that, but it's a nice RTS. Still, it makes me kill myself.			"

												First I love the old game. I read the review on this and even though most of them said it keeps crashing I purchased anyways. Well I should have trusted the other posts. This game keeps crashing. I have spent hours and days trying to fix so I can play. I contact sega and was told check all the drives. I did this and made sure I had the newest versions. In the end still crashes. Very frustrating and well just about♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to the point of I will not purchase this title again. I asked Sega for a refund which the reply was uninstall all the drivers and game and reinstall. This would take hours to complete. So I purchased a few other games and stopped playing this one. Funny thing no issues with the other games, not even one crash to report. Seems Sega really messed this one up.			"

												This is a really fun game. The good old core mechanics of CoH 1 are there and some minor improvements that really add to the experience. There are also some minor steps back as well, so really this game doesn't amount to better than CoH 1. In fact if you own that game already and enjoy it, keep enjoying it, this game might not be for you.If you are new to the game alltogether, know it has a steep learning curve. Not as bad as starcraft 2 as far as microing and stuff goes, but it has really deep strategy, and there is a lot to know about the different units and ablities. That being said, it's way easier for a new person to get into than a lot of RTS games. Some of it can been pretty intitutive, as you all know tanks are really powerful and hard to kill with a rifle in real life, well guess what, same holds true in this game.Pros:1. While this isn't about gameplay, I think it's important. Graphics are improved. This does look better, but only if you had the hardware to show it off. If your graphics card is just meh or okay, you might think CoH 1 will look better on your PC.2. Various minor aspects of the game have been changed. I think, whle minor, they are helpful changes.  Examples: Veteran status is displayed as stars above your unit. This makes it easier to see your vets, and to keep them safe. You know longer have to walk straight up to a point to capture it, you just have to be in a circle around the point. This is nice because you can protect your guys a little better, put them in cover.Cons:1) game could have been more. I'm not sure what it is, but something is missing. I suppose I expected more out of the sequel to company of heroes 2. Really I just got company of heroes 1 with nicer graphics and minor improvements. Which is fine, since it's still a really fun game, but a little disappointing. If you don't already own the first one, you might as well get this one with the better graphics and minor improvements.2. U.S. forces is what I play, and it doesn't seem to play the way I expected. Expect the gameplay for the americans to be very different from CoH 1.3. Game is burdened with earned bonuses and such, that I think imbalance the game. It would take a lot of work to get this game ready for esports. I really just like fair balanced, and consistant gameplay, and while I recongize when you have a game with different factions with their own unique units and ablities, balanced gameplay is really hard to achieve, the little bonuses and things you earn from playing are not necessary.Unfortunately, while this game may be great for a lot of people, and I'll probably play it from time to time since I already own it, I have to ask myself, would I buy again? The answer is probably not. While this is one of the best RTS out there, it could have been a LOT better.There  could have been . . .More interesting factions, the original U.S. Forces for example, were better. They had better units and ways to use them. Could have created this game better for esports.  Standardized fair and balanced gameplay.Could have been more focused. They are working on too many factions, campagins and the like. They should be more focused on improving and refining a basic set of factions and the core gameplay. Instead of adding a new faction, add new units to existing factions, balance them, and through help UI improvements.So while it's fun. I can't recommend it like the original.			"

												Dear god this game is such a farcry from the other.... Base building? You're basically setting up different kinds of radios to call guys from off screen. That's lame. Combat? It feels trivial. Tanks are so meaningless sometimes getting so horribly wrecked by infantry that its not even worth building them, unless your russian in which case you NEED tanks to do anything against so much as light armor. The resource system is jacked, the tank damage is nice and realistic which is a plus but on top of that this damn game feels like league of legends with all of its tiny stat boosts based off of general and selecting unit load out like its a game like Airmech... jesus christ I loved the first game.. now I just have a bad taste in my mouth... and it tastes like EA.

												A great addition to the ""Company of Heroes"" original.  With countless improvements, which take little time to get use to, and new weapons and vehicle classes that will truly change your way of approaching each new mission.  The re-playability of each mission/map only depends on your choice of opponent, AI or human.  Each brings with them new challenges and difficulty levels.  Overall a great game that I whole heartedly recomment to the RTS fan, or any gamer.  Enjoy.			"

Devs know that if they give you the premium currency very slowly you will just get frustrated and buy the microtransactions. those are justified in a free to play game but they are not justified in a WWII strategy game that costs 12$ andd up. after a few minutes of gameplay i refunded it.

												This game is literally one sided. The russians have a great disadvantaged compared to the germans who can build just about anything to counter what the russian's have. Relic has ruined this game to the point they literally only use it for collecting money and not giving 2 s**ts about if the game is balanced or not ""For the russians mostly"".If you want to play a great eastern front game that is by far more realistic and actually has more units to offer then I suggest playing Company of Heroes 1 with the eastern front mod or any mod for that matter. A shame too since I put in so many hours in CoH1 for relic to completely ruin its sequel, I surely hope they go broke.			"

												I loved coh 1 but coh 2 is  absolutely terrible. Here are the problems:1-The matchmaking is absolutely awful, it seems like the exp points you gain mean nothing when it comes to matchmaking as you are teamed with players that are either less experienced than you or are really skilled. 2-The game frequently crashes and the number of players that just drop 1 second after the game starts due to technical issues is very high.3- The graphics are not optimized at all.3-The factions are not balanced. The developers only want your money and nothing else. They don't give a damn about the quality of this series anymore.			"

												As of current, i haven't been able to play much due to my computer not being good enough. But i'm really dissapointed with all the expensive DLC... At first you had to buy skins, but i think you can earn them now? And now with the new British and western forces.. it confuses me. COH 1 and one DLC for extra factions and one other DLC for some extra game modes or missions, I can't exactly remember. I want to like this game but so far the DLC is a big turn off.Even with my new computer easily being able to run this game, I still don't enjoy it as much as the original games. I'd say get those instead.			"

			Про ""Антиобзоры"" - http://vk.com/topic-25557243_28900822 Bad Comedian - Why Russians Hate Company of Heroes 2...and NAZI Relic entertainment So, basically, the game is about the EVIL SOVIET...		

Being a big fan of the first CoH i would think this game would be better but between having to pay for everything, even camo for units thats stupid.also they f**ked up history in genral. Burning down houses with your own people in them burning your own troops in fields that never happend. yes scorched earth policy, but there was never a policy to kill your own people. also in the campaign the ""hero"" aka the whiny b*tch talked about losing so many men.UUUHHHHHH HELLLOOO your fighting WAR?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?! of course you gonna lose men.In a campaign mission it said Stalin sent thousands to die.................................................... SO DID Americans,British,France,Germany,Japan etc. in this game they made the Russians seem like babies. there motherland is burning the germans are killing your people, in real life Russians wanted revenge not ot run. Relic at this point you should go to a history class and learn somthing. And after reading this i thought this game was called Company of Heroes??? not company of the runners???			"

												Company of Heroes 2, where do i start.First, id like to say i actually kind of enjoyed it. Until i started to play it longer than a few hours. The first thing that annoyed me was my mighty and powerful IS-2 heavy tank RUNNING THROUGH MY SNIPER NEST on its way to where i told it to go, so the pathfinding AI is occasionally bloody stupid and aggravating.Secondly, i honestly dont care what people say, mission 11 of the campaign is a screwed up mess, without ruining the wonderous story and what not, you are given 5 snipers and told to go kill 3 officers in 3 camps, each one with more defences than the last, simple right?Well no, its not that ""simple"" what it actually is, is you killing an officer, and every single soldier in the camp coming to kill your snipers. Anyone that knows the general rule of snipers knows snipers do not do well when in actual head on combat. This mission is that.Finally i noticed something strange in the skirmish mode, i was playing a community made map in a 4 V 4 (3 AI on my team, 4 on the other team) match and it took me THREE HOURS (as in 3 actual hours) to kill and defeat the other team, at least 2 of those hours were spent contending against the cheating AI who spawn engineers every single chance they get endlessly to repair their supposedly destroyed headquarters.So would i recommend this game? nope, i have a lot of problems with the game right now, ranging from its DLC model to the fact its just plain crap in comparison to the original, etc etc. My advice would be gift it to someone you dont like.

												This game would have me believe that not only did each and every Russian conscript have a gun and bullets, they also carry out infinite amounts of Russian moonshine with which they use to burn out the feeble German army. It would also have me believe that German tanks were actually, in fact, made of the highest quality paper mache and that even though they look like they have sloped armor, they are actually big rectangular boxes. One squad of Russian Shock Troopers can kill a German flamethrower team, Grenadier squad with light machine guns and a Panzer Grenadier squad even while surrounded. German Grenades are all repurposed sparklers. Russian women can asexual reproduce in large numbers from the floorboards of mostly destroyed buildings, far behind german lines to kill and capture German artillery pieces with the massive caches of advanced German weapons littered in said ruined buildings. The pain goes on...The game developers need to sit down with a history book and realize that the Nazis nearly won because they had better equipment.			"

												Okay, first of all... No keybindings, for an RTS and strategy games you need damn keybindings in order to make yourself a bit more comfortable with the options the game gives you. This game has a good concept, good gameplay, but a terrible UI and a frustrating camera angles that makes me want to throw up. Do I want to continue to play this game? Yes, but the only concern is, will they be able to put a damn keybinding setting soon? I like to focus on little things that make a game good and then go on to the bigger stuff. For the moment this game has potential, but is it showing it? I don't think it currently is. Plus it wants you to buy the DLC which is pathetic to say the least. To be honest, the graphics are not that good. Besides I have been noticing fps drops that annoy me, it is dumb that I can run Farcry4 on a 50-60 fps scale and I am happy with that. In this game it runs about 30-40, and then there is some places on maps where it would just drop to 20 fps.  Again I would like to continue this game, but all I want fixed is to be able to scroll out to a point where you can see the map and a keybind settings tab. Please note that this was my review and my opinion and this is to help you decide if you want to try it or not. Thankyou for reading my review.			"

												Company of Heroes two, abreviated as CoH2 from here on out is a game that is famous for WW2 gameplay.However,  being famous and well known, doesn't dictate quality, as past fancy graphics the same problems that plagued the first game, have sadly been  brought over to the 2nd.That is the stupid Ai movement system, this have ALWAYS been an issue, and in a game that features so many details and barriers that your vehicles and personell can get stuck on, it quickly turns into a nightmare.The other problem is the illogical ""balanced"" weapons handling, tanks keep firing and often illogically have their rounds bounce off the opponent, but that tiny light tank that puffs off a round at your front scores damage on your heavy tank.All of this adds up to a lot of problems, this problematic system wouldn't have been so bad, unless the movement Ai was... Utterly crap, you need to have your tank reverse out of the field?Well they provided a nice ""Reverse"" function button to tell the tank to back out of there, but you have a 50/50 chance of him ignoring it and turning his weak rear to the enemy and getting owned as a result.And that is the flaw of this game, a flaw that the developers behind Men Of War series realized isn't fixable, no matter how much time you spend on Ai deployment you can NEVER EVER beat a superior human at navigating a tank through obstacles, so how did they solve it?In Men Of War, they allow the player to take control of the vehicle in question, something that in my circle of friends is called the ""END the stupidity key"" since you hit the END key on your keyboard and you are in direct command and control.A function that you desperatly wish for in this game, but alas isn't there, it is time to realize you cannot fix a core problem and implement this Sega!The other problem this game suffers from is... Microtransactions, camoflauged as DLC.Think you get the full game by buying this and all the DLC on the Steam store page? Guess again, you are still missing missions, maps and commanders that you have to BUY in game with REAL MONEY!Unlike traditional microtransaction games, these are things you pay for once, and then own for ""life"" but it is still the exact same microtransactions at the core.In short, if you want a fun time playing WW2 RTS games, buy the Men Of War series, yes their Ai has the same navigational problems, but at least you have the option to intervene and avoid a disaster, unlike CoH 2 where you will have to watch that precious tank or squad get smashed doing stupid things.If you are set on a CoH experience, you are better off buying CoH 1, it is very similar with Skirmish matches for Coop,  but that game is complete without any nasty microtransaction junk.If you heard about the coop stuff in this game and thought you got a nice Coop campaign? Forget about it, all there is, is some Skirmish missions where you start off with a different loadout, and some scripted Ai, like the Ai getting an illogical reinforcement that is then thrown at your position, there is no such thing as in Men Of War where you do it mission style to aqquire assets, and where that artillery gun may need to come down before you can move on your objective for an example.In short, CoH 2 was a disappointment at launch, and hasn't gotten improved with the years since then.

												well, lets start this review talking about the technical aspects of the game:Company of Heroes 2 (from now CoH2 or ""You Wanna Win Then Pay: Soviets Are♥♥♥♥♥♥Edition""), is a technically advanced version of Company of Heroes 1.This game has better graphics overall and has some aspects that improve the gameplay: -The possibilty of jumping trough sandbags and small walls allowing you to flank positions-An improved unit vision that keeps in the fog of war what your units cant see-A cover sistem that includes tanks as a heavy cover so your units can use that heavy cover behind your armor and advance in consecuence, but you actually can't force him to do so.-Better MG aiming, allowing a single MG to destroy a squad in less time that CoH1-Better mortar fire that now actually does some damageOn the other side the game has some cons:-The game is, once again, unbalanced. Relic will patch CoH2 from time to time adding stuff, removing skills, changing units overall making some faction or unit ""broken"" and ridiculusly op for some time.-Tank battles are an important piece of the gameplay but are not coded properly, you dont have different ammo to choose (there are some exceptions like the sherman or the isu-152), projectiles don't lose penetration as they fly over the battlefiled, tank shooting range is messed up and unbalanced, so is the shell reloading speed.-The game looks a bit P2W as you will need commanders or factions that are not default-The campaign is propaganda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that compares the soviets with assasins that prefered to kill their own civilian people rather than give them a rifle to fight and consecuently, to win the war, having no time to counteratack but plenty of it to start the scorched earth tactics, burning their people to death and acting like traitors with their commrades.-It is historically incorrect and ridiculizes the red army.So, if you like historically accurate games, or you don't like the red army to be represented like a bunch of kids afraid of their commisars who forces them to charge to death or you just prefer balanced games; don't buy this game. However, to be honest, what could you expect about a game made by 'muricans in wich 'muricans are a playable faction? (CoH2 was supposed to be an easter front based game, first DLC thoug, america and oberkommando from west front)Factions:Axis:Axis players can choose a bunch of units and upgrades that gives them the upperhand in the battlefield (like upgrading squads with panzerschrecks, portable MGs or using powerfull grenades, build bunkers, sandbags and defensive positions), used properly, these can make the difference.They also have strong tanks that can't be fought in equal conditions, with magical 75mm shells that pierce 120mm 60º frontal armor like it is butter.Soviet:They have ridicously weak troops, with poorly chosen skills, no anti-vehicle power (except AT grenades that do a low amount of damage or AT rifles that instead of damaging the crew or vehicle parts make tanks to explode, this rifles are doctrinal and can't be upgraded to basic troops), no specialist troops or called to the battlefield just by doctrinal commanders (no soviet airborn, no elite guards unless doctrinal, no shock troops unless doctrinal).An underpower armor that provides low-quality, small number tanks that can't fight back a panzer IV (even if they are equiped with the 85mm cannon, just 3mm less than the so feared 88mm pak)Even the super-heavy IS-2 with the 122mm cannon can't fight back a couple of panzer IV equiped with the KWK3 L/75 cannon.OKW:Axis faction that deploys trucks just like tommies in CoH 1, pretty decent infantry and pretty decent armor having access to the mighty Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B ""King Tiger"" (is poorly designed and balanced having less range that other tanks) or the Panzerjäger Tiger Ausf. B ""JagdTiger""'Murica:'muricans are OP: with common shermans (75mm short cannon) piercing tigers or the ""Jackson""  tank hunter that can erase 1/3 of a tiger HP per shot because they can charge armor piercing rounds (it is poorly designed and the tank itself is terribly weak). They can also leave the tanks so the crew can repair them (we ruskys so idiots to repair our magical metal boxes)The infantry, is... let's say fearless veterans, heroes of the great nation of the freedom and the apple pie.They now have access to mortars, wich is nice to counter the MG spamCommonwealth:Brits are back and they have their shovels so they can dig in as they did in CoH 1, their infantry is strong but expensive and can be upgraded wit LMGs and PIATs that will blow enemy armor up if you somehow manage to land a shot on an enemy tank.Their emplacements are ok but cannot be destroyed by the brit player to make room for some new troopsBrit armor is poorly balanced and you will struggle to make a decent use of itSo, everything in the axis side does more damage, its more useful and perform better in battle unless you are playing as americaHere is a video, (not mine), that maybe explains all of the above better than me:

												This game has a huge potential to be great but at its current state,  I do not recommend anyone buy it unless it suddenly goes on 90% sale or something.I'll explain my reasons why.- The new war spoil system. Their new 'drop' type system is one that tries to copy Valve item drop systems in TF2, DotA and CSGO. In an effort to keep players playing, they made it so that an esimated, every 3 hours of of matches you play, you will get a random item drop. The only problem with this is its the only way to get drops. You can get duplicates of what you already own, drops are infrequent (3 hours of matches is about 6-10 matches) and there is no way to get an item you want unless you throw more time at this game like an idiot. Whereas in Valve games it had the store and market.- Western Fronts DLC. The new DLC released for this game is very unbalanced and unfinished. Which makes you wonder why they released it in the first place. First of all, a recent patch on July/3/2014 has nerfed United States Forces to be completely useless at all stages of the game. The German faction on the otherhand, the OberKommandoWest received massive buffs which makes you wonder if Relic, the creator of this game, is full of freedom hating nazi sympathizers. - No communication with fans. The developers are completely out of touch with their fans and playerbase. A recent video regarding the release of the new war spoils system features one of the developers going sky diving, dressed as a US airborne paratrooper. What makes him think that I want to watch him cosplay as a paratrooper while skydiving so he can explain to me his new♥♥♥♥♥♥system? The money would've been better spent paying an intern to compile a list of the community's praise and complaints of the game. Instead he chose to waste a ton of company money so he could have the playerbase watch him publicly masturbate skydive.The developers of this game doesn't listen to their fans and does whatever they want. They are only interested in farming this unbalanced game with broken features to idiots with money. If you believe you are not an idiot with money, don't buy this game.			"

												The game itself is very enjoyable, not enough variety in units I personally don't think but a mod would fix that quite nicely.The main issue with the game is the steam servers it runs on, as there was a huge transitioning error in the switch, which appears to not have been resolved. The issue involved a time lag that increased in length as the game went on, starting at seconds, ending in minutes. This has still not been resolved as I and others are still experiencing this and even after hundreds of complaints from myself and many others, and a substantial period of time, it still has not been fixed and it needs to be urgently looked at.

												It was a great game before the updates.Its DLC s are way too expensive for their contents and the developers keep f*cking the Axis factions with downgrades and boosting the Allies with new advantages.The multiplayer is unplayable right now.If you never play this and thinking to buy it for its multiplayer just DONT.I guess the developers will keep licking the American's balls for more money and destroy the game until its totally unplayable			"

												Very very good rts, campaign and theater of war is kinda second time experience also newest ardennes assault i like it's idea. Multiplayer face computer or other players 1v1 or find team and go togheter. Game which needs strategy to master on if you new and think you already know how to play it's good so think again it only looksl ike easy game but this will take more than 100 hours to undearstand it good and over thousand to master. So i reocmmend this game to every rts fan this is one of the best ones we can find here.			"

												I'm only writing this because I'm absolutely sick of the negative reviews on cash grabs. While I agree it's bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ it ultimatly is not super necassary as you can get pretty good base commanders, or get them for really cheap on sale (though I agree that shouldn't have to be a thing). The game itself is really fun-for multyplayer. The campaign is ok I suppose but it's nothing speacial. The pay model doesn't ruin the game HOWEVER I CANNOT recommend this game over $20 because of the pay model in place (you still most likley will want the Americans and Brits and OKW as well) Luckily this game goes on some pretty crazy sales, but I found myself enjoying the game without spending much money until I decided I wanted to, not needed to. BUT: YES HUGE BUT.I still can't recommend the game (over 20 bucks, at the time of writing this it's about 9 dollars which is pretty good for this game in my honest opinion). I can't recommend not because of the pay model, not because you have to buy factions (which isn't that uncommon in devs, come on guys!) but becuase it's quite a huge mess right now. Patches just keep ♥♥♥♥ing thingsup to the point where it's rediculous. One faction always seems to outshine the others, only to get 'fixed' and another one replaces it. Previusly it was the Brits (probably to get people to buy it). Now it's the OKW. If the game is ever fixed to a fun point I will gladly change the recommendation, but right now I just can't. You're better of with COH1 right now.			"

												I once fought a battle of annihilation against a foe for control over three bridges. The long back-and-forth struggle to seize a foothold beyond the river left the two southern crossings destroyed, and myself decidedly on the defensive.Earlier, my bitter retreat across the middle span, fought just to buy my engineers enough time to demolish the traverse and delay my rival's advance, had cost me the bulk of my complement. Indeed, the brutal attrition reduced my forces to merely a pair of depleted rifleman squads and an antiaircraft half-track. The adversary quickly seized his opportunity, and readied an offensive to take the northern crossing. Anticipating that the Germans would act swiftly, I maneuvered my pitiful army in a desperate bid to delay the inevitable. To serve as a screen for my sole remaining vehicle, I hastily positioned my undermanned troops behind a ruined wall for what I recognized to be the last firefight of the match. As they stared down the barrels of their weapons into the fog of war, they grasped that we had no hope of winning, but not a soul entertained any thought of retreat. Such was the mettle of men those days.Out of the darkness rose a faint whine. My boys shifted nervously as the wail grew into a hellish crescendo that I knew all to well. On the far bank, a Tiger appeared on approach, her monstrous proportions dwarfing even the wrecked Shermans and Panzer IVs that her mudguards tossed aside. This infernal machine spearheaded a column of battle-hardened and well-equipped grenadiers, their eyes fixed on the defenceless bridgehead that so many of their Kameraden had fallen in vain to capture. Vengeance burned in their hearts, and the reckoning was soon upon us.As the opposition charged toward my beleaguered defenders, the lines exchanged withering salvos. In a gesture of futility, I rolled my M15A1 forward, within range of the attackers, and pinned them in the mud of the riverbank. In response, my opponent ordered his mechanical beast to cross, planning to bring her fearsome 88mm gun to bear. Outrageously, my nemesis then called down a strafing run on my infantry, killing them to a man. How could such cruelty exist in a world where my soldiers had displayed such honor only moments before? I cursed bitterly as my GIs' bloody limbs rained through the billowing smoke and dust that shrouded the battlefield, and prepared to surrender.Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, my AA half-track, in a burst of autocannon fire, downed the Stuka, and the flaming wreckage crashed into the weakened trestles, which gave way. The deck collapsed under the enormous weight of the tank, plunging the crew and the surrounding infantrymen to their watery graves. Only a handful of survivors remained, trapped and suppressed on the near bank, where my M15A1's machine guns made mincemeat of them.I then rebuilt my forces, crossed the river, and vanquished the enemy.

												I would like to be able to play COH 2 Aredennes Assault, but I get to the point where I have to unlock the weapons stores and I click on the right button and they unlock.  However, I does not register as having completed my mission.  So I am stuck in the HQ area and not able to proceed with the attack or go to a different senario.  In addition, I purchased the complete COH 2 games from Steam and only the Stalingrad and Aredennes games shows up when the game loads.  Any suggestions or ideas on how to proceed would be helpful.

Posted: November 23, 2015
												So many reviews have been posted already as this game is hardly new anymore, but I will give my 2 cents anyway. I have bought this game for the single player aspect only, because thats what I liked about CoH 1. So I am only basing this review on the single player aspect and therefor I will completely ignore all the negative reviews about the tons of DLC's for multi player here on Steam.I have (am playing) played the main campaign and the Ardennes campaign.What I among other things loved about CoH 1 was the (relative) freedom you had to complete the objectives. You were given a main objective and sometimes a secondary optional objective and then you could build a base and slowly build up defences and expand your territory on the map. There were multiple paths and directions you could take to take over territory.  In CoH 2 the gameplay is really restricted, even units like engineers can't use their capabilities until the pre-scripted story 'yada yada' unlocks their function in the battlefield. The game now constantly tells you what to do, how and where you should advance and what weapon you should use. You even get shiny hologram markers on the map that tells you exactly where the developers wants you to go.  I have broken the gameplay several times already by not doing what the developers expect me to do. On multiple occasions I have found spawn points of the enemy AI at sectors I could overtake, but apparently was not meant to overtake. I litterally saw the enemies spawn at a static location out of thin air every x amount of seconds. I builded static HMG nests around the spawn points and they kept dying the moment they spawned on the map lolz. The campaigns are really designed for speed RTS, unlike CoH 1. Generally the developers expect from you that you advance on the map as fast (and dumb) as possible, while I like to take it more slow and strategic and fortify capture points before I advance further. Not playing the game by how the devs designed it leads to all sorts of gameplay issues. Biggest issues are the main oblectives that are timed and forces you to rush and play kamikaze mode instead of playing a 'strategic' game. Some of the missions/objectives felt a bit like CoH 1 and I could play it the same way, but the majority of the time I felt hand cuffed, and rushed, and spammed by AI spawns during gameplay and on rails by a narrow developers mind that limits me to a certain gameplay approach. The pathfinding of the AI also has not improved, or even may be worse now. Ordering AI to travel from A to B leads the AI directly through enemy fire. You really have to babysit the AI now and order them from corner to corner otherwise they will walk into an anemy tank or HMG fire.A lot of the time there are also pre-scripted friendly AI infantry on the map, that keep advancing and dying. You see them walk right into HMG fire. They litterally were scripted with a static path to walk into enemy fire... you see a hundred dead NPC AI lying in a row on the ground. They behave like lemmings.I also could go on about the UI and graphics etc (which are okay), but I will leave it at the gameplay aspect as that what matters the most to me. CoH 1 is an 80/100 in my opinion so I think overall CoH 2 (single player) is a,Barely 70/100 Edit: If you are a fan of the old CoH single player gameplay and are looking for something similar then buy Men of War 1 which is by far better then the gameplay in CoH2. After playing this game for 13 ohurs I went back to play MoW 1.			"

												I picked up CoH2 during the free weekend. I was impressed with the flow of play from Relic's CoH inspired Dawn of War titles (less so Retribution, for reasons that will become clear) and thought i'd take a look.Wish I hadn't bothered.First lets address the elephant in the room - the bugs. Stable this game is not. A widely reported game-stopping bug STILL exists in the tutorial mission (encountering a game-stopper within five minutes is surely not a good sign of things to come). due to the way the game processes script triggers and this core issue will come back to bite you many times in the future.On a high-end PC I experienced all of Relic's greatest hits. Audio bugs are the most frequent - sounds get 'stuck' and loop the same half second over. And over. And over. And over. Your only recourse is to close the program or mute the sound. It intensely dislikes the Steam overlay and god forbid you alt-tab.On to the actual gameplay. Not much better.Every mission boils down to: DEFEND AGAINST WAVES!!! which initially receives enough lampshading to be forgivable but even this wears thin and by the sixth mission you're fed up with it.The AI is impossibly stupid. There is no notion of target priorities - your tank destroyers will cheerfully engage light infantry over heavy vehicles, flamethrowers will stand around playing with themselves while under fire from a unit they could easily wipe out if they just moved a half inch into range, but they will gleefully mow down any number of your own troops if it means getting to hit even one vehicle.Pathfinding is a nightmare - be prepared to do a lot of micro and button mashing or you'll have tanks doing reverse donuts through hostile bases in no time. In fact the game seems to be more about fighting against the UI than it does the AI.Unit production is exhausting and badly presented, both infantry and vehicles are spread out across three of the four production buildings with no unifying standard. Icons are not visually dissimilar enough to allow for easy selection of the right unit even if you remember which building it comes from so you're frequently left with the choice between trying to control a combat with the pathfinding and targeting AI fighting you every step of the way or accepting that the units are going to do whatever the hell they want anyway and just focus on making sure you're spamming out the right mix of units to at least make some progress. If this weren't enough the reinforcement mechanic, by which your recruited units arrive on the battlefield is extremely difficult to manage - its not at all apparent where your forces will appear as they begin the trudge to your waypoint, and the WAVES!!!! design of the missions means you'll often be left wondering where the hell those reinforcements you ordered five minutes ago are, only to find they were wiped out by newly spawned AI units in previously cleared areas.The game itself is chaotic. There's no opportunity to really implement strategy beyond the basic rock-paper-scissors unit balancing and your role as the player is more to babysit units so they don't empty clips of light arms into armoured tanks and waste anti-tank fire on infantry. Its a chore, taking place faster than you can really respond because of bad UI design that does nothing but get in your way.If you're a fan of RTS, give this game a miss. Its a mess.			"

												Im not recommending this game because of three reasons, ignore my play time i could barely play it, but got a good feel to write a review, on a whole the games good, but below is why im not recommending it.1. Even though after looking at the requirements to run this game, and checking if my PC can run it, which i have the right stuff to run it, i lag like crazy in the multiplayer, and my mates ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop plays this with no worry, dont know if its my rig, or the game being an♥♥♥♥♥♥ but until something changes, this reason stays.2. Price, on steam this game + dlc which gives you the USA and the German special forces is way to much (£45 in total, £30 just for the game) and you dont really get much with the game, you kinda do everything in a couple of hours as there arnt very many unit types, unless you pay for the dlc.3. DLC compatably, now this isnt the problem, this is great, the problem is the DLC units and ffactions are too OP, and get alot more units and structures than the standard 2 factions in game, which seems quiet unfair.IF you really want to buy this game but are unsure about it, i wouldnt buy it here, because £30 for a game your unsure about is too steep (same reason with me), so go to a website called CD keys if you really want this game, downloads to steam and is 3 times cheaper (just the standard game, no dlc)Or if you dont want to pay £10 for it, go get the first one, im told its way better and is only £7, knock yourself out, cause there are your two options if you cant choose.PS, yes Valve, yes Relic, im telling people about a way to get this game cheaper because this game aint worth £30 "

												All the bad reviews are really unfair. This is a one of the best RTS ever. Hours and hours of fun! Promise! The play to win aspect people is writing about is exaggerated. If you loose its easy to blame P2W instead of improving your tactics. You dont have to buy extra commanders to win. There is really no P2W to talk about here. Adding more commanders just adds more diversity. Anyway the game is available at a reasonable price now, so you should be able to afford an extra commander if you feel like it.Buy this game! Playing this game online is really great fun, and after all these years they finally got it working right....			"

												This is a great game if you are a fan of RTS ww2 games. Ofcourse it has its pros and cons. It is trying to be realistic but it fails to deliver that sometimes. ex. sherman easy eight (76mm cannon) shoots in the middle of enemy rifleman squad and no one dies, or you throw a grenade in the middle of a enemy troops and nobody even gets hurt, units fail to aim, those are mostly the things that bother me, other than that the game is very good but then there are cheaters.. yeah cheaters, drop hackers, you enter game, kick enemy♥♥♥♥♥and guess what? u get disconnected and he wins because of the drop hax.I really recommend this game if you can handle with a bit of unrealism and sometimes even cheaters. if you love ww2 rts games then this is probly a game for you.pros:+ gameplay+ graphics+ units+ voicesCons:- Unbalanced- cheaters (duh) (but  pretty rare to stumble upon one)- a bit of unrealism sometimes- Anti-tank grenades always destroy engine even if thrown at front of the tank- units accuracy (90% of time they wont even hit a guy whos running towards your men and manages to run by them escaping -,-)			"

												This game is certainly a fun one, and can be a tactical masterpiece. But bewarned: this game is most certainly not finished. Relic needs to continue patching issues, as one could easily tell by the forum and internet outcries, and expect more DLC to likely come out as well. While I love this game, occasionally some of the changes relic makes can either be extremely needed and lovely, or absolutely rage inducing. Buyer bewarned if you are the competitive-type.-Sir Patt			"

												EDIT 1/15/2016:I have updated this review with a thumbs up to reflect the progress that this game has made over the past two years.I am very satisfied with this title as of now; it is a friendly experience to gamers that may not be familiar with RTS games.The Steam workshop adds an infinite amount of replayability for this tilte: camos, maps, mods.The graphics have been updated since release, and the game definitely runs a lot better at max setting on my pc.The game has been better balanced to actually giving the Allies a fair fighting change against the Axis powers.What has really made me happy about this game, is that I introduced a handful of my friends to it; firneds that do not normally enjoy RTS titles, yet for some strange reason this game calls out to them and allows them a fun gaming experience.The only 2 drawbacks, I would say, is the commander DLC and the matchmaking. While it is not exactly P2W, the DLC for commanders is a little expensive for recylced abilites jumbled up to fit playstyles. If, I may, suggest buying individual abilites and crafting your own doctrines and mixes using the abilities you have unlocked through war spoils and DLC. With minor restrictions, (only 2 call-ins or 2 artillery abilities for example) I feel this would ultimately bring about the best gaming experience to both seasoned players, and those contemplating on buying this title.The matchmaking, is by far, a little bit on the unbalanced side.I am prestige 1 level 75, and I constantly play against fresh level 20 players, and prestige 3 max level players ALL OF THE TIME. The teams are grossly inbalanced and the game usually ends with victory to the more experienced team.All in all, this is a wonderful game to pick up.The solo player is nice, the coop is nice, the multiplayer is wonderful, but the most important aspect is the custom match ability to play against AI and friends; this alone ties this game together to be absolutely worth the effort. ___________________________________________________________________________________I don't really know how to explain my feelings towards this game.At one end I really enjoy the History aspect of the game, being one of the bloodiest battles in human existence.At the other, this game feels like it took one giant step back from the original Company of Heroes that we RTS fans have fallen in love with. The graphics are appealing, the gameplay is decent, and the story is engrossing; however, it just doesn't feel like a CoH game.It feels almost as if SEGA came in and waved their magic wand and made the game too simple to actually enjoy. There are fewer units than the original making the gameplay a little stale. A few bells and whistles that actually hinder the playability.And don't get me started on the dlc: commanders, skins and faceplates...However, the map community and Steam workshop add a tremendous amount of replayability for this title.I was on the fence about this game, however, I probably wouldn't recommend this title unless you are a hardcore RTS fan and enjoy strategy games.

												this game is an absolute disappointment over the first one. russians are exact copy of the americans from coh1. they also changed a lot of the gameplay mechains around and introduced some new stuff that is very qeustionable and the game suffers as a result.sick and tired of the dev witholding basic content and making it overpridced DLC, which ruins the functionality of the game while nickle and diming your wallet. this is a disgusting trend and I hope these devs learn the hard way by people not buying it.so happy I got it on sale, I would be furious if I paid full price for this garbage. ♥♥♥♥ you relic			"

												I have been playing this game since just after its release (over 200 hours played according to steam) .  Endlessly fun just duking it out over a Bridge with friends.  Normally I grow tired of a game after maybe 50 hours, but something keeps bringing me back to Company of Heroes 2.I wish they could have integrated the old armies from the original COH into this game (the brits in particular).  You can tell they tried to make up for that gap with the Western Front expansion, however the Americans have to hard a time fending off the heavy tanks of the germans and russians.  America has to utilize 80-90% of its forces to repel a german attack that consists of just two heavy tanks and some light support (Infantry). That being said, it can be frustrating, but easily worked around if you play with an ally that can call in heavy tanks.Just because I know it was such an issue when it came out... War Spoils. Despite the thousands of comments in the forums bashing Relic for ruining the game and making things unfair... I actually quite enjoy war spoils. I'm not trying to sound noble, but I play this game to have fun pure and simple.  I could care less what camo pattern I use. On occasion I unlock something from the War Spoils drop and I get a little glimmer of excitement like when I first started playing this game. Playing games for the soul objective of getting ""drops"" at the end of the match is sure to frustrate you as I can tell you firsthand that its not uncommon for me to go 6+ hours of gameplay (multiplayer) with no drops.Now for anybody still reading this and is new to this game you may have not the slightest idea what I just babbled on about. Not to fret, COH2 is endless fun and if you are not sure about it put it on your wishlist.  When this game goes on sale they usually bring it down to $4.99. Cheers!			"

												Well, after playing CoH for a few years, I can tell you that CoH2 is amazing.I stareted 3 days ago and i already have almost 40 hours, worse than any god damn drug.Anyway, i just want to say something about those ''Pay2win'' comments. They are BS.Game is not pay to win, not at all. Yes, every nation has its own commanders, some you have to earn, some you have to buy, and some you get at the start.The thing i did when i started the game, i tried every nation and just loved absolutely everything about Russians, they fit my style perfectly. So what i did, i then went trough few comanders and found one that i like the most and that i could actually use and have some fun with it. I thought, hmm maybe i shoulde buy it, its only 2.5 euros, should I? YES. And hell yeah i was right, at the momment i played with it i forgot i paid for it, it was so so so much fun.Now, if you want to play with every nation, have every commander and every possible skin, then you will have to pay for it, alot. You can get your commander that you like for 2-3 euros, is not that much money, and you will have alot of fun, and your opponent wont have and advantages over you.If less than 5 euros mean the game is pay to win, then idk what to say.BUT, If you ask me, would i buy the game for its full price, 120 euros ? No thank you. It's expensive as hell, and IMO, the stupidest thing about this game is not the commanders, its 20 god damn DLCs that you cant play without, and its annoying, but if you can wait for a discount, awesome, you wont regret it, i promise you.I got it for about 20 and maybe 23-24 max with commander and its absolutely worth it.I have to say it again, this game is absolutely phenomenal. 11/10			"

												For anyone that played the first game: It's diffrent. There're many change to the better, but also many to the worse.  The first was better in my opinion, but this game is also quite awesome. The campaign was better in the first game in my opinion.This game had a lot to live up to from the first games major success. I think they made a really great game and they really tried to make it a fresh game and they made a few bold changes which most often was to the better. But the game is still very much CoH, in a good way. This game is new and therefore don't feel so balanced as the old CoH. Just as the first game this game still have base building and require good micro managment. Update: After years of updates I say that his game now is better then the original in almost every way. Even in the begining small changes such as points are now capped while standing inside a area around the point instead of having a need to stand right next to it as well as the ability to block an enemies caputure by standing inside the same area was a straight upgrade in my opinion. The true sight and sound system that already in the game from the start is awsome and ones you are used to it, it's very hard to go back to he more unrealistic LoS system of the first game.ProsHard to find a better RTS then this, if you don't count the first game. Great graphic.(Updated) The balance as of now is arguble at the same high level as the previous game. ConsFeels like it runs a bit to heavy compaired to the graphic it produce.(Outdated) This game dosn't feel as balanced as the old CoH. (Thought the old game have had years of balane changes. I can't remember if the old CoH was anymore balanced then this new game when it first were released; I would not belive so at least.) *After years of tweaking I think its probably on a equally balanced state as the original game though.

												Pros: If you are a World War 2 history lover, and you like bird's eye view strategy games, then this is one of the best out there. Company of Heroes 2 is very challenging against the AI which is great if you can't find an online game to play with other players. There is a ton of different perks to give you combat bonuses on your units, and commanders to choose from (commanders allow you to have special tactics to use during the game).Cons: For the cost of $39.99 I think you should get the whole game, but there are still tons of things you may have to purchase to get! Some things you can just purchase, but they can be unlocked. However, others can only be unlocked through purchase only! This could be forgiven if the game was cheaper, but for the cost of it there shouldn't be as much DLC as there is!Final Score: Company of Heroes 2 is still a solid game. It is a great improvement from Company of Heroes the original, and the graphics and gameplay have been improved. The final rating is a 8/10. "

												Very addictive game, very well designed and became one of my favourites and highly recomended.Everything in this game seems to work perfect and my only objection is the plot of the main campaign.The game script is foccusing a lot to the bad side of Soviet history, perhaps, trying to satisfy some of the western players. I know that, it is just a game, but the script was annoying to some extend, although i am not Russian.My score is 9.5/10 If you are Russian 9/10 and you should play it, just to hear the officer's call: ""FOR RODINA.... FOR MOTHER LAND..."" :)By the way, i am Greek and my country suffered 800.000 losses during this disgusting war. For those who dont know history, Soviet Union suffered more than 15.000.000 losses (!!!!) and their soldier's sacrifice stoped the fascist expantion all over Europe. (Thank GOD...)P.S.Playing this game, i felt happy, thinking that our world is peacefull (more or less).Keep it that way please, because war gives birth not only to heroes, but also to monsters.Who is the hero and who is the monster is to be decided by the winers and after millions of deaths.

												A good game by far and income is quite new to most strategy games. the income is earned by capturing points but there is 4 diffrent points and 1 includes in only one mode of gameplay. #1 is the standard point it gives gas and muniton and can have a munition/gas upgrade this can only be done by the 3 factions but this does not include oberkommando. #2 is the gas depot which gives gas income this gives more gas than the standard point but gives no munitons.#3 is the muniton depot it gives more munitions than the standard point but gives no gas income. #4 Victory Point this is in a certain mode of gameplay but victory points are used to detuct point from the enemy point count but to win late game you will need 2/3 at least to keep deducting the points and 3/3 will deduct points at a faster rate. also this option which kill all enemy structures is available to all modes of play and is a automatic win if you kill all structures of the enemy.

I did not play the game for over a year.  Downloaded it again last month and I haven't stopped playing since. The new factions, combined with balance changes have improved this game drastically. It may even be better the COH1!			"

												As a Company of Heroes ""veteran"", I understand how the game is played or should be played. I call myself a ""veteran"" not because I am fantastically amazing at the game because I'm not. I call myself a veteran because I have played almost everything Company of Heroes related. I played Company of Heroes 1, Company of Heroes Online (when it was still active), all of the expansions to Company of Heroes 1, and Company of Heroes 2. I have yet to get the Ardennes Assault DLC though I do have the Western Front Armies pack. From my experinces on Company of Heroes 1, the game can get very competitive. But it's not a right competitiveness. The competition someone will face in Company of Heroes Multiplayer is one that will only irritate you and make you want to sling your computer out of the window from the frustration that will follow. Why so much irritation and frustration you may ask? It isn't because that people play right and fair. It's because nobody does anything original. Every match you enter, you will be facing someone who will more than likely do one of three things. 1: They wil spam non-stop throughout the entirity of the match. 2: They will spam Commander abilities in your base non-stop. 3: They will do both of the above. Now these ""tactics"" that I have listed are moer relevant to Company of Heroes 2 that Company of Heroes 1 because Commander abilities in Company of Heroes 1 were much more limited and much more expensive and harder to spam due to map design for resources. But as a personal experience from a Company of Heroes 2 match, I counted that my opponent used the IL-2 Gun Strafe a grand total of 28 times. But if someone were to buy this game, I would suggest they only fight AI battles and play the campaign. Anyone who does that will have more fun than anyone who attempts to fight others in multiplayer. In my personal opinion, the campaign for Company of Heroes 2 was a great story but some of the missions were ridiculously hard because of what you are given to fight with. Overall, I would rate the campaign a 7/10 just because of the sheer impossibility of some missions. Compared to Company of Heroes 1's campaign, Company of Heroes 2's campaign added more of a personal face to a different side of the war. Company of Heroes 1's campaign gave a great history of how World War II unfolded on the Western Front. Now multiplayer, I would rate about 4/10 just because of the people who play on it. AI battles would be a 9/10 just because the AI progressively advances the longer the match lasts. The overall game of Company of Heroes 2, however, I would rate a 6/10 with everything mixed together. Though multiplayer on Company of Heroes 2 has made me more angry than Call of Duty (which enrages me nearly every time I play) at times, the game is a definate improvement over Company of Heroes 1 in game-play effects and balancing and new play styles that came from the addition of True Sight. But all in all, this game is only for someone who enjoys playing with friends because playing with strangers is out of the question.			"

												This game has a lot of improvements made from the previous COH in the series, especially the vehicle combat system. The strategy in the game has made it harder to use a single unit-class, forcing players to diversify more and expand their own playstyles. Some don't like it, but I actually welcome the change!I played through the Campaign, and while it was good for a stand-alone story, I can understand how Russians may take offense at it. I read some reviews saying it was a pro-Nazi perspective, making the Russians seem like the bad guys, but when I played it, I didn't get that feeling. The story seemed to have elements of truth in it, but pieces were exaggerated for the sake of cinematography in the game.The best part, however, is the multiplayer. The automatch system was an unusual change from vanilla COH's server-list selection, but after you get familiar with it, it's extremely helpful for getting the game you want to play online. Interestingly, when you start your auotmatch, it shows the percentage of German commanders and Soviet commanders also looking for games. I love this, because if I choose Soviets, but there's already a lot, I'll switch to German in a heartbeat to get into a game faster.I feel the balancing in the game is really good! I don't feel like one side is over-powered in any way, but they do have different playstyles that I love to utilize.Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to a friend. It's fun to play, it's beautiful to watch, and the combat is exhilirating. Worth every penny  I spent!			"

I play one of the historical mods (Battleground Europe by Jed) and I also use the Infantry Emphasis game mode which somewhat limits the amount of vehicles/tanks.  Best RTS I have ever played.			"

												Very unbalanced multiplayer. Clearly overpowered units takes many months to adjust and still havent been adjusted. I liked this game at first but after seeing the imbalances I refuse to play any more and I sure as heck won't buy any dlc.Also Relics zero communication policy means that no insight on future plans are given and never any headsup on planned changes.I've played alot of Dawn of war 2 and altough it took them forever to balance that game, at least they gave out previews on balance changes and communicated more.Can't recommend this game at current state.

												I was waiting for this game for a long time. Compared to the first CoH, it is a terrible game. It is not terrible because it is not the same, but it is terrible because it feels like the game was not made with much thought. There are so many DLCs, and the tech trees for each commander seems so limited, so much of variations on the same theme. The best commanders are only available as ""pay to win"". The matchmaking system is HORRIBLE. Why not just let me screen for games on a browser and join them? Why only let me select one choice for a match, when I may be open to several different types of games? Matchmaking systems should always be optional.The way they changed infantry and vehicle balance also made the game feel much more vehicle focused. Most infantry, even some antitank infantry, don't stand a chance against tanks. They just drop like flies, even under cover (though it might also be the hacking AI). The AT guns are also clunky and require just as much pop cap as a small or medium tank. The AI cheats like crazy for comp stomp games. Example: you cannot field any snipers because they will be killed magically by magic mortars and other freak shots. You can only play certain tactics against the AI, as all the other normal tactics will fail to their horrible hacks (worst than the first one, not even fun, why not put some more thought into AI?). Playing against the computer becomes an exercise in patience, and it is not fun.Even though I spent a pretty penny on this game and a few DLCs, and I really wanted to like this game, I have gone back to CoH original. Good luck to everyone else.			"

												It's got a fun tutorial, I guess, I mean it's got absolutely no dialog in it (well it appears it tries to but the text only appears for a frame before disappearing). It kind of explains how to move units and how the combat system works, quickly moving away from RTS basics and how it changes the rules.Skirmishes are kinda fun, though I kinda wish the tutorial had a mission to explain those too.The game, however, does not have a campaign. It has a screen that takes you to the campaign, but instead of a play button, it says ""Purchase""Pressing the purchase button takes you to the steam page, and the steam page says that I can only purchase it as a gift for somebody else. So, yeah, the campaign doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.On top of that I should have some in game skins, however in the in-game inventory I have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Moreover it appears I can only play as a certain Army, for whatever unexplained reason, and when I click on any of the other armies it takes me to the steam store page again.Mind you I've clicked on purchasing other things from the game menu and it's taken me to DLC lists that are hidden in the depths of steam that imply that the DLC list is much greater than the advertised 4 of them, but even then those are just skin packs. No place to buy the main campaign.I mean, look how long I've played the game... I've already played through ALL the content available, twice.			"

												On the surface CoH2 seems like a pretty decent game but if you're looking for a good multiplayer-RTS then you should get Starcraft 2 still. It's still one of the most balanced games out there. Relic's striving for more players who choose the Allied Forces damages the game-balance tremendously and makes the game incredibly frustrating on multiplayer. If you still want a WW2 RTS then I'd still suggest the first CoH as it's not that unbalanced. Maybe they'll change it but don't buy the game until that happened.			"

												SPOILER: I'm going to give this game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Keep on reading if you want to know why.I dislike this game strongly not on account of being Russian and have some game writer who have seen one Hollywood movie take a dump on the history of my country. Nor for displaying the Soviet Red Army as a horde of ruthless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animals who were killed casually by friend and foe (""Enemy At The Gates"", anyone?), hinting at the assumption that the only reason Soviets were able to kick the Germans out of the Soviet Union was because the latter ran out of bullets. Also, Winter. Then again, if you want to learn history, play the Civ series.I dislike this game because of the following: dumb and poorly written dialogues, with cliché lines and stories taken from thin air. I dislike this game because of the language, with a mix of Russian obscenities and ridiculous accents (like ""Red Heat""); either you go all the way and do dialogues in Russian and with English narration, or do it like in Red Alert-series. This language/accent mixture makes me think of parodies on Soviet armed forces from various comedies, action movies from the 80's and 90's and games like ""Red Alert"", which negates this game's attempt at being a serious and challenging RTS about a serious and grave war. Unlike CoH, where dialgoues, speech and general use of spoken langauges were well executed, which gave CoH the perfect mood the creators intended for it, I don't feel passionate about anything or anyone in CoH2, mostly due to the fact that the characters make me think of cartoonish characters.As for the gameplay aspect, well, the perfectly imbalanced forces on both sides are...imbalanced. On one hand you have the OP German forces, on the other - Soviet morons who die like flies from everything, including breathing, apparently. Heck, in CoH I often managed to keep at least one squad alive throughout an entire mission; here, you are lucky if your Soviet squad lives the first 5 minutes of a battle! Even 'elite' forces drop dead for no reason! Which sucks bum on missions where you have to rely on special tactics squads. With this in mind, the intense action and fast pace of the game are more of an annoyance, rather than a pleasant challenge. The Winter missions were an interesting aspect, but, again, with your forces' life expectancy equal to that of a banana in a family of monkeys, restarting these missions from last save time and time again became tedious very fast.As for the performance, I don't get why this game needs more than 15GB of free space; the graphics haven't improved, the cinematics are crappy; what the heck does it use this space for?!In conclusion, I only bought this game because it was on Relic sale on the weekly Humble Bundle, and I won't play it again. I don't care for the graphics, I wanted the story. What I got was crappy dialogues, badly written plot and story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission, irritating gameplay mechanics, and general annoyance every time someone said something (yes, I'm obsessed with language, but then, I'm also a linguist, so shovel it, OK?). This game takes a huge dump on CoH-series. Mods is this game's only hope. What the clucking bell were SEGA and Relic thinking when they released a sequel this bad? And I am not the only one to give the game a scolding review, far from it.Buy it if you have too much empty space on your hard drive or want to revisit the Red Alert universe. Otherwise, you'd be better off with other Relic games.			"

												Game is good, as long as it doesn't crash over and over which it will on Radeon 4xxx series cards, I do not recommend buying this game if you own any of these cards as the game will bluescreen with a driver error.This is a known issue from beta which still has not been fixed, AMD attempted a fix with some 13.4 beta drivers but those just postponed the crashing  but did not prevent it. Game still crashes with BSOD on legacy 13.9 drivers.Cannot recommend because of this issue which was in the game in beta but never ever fixed by Relic. They just passed the problem to AMD, and failed to address the root cause of the issue, which is presumably a software / DirectX conflict with these particular model of video cards.Just buy CoH 1 instead.

When i first bought this i had about 20 hours on the original COH (due to them moving to steam) and now i have 90hrs for it, I think this speaks volumes in terms of how badly SEGA screwed up with COH2 and how disappointed I am in the direction taken with this game.Pros-Similar gameplay to the original COHCons-Alot more graphic intensive and very little gain from it (minus the snow effects)-factions are too asymetric-Too much overpriced DLC making the game feel more like a free to play game (which you pay to just play then pay more to be overpowered)			"

												I'll give Company of Heroes a 4/10 because it's not the worst game ever made, I can think of other games that are more deserving of a 0-1/10 - looking at you Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. However, I (like many other gamers) feel that Company of Heroes 2 just doesn't live up to the expectations of its predecessor. What has happened to the sophisticated commander tree? It has been replaced by a new commander system with no choice, except you can choose 5 different commander 'perks' before a match, then when you get commander points it'll unlock perks automatically (as each perk has a commander point requirement that, once reached, the perk will instantly become available). Okay, but at least CoH 2 has interesting concept art briefs between each mission right? Wrong. Those concept art briefs - which I, personally, loved and associated with the CoH titles - have been replaced by 30 second longish cut scenes between a lieutenant (who you never see or hear from in the missions) that is going to be executed for desertion and his old commander talking about the war - CoH 2 has replaced exciting and interesting character development and artistic cut scenes for a character you'll never see in-game and mediocre between mission cut scenes. There's almost no continuity between missions, in the original CoH you'd get a patriotic and informative brief (so you know what's going on in the grand scale of things), but in CoH 2 it's a case of; a minute cut scene that says ""the Germans attacked Russia"" and ""they get really close to Moscow"", from there on it's a case of go there, kill them, we won, fight them - then the level design and gameplay follows this pattern, so what may seem interesting and innovative to start becomes dull and representative in later missions. Yet another CoH 2 mistake is the lack of units, you'll have 2 units that you'll ever really use, your conscripts (infantry) and the T34s (tanks), that's it, you do have snipers (that for some reason only use stealth while they're in cover) and mortar teams etc but what's the point when they'll just get flooded by infantry and tanks? If you want to fight for the Germans, you better go somewhere else, because the singleplayer campaign is all Soviet - you can play as the Germans in multiplayer. Well, you can also play as the Germans in a new feature called 'Theater of War' which, basically, mini-campaigns with about 2 singleplayer missions and tonnes of co-op missions (which is a welcome feature) - but when I realized that my friends weren't prepared to pay £30 for a sub-par sequel, I was left with about 4 hours of German gameplay, max...Well... I think I've said all that I can about Company of Heroes 2. In conclusion, I'm not satisfied with Sega's sequel on what was a milestone in real-time strategy games. It has lost its strategy and has replaced it with numbers. And has many little 'features' that'll drive you mad, like units flashing their player colour when they're clicked on and all your recruited units now start off-map so you have to wait for them to come to you. There seems to be a never ending list of what's wrong with CoH 2, it's like they got the designs and features from the original games and said ""these are good, but, scrap them and let's start from fresh without taking any inspiration from the originals"". Plus CoH 2, to me, seems to have been Sega-fied.			"

												Over all an ok game, but i felt like I was playing a mod for the first game.Actually the eastern front mod for the first game was a little better IMHO.Tanks are very overpowered in this game though, historically the use of mixed unit tactics was the way to go during world war two, heavy armor without air, artillery and infantry support was dead armor( as the Russians found out the hard way), but this game seems to reward C&C style tank rushes. Also certian tanks can litterally outrun a deployed AT gun THAT IS facing it. And what I mean by this is that if you have a gun facing an enemy tank and they use the magical overdrive ability by the time it takes your men to aim its too late, tanks moved behind your gun and has killed all the men maning it.Too bad game is totally ruined by DLC whoring.

												I think I just bought something that should be a free to play. There are adds everywhere for skinpacks, map packs, mini campaigns, etc. This is why so many people are against DLC. Games like this abuse the DLC system beyond belief. You basically pay for things that should already be in the game, like maps, missions, co-op things, skins, and profile custimization. Your overpaying for small pieces of a game, with a quality and quantity nowhere near its asking price. Its also way overpriced for the vanilla game in general, and I bought this game on sale for less then $20. The $20 I had to spend to just play the very basic piece of this game would be like paying to play a ""free to play"" styled game. I seriously want my money back for this one. Shame considering you'd expect more from this game series... really disapointed.			"

												The original company of heroes series were for a long time my favourite games ever. Somehow all of the charm, smooth play, great feel and depth of CoH has been completely lost. If you enjoyed the first game and it's expansions, stick with them. This is, very sadly, not a good sequel.Map design and pathing are sub-par, the upgrade system unexplained and somewhat un-needed, the in game units are less defined, the graphics are no big upgrade, the AI is completely broken (There is no way that anyone but a CoH veteran will beat the computer on 'standard' difficulty in skirmishes) and there is just a generally disjointed, unfinished, un-polished air to everything. The total opposite to how CoH 1 felt, which is really confusing considering how similar they are.3/10			"

												I came, I tried, I decided it wasn't worth my money even on sale for 9.99.  First of all, you're buying just a fragement of a game.  The majority of the game is DLC.  Secondly, the story missions are just too hand-holdy.  I know that that's the way of modern RTS games, but it just is slow, there are really few options within a mission to really be creative, and it just feels like I'm marching down a corridor.  The action is also just far too arcadish for my tastes.  If I'm going to play a WW2 based RTS, I'd rather play Men of War.  Sure, that series has its issues, but at least the action feels weighty...  Here everything can absorb plenty of damage and keep rolling.  The fights are hectic and disorganized, while a game like Men of War allows you to really plan and strategize, particularly with infantry.  The style fits the Warhammer 40k retexture of this game far better than an actual war set in the real world.			"

												COH2 is better with the mods yes, but it would be wiser to start setting the game to the future. If you are concerned for other country to be upset then use fictional world. I did not buy this game in the beginning because they already had Russian army in the Eastern front mod of COH1. well overall the campaign sucks, but at least you can play or watch with others, and that is good for me. You want to buy this game if you have friends to play with otherwise I would not recommend it too much.			"

												Seems like there are plenty of reviews out for this game, I'll just put in my 2 cents.  The game is a great rts, probably not as good as the first COH series, but it IS enjoyable and fun to play.The main issue besides the pay2win bloatware with commadnders ( I personally haven't really spent much on the game and don't care about commanders as much, My main issue with the game is the ABSOLUTE LACK OF HARDWARE OPTIMIZATIONS..........................That's where the real problems begin.  ""Game is slowing down, reduce your settings"" I'm sorry what?  I'm running an FX8350 with 32gb of RAM , game runs off the SSD and an AMD 6970 ( i have 2 of them, but I'm almost sure the game doesn't use crossfire).   how the heck is my game slowing down.  I tried this in any freaking video settings.... same deal.  Game slows down no matter what.  I'm not sure if it's a matter of servers handling the load, or how the game processes the units, or just the sheer amount of textures.  I can handle maps with 200 pop capacity without slowing down to the point where it is unplayable.  I've had maps that even at 400 i'm fine.  Even with 800 maps, SOME Work, some don't , some you'll start slowing down and falling behind in time in the game with your friends to the point where you are 15min lagged behind.  Not sure how this even freaking happens or works out for an RTS game .  It's RTS not turn based.There are a ton of posts about this subject, game devs don't even bother fixing their game in terms of performance, sega just keeps releasing useless DLCS.  Guess what, I would have spent 40 bucks on a stupid DLC if the game actually ran properly with my given hardware which even thoguh it's a few years old, it is much much better than your average gaming rig still.  (I still run most my games on high or ultra, recent games), so it's not a matter of my hardware being♥♥♥♥♥♥Are the devs probably going to fix this ever?  Probbably not. Buy the game when it's on sale ONLY, do not spend all your money on the full price of this junk.  My 2 centss			"

												Let's put aside the fact that I pre-purchased this game the day it was available and was unable to play it until yesterday (6.5 months after it came out) because the game claimed my computer wasn't able to handle the graphics (which it was more than capable of doing) and that only by completely wiping my computer (for other reasons - not just this game) and loading windows 7 fresh was this game able to start...This feels cartoonish and fake and I feel like I was swindled.  Graphics would be good if the developers did some research into uniforms and vehicles.  German pioneers are wearing bright green Finnish uniforms?  The German uniforms look ridiculous.  They're the ""Hollywood"" uniforms and nowhere near accurate.  I hate, ABSOLUTELY HATE the DLC and the fact that if you bought all the DLC it'd cost far more than this ridiculously overpriced game.  The game requires a lot of computing power to run.  You can't zoom out very far.  Command trees are gone from COH1.  The Commanders are stupid - it's like 9 abilities randomly placed under commanders, and if you are dumb enough, you pay to get new  commanders, but no new abilities.  There's no doctrines anymore, so every game you play feels like the last.  Abilities are unbalanced.  Units, weapons and vehicles look cartoonish.  It's basically a re-skin of COH1 with Russians instead of Americans or British.  Support for this game is damn near non-existent, and the support I did get was inept and unable to help me fix the problems I was having starting this game.  What a waste of money.  Don't bother.

												This is a good game I will admit that but there are several major issues that drag the game.It has great potential but it has holes that scream to be filled with DLC (and some already have)The game is focused around WW2 during the German invasion of Russia it offers a 14 mission long campaign a skirmish mode against the AI and an active multiplayer base there are 2 sides (unless u buy DLC which adds 2 more:The Oberkommando Wehrmacht and United States Forces)the German Wehrmacht and the USSR each having different strengths and weaknesses the campaign is based around a a Soviet Liutenant named Abraham Ivaskovych (or something along those lines) who was sent to a Gulag for apparent crimes against the state (I won't spoil the story not that there is much to spoil just in case u do buy the game) he is visited by his former officer Churkin (I forget his first name) it brings you from the beginning of the invasion (u play as the USSR in the campaign) to the siege of Berlin the campaign is hard which  is good (I completed it on captain which is basicly normal) the characters however are boring and I couldn't really care less about them The combat is enjoyable and is satisfying when u destroy an enemy unit or an enemy tank u will choose in multiplayer/skirmish a commander during the game which gives u abilities and bonuses these are unlocked by levelling up every time u level up u MIGHT earn ''warspoils'' which are either upgrades eg.one might give ur Grenadiers/Conscripts 3% more accuracy they are very small bonuses and I pay little attention to them as the differences they enact are quite minor the game is a base builder RTS the USSR and Wehrmacht are very different which is obviously good the game unfortunately however does not have good balance the Wehrmacht is clearly better than the USSR and with the DLC the OKW is very superior compared to the USF and Conscripts are too good these are some balancing issuesPros:Enjoyable combatGood resources systemBoth sides are fun to playHard campaignLong campaign Good AIFun multiplayer Cons:Bad balancing (The German factions are superior to the Allied ones and the US are more of a weakness than a strength)Unit strengths are historically innacurate Uninteresting campaign charactersLack of unit variety Many areas that are clearly going to be filled with DLC Tanks are too expensiveOverall I would not reccomend this because even though there are more pros than cons the some cons are too major to be forgiven if u are looking for a great WW2 Base building RTS with a good campaign then I would reccommend the original Company of Heroes it is far superior and I have a positive review for that if u wish to look at it.

When i search ladder game there is 80% people playing axis and 20% playing allies this shows when you search for game. Why there is more player playing axis you wonder? its because the game is so god damn imbalanced and playing axis just gives you a free win their units is much stronger dealing more dmg having more health compared to allied units.This game is just a waste of money and alot of money you need to pay for everything ingame even for playing multiplayer after you bought the game...

												First of all I bought the game in a store, more specifically, I bought Ardennes Assault thinking that it was something like Tales of Valor, where it was a standalone expansion where I could enjoy a simple skirmish and have the freedom to play however I wanted to besides the campaign. Well, no. Relic and Sega have taken all that out so I pay money (far more what its worth) for...an empty shell. Yes, sucks to be me for not coming on to Steam to read the reviews, but having not played for a long, long time and seeing it in the store, I thought why the hell not. Anyway, it stutters and lags and has some really weird AI. When exiting a garrison, some units exit DIRECTLY into the line of fire even when they entered from the other side of a building. Retreating also has them go directly into the line of fire. Seriously? I'm going to cut it short and say no, this is not an improvement over COH1.			"

Instead if you want to play the game with just the other Soviet content you'll shell out another $15, for content that was already made, they just wanted more of your damn money.The story was cardboard, the missions were repetative, and ultimately I went back to playing the original CoH.

												Excellent balancing and continued support. Relic has done a great job with this game, especially after releasing the new factions. The only shortcomings of this game are the complicated price tags for commanders/DLC/expansions which adds too many varying things to the game. Western Fronts Armies is an expansion adding 2 Multiplayer only factions, whereas Ardennes Assault expansion only adds a Singleplayer expansion (which uses the faction introduced in WFA)... confusing, so check out the reddit page for full details.Other than the marketing system, the graphics are great, gameplay fluid and online community acceptable as a whole. Modding tools and map making abilities are available too. A great game to play with friends and don't be afraid to automatch!			"

												I do recommend this game but I dislike the variety of Axis forces in the game. We have 3 allied nations at the moment and only 2 Axis companies, so to speak. Since I am from Eastern Europe I like this game because I can fight against the Soviet Russia. I can only do so while playing Axis, so it is getting rather boring...Even when they added the Commonwealth it did not do much to make playing Axis interesting.Once they add another Axis faction (I would recommend Finland or some German North Army Company as they would fit the snow-theme) I can guess it would get more interesting again.This game is easy against spammers (the usual ""because Youtube told me to spam Q.Q"" players)  but if someone plays it with wit and cunning, it is rather interesting. I usually play with my friend while speaking via Skype. I love the 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 gameplay since it makes me feel like I am part of something bigger. 1v1 is boring since company vs company simply is not fun enough for me. 2v2 and bigger games make me feel like part of a batallion and when other two teammembers know how to coordinate attacks with flaking with their company - it gets even better.While playing this be flexible, use diversion, infiltration, flanking and fainting to lure in all those enemies who have no clue how real battles are fought. As a member of armed forces I love this game because of its tactical and strategical capabilities.			"

												This game goes against what historians say about what happened in the eastern front and gets it all wrong in the story line, everyting from Order 227 to Scorched Earth policy is potrayed wrongly but it's made by relic and relic is a canadian company. First off Order 227 is potrayed as this order that if soviet troops retreat they will be shot as soon as they make it back to their commander, in real life they would have been shot but only for desertion and they would have been given a warning before they were shot. Second the scorched earth policy is potrayed as an order given by stalin to destroy all buildings and material before retreating from your position, in real life building that wern't occupied by civillians were desginated for destruction and the material was to be used to slow the enemy advance. The only good thing about this game is the gameplay in multiplayer mode. And after this games failed launch were it recived heavy criticisem from eastern europeans, relic soon came out with the western front allies which really is just a new version of company of heroes one. what keeps this game going is the mountain of Steam workshop items that can be downloaded a good amount are good some are bad but there is maps, tuning packs that improve game play or give you diffrent/extra units and win condition where it modifies how you win a match.In world war 2 one shot from a ISU-152 was able to destroy a panzer 4 with one shot in this game a panzer 4's main 75mm gun with standard shell can rip apart a ISU when hitting the frontal armor when a the front armor of a ISU was able to defeat the 75mm shell.The AI DO NOT pay resource cost by this I mean if a machine gun and crew cost 300 man power the AI pays nothing I've been in matchs against AI that 1 minute into the match they have 4 MG's and like 10 squads of infantry where I have like 4 squads and 1 MG and I have spent all man power on these units and you could push the enemy back to their base and they have no resource income but they will still field a bunch of infantry and spawn a heavy tank.

												Very unbalanced multiplayer. Clearly overpowered units takes many months to adjust and still havent been adjusted. I liked this game at first but after seeing the imbalances I refuse to play any more and I sure as heck won't buy any dlc.Also Relics zero communication policy means that no insight on future plans are given and never any headsup on planned changes.I've played alot of Dawn of war 2 and altough it took them forever to balance that game, at least they gave out previews on balance changes and communicated more.Can't recommend this game at current state.

												I was waiting for this game for a long time. Compared to the first CoH, it is a terrible game. It is not terrible because it is not the same, but it is terrible because it feels like the game was not made with much thought. There are so many DLCs, and the tech trees for each commander seems so limited, so much of variations on the same theme. The best commanders are only available as ""pay to win"". The matchmaking system is HORRIBLE. Why not just let me screen for games on a browser and join them? Why only let me select one choice for a match, when I may be open to several different types of games? Matchmaking systems should always be optional.The way they changed infantry and vehicle balance also made the game feel much more vehicle focused. Most infantry, even some antitank infantry, don't stand a chance against tanks. They just drop like flies, even under cover (though it might also be the hacking AI). The AT guns are also clunky and require just as much pop cap as a small or medium tank. The AI cheats like crazy for comp stomp games. Example: you cannot field any snipers because they will be killed magically by magic mortars and other freak shots. You can only play certain tactics against the AI, as all the other normal tactics will fail to their horrible hacks (worst than the first one, not even fun, why not put some more thought into AI?). Playing against the computer becomes an exercise in patience, and it is not fun.Even though I spent a pretty penny on this game and a few DLCs, and I really wanted to like this game, I have gone back to CoH original. Good luck to everyone else.			"

												The game itself seems like a fun concept with good graphics and realism but:Most of the game is locked out with purchase/DLC options including all single player campaign content.The tutorial is almost useless.There is apparently no map scrolling and clicking on the minimap to select a different area all the time is tedious and not accurate enough.I played through the single and small tutorial mission and enjoyed the game so far though all it teaches you to do is to move and select an enemy unit to fire on.The next screen was filled with Buy Now! Buy Now! Buy Now! Buy Now! missions... so I clicked to play the single player campaigns and only got two options. I tried Ardennes Assault and saw Purchase... So I went back and clicked the Russian one and got - yes, you guessed it - Purchase... So there's no single player campaign missions included with the game? Strike one and major fail in my opinion.I tried Theatre of War - Battles, Challenges and Co-Op Scenarios - which had 4 options. All of which had Purchase instead of start mission or something useful. Strike two.The only thing left was Online & Skirmish - Automatch vs Players seemed to work, but I had no interest in playing against other players when I really had no idea what I was doing yet. Three strikes.I tried Automatch vs AI but again it was multiplayer vs AI and I wanted to play solo.In my fifth and final attempt to actually play this game I tried Create Custom Game and I was finally able to create a game which had me vs an AI player. I had no idea what I was doing and failed quickly and horribly. I'm done.			"

												On the surface CoH2 seems like a pretty decent game but if you're looking for a good multiplayer-RTS then you should get Starcraft 2 still. It's still one of the most balanced games out there. Relic's striving for more players who choose the Allied Forces damages the game-balance tremendously and makes the game incredibly frustrating on multiplayer. If you still want a WW2 RTS then I'd still suggest the first CoH as it's not that unbalanced. Maybe they'll change it but don't buy the game until that happened.			"

												It's got a fun tutorial, I guess, I mean it's got absolutely no dialog in it (well it appears it tries to but the text only appears for a frame before disappearing). It kind of explains how to move units and how the combat system works, quickly moving away from RTS basics and how it changes the rules.Skirmishes are kinda fun, though I kinda wish the tutorial had a mission to explain those too.The game, however, does not have a campaign. It has a screen that takes you to the campaign, but instead of a play button, it says ""Purchase""Pressing the purchase button takes you to the steam page, and the steam page says that I can only purchase it as a gift for somebody else. So, yeah, the campaign doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.On top of that I should have some in game skins, however in the in-game inventory I have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Moreover it appears I can only play as a certain Army, for whatever unexplained reason, and when I click on any of the other armies it takes me to the steam store page again.Mind you I've clicked on purchasing other things from the game menu and it's taken me to DLC lists that are hidden in the depths of steam that imply that the DLC list is much greater than the advertised 4 of them, but even then those are just skin packs. No place to buy the main campaign.I mean, look how long I've played the game... I've already played through ALL the content available, twice.			"

												Fun for a while, but totally unrealistic. Tanks take a rediculous amount of damage, one hit kills are impossible on tanks, even with rear hit. Men are way too easy to replace, can fully reinforce a squad in a few seconds, so you really have no need to value your mens lives. Infantry AT weapons are hopeless. Game comes down to how fast you can click and manage your blobs of men. Not much room for tactical gameplay either as everyone is rush rush rush. Games are usually over before you get any chance to build that large tank. I liked the original better. Alot more building stuff, healing friends, setting up defences. Totally not the same now, just another RTS in my eyes, nothing special.			"

												EDIT 1/15/2016:I have updated this review with a thumbs up to reflect the progress that this game has made over the past two years.I am very satisfied with this title as of now; it is a friendly experience to gamers that may not be familiar with RTS games.The Steam workshop adds an infinite amount of replayability for this tilte: camos, maps, mods.The graphics have been updated since release, and the game definitely runs a lot better at max setting on my pc.The game has been better balanced to actually giving the Allies a fair fighting change against the Axis powers.What has really made me happy about this game, is that I introduced a handful of my friends to it; firneds that do not normally enjoy RTS titles, yet for some strange reason this game calls out to them and allows them a fun gaming experience.The only 2 drawbacks, I would say, is the commander DLC and the matchmaking. While it is not exactly P2W, the DLC for commanders is a little expensive for recylced abilites jumbled up to fit playstyles. If, I may, suggest buying individual abilites and crafting your own doctrines and mixes using the abilities you have unlocked through war spoils and DLC. With minor restrictions, (only 2 call-ins or 2 artillery abilities for example) I feel this would ultimately bring about the best gaming experience to both seasoned players, and those contemplating on buying this title.The matchmaking, is by far, a little bit on the unbalanced side.I am prestige 1 level 75, and I constantly play against fresh level 20 players, and prestige 3 max level players ALL OF THE TIME. The teams are grossly inbalanced and the game usually ends with victory to the more experienced team.All in all, this is a wonderful game to pick up.The solo player is nice, the coop is nice, the multiplayer is wonderful, but the most important aspect is the custom match ability to play against AI and friends; this alone ties this game together to be absolutely worth the effort. ___________________________________________________________________________________I don't really know how to explain my feelings towards this game.At one end I really enjoy the History aspect of the game, being one of the bloodiest battles in human existence.At the other, this game feels like it took one giant step back from the original Company of Heroes that we RTS fans have fallen in love with. The graphics are appealing, the gameplay is decent, and the story is engrossing; however, it just doesn't feel like a CoH game.It feels almost as if SEGA came in and waved their magic wand and made the game too simple to actually enjoy. There are fewer units than the original making the gameplay a little stale. A few bells and whistles that actually hinder the playability.And don't get me started on the dlc: commanders, skins and faceplates...However, the map community and Steam workshop add a tremendous amount of replayability for this title.I was on the fence about this game, however, I probably wouldn't recommend this title unless you are a hardcore RTS fan and enjoy strategy games.

The extra factions (Western Front) , however, add a worthy amount of content for the price for sure, don't have ardennes assault to judge for.

												I was looking for a multiplayer RTS that had no resources gathering but still kept strategic and tactical depths. CoH2 ticks all the boxes, with added brilliant graphics and audio to create one intense, immersive experience. Instead of resource gathering you have to capture certain territory points that when held give you the resources you need, such as manpower, munitions or fuel. You are then able to use these resource points to make building upgrades which then allow you to get better units or to upgrade your current units with special abilities. It’s very close to a MOBA actually, but with far more complexity.Concerning the campaign parts, it’s okay, but the game really shines in multiplayer, which by playing the campaigns helps you improve your multiplayer skills. The only negatives I can say about the game is that the tutorial should be better, especially to help people that are more interested in just playing multiplayer, and I almost stopped playing because of not quite knowing how it all worked. Also its mini tactical map, which is used consistently, greatly needs improvement, sometimes being very difficult to see where your units are. The larger tactical map is not practical to use so the mini map is mostly relied on and therefore needs to be clearer. "

												Good for scratching that realistic-RTS itch, but falls dreadfully short on balance (changes per patch) and competitive play. No ladder player what-so-ever. Limited matchmaking that throws you in with first-available opponents - and AOL-age lobby support.Pay to win online play: $1.99-4.99 for premium Commanders that completely outshine their default commanders or exploit over powered mechanics (mostly an issue with OKW/USF, but definitely apparent for Sov/Wer).Core gameplay is mostly minor improvements on the winning formula from CoH 1, but now wrapped and infused with micotransactions and DLC.Even if you only buy the base game/armies - you'll enjoy the game, but you'll quickly hate the developers/publishers for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥izing a game with so much potential to be the definitive WW2-RTS, as the shortcuts for the sake of profit is literally evident in almost every element of the game.You'll hate yourself for enjoying this game because of what it means for modern gaming development/DLC.

												Ive spent a few hours on this game :)I can tell you the game itself WAS intense and exciting. Plenty of action across the battlefield.The problem is with the realism and balance. If you are like me and ONLY want to PVP then I would say skip this game. Look around for something else or wait for the next big RTS to come out. The biggest problem is that there is NOTHING similar to this game anywhere. I mean, sure you can go back to COH1 but going to an older game is just lame. Unfortunately we WW2 strategy junkies are stuck with this unbalanced saga that is COH2.Anyway, if you decide to buy this game heres the score...The devs seem to bend over backwards and give in to the crying masses, you know the ones that yell ""OP"" about everything instead of sticking to realistic guidelines.So, the game has changed into blob vs blob. Basically you build a large mass of troops, tanks, guns etc and put a big square around them and charge at another large mass (blob) of troops tanks and guns. the counters for the blob were recently all but removed so unless your blob is the biggest you lose. Simple... So work out which army can build the biggest blob first and stick with them :) You will win everytime.			"

Still fun but overall would recommend the first series for someone looking for a new RTS to play.The main reason why I do not recommend this game, DLCs and costs.  This game is $39.99, the first DLC $19.99, now they put out a second for $39.99.  THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH $100!  That is not including the microtransactions to get better generals and perks.

												I like RTS games.  I also like WW2 themed games.  So believe me when I say that I want to like this game.  It does a few things well.  The overall level of detail in the maps, units is good.  There are plenty of upgrade, customization options out there to help players develop their own strategies, tactics.  It has all of the basic elements of a winner.    However...  The A.I and unit path finding in this game are both awful.  Infuriatingly...unforgivably awful.  I appreciate the fact that the unit I.A can't be TOO effective, otherwise the game is just too easy.  But your units in this game totally inept.   - Infantry units will just stand around and get shelled to death unless you micromanage them.  They won't attempt to avoid explosions, fire...or make use of available cover.  They'll just die.   - Vehicles?  Utterly useless.   Don't even think of moving more than two of them at a time.  They'll run amok, cutting each other off, and colliding randomly all the way to their destination.  They'll struggle around every single terrain obstacle, taking the worst conceivable path unless you painstakingly direct them around every rock and tree.  This takes pretty much as much time as it would if you had just let them just traverse the entire map.  Some times they'll just do what they want despite all of your furious clicking and keyboard mashing.  They'll roll right over friendly defensive structures, destroying them and scattering your (previously well protected) infantry onto open ground.  They'll also drive straight onto your own tank traps if you let them.  I've seriously watched tanks and artillery rotate 300 degrees in the wrong direction to face a target, then fail to engage.  they'll just sit there.  Your infantry units will cohabitate with opposing units, often moving into point blank range before engaging.  The proximity/collision detection in this game is totally broken.     I've played the campaigns in this game, as well as Ardennes Assault (in the hope that they had addresses these issues)  My verdict:  There's no way in hell that I'll ever pay another dime to this franchise until they start fixing this garbage.  Playing this game starts to feel like a chore after a while because you'll spend half of your time making sure that your units aren't spinning around in a corner somewhere.  After 3 stand alone releases, and a mountain of DLC, there's just no excuse for such shoddy gameplay.  FAIL    "

												Great concept, good mechanics, HORRENDOUS balance and pay 2 win nonsense. The German side is simply out matched in every regard. Their basic grenider infantry unit is only good at long range and when stationary, so the allies have to simply just charge at them to knock them out. The Greniders do not get sub machine guns, yet the allied squads all do. In addition, the German squads have 4 men to the allied 6... and cannot fire grenades until you advance your battle phase to level 1... while the allies can upgrade to grenades immediately... pay 2 win allows allied players to get hordes of veteran riflemen RIGHT OFF THE BAT and just swarm your under powered trash infantry, even if they have MG42 support. One would think that the German tanks would be better then right? WRONG  The allies get more tanks, and for some strange reason a Sherman tank in the game is better then basically every German tank, despite the fact in real life they were easy to knock out, you will routinely see a Sherman shrugging off tank rounds like it is a Tiger tank... yet it is not. The T-34 is equally OP, but at least they have an historical excuse for that. I cannot tell you how many times I have tried to adjust my startegy as Germans and time and time again you just get swamp with masses of infantry and tanks. I finally quit after a match in which we destroyed twice as many enemy units as they did, but still lost because they easily replace everything, have pay 2 win veteran infantry, and pay 2 win massive sherman easy 8 tank destroyers.

												The game is good for exciting, fast skirmishes. About it. The buildup and speed runs slightly faster than that of CoH1. However the game is also far more frustrating. Ever watched as a squad member lagged behind halfway across the map because he couldn't get around a set of sandbags? Or a squad that literally can't see anything because of a couple of trees around it due to ""truesight""? Or a heavy flak gun become half useless because of two trees it can't destroy after two dozen shells? Thanks Relic for spending all your time on DLCs and not fixing basic gameplay problems.I don't have as much issue with the DLC commanders as most people. Even some of the basic commanders are great to use. The part that's annoying is that you can't use some of the cooler units in the game without paying for certain commander DLCs, nor can you access certain counter-strategies without them. For example if you enjoy playing Soviets but wish you had T-34-85s to counter the standard german Panzer V Panther... well too bad, go grab a DLC.The campaign plays like Hollywood propaganda from the Cold War. Where are the great tank battles of Kursk? The marshland penetrations of Bagration? The high altitude combat in the Caucausus, especially the highest elevation fight at Refuge of the 11? The assault on the Sevastapol coastal batteries? Even the climatic bridge meeting between the two pincers of Stalingrad? Nah. Forgot all these cool mission ideas. Let's just focus on making the brainless slavic horde look at bad as possible against their heroic Wehrmacht foes.			"

												Has the frame work of a decent game, building of the first, however seems to have taken several steps in a bad diretion. The campaign is fairly standard for games set in the era, but plays out fairly well, unit response times and where they choose to go can be frustrating, moving to stand infront of the cover you sent them too if you dont carefully move your cursor around to see where they will all go forr example. But these arn't game breaking issues really.The main issues come when you have completed the campaign, skirrmish maps are very restrictive, you are limited to a low population cap with no options of changing and your choice of units feels very small, while there are some standard units for both sides some of the more fun ones and any of the abilities are locked to commanders, so you're unlikely to be able to field a selection of your favorite units at the same time. There are also many commanders that cost money, at a pretty high price tag for what you get. Not to mention units like the tiger or some artillerey pieces come with their own high population cost (nearly a 1/4 of your total). Along with commanders, colour patterns for your tanks and faceplates you can also pay for added misson packs. Don't. Most of these missions aren't even missons they are lazy attempts, basically a skirmish game you could set up yourself. while therer are one or two actual scripted missons like the campaign they are no where near worth the price tag to unlock. Over all I'd give this game a 3/10, which makes me sad given afew changes and less DLC it would have been in my top games to play.			"

												This is a horrible game! COH2 sucks so bad! The gameplay is horrible and it is very annoying. Your troops are so weak that even though you outnumber the enemies or have veterancy, they still end up dying. WTH?! There is also lack of resources. You barely have enough to buy more men or vehicles. The generals in the game are also annoying. Especially when your units die all the time, generals always tell you they die. General obvious. The game wants to be realistic but it's horrible. It ended up being unbalanced and troops always end up dying so easily. The beta was a bit more realistic and plays better at times. Though the beta is still horrible too. This is regardless of MP or SP. The good things are the graphics, improved some gameplay elements, and that's about it. The whole game revolves around the annoying and horrible gameplay. COH1 was so much better and more fun. This game is annoying and not very fun. Money wasted on this poor game. Nothing against Russians but in the game, they should be more powerful or balanced. I'll rather settle for Germans, which seems to retain traditional gameplay and a bit more powerful and more resources. Generally, this game is mediocore and annoying. I will be playing more of COH1. COH1 over COH2 any day. 7/10.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 sees new content added to the CoH series as well as a few differences in gameplay that are good ideas, but overall everything could have been improved upon. For starters the field of view they implimented where soldiers cannot see over headges taller than them or through buildings, can create the oppertunitity for a great sneak attack and defence in a game. HOWEVER the same field of view does NOT apply for TANKS and other vehichles.... Umm hello? do these tank crews see through armour plaiting? why are there vision slits in the game if the crew cannot see only out of those vision slits unless the commander ""turns out"" in the tank. There are more examples of great ideas/changes that could have been better or just failed completley but I would be here all day writting this review, but I am not going to because chances are you wouldnt read the whole thing anyway.DL MOTHER F***ING C|_|_____________| DLCs such as ardennes assault (which should have been with the american DLC) as well as commanders/skin packs/all that other pay ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that should have been in the game to start with. MONEY MAKING TO THE MAX!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am supprised the dont make you pay for a DLC that lets you implement the damn workshop into the game (fingers crossed they arnt working on that)As  diehard fan of CoH since I played the original back on my old PC I would really love to see this game series continue. BUT with more considerations for the fans. To make a game that we will love the way they used to be made. WITH ALL THE CONTENT IN THE GAME. I would love to give this a thumbsup because I do love to play this game but it is for that reason alone that I cannot.Please think about this for CoH 3.... if there is going to be one...p.s I do not own a steam version of CoH 1 which is why I do not have it in my steam library, however, I do have the original boxed version and have played numerous hours of the game (honestly I played so much I couldnt tell you how many hours I played [thats what steam is for ;) ] From online to single player I played the **** outta that game.

												Before reading just so you know I tend to prefer playing RTS games with friends cooperatively than against anyone so I play skirms against bots since I don't find being competative very fun. So my opinion is limited with respect to online play against others.Short Version:    Pros:Still a tactical war game.Includes hazards from the environment.Fog of war is only revealed by line of sight.    Cons:Way to much of it is DLC, and DLC is too expensive for what little you get.Coop Scenarios are no different from skirmishes with restrictions.Units just don't feel as useful as they were in other games.I just don't find it as fun.Before someone thinks it I definitely don't claim to be at all good at this game, or at any RTS really, but I find it pretty easy to find a game that I'm mediocre or even♥♥♥♥♥♥at fun to play and this just isn't one of them. To be honest if a friend didn't buy this for me I doubt I'd have managed to find enough good in it to own it right now.Compared to the first game I think this one improved very little. The ability to have your sight blocked by buildings, being limited by the cold weather, and being able to shoot the ice to sink tanks as a means of clearing them out quickly are nice additions but that's about it for me. The new units just don't feel as versatile or as useful as they were in the first one. Also I personally find the bulletins next to useless since something you'd really one like recharge on the katyusha since it can only attack with it's ability or more accuracy for AT guns seem unavailible and even if they are they're usually 2-4% difference which is hard to notice unless you use them excessively in your strategy.The most frustrating part of this game is everything they added they seemed to have flipped a coin to see if they should put a select of a purchase button under it. So much of the content is actually DLC, there are loads more commanders to choose from but 80% of them are gated. And the thing is it's not even reasonably priced, single commanders for $5 each, useless cosmetic stuff like tank skins or faceplates for your nametag are $3 or so. As of writing this half the scenarios in the theatre of war are bought seperately.For those who occationally play bots with friends or coop scenerios I'll say this. The coop scenerios are a joke, they are just a pre set skirmish with some dialog and restrictions tossed in (You can't use units that weren't availible before the that time period). If you're really lucky they'll have a mechanic added such as only one of the two can use tanks while the other can only use infantry, or you get extra resources if you're outcapped but that's pretty rare. Largely they're just skirmishes where the army and map is already set out. Also the bots difficulty scales weirdly in my opinion. One difficulty they'll feel like they don't do anything but the one above it will have them set on horde mode somehow sending constant streams at you.Lastly the RNG in this game kicks the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. This game like the first one has a general radius where your shots land, so shooting a tank with a tank will be easy but it may miss smaller targets like infantry, but this doesn't seem to apply to bots as much. I've had them killed my snipers multiple times with a single shot with an AT gun (actually seems to happen everytime i try to snipe off the AT crew), my scout cars machine guns will be hitting nearby butterflys while theirs so much as looks at my infantry and half my unit is dead. Additionally I'll stick my units in good cover and still lose a fire fight against an enemy unit of the same type standing in the open. A single enemy rocket barrage clears out my garrisons. Mortar troops managing to nearly destroy an entire unit with perfect shots. etc...			"

												This game started off with real promise.. it seemed like it was going to be a great sequel. Then patch after patch it fell so short of its predecessor. This game is a real time strategy that is trying to be league of legends. Focused around a small number of small sized units engaging in skirmishes. World War II was anything but small skirmishes, especially along the eastern front where millions of soldiers and armored units engaged in all out war. This game is nothing but a money trap, and shows just how much this company has sold out. I would recommend buying company of heroes 1 over this game anyday. CoH1 is an outstanding game to this day, and is leaps and bounds better than this piece of garbage even today.			"

I will continue to play it. The community have been busy fixing the developers mistakes and adding in all the bits that theyve forgotten. Its good fun, the graphics and sounds are brilliant, and it plays well. However. Because of the sheer mind bogling array of DLC the company has released alongside the game, I cannot recommend it. I have purchased a lot of it, and it never seems worth it. Buy the base game when it's on special, but dont fall for the same mistake I did and spend money filling their coffers with coin when DLC shouldnt be rewarded.			"

												Dear Would-be-Player, It is possible that this incarnation of Company of Heroes will work on your computer without crashing repeatedly and severely as it has on mine. It is possible that you will get great enjoyment out of the relatively few components of the game that you get when you lay your money down for the game, for the relatively few minutes or maybe even a few hours before it either hangs or crashes your computer. You may be happy to keep paying for DLC's. Perhaps your computer is the latest and greatest model, one that can handle the idiosyncracies of this game design instead of a gaming laptop computer that was the envy of many players just a few years ago, with its ATI mobility Radeon HD4670 that easily coped with other demanding titles. But not this one, not CoH2. Perhaps the game won't potentially damage your computer. Maybe you are a mellow soul who does not feel troubled to be told that ""Your remedy for dissatisfaction with the game software or any products, content, or other information made available by or through SEGA, is to stop using the software."" I wish you luck, and the hours of enjoyment I have not had the pleasure of. I wish you the (relatively) innocent war-game player satisfaction - while I try to refrain from wishing afflictions such as herpes simplex, STD's, lice, excema and hairy warts on those who write such self serving EULA ""agreements"" and design games like these in such a shoddy and money grubbing manner. I shall uninstall it from this computer and try it on my newer work computer and hope it doesn't cause that to also crash repeatedly. If it does so, my wishes upon the Sega game designers  are sure to be rather more extravagant! All I will say right now is that I do not feel my dissatisfaction to be in any way remedied ......			"

I loved it so much I busted my @ss trying to download several mods like the famed Blitzkrieg mod. I hoped for an even better experience with the sequel, but I was let down to find out that it had been ruined by DLC, poor design choices and overall f**kups by the developers. It wasn't fun anymore. I didn't bother buying the DLC as I didn't want to promote the devs for their stupid decisions. I still only play COH 1 to this day and every time I try give COH 2 another chance, I'm swiftly reminded why I uninstalled it.Want to play Company of Heroes?

I got this in a Humble Bundle, so the cards probably make up the portion I paid for it, but I was disappointed to find that I'd essentially bought a platform without even the smallest campaign to get me into the game. My only option after a very mechanistic game tutorial was AI or online playing, or online paying. Or card farming, which is what I did.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't for a few reasons. The single player campaign isn't very good. Definitely not as good as the first game's. I found the Theater of War missions more interesting than the campaign. The multiplayer is ruined by the fact that most of the Commanders have to be bought and they aren't cheap. Relic is charging for stuff like this is a free to play game. It really is disgusting. Technically you can unlock the Commanders by playing matches and getting War Spoils, but in reality those almost never drop.			"

												This Review is from the Singleplayer Campaign and its Storyline.Not as great as COH1 and its expansions. Also don't bother with the comments about the controversy it will burn your eyes and melt you with angry monkeys everywhere in thier chairs typing if you read the comments around the internet about it.Red alert 1 another RTS Did better with the Soviet Campaign (the RA series became cartoony later in its sequels though)I didn't like Call of Duty 2 Modern warfare and the airport mission. I Skipped that though *sips his drink* take that COD Kids.Watching the campaign in youtube and reading the angry comments and the ""so called historical accurate whatever it means"" has made me think ofSpec Ops: the line which tears apart Battlefield and Call of duty's storylines and its cliches.Sure Red alert the russians attacked a village and thats in mission one! (The teddy bear makes me cry as im typing this)but thats in an Alternate Timeline and not in WWIIDude why are you comparing this to other games like Spec Ops? now you want me talk about Fallout and War, War never changes? or now about WWII Medal of Honor or Brothers in Arms. Just look at Dune II or Starcraft instead then.Look at Sniper elite V2's story and go watch Yahtzee croshaw's Look on it. it' offends me as an Historical reasearcher like God of War did with it's mythology and it's mystical creatures and messing them up and getting it wrong. THE STORY: Im not happy with this man :(You play as an Unlikeable Dude and Commands his Comrades without a Rifle. That was done in WWI Not II They say.They machinegun the cowards that they are thier own. Because we waste ammo on Cowards. And Commanders and Officers being big bad baddies that do no good.Okay Look at the Ammericans in COH1. Then the British in the Expansion. Even the Germans gets the sympathy in the campaign at thier Expansion while being No nos.Did the Allies did any ""War Crime?"" I like to see that somewhere else but not in this with it's execution its makes you not care that much really yes really with the Terrible Movies characters in thier Bad WWII Movies. Made me like an bad person but WWII Was an horrible thing and i will not talk about this. but okay part two mission two hop hop.Russia go protect village from Germans. Commander go drink lots of and lots of poisoned Vodka and goes ""*Hic* go burn dah houses commrades!"" and one smart Russian soldier said ""But sir. There are people in there!"" But no says the Drunken Commander he said this ""No! Go burn dah houses i don't care * hic*"" he then shot the poor smart soldier in the head and they go burn the houses with people in them. Then he said ""Go burn the hay field *hic* *drinks another Vodka*"" but another said ""But sir. Nikolai is playing with the hay! hes looking for the needle comrade!"" But no again it is said. The Dumb Drunken Commander shot him and they burn the fields with every soldier taking cover there. then they dumped thier troops and bombed the bridge. *clap clap*Hoo hoo it gets worse. skipping part 3 and 4. ""Patroling the Wastes makes you wish for Nuclear Winter""Heres Misson 5The Unlikeable dummy makes a dumb speech and said ""Heyyyy why not we shot each other and let the germans win?""   *cough cough cough* and some group of some random in don't know these sameish comrades said ""uhh okay but we advance and uuhhhh ran away and get shot by you."" because they are just thrown in there like ragdolls in GMOD.Part 6 Mission 6Mr Jerkface swoops in enemy territory with troops and found something for winning but Bad luck... Tank patrol and tank fired at the dumb dumb and survived and hes at the rumbles. but luck got him and hes not caught by the germans because poof! its magical that the Germans where focusing with the Russians but he didn't get caught at all!?His Troops saved the Jerkface and returned to the Drunken Commander who drinks lots and lots of Vodka! the drunk man shot Jerky jerk's friend (as i say) because we need less troops cause they no good what about winning?I Don't care anymore about the Story i quit. RA1&2 Did better with the soviets and i even think about Spec Ops: The line and it's about an american soldier who gotten alot trouble and became an enemy from his own and caused alot of unwanted deaths of hostile american soldiers and civilians.  Red Alert 1 in other hands was serious but RA2 Was not. But Tesla Coils and Mass Mammoth Tanks And Teleportation called Chrono something was goofy and cool. And the Soviet ending has a twist at the end. They were evil in Red alert 1 but despite that. Red alert 2 was a bit more goofy and funny.""History is written by the observer. Propaganda is written by the victor."" -THIEF: Deadly Shadows4.5/10 -Story could had been done beter. good premise. bad execution in my point of view wasted a good plot. unlikeable characters and the russian soldiers could had sympathy too but no wasted too.  :(Graphics-in sort but okay.Menu looks cool but the ingame cinematics look not as good as the COH1 did moving on. 7/10Gameplay-fun is always fun! is it?I Thinks it's better a bit than COH1. Otherwise it looks the same but the market is full of shooters and RTS is a bit rare.Only Singleplayer Gameplay 6/10 minus the awful storyOkay im done i think. My brother bought this and i watched him play looked nice like the COH1 Did but metacrtic did made me smile in a sarcastic way but hearing about the story made me a bit unwell. I Could write a better storyline for this game than the writers did. but i don't have the skills to do so. but i feel just sad about this i really do.After seeing the fourms in steam and gaming sites comments about COH2's Hate Among Russian Players. It's just a plague of stupidity and fantastic way for trolls and angry angry monkeys jumping on thier computers about it. Fan or Patriot or a Russian man No im just a person who enjoys watching HBO. Playing Video games. Watching YouTube. Running around the Web. it just makes me sad Looking at this story taking this and taking it to Eleven and done horribly to those that fought for thier countries. Americans. British and France, Canada even Asia in the Pacific War did War Crimes in WWII.Just Look at Wikipedia please at WWII War Crimes but you can ask WWII Veterans or Read a Book about it in your hands instead.Thanks alot i will go back and watch Enemy at the Gate and compare it to Saving Private RyanAnd then go back and restart Spec Ops the Line or Medal of honor or WWII COD and then Play Red alert 1 again or BetterPLAY Company of Heroes 1 Single Player and it's ExpansionsSCORE 6.9/10 Company of Villians 2. There is no Good in this Story. Why is it called Heroes if i see no good whats the point?			"

												After playing several matches and completing the campaign on medium difficulty, I have to say its not worth it. I loved CoH... but this, this is a sham. first off only 2 armies to choose from (without DLC) that being russians and germans. Secondly if you actually liked the game and want more (my god theres more) you can buy it. like a 2nd campaign $40 please..... like bugger off. $10 sure or even $15 (or $20 would be pushing it) But $40...... you've got to be joking.I enjoyed bits and pieces of it. I really did. But I think that was because of my love for CoH (that being the first game)for the amount of content it just really is not worth it. Go buy the first CoH and its DLC all up probably less then $30 and it has 6 times the amount of content and fun just looks a little older and i do mean only a little.			"

												Could not finish the tutorial owing to a bug. Asked me to left-click to start artillery fire, but that didn't do anything. The camera was locked and the tutorial was scripted so I couldn't do anything until I finished that part. Appears to be decent RTS where you control a small number of units which gain veterancy and can pick up upgrades. Beginning of the game appears heavily scripted, with not much in terms of interesting alternate ways of defeating the enemy. Expect the community maps and other maps further along allows more interesting strategy options. Like the cover system so far, with little dots telling you where your troops will end up. Unfortunately, the send-to-cover system appears to be agnostic to the direction of incoming fire. Half your troops on the wrong side of cover quite often unless you keep looking for the one cover option where all are on the right side.			"

												I wanted to love this game. Being a huge fan of the original Company of Heroes the idea of sequel with new game mechanics and units made my heart flutter. I watched videos with the developers talking about ice shelves being destructible, having to build fires so you troops don't freeze to death, adding a fog of war with snowstorms and all sorts of really amazing stuff.What they didn't tell you though, was that they were going to dumb down the game to lowest common denominator. In the original your play style could be complimented by each DISTINCTIVE army. Don't like to muddle around with different unit types and blast the enemy constantly? Cool, we've got some Panzer Elite for you. Are you a turtle and want to play a Sim-City RTS? Great, got a Brit army right over here. CoH2 plays the same no matter who you play as and you are forced to play offensively. Defenses are ineffective and troops between armies indistinguishable, more or less.  The icing on the cake of disappointment comes with the DLC. If you want a little variety in your dull game it can be purchased one small piece at a time. Way to milk a mediocre product for more money that I should have never spent in the first place.  "

Posted: December 2, 2013
												My initial review was after about 20 hours of gameplay and I have since decided to change that review now that I have near 100 hours logged.  From the start this game falls flat on its face due to the outrageous price and loaded DLC that Relic claims is for ""continued support"".  What a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Never until this decade has DLC gotten so out of control.  Companies out there that make games with no DLC charge less for some of their games and patch them for years afterwards.  But, enough about the horrendous business model that has lost my money and more about the game.     Company of Heroes 2 takes what the 1st one did and makes it bland.  No longer are you able to approach a situation from multiple vectors of possibilities and are now forced to be aggressive.  Trench wars, defensive positions, and the general concept of holding a point and inching forward no longer exists unless you build a custom map with a specific choke point that is designed to do just this.  Commanders do very little other than offer a few units that you can't build or offer some weapons you normally wouldn't get.  Don't think for an instant this is a direct equivalent to the doctrines in the first CoH because it isn't, not even by a long shot.  T-34 85s are called in units and not build versus the 76s that are built.  Tigers are called in and not built.  Population is capped at 100 unless you manually change it in the map editor.  No V1 rockets or other cool special abilities like calling in a King Tiger, JagdPanther, Pershing Tank, etc.  Just a few fragmentation bombing runs, and plane strafes with some other abilities like camo, tank smoke, etc.     The game does do well graphically, I will give it that but I do not believe that is anyhwere near sufficient to call this a second game.  Sounds are just as realisitic as they were in the first one but pathfinding seems to never have been improved.  I guess they wanted to focus on vaulting over sandbags and walls instead of fixing critical issues from a game that suffered the same issues 7 years ago.  Buying barbed wire cutters for engineers because they don't come with them, you know....cause engineers don't work in situations like that...or something.....       I really hate to fill a review with constant negatives so I will put a few of the things that this games does manage to do well.  First, I like the concept that Germans and Russians can play on the same team.  This slightly alters the single strategy concept that this game has embedded into its core.  I also like that you can repair bridges if they are partially damaged instead of waiting until it is completely gone.  Another great aspect of this game is that the physics have been improved.  Tanks feel more like tanks as they rock when they shoot and get hit and actually have a reverse button so you arn't spam clicking or queueing your tank backwards like you had to in the first installment.  Finally, capping points by standing near them is great.  I no longer have to make sure my units are capping, all I have to do is get them within the area of effect for it to begin capturing.     Unfortunately, that is really all I can think of that makes the game look decent.  All of the improper balancing due to a new and whiny community is holding this game back.  I wish Relic would just balance the game as they see fit, it worked great for the first installment.  Gamers are entirely to whiny and shed tears when something doesn't go their way, but then again that is the way most my country is.  People will whine because they can't play, don't understand a concept, or simply just don't get their way but a game like this shouldn't be altered because of those reasons.  Single minded strategy, a massively cheating AI, and horrendous balancing with laregely missing content make this game a no purchase unless you are either bored or get it during a massive sale, and by massive I mean 75% or more.  Do yourself a favor, don't get burned.			"

												Probably the worst strategy game I've ever played. How can it be that losing three tanks against one infantry squad. And there are not even far enough troup points. Why do I need 12 troup points for a tank which only need 3 people in it to use?!And you can't upgrade most tanks anymore (like with an MG on top). If you want to play a ww strategy game you should propbaly buy the first one (COH 1 with extension). There you also got a lot more varieties (US, Commonwealth, German, German Tank elite). They remove very cool stuff which was available in the first game. Like the artillery (Commonwealth --> 25 Pounder Gun Howitzer. I really loved that one :)).And for the first part there are plenty of mods an maps available. Much more fun and much more possibilities. (And the graphic is as good as it is in the second part).Also the matchmaking system got under my skin. why the ***** can't there be a lobby, where you can see a list of open matches. I can only start a autosearch and furthermore I can't even decide if I want to play in the match they found for me. I will be droped in immediately. The only chance to get out of it is by capitulation. AWESOME!!!!! Totally loving it.			"

												DO NOT BUY. I have hundreds of hours of playtime in this game and I can tell you that it`s not worth it. The game is terribly optimized, terribly balanced (snipers are incredibly OP and there is no counter to them) and the business model is the final nail in the coffin. Since they try to milk the cash through the sale of additional commanders (who possess additional units and abilities), the core (non-commander) unit pool is pretty poor and the game lacks strategic depth.The only reason that could justify the purchase is the fact that there are no good RTS games nowadays. So if you are an RTS fan and you need your fix there aren`t many options and I wouldn`t blame you. You`ve been warned though.			"

Also, for the people who complain about prices and what not, do research. you can find third party pc marketplaces on the internet to buy games and dlc for cheap.			"

												Company of Heroes was one of the best strategy games ever made. Let be straight on this! This game is not better then Company of heroes 1. Company of heroes 2 is a good game but dont live to the legacy from the first game. Company of heroes 2 when it came out felt like the game is unfinish, with only 2 armys, some maps and some tweeks in the gameplay. They realase the game unfinish for you next buy loads of DLCs to complete the game. Its kinda like the sims 3 with the sims 4, you have sims 3 completed with all can you imagina and next they launch sims 4 unfinish for next lanch a bunch of DLCs to complete game. Company of heroes 2 is the same thing. This game still Company of heroes but misses lot of stuff from the first game. The gameplay is identical with some tweeks, 2 armays and new maps. What i hated about this game is the m,ain game only have 2 annoying armys for you listen all the time! Its germans and russians, always speak russian and german all the time... You cant understand nothing. This game is also hard and the friendly IA somethings is really dumb can make you really angry lol. But overall the game is good but not as good as the first one. If you like the first one you will like this one. But be aware this game needs a lots of DLCs for you enjoy it a lot! Because you get stuck only with main game you will get bored like hell... And listen that russian? Man is really annoying. Review: 8/10			"

												As a Company of Heroes ""veteran"", I understand how the game is played or should be played. I call myself a ""veteran"" not because I am fantastically amazing at the game because I'm not. I call myself a veteran because I have played almost everything Company of Heroes related. I played Company of Heroes 1, Company of Heroes Online (when it was still active), all of the expansions to Company of Heroes 1, and Company of Heroes 2. I have yet to get the Ardennes Assault DLC though I do have the Western Front Armies pack. From my experinces on Company of Heroes 1, the game can get very competitive. But it's not a right competitiveness. The competition someone will face in Company of Heroes Multiplayer is one that will only irritate you and make you want to sling your computer out of the window from the frustration that will follow. Why so much irritation and frustration you may ask? It isn't because that people play right and fair. It's because nobody does anything original. Every match you enter, you will be facing someone who will more than likely do one of three things. 1: They wil spam non-stop throughout the entirity of the match. 2: They will spam Commander abilities in your base non-stop. 3: They will do both of the above. Now these ""tactics"" that I have listed are moer relevant to Company of Heroes 2 that Company of Heroes 1 because Commander abilities in Company of Heroes 1 were much more limited and much more expensive and harder to spam due to map design for resources. But as a personal experience from a Company of Heroes 2 match, I counted that my opponent used the IL-2 Gun Strafe a grand total of 28 times. But if someone were to buy this game, I would suggest they only fight AI battles and play the campaign. Anyone who does that will have more fun than anyone who attempts to fight others in multiplayer. In my personal opinion, the campaign for Company of Heroes 2 was a great story but some of the missions were ridiculously hard because of what you are given to fight with. Overall, I would rate the campaign a 7/10 just because of the sheer impossibility of some missions. Compared to Company of Heroes 1's campaign, Company of Heroes 2's campaign added more of a personal face to a different side of the war. Company of Heroes 1's campaign gave a great history of how World War II unfolded on the Western Front. Now multiplayer, I would rate about 4/10 just because of the people who play on it. AI battles would be a 9/10 just because the AI progressively advances the longer the match lasts. The overall game of Company of Heroes 2, however, I would rate a 6/10 with everything mixed together. Though multiplayer on Company of Heroes 2 has made me more angry than Call of Duty (which enrages me nearly every time I play) at times, the game is a definate improvement over Company of Heroes 1 in game-play effects and balancing and new play styles that came from the addition of True Sight. But all in all, this game is only for someone who enjoys playing with friends because playing with strangers is out of the question.			"

												Greetings,    I have been playing company of heros 2 for several months now, Recently reaching my 500 hour mark. The game is fantastic if you enjoy strategy and rts games in general. While many people are upset with balance issues etc. i feel that the game for the most part balanced. Every side has a over powered unit or 2 but every unit has a weakness. It is all about countering.  The games graphics are beautiful and the little details that are hidden are nice. The campaign was fun and kept me busy for a bit. The dlc might seem greedy on relics part but i own all of them and have enjoyed it all. I highly recommend this game. Would also recommend some blood pressure meds to go with it.			"

												After playing several matches and completing the campaign on medium difficulty, I have to say its not worth it. I loved CoH... but this, this is a sham. first off only 2 armies to choose from (without DLC) that being russians and germans. Secondly if you actually liked the game and want more (my god theres more) you can buy it. like a 2nd campaign $40 please..... like bugger off. $10 sure or even $15 (or $20 would be pushing it) But $40...... you've got to be joking.I enjoyed bits and pieces of it. I really did. But I think that was because of my love for CoH (that being the first game)for the amount of content it just really is not worth it. Go buy the first CoH and its DLC all up probably less then $30 and it has 6 times the amount of content and fun just looks a little older and i do mean only a little.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't for a few reasons. The single player campaign isn't very good. Definitely not as good as the first game's. I found the Theater of War missions more interesting than the campaign. The multiplayer is ruined by the fact that most of the Commanders have to be bought and they aren't cheap. Relic is charging for stuff like this is a free to play game. It really is disgusting. Technically you can unlock the Commanders by playing matches and getting War Spoils, but in reality those almost never drop.			"

												This Review is from the Singleplayer Campaign and its Storyline.Not as great as COH1 and its expansions. Also don't bother with the comments about the controversy it will burn your eyes and melt you with angry monkeys everywhere in thier chairs typing if you read the comments around the internet about it.Red alert 1 another RTS Did better with the Soviet Campaign (the RA series became cartoony later in its sequels though)I didn't like Call of Duty 2 Modern warfare and the airport mission. I Skipped that though *sips his drink* take that COD Kids.Watching the campaign in youtube and reading the angry comments and the ""so called historical accurate whatever it means"" has made me think ofSpec Ops: the line which tears apart Battlefield and Call of duty's storylines and its cliches.Sure Red alert the russians attacked a village and thats in mission one! (The teddy bear makes me cry as im typing this)but thats in an Alternate Timeline and not in WWIIDude why are you comparing this to other games like Spec Ops? now you want me talk about Fallout and War, War never changes? or now about WWII Medal of Honor or Brothers in Arms. Just look at Dune II or Starcraft instead then.Look at Sniper elite V2's story and go watch Yahtzee croshaw's Look on it. it' offends me as an Historical reasearcher like God of War did with it's mythology and it's mystical creatures and messing them up and getting it wrong. THE STORY: Im not happy with this man :(You play as an Unlikeable Dude and Commands his Comrades without a Rifle. That was done in WWI Not II They say.They machinegun the cowards that they are thier own. Because we waste ammo on Cowards. And Commanders and Officers being big bad baddies that do no good.Okay Look at the Ammericans in COH1. Then the British in the Expansion. Even the Germans gets the sympathy in the campaign at thier Expansion while being No nos.Did the Allies did any ""War Crime?"" I like to see that somewhere else but not in this with it's execution its makes you not care that much really yes really with the Terrible Movies characters in thier Bad WWII Movies. Made me like an bad person but WWII Was an horrible thing and i will not talk about this. but okay part two mission two hop hop.Russia go protect village from Germans. Commander go drink lots of and lots of poisoned Vodka and goes ""*Hic* go burn dah houses commrades!"" and one smart Russian soldier said ""But sir. There are people in there!"" But no says the Drunken Commander he said this ""No! Go burn dah houses i don't care * hic*"" he then shot the poor smart soldier in the head and they go burn the houses with people in them. Then he said ""Go burn the hay field *hic* *drinks another Vodka*"" but another said ""But sir. Nikolai is playing with the hay! hes looking for the needle comrade!"" But no again it is said. The Dumb Drunken Commander shot him and they burn the fields with every soldier taking cover there. then they dumped thier troops and bombed the bridge. *clap clap*Hoo hoo it gets worse. skipping part 3 and 4. ""Patroling the Wastes makes you wish for Nuclear Winter""Heres Misson 5The Unlikeable dummy makes a dumb speech and said ""Heyyyy why not we shot each other and let the germans win?""   *cough cough cough* and some group of some random in don't know these sameish comrades said ""uhh okay but we advance and uuhhhh ran away and get shot by you."" because they are just thrown in there like ragdolls in GMOD.Part 6 Mission 6Mr Jerkface swoops in enemy territory with troops and found something for winning but Bad luck... Tank patrol and tank fired at the dumb dumb and survived and hes at the rumbles. but luck got him and hes not caught by the germans because poof! its magical that the Germans where focusing with the Russians but he didn't get caught at all!?His Troops saved the Jerkface and returned to the Drunken Commander who drinks lots and lots of Vodka! the drunk man shot Jerky jerk's friend (as i say) because we need less troops cause they no good what about winning?I Don't care anymore about the Story i quit. RA1&2 Did better with the soviets and i even think about Spec Ops: The line and it's about an american soldier who gotten alot trouble and became an enemy from his own and caused alot of unwanted deaths of hostile american soldiers and civilians.  Red Alert 1 in other hands was serious but RA2 Was not. But Tesla Coils and Mass Mammoth Tanks And Teleportation called Chrono something was goofy and cool. And the Soviet ending has a twist at the end. They were evil in Red alert 1 but despite that. Red alert 2 was a bit more goofy and funny.""History is written by the observer. Propaganda is written by the victor."" -THIEF: Deadly Shadows4.5/10 -Story could had been done beter. good premise. bad execution in my point of view wasted a good plot. unlikeable characters and the russian soldiers could had sympathy too but no wasted too.  :(Graphics-in sort but okay.Menu looks cool but the ingame cinematics look not as good as the COH1 did moving on. 7/10Gameplay-fun is always fun! is it?I Thinks it's better a bit than COH1. Otherwise it looks the same but the market is full of shooters and RTS is a bit rare.Only Singleplayer Gameplay 6/10 minus the awful storyOkay im done i think. My brother bought this and i watched him play looked nice like the COH1 Did but metacrtic did made me smile in a sarcastic way but hearing about the story made me a bit unwell. I Could write a better storyline for this game than the writers did. but i don't have the skills to do so. but i feel just sad about this i really do.After seeing the fourms in steam and gaming sites comments about COH2's Hate Among Russian Players. It's just a plague of stupidity and fantastic way for trolls and angry angry monkeys jumping on thier computers about it. Fan or Patriot or a Russian man No im just a person who enjoys watching HBO. Playing Video games. Watching YouTube. Running around the Web. it just makes me sad Looking at this story taking this and taking it to Eleven and done horribly to those that fought for thier countries. Americans. British and France, Canada even Asia in the Pacific War did War Crimes in WWII.Just Look at Wikipedia please at WWII War Crimes but you can ask WWII Veterans or Read a Book about it in your hands instead.Thanks alot i will go back and watch Enemy at the Gate and compare it to Saving Private RyanAnd then go back and restart Spec Ops the Line or Medal of honor or WWII COD and then Play Red alert 1 again or BetterPLAY Company of Heroes 1 Single Player and it's ExpansionsSCORE 6.9/10 Company of Villians 2. There is no Good in this Story. Why is it called Heroes if i see no good whats the point?			"

												Could not finish the tutorial owing to a bug. Asked me to left-click to start artillery fire, but that didn't do anything. The camera was locked and the tutorial was scripted so I couldn't do anything until I finished that part. Appears to be decent RTS where you control a small number of units which gain veterancy and can pick up upgrades. Beginning of the game appears heavily scripted, with not much in terms of interesting alternate ways of defeating the enemy. Expect the community maps and other maps further along allows more interesting strategy options. Like the cover system so far, with little dots telling you where your troops will end up. Unfortunately, the send-to-cover system appears to be agnostic to the direction of incoming fire. Half your troops on the wrong side of cover quite often unless you keep looking for the one cover option where all are on the right side.			"

When i search ladder game there is 80% people playing axis and 20% playing allies this shows when you search for game. Why there is more player playing axis you wonder? its because the game is so god damn imbalanced and playing axis just gives you a free win their units is much stronger dealing more dmg having more health compared to allied units.This game is just a waste of money and alot of money you need to pay for everything ingame even for playing multiplayer after you bought the game...

												First of all I bought the game in a store, more specifically, I bought Ardennes Assault thinking that it was something like Tales of Valor, where it was a standalone expansion where I could enjoy a simple skirmish and have the freedom to play however I wanted to besides the campaign. Well, no. Relic and Sega have taken all that out so I pay money (far more what its worth) for...an empty shell. Yes, sucks to be me for not coming on to Steam to read the reviews, but having not played for a long, long time and seeing it in the store, I thought why the hell not. Anyway, it stutters and lags and has some really weird AI. When exiting a garrison, some units exit DIRECTLY into the line of fire even when they entered from the other side of a building. Retreating also has them go directly into the line of fire. Seriously? I'm going to cut it short and say no, this is not an improvement over COH1.			"

I am not a fan of having to purchase more maps, and content just to play the game, was $60 not enough for you Sega/Relic? Instead if you want to play the game with just the other Soviet content you'll shell out another $15, for content that was already made, they just wanted more of your damn money.The story was cardboard, the missions were repetative, and ultimately I went back to playing the original CoH.

												Very unbalanced multiplayer. Clearly overpowered units takes many months to adjust and still havent been adjusted. I liked this game at first but after seeing the imbalances I refuse to play any more and I sure as heck won't buy any dlc.Also Relics zero communication policy means that no insight on future plans are given and never any headsup on planned changes.I've played alot of Dawn of war 2 and altough it took them forever to balance that game, at least they gave out previews on balance changes and communicated more.Can't recommend this game at current state.

												I was waiting for this game for a long time. Compared to the first CoH, it is a terrible game. It is not terrible because it is not the same, but it is terrible because it feels like the game was not made with much thought. There are so many DLCs, and the tech trees for each commander seems so limited, so much of variations on the same theme. The best commanders are only available as ""pay to win"". The matchmaking system is HORRIBLE. Why not just let me screen for games on a browser and join them? Why only let me select one choice for a match, when I may be open to several different types of games? Matchmaking systems should always be optional.The way they changed infantry and vehicle balance also made the game feel much more vehicle focused. Most infantry, even some antitank infantry, don't stand a chance against tanks. They just drop like flies, even under cover (though it might also be the hacking AI). The AT guns are also clunky and require just as much pop cap as a small or medium tank. The AI cheats like crazy for comp stomp games. Example: you cannot field any snipers because they will be killed magically by magic mortars and other freak shots. You can only play certain tactics against the AI, as all the other normal tactics will fail to their horrible hacks (worst than the first one, not even fun, why not put some more thought into AI?). Playing against the computer becomes an exercise in patience, and it is not fun.Even though I spent a pretty penny on this game and a few DLCs, and I really wanted to like this game, I have gone back to CoH original. Good luck to everyone else.			"

												The game itself seems like a fun concept with good graphics and realism but:Most of the game is locked out with purchase/DLC options including all single player campaign content.The tutorial is almost useless.There is apparently no map scrolling and clicking on the minimap to select a different area all the time is tedious and not accurate enough.I played through the single and small tutorial mission and enjoyed the game so far though all it teaches you to do is to move and select an enemy unit to fire on.The next screen was filled with Buy Now! Buy Now! Buy Now! Buy Now! missions... so I clicked to play the single player campaigns and only got two options. I tried Ardennes Assault and saw Purchase... So I went back and clicked the Russian one and got - yes, you guessed it - Purchase... So there's no single player campaign missions included with the game? Strike one and major fail in my opinion.I tried Theatre of War - Battles, Challenges and Co-Op Scenarios - which had 4 options. All of which had Purchase instead of start mission or something useful. Strike two.The only thing left was Online & Skirmish - Automatch vs Players seemed to work, but I had no interest in playing against other players when I really had no idea what I was doing yet. Three strikes.I tried Automatch vs AI but again it was multiplayer vs AI and I wanted to play solo.In my fifth and final attempt to actually play this game I tried Create Custom Game and I was finally able to create a game which had me vs an AI player. I had no idea what I was doing and failed quickly and horribly. I'm done.			"

												It's got a fun tutorial, I guess, I mean it's got absolutely no dialog in it (well it appears it tries to but the text only appears for a frame before disappearing). It kind of explains how to move units and how the combat system works, quickly moving away from RTS basics and how it changes the rules.Skirmishes are kinda fun, though I kinda wish the tutorial had a mission to explain those too.The game, however, does not have a campaign. It has a screen that takes you to the campaign, but instead of a play button, it says ""Purchase""Pressing the purchase button takes you to the steam page, and the steam page says that I can only purchase it as a gift for somebody else. So, yeah, the campaign doesn't exist as far as I'm concerned.On top of that I should have some in game skins, however in the in-game inventory I have nothing. Absolutely nothing. Moreover it appears I can only play as a certain Army, for whatever unexplained reason, and when I click on any of the other armies it takes me to the steam store page again.Mind you I've clicked on purchasing other things from the game menu and it's taken me to DLC lists that are hidden in the depths of steam that imply that the DLC list is much greater than the advertised 4 of them, but even then those are just skin packs. No place to buy the main campaign.I mean, look how long I've played the game... I've already played through ALL the content available, twice.			"

												On the surface CoH2 seems like a pretty decent game but if you're looking for a good multiplayer-RTS then you should get Starcraft 2 still. It's still one of the most balanced games out there. Relic's striving for more players who choose the Allied Forces damages the game-balance tremendously and makes the game incredibly frustrating on multiplayer. If you still want a WW2 RTS then I'd still suggest the first CoH as it's not that unbalanced. Maybe they'll change it but don't buy the game until that happened.			"

												SPOILER: I'm going to give this game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Keep on reading if you want to know why.I dislike this game strongly not on account of being Russian and have some game writer who have seen one Hollywood movie take a dump on the history of my country. Nor for displaying the Soviet Red Army as a horde of ruthless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ animals who were killed casually by friend and foe (""Enemy At The Gates"", anyone?), hinting at the assumption that the only reason Soviets were able to kick the Germans out of the Soviet Union was because the latter ran out of bullets. Also, Winter. Then again, if you want to learn history, play the Civ series.I dislike this game because of the following: dumb and poorly written dialogues, with cliché lines and stories taken from thin air. I dislike this game because of the language, with a mix of Russian obscenities and ridiculous accents (like ""Red Heat""); either you go all the way and do dialogues in Russian and with English narration, or do it like in Red Alert-series. This language/accent mixture makes me think of parodies on Soviet armed forces from various comedies, action movies from the 80's and 90's and games like ""Red Alert"", which negates this game's attempt at being a serious and challenging RTS about a serious and grave war. Unlike CoH, where dialgoues, speech and general use of spoken langauges were well executed, which gave CoH the perfect mood the creators intended for it, I don't feel passionate about anything or anyone in CoH2, mostly due to the fact that the characters make me think of cartoonish characters.As for the gameplay aspect, well, the perfectly imbalanced forces on both sides are...imbalanced. On one hand you have the OP German forces, on the other - Soviet morons who die like flies from everything, including breathing, apparently. Heck, in CoH I often managed to keep at least one squad alive throughout an entire mission; here, you are lucky if your Soviet squad lives the first 5 minutes of a battle! Even 'elite' forces drop dead for no reason! Which sucks bum on missions where you have to rely on special tactics squads. With this in mind, the intense action and fast pace of the game are more of an annoyance, rather than a pleasant challenge. The Winter missions were an interesting aspect, but, again, with your forces' life expectancy equal to that of a banana in a family of monkeys, restarting these missions from last save time and time again became tedious very fast.As for the performance, I don't get why this game needs more than 15GB of free space; the graphics haven't improved, the cinematics are crappy; what the heck does it use this space for?!In conclusion, I only bought this game because it was on Relic sale on the weekly Humble Bundle, and I won't play it again. I don't care for the graphics, I wanted the story. What I got was crappy dialogues, badly written plot and story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission, irritating gameplay mechanics, and general annoyance every time someone said something (yes, I'm obsessed with language, but then, I'm also a linguist, so shovel it, OK?). This game takes a huge dump on CoH-series. Mods is this game's only hope. What the clucking bell were SEGA and Relic thinking when they released a sequel this bad? And I am not the only one to give the game a scolding review, far from it.Buy it if you have too much empty space on your hard drive or want to revisit the Red Alert universe. Otherwise, you'd be better off with other Relic games.			"

												Over all an ok game, but i felt like I was playing a mod for the first game.Actually the eastern front mod for the first game was a little better IMHO.Tanks are very overpowered in this game though, historically the use of mixed unit tactics was the way to go during world war two, heavy armor without air, artillery and infantry support was dead armor( as the Russians found out the hard way), but this game seems to reward C&C style tank rushes. Also certian tanks can litterally outrun a deployed AT gun THAT IS facing it. And what I mean by this is that if you have a gun facing an enemy tank and they use the magical overdrive ability by the time it takes your men to aim its too late, tanks moved behind your gun and has killed all the men maning it.Too bad game is totally ruined by DLC whoring.

												I think I just bought something that should be a free to play. There are adds everywhere for skinpacks, map packs, mini campaigns, etc. This is why so many people are against DLC. Games like this abuse the DLC system beyond belief. You basically pay for things that should already be in the game, like maps, missions, co-op things, skins, and profile custimization. Your overpaying for small pieces of a game, with a quality and quantity nowhere near its asking price. Its also way overpriced for the vanilla game in general, and I bought this game on sale for less then $20. The $20 I had to spend to just play the very basic piece of this game would be like paying to play a ""free to play"" styled game. I seriously want my money back for this one. Shame considering you'd expect more from this game series... really disapointed.			"

												The original company of heroes series were for a long time my favourite games ever. Somehow all of the charm, smooth play, great feel and depth of CoH has been completely lost. If you enjoyed the first game and it's expansions, stick with them. This is, very sadly, not a good sequel.Map design and pathing are sub-par, the upgrade system unexplained and somewhat un-needed, the in game units are less defined, the graphics are no big upgrade, the AI is completely broken (There is no way that anyone but a CoH veteran will beat the computer on 'standard' difficulty in skirmishes) and there is just a generally disjointed, unfinished, un-polished air to everything. The total opposite to how CoH 1 felt, which is really confusing considering how similar they are.3/10			"

That the German infantry were not able to shoot the broad side of a red barn. 2. That tanks weren't something you would get to build until you were being already being crushed by the other two sides, and even if you do manage to get ""A"" tank expect it to be canned in one to two shots by anything else on the field even on easy while you can have 6 tanks shooting at one of there's and the shells bounce off like BB's.

												A major let down after the first CoH.  Unless of course you fancy playing as infantry only mods. Vehicles have no sense of direction, no ai or anything. For some reason they also refuse to zero length turn resulting in plenty of exposed rear armour whilst your tank performs a perfect 3 point turn.Infantry also lose out badly versus vehicles. Panzerknackers/ bazookas might as well be spitwads and harsh language versus even the lightest of vehicles, meaning that you cannot play infantry all game, you at some point to use vehicles, meaning you end up with the issues above.Like relic did with DOWII, they tried to rewrite one of the games they fell famous for and came up very short			"

												This game has a lot of improvements made from the previous COH in the series, especially the vehicle combat system. The strategy in the game has made it harder to use a single unit-class, forcing players to diversify more and expand their own playstyles. Some don't like it, but I actually welcome the change!I played through the Campaign, and while it was good for a stand-alone story, I can understand how Russians may take offense at it. I read some reviews saying it was a pro-Nazi perspective, making the Russians seem like the bad guys, but when I played it, I didn't get that feeling. The story seemed to have elements of truth in it, but pieces were exaggerated for the sake of cinematography in the game.The best part, however, is the multiplayer. The automatch system was an unusual change from vanilla COH's server-list selection, but after you get familiar with it, it's extremely helpful for getting the game you want to play online. Interestingly, when you start your auotmatch, it shows the percentage of German commanders and Soviet commanders also looking for games. I love this, because if I choose Soviets, but there's already a lot, I'll switch to German in a heartbeat to get into a game faster.I feel the balancing in the game is really good! I don't feel like one side is over-powered in any way, but they do have different playstyles that I love to utilize.Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to a friend. It's fun to play, it's beautiful to watch, and the combat is exhilirating. Worth every penny  I spent!			"

												This game goes against what historians say about what happened in the eastern front and gets it all wrong in the story line, everyting from Order 227 to Scorched Earth policy is potrayed wrongly but it's made by relic and relic is a canadian company. First off Order 227 is potrayed as this order that if soviet troops retreat they will be shot as soon as they make it back to their commander, in real life they would have been shot but only for desertion and they would have been given a warning before they were shot. Second the scorched earth policy is potrayed as an order given by stalin to destroy all buildings and material before retreating from your position, in real life building that wern't occupied by civillians were desginated for destruction and the material was to be used to slow the enemy advance. The only good thing about this game is the gameplay in multiplayer mode. And after this games failed launch were it recived heavy criticisem from eastern europeans, relic soon came out with the western front allies which really is just a new version of company of heroes one. what keeps this game going is the mountain of Steam workshop items that can be downloaded a good amount are good some are bad but there is maps, tuning packs that improve game play or give you diffrent/extra units and win condition where it modifies how you win a match.In world war 2 one shot from a ISU-152 was able to destroy a panzer 4 with one shot in this game a panzer 4's main 75mm gun with standard shell can rip apart a ISU when hitting the frontal armor when a the front armor of a ISU was able to defeat the 75mm shell.The AI DO NOT pay resource cost by this I mean if a machine gun and crew cost 300 man power the AI pays nothing I've been in matchs against AI that 1 minute into the match they have 4 MG's and like 10 squads of infantry where I have like 4 squads and 1 MG and I have spent all man power on these units and you could push the enemy back to their base and they have no resource income but they will still field a bunch of infantry and spawn a heavy tank.

												  This is a game that always surprises you. The checks and balances and counter system works really well. You can have many different strats with the same ""country"", but you can also switch and play as different ""countries"" and try them out. This game is also supported to this day. Steep initial learning curve but trust me, it is worth it. You can also buy one of the standalone DLCs first for a lower price to see if you like it. Dont trust the lower reviews, they are just raging about new patches nerfing some of their OP stuff.     -QUICK POINTS--plentiful workshop mods-still an engaged comun.-better w/ friends-looks good-cheap-in depth map creator			"

												STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNBALANCED NIGHTMAREIf you ever wondered how cool this good-looking game might be... please do yourself a favor and avoid playing this game and spending your hard-earned money the wrooooooong waaaaaaaaay.Where should I start? Well... If you want this game for its core experience (which is ONLINE automatch games) you'll be incredibly frustrated EVERY time you play as the Axis Faction (Germans). If you are one of those guys that likes german tanks from WWII, you'll be better off playing World of Tanks than playing this game. The game is simply UNBALANCED out of proportions, allied infantry is tougher and outnumbers every german infantry squad. Their tanks are always more accurate and hit harder than german's. And oh boy... the artillery barrages from ALL ALLIED FACTIONS are BRUTAL... and german artillery is underpowered.The only way i can recommend you to buy this awfully ruined game is... If you wish to play it as allied factions (Russians, Americans, and Brits) You'll be guaranteed a rewarding experience crushing down your opponents that are stubborn enough to try and out-wit their way to victory... but ultimately ending in a 2/10 pathetic win ratio.

												I bought this game on release few years ago and was really disappointed.They improved physics,lighting and sound but the game lacked the fun of the overall better made COH.With new units and abilities that were released after initial launch of the game made it better.But this company(not of heroes) chose to exploit players instead of exploiting this game possibilities.All that f*&?%$& DLC is a joke and this company is milking this game to the bone.Buy it on sale and don't buy DLC....8$ for a commander? 3$ for a camo pack?

												After I was guilted into o buying this game I was rather sceptical. Then a couple games into it I found myself greatly enjoying the well managed gui and unit control. Head and shoulder above any other WW2 RTS, and the diversity of each faction is amazing. Just don't play online, not because the online is bad, but the AI is so well engineered. Amazing game, well worth every dime I spent.			"

												This is a horrible game! COH2 sucks so bad! The gameplay is horrible and it is very annoying. Your troops are so weak that even though you outnumber the enemies or have veterancy, they still end up dying. WTH?! There is also lack of resources. You barely have enough to buy more men or vehicles. The generals in the game are also annoying. Especially when your units die all the time, generals always tell you they die. General obvious. The game wants to be realistic but it's horrible. It ended up being unbalanced and troops always end up dying so easily. The beta was a bit more realistic and plays better at times. Though the beta is still horrible too. This is regardless of MP or SP. The good things are the graphics, improved some gameplay elements, and that's about it. The whole game revolves around the annoying and horrible gameplay. COH1 was so much better and more fun. This game is annoying and not very fun. Money wasted on this poor game. Nothing against Russians but in the game, they should be more powerful or balanced. I'll rather settle for Germans, which seems to retain traditional gameplay and a bit more powerful and more resources. Generally, this game is mediocore and annoying. I will be playing more of COH1. COH1 over COH2 any day. 7/10.			"

												Has the frame work of a decent game, building of the first, however seems to have taken several steps in a bad diretion. The campaign is fairly standard for games set in the era, but plays out fairly well, unit response times and where they choose to go can be frustrating, moving to stand infront of the cover you sent them too if you dont carefully move your cursor around to see where they will all go forr example. But these arn't game breaking issues really.The main issues come when you have completed the campaign, skirrmish maps are very restrictive, you are limited to a low population cap with no options of changing and your choice of units feels very small, while there are some standard units for both sides some of the more fun ones and any of the abilities are locked to commanders, so you're unlikely to be able to field a selection of your favorite units at the same time. There are also many commanders that cost money, at a pretty high price tag for what you get. Not to mention units like the tiger or some artillerey pieces come with their own high population cost (nearly a 1/4 of your total). Along with commanders, colour patterns for your tanks and faceplates you can also pay for added misson packs. Don't. Most of these missions aren't even missons they are lazy attempts, basically a skirmish game you could set up yourself. while therer are one or two actual scripted missons like the campaign they are no where near worth the price tag to unlock. Over all I'd give this game a 3/10, which makes me sad given afew changes and less DLC it would have been in my top games to play.			"

												This is a good game I will admit that but there are several major issues that drag the game.It has great potential but it has holes that scream to be filled with DLC (and some already have)The game is focused around WW2 during the German invasion of Russia it offers a 14 mission long campaign a skirmish mode against the AI and an active multiplayer base there are 2 sides (unless u buy DLC which adds 2 more:The Oberkommando Wehrmacht and United States Forces)the German Wehrmacht and the USSR each having different strengths and weaknesses the campaign is based around a a Soviet Liutenant named Abraham Ivaskovych (or something along those lines) who was sent to a Gulag for apparent crimes against the state (I won't spoil the story not that there is much to spoil just in case u do buy the game) he is visited by his former officer Churkin (I forget his first name) it brings you from the beginning of the invasion (u play as the USSR in the campaign) to the siege of Berlin the campaign is hard which  is good (I completed it on captain which is basicly normal) the characters however are boring and I couldn't really care less about them The combat is enjoyable and is satisfying when u destroy an enemy unit or an enemy tank u will choose in multiplayer/skirmish a commander during the game which gives u abilities and bonuses these are unlocked by levelling up every time u level up u MIGHT earn ''warspoils'' which are either upgrades eg.one might give ur Grenadiers/Conscripts 3% more accuracy they are very small bonuses and I pay little attention to them as the differences they enact are quite minor the game is a base builder RTS the USSR and Wehrmacht are very different which is obviously good the game unfortunately however does not have good balance the Wehrmacht is clearly better than the USSR and with the DLC the OKW is very superior compared to the USF and Conscripts are too good these are some balancing issuesPros:Enjoyable combatGood resources systemBoth sides are fun to playHard campaignLong campaign Good AIFun multiplayer Cons:Bad balancing (The German factions are superior to the Allied ones and the US are more of a weakness than a strength)Unit strengths are historically innacurate Uninteresting campaign charactersLack of unit variety Many areas that are clearly going to be filled with DLC Tanks are too expensiveOverall I would not reccomend this because even though there are more pros than cons the some cons are too major to be forgiven if u are looking for a great WW2 Base building RTS with a good campaign then I would reccommend the original Company of Heroes it is far superior and I have a positive review for that if u wish to look at it.

												I can only speak for online multiplayer and skirmish games - I haven't even played the solo campaigns once. But for RTS multiplayer fans this game is must have. While its predecessor CoH1 lacks momentum at multiplayer games this game is all about fast teching and hitting. At the very beginning it is quite difficult to gain an understanding in the game mechanics. Furthermore you should not even consider starting a multiplayer games with little or no experience since you will be torn down before you even started playing. I recommend this game if you have some buddies to play with in private games.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is a dynamic Real Time Strategy game based in the european theater of World War 2. At the moment you can play as 5 different factions: the Soviets and the Wehrmacht on the eastern front and on the western front you have the United States Forces, United Kingdom Forces and the Oberkommando West. This game is similar to other RTS games like StarCraft and Age of Empires in the matter that you can build units, construct new base buildings and micro. However this games differs heavily in how resources are collected. Instead of mineral gathers in StarCraft you gain additional resource income from capturing more territory for your team. More territory = more fuel and munitions. Manpower income is all dependant on your army size, larger the army = less income. Munitions in CoH2 is used for numerous upgrades and abilities such as throwing grenades or giving your riflemen BARs and bazookas. You can also use resources for offmap abilities like artillery and flares for vision. Fuel is often the most contested of the resources because the more fuel you have the more frequent you can construct tanks and with higher quality if you wish.CoH2 has 4 different types of PvP game modes, 1v1 2v2 3v3 and 4v4. In my opinion 1v1 is where you see the most intense actions and skill of the highest level. You can see your mistakes when you mess up, and you can see fantastic plays when you outflank your opponet and force retreats.One of the core functions of this game is the ""Retreat"" function. Giving a squad a ""retreat"" command allows them to begin returning to your base and at an accelerated rate but once given it cannot be undone. Retreating squads allows you to retain your squad and its veterancy which in turn allows them to reinforce men they've lost and makes them more effective on the field.""Cover"" in CoH2 is essentially having an object inbetween your forces and your opponets so instead of bullets hitting your men, they hit the object. Different types of cover provide different benefits. No cover provides no bonuses, light cover provides a received accuracy bonus and heavy cover provides both a received accuracy bonus and damage reduction when hit. Negative cover on the other hand which is where your squads are exposed on open terrain such as roads or water provide a received accuracy penalty, meaning your squad will get hit more often. Other types of cover include garrisons which are similar to heavy cover. All these different cover bonuses and penalties have different interactions such as a grenade being thrown into a garrison, or a flamethrower being used against a squad in water. To win a match in CoH2 you need to do 1 of 3 things. Your opponet(s) surrenders the match, you destroy the entire enemy base or you win through Victory Points. Victory Points are additional capture points around the map, usually 3 total to take and hold to drain your opponets of VPs. When your opponet(s) hit 0 VPs the match ends and you have won. Your own VPs hit 0 and you lose.Those are just some of the basic concepts of CoH2 and there is always more to learn and explore with such a dynamic game. Every game is entirely different because in 1 game you may get an early ambush off and wipe a squad quickly and get a major lead. The next game you could have a 50 minute tank slugfest with Tiger 2s and Fireflys.Unfortunatly this game doesn't receive that much love in some areas such as balance and patches due to the smaller community, but the community that exists is very dedicated on playing this game and many players will aid in improvements you can make if you ask.If you're thinking about buying this game I'd highly recommend it, and sales never hurt either. There is quite a few DLC expansions which do add to the game significantly but nearly every Steam sale this game goes on 75% off minimum. Could probably get everything for $20 or less. If you do end up purchasing this game I'd recommend learning from high level players. Youtube holds many shoutcasters who explain details of the game and mechanics. A few of them include: GeneralsGentlemen, tightrope gaming, Helping Hans and The Propagandacast. I watch the first 3 in that list and I can personally say they've all helped me improve my game. Tightrope and Helping Hans both have tutorial videos on their channels which aid greatly in mechanics and tips you can use to up your game.Fair warning though, this game does require significant time to hone skills similar to MOBAs. I believe it is not as severe as that genre on time dedication but it is prominent.Overall its a great game. I can only dream of the game it would be if it had significantly better care. The community is working hard everyday to make it better though so at least one day it'll hopefully be a game worthy of significant remembrance.			"

												Well, after playing CoH for a few years, I can tell you that CoH2 is amazing.I stareted 3 days ago and i already have almost 40 hours, worse than any god damn drug.Anyway, i just want to say something about those ''Pay2win'' comments. They are BS.Game is not pay to win, not at all. Yes, every nation has its own commanders, some you have to earn, some you have to buy, and some you get at the start.The thing i did when i started the game, i tried every nation and just loved absolutely everything about Russians, they fit my style perfectly. So what i did, i then went trough few comanders and found one that i like the most and that i could actually use and have some fun with it. I thought, hmm maybe i shoulde buy it, its only 2.5 euros, should I? YES. And hell yeah i was right, at the momment i played with it i forgot i paid for it, it was so so so much fun.Now, if you want to play with every nation, have every commander and every possible skin, then you will have to pay for it, alot. You can get your commander that you like for 2-3 euros, is not that much money, and you will have alot of fun, and your opponent wont have and advantages over you.If less than 5 euros mean the game is pay to win, then idk what to say.BUT, If you ask me, would i buy the game for its full price, 120 euros ? No thank you. It's expensive as hell, and IMO, the stupidest thing about this game is not the commanders, its 20 god damn DLCs that you cant play without, and its annoying, but if you can wait for a discount, awesome, you wont regret it, i promise you.I got it for about 20 and maybe 23-24 max with commander and its absolutely worth it.I have to say it again, this game is absolutely phenomenal. 11/10			"

												I can't say this game isn't good, I actually found it surprisingly good. But if you want to buy it, just buy the Master Collection when it's on sale. That's how I got it and I wouldn't say it's worth more than the 14€ I payed for it since you have so many things to pay for in game if you want a bigger variety of tactics and units (not including the camo's here which cost a fortune).In short: great game, but Steam sales won't eat your wallet as fast as the game store does.BTW: Single player campaign is pretty much♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to Company of Heroes....you either play as the Russian or the US.

												RTS is probably my weakest genre, so with that in mind, I will mostly just say that I enjoy the game for its detailed and convincing special effects and sound design. It has lots of dramatic gut-wrenching explosions, and there is much fun to be had laying waste to the environment and your opponents alike with heavy mortars and satchel charges. One compelling knock against the game, which I have heard, is the flattening and simplification of the progression system, compared to its predecessor. That is disappointing, because to me, good RTS design is all about that progression, and the complex and interesting ways in which it can lead to a dramatic and often catastrophic crescendo at the end. I think few games do that as well as the classic C&C: Generals.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 gives an experience that few other games give. Where Men of War gives you a more technical picture of the Second World War Company of Heroes gives a cinematic experience that I have seen in few places. The sound of the engines grinding across the terrain, the dirt being kicked up by the treads and the haze generated by artillery bombardments really helps to immerse the player in the world of the Eastern Front. From a mechanical standpoint this game differs little from its predecessor and remains a solid Relic title. I have little time logged into multiplayer but from what I understand the community is a healthy one. If you want an a WWII title that is pleasing to the eye and can give you a truly immersive experience as far as sound design, set pieces to battle over as either the Wehrmacht or the Red Army (There are other factions available if you feel so inclined to purchase the DLC) this game really is a great place to start before you venture further into the WWII RTS genre.

Les graphique sont incroyable pour un je d ce type de plus les unitées sont tres representative de l'histoire, de plus les tactique que nous devons utiliser sont differentes pour chaque armée et c sont les vrai type de tactique que ces mems armées utilisaient. Alors je recommande ce jeu car il est tres realiste, parfait istoriquement, un gameplay d'une grande intensiter et tres tactique.			"

												I can only speak for online multiplayer and skirmish games - I haven't even played the solo campaigns once. But for RTS multiplayer fans this game is must have. While its predecessor CoH1 lacks momentum at multiplayer games this game is all about fast teching and hitting. At the very beginning it is quite difficult to gain an understanding in the game mechanics. Furthermore you should not even consider starting a multiplayer games with little or no experience since you will be torn down before you even started playing. I recommend this game if you have some buddies to play with in private games.			"

I will continue to play it. The community have been busy fixing the developers mistakes and adding in all the bits that theyve forgotten. Its good fun, the graphics and sounds are brilliant, and it plays well. However. Because of the sheer mind bogling array of DLC the company has released alongside the game, I cannot recommend it. I have purchased a lot of it, and it never seems worth it. Buy the base game when it's on special, but dont fall for the same mistake I did and spend money filling their coffers with coin when DLC shouldnt be rewarded.			"

												Dear Would-be-Player, It is possible that this incarnation of Company of Heroes will work on your computer without crashing repeatedly and severely as it has on mine. It is possible that you will get great enjoyment out of the relatively few components of the game that you get when you lay your money down for the game, for the relatively few minutes or maybe even a few hours before it either hangs or crashes your computer. You may be happy to keep paying for DLC's. Perhaps your computer is the latest and greatest model, one that can handle the idiosyncracies of this game design instead of a gaming laptop computer that was the envy of many players just a few years ago, with its ATI mobility Radeon HD4670 that easily coped with other demanding titles. But not this one, not CoH2. Perhaps the game won't potentially damage your computer. Maybe you are a mellow soul who does not feel troubled to be told that ""Your remedy for dissatisfaction with the game software or any products, content, or other information made available by or through SEGA, is to stop using the software."" I wish you luck, and the hours of enjoyment I have not had the pleasure of. I wish you the (relatively) innocent war-game player satisfaction - while I try to refrain from wishing afflictions such as herpes simplex, STD's, lice, excema and hairy warts on those who write such self serving EULA ""agreements"" and design games like these in such a shoddy and money grubbing manner. I shall uninstall it from this computer and try it on my newer work computer and hope it doesn't cause that to also crash repeatedly. If it does so, my wishes upon the Sega game designers  are sure to be rather more extravagant! All I will say right now is that I do not feel my dissatisfaction to be in any way remedied ......			"

												I was looking for a multiplayer RTS that had no resources gathering but still kept strategic and tactical depths. CoH2 ticks all the boxes, with added brilliant graphics and audio to create one intense, immersive experience. Instead of resource gathering you have to capture certain territory points that when held give you the resources you need, such as manpower, munitions or fuel. You are then able to use these resource points to make building upgrades which then allow you to get better units or to upgrade your current units with special abilities. It’s very close to a MOBA actually, but with far more complexity.Concerning the campaign parts, it’s okay, but the game really shines in multiplayer, which by playing the campaigns helps you improve your multiplayer skills. The only negatives I can say about the game is that the tutorial should be better, especially to help people that are more interested in just playing multiplayer, and I almost stopped playing because of not quite knowing how it all worked. Also its mini tactical map, which is used consistently, greatly needs improvement, sometimes being very difficult to see where your units are. The larger tactical map is not practical to use so the mini map is mostly relied on and therefore needs to be clearer. "

												Game is good, as long as it doesn't crash over and over which it will on Radeon 4xxx series cards, I do not recommend buying this game if you own any of these cards as the game will bluescreen with a driver error.This is a known issue from beta which still has not been fixed, AMD attempted a fix with some 13.4 beta drivers but those just postponed the crashing  but did not prevent it. Game still crashes with BSOD on legacy 13.9 drivers.Cannot recommend because of this issue which was in the game in beta but never ever fixed by Relic. They just passed the problem to AMD, and failed to address the root cause of the issue, which is presumably a software / DirectX conflict with these particular model of video cards.Just buy CoH 1 instead.

When i first bought this i had about 20 hours on the original COH (due to them moving to steam) and now i have 90hrs for it, I think this speaks volumes in terms of how badly SEGA screwed up with COH2 and how disappointed I am in the direction taken with this game.Pros-Similar gameplay to the original COHCons-Alot more graphic intensive and very little gain from it (minus the snow effects)-factions are too asymetric-Too much overpriced DLC making the game feel more like a free to play game (which you pay to just play then pay more to be overpowered)			"

												I'll give Company of Heroes a 4/10 because it's not the worst game ever made, I can think of other games that are more deserving of a 0-1/10 - looking at you Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. However, I (like many other gamers) feel that Company of Heroes 2 just doesn't live up to the expectations of its predecessor. What has happened to the sophisticated commander tree? It has been replaced by a new commander system with no choice, except you can choose 5 different commander 'perks' before a match, then when you get commander points it'll unlock perks automatically (as each perk has a commander point requirement that, once reached, the perk will instantly become available). Okay, but at least CoH 2 has interesting concept art briefs between each mission right? Wrong. Those concept art briefs - which I, personally, loved and associated with the CoH titles - have been replaced by 30 second longish cut scenes between a lieutenant (who you never see or hear from in the missions) that is going to be executed for desertion and his old commander talking about the war - CoH 2 has replaced exciting and interesting character development and artistic cut scenes for a character you'll never see in-game and mediocre between mission cut scenes. There's almost no continuity between missions, in the original CoH you'd get a patriotic and informative brief (so you know what's going on in the grand scale of things), but in CoH 2 it's a case of; a minute cut scene that says ""the Germans attacked Russia"" and ""they get really close to Moscow"", from there on it's a case of go there, kill them, we won, fight them - then the level design and gameplay follows this pattern, so what may seem interesting and innovative to start becomes dull and representative in later missions. Yet another CoH 2 mistake is the lack of units, you'll have 2 units that you'll ever really use, your conscripts (infantry) and the T34s (tanks), that's it, you do have snipers (that for some reason only use stealth while they're in cover) and mortar teams etc but what's the point when they'll just get flooded by infantry and tanks? If you want to fight for the Germans, you better go somewhere else, because the singleplayer campaign is all Soviet - you can play as the Germans in multiplayer. Well, you can also play as the Germans in a new feature called 'Theater of War' which, basically, mini-campaigns with about 2 singleplayer missions and tonnes of co-op missions (which is a welcome feature) - but when I realized that my friends weren't prepared to pay £30 for a sub-par sequel, I was left with about 4 hours of German gameplay, max...Well... I think I've said all that I can about Company of Heroes 2. In conclusion, I'm not satisfied with Sega's sequel on what was a milestone in real-time strategy games. It has lost its strategy and has replaced it with numbers. And has many little 'features' that'll drive you mad, like units flashing their player colour when they're clicked on and all your recruited units now start off-map so you have to wait for them to come to you. There seems to be a never ending list of what's wrong with CoH 2, it's like they got the designs and features from the original games and said ""these are good, but, scrap them and let's start from fresh without taking any inspiration from the originals"". Plus CoH 2, to me, seems to have been Sega-fied.			"

												My initial review was after about 20 hours of gameplay and I have since decided to change that review now that I have near 100 hours logged.  From the start this game falls flat on its face due to the outrageous price and loaded DLC that Relic claims is for ""continued support"".  What a load of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Never until this decade has DLC gotten so out of control.  Companies out there that make games with no DLC charge less for some of their games and patch them for years afterwards.  But, enough about the horrendous business model that has lost my money and more about the game.     Company of Heroes 2 takes what the 1st one did and makes it bland.  No longer are you able to approach a situation from multiple vectors of possibilities and are now forced to be aggressive.  Trench wars, defensive positions, and the general concept of holding a point and inching forward no longer exists unless you build a custom map with a specific choke point that is designed to do just this.  Commanders do very little other than offer a few units that you can't build or offer some weapons you normally wouldn't get.  Don't think for an instant this is a direct equivalent to the doctrines in the first CoH because it isn't, not even by a long shot.  T-34 85s are called in units and not build versus the 76s that are built.  Tigers are called in and not built.  Population is capped at 100 unless you manually change it in the map editor.  No V1 rockets or other cool special abilities like calling in a King Tiger, JagdPanther, Pershing Tank, etc.  Just a few fragmentation bombing runs, and plane strafes with some other abilities like camo, tank smoke, etc.     The game does do well graphically, I will give it that but I do not believe that is anyhwere near sufficient to call this a second game.  Sounds are just as realisitic as they were in the first one but pathfinding seems to never have been improved.  I guess they wanted to focus on vaulting over sandbags and walls instead of fixing critical issues from a game that suffered the same issues 7 years ago.  Buying barbed wire cutters for engineers because they don't come with them, you know....cause engineers don't work in situations like that...or something.....       I really hate to fill a review with constant negatives so I will put a few of the things that this games does manage to do well.  First, I like the concept that Germans and Russians can play on the same team.  This slightly alters the single strategy concept that this game has embedded into its core.  I also like that you can repair bridges if they are partially damaged instead of waiting until it is completely gone.  Another great aspect of this game is that the physics have been improved.  Tanks feel more like tanks as they rock when they shoot and get hit and actually have a reverse button so you arn't spam clicking or queueing your tank backwards like you had to in the first installment.  Finally, capping points by standing near them is great.  I no longer have to make sure my units are capping, all I have to do is get them within the area of effect for it to begin capturing.     Unfortunately, that is really all I can think of that makes the game look decent.  All of the improper balancing due to a new and whiny community is holding this game back.  I wish Relic would just balance the game as they see fit, it worked great for the first installment.  Gamers are entirely to whiny and shed tears when something doesn't go their way, but then again that is the way most my country is.  People will whine because they can't play, don't understand a concept, or simply just don't get their way but a game like this shouldn't be altered because of those reasons.  Single minded strategy, a massively cheating AI, and horrendous balancing with laregely missing content make this game a no purchase unless you are either bored or get it during a massive sale, and by massive I mean 75% or more.  Do yourself a favor, don't get burned.			"

												Probably the worst strategy game I've ever played. How can it be that losing three tanks against one infantry squad. And there are not even far enough troup points. Why do I need 12 troup points for a tank which only need 3 people in it to use?!And you can't upgrade most tanks anymore (like with an MG on top). If you want to play a ww strategy game you should propbaly buy the first one (COH 1 with extension). There you also got a lot more varieties (US, Commonwealth, German, German Tank elite). They remove very cool stuff which was available in the first game. Like the artillery (Commonwealth --> 25 Pounder Gun Howitzer. I really loved that one :)).And for the first part there are plenty of mods an maps available. Much more fun and much more possibilities. (And the graphic is as good as it is in the second part).Also the matchmaking system got under my skin. why the ***** can't there be a lobby, where you can see a list of open matches. I can only start a autosearch and furthermore I can't even decide if I want to play in the match they found for me. I will be droped in immediately. The only chance to get out of it is by capitulation. AWESOME!!!!! Totally loving it.			"

												DO NOT BUY. I have hundreds of hours of playtime in this game and I can tell you that it`s not worth it. The game is terribly optimized, terribly balanced (snipers are incredibly OP and there is no counter to them) and the business model is the final nail in the coffin. Since they try to milk the cash through the sale of additional commanders (who possess additional units and abilities), the core (non-commander) unit pool is pretty poor and the game lacks strategic depth.The only reason that could justify the purchase is the fact that there are no good RTS games nowadays. So if you are an RTS fan and you need your fix there aren`t many options and I wouldn`t blame you. You`ve been warned though.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't for a few reasons. The single player campaign isn't very good. Definitely not as good as the first game's. I found the Theater of War missions more interesting than the campaign. The multiplayer is ruined by the fact that most of the Commanders have to be bought and they aren't cheap. Relic is charging for stuff like this is a free to play game. It really is disgusting. Technically you can unlock the Commanders by playing matches and getting War Spoils, but in reality those almost never drop.			"

												If you have played CoH1, your first impression will be ""this game is a huge disappointment"". But as you play more, you will see some mechanics changed to better and playability is different from CoH1 not worse. More realistic, and more cruel from CoH1. Spamming is no longer solution of every problem. There is not any super unit that is unbeatable. Buying some in-game content with money is always annoying. This is the major bad side of the game.

												I did love the original Company of Heroes where you stormed the beaches of Normandy and drove the Germans off from France. I thought it was epic, part 2 takes you to the Russian front where you play as a Soviet commander fighting off the Nazis from Mother Russia.URA! The campaign is pretty long (15 missions). It took about 20 hours to beat it on EASY difficulty. Captain and General difficulties might be too hard for beginners. Unless you don't know your way around strategy games and haven't played the first CofH game, this might be better laid off due to the intensive difficulty and how it delivers its hints on aiding you how to win the scenarios.The graphics are beautiful, without mentioning how you can maneuver in the maps. For an RTS game it's a gem. I loved it all the way! I'm not saying you shouldn't buy it but you should think about ""Have I ever played any RTS?"" If you have, then go for it.Reclaim Mother Russia from the Fascists!5/5			"

												FOR MOTHER RUSSIA!!!Pros: -Tactical Variety. The same strategy won't always work the same.-Glorious Graphics.-Russian Army. Need I say more?-Western Front: Because we missed the classic armies.-Winter Maps: Drastically changes everything.-Revamped AI: Bruh. So awesum!-Modding: Makes it more fun yas.-Campaign is cool: hidden objectives and strategies make the campaign fun(still haven't finished due to time constraints)Cons:-Graphics requirements: not recommendable on lower spec laptops and PCs.-When using game enhancing mods(e.g. Spearhead and Ultimate Resources mods), the AI gets too overpowered as you are and starts killing you and your teammate.That's all folks! 5 Stars and recommend to play!! ^_^			"

												For anyone that played the first game: It's diffrent. There're many change to the better, but also many to the worse.  The first was better in my opinion, but this game is also quite awesome. The campaign was better in the first game in my opinion.This game had a lot to live up to from the first games major success. I think they made a really great game and they really tried to make it a fresh game and they made a few bold changes which most often was to the better. But the game is still very much CoH, in a good way. This game is new and therefore don't feel so balanced as the old CoH. Just as the first game this game still have base building and require good micro managment. Update: After years of updates I say that his game now is better then the original in almost every way. Even in the begining small changes such as points are now capped while standing inside a area around the point instead of having a need to stand right next to it as well as the ability to block an enemies caputure by standing inside the same area was a straight upgrade in my opinion. The true sight and sound system that already in the game from the start is awsome and ones you are used to it, it's very hard to go back to he more unrealistic LoS system of the first game.ProsHard to find a better RTS then this, if you don't count the first game. Great graphic.(Updated) The balance as of now is arguble at the same high level as the previous game. ConsFeels like it runs a bit to heavy compaired to the graphic it produce.(Outdated) This game dosn't feel as balanced as the old CoH. (Thought the old game have had years of balane changes. I can't remember if the old CoH was anymore balanced then this new game when it first were released; I would not belive so at least.) *After years of tweaking I think its probably on a equally balanced state as the original game though.

												I was looking for a multiplayer RTS that had no resources gathering but still kept strategic and tactical depths. CoH2 ticks all the boxes, with added brilliant graphics and audio to create one intense, immersive experience. Instead of resource gathering you have to capture certain territory points that when held give you the resources you need, such as manpower, munitions or fuel. You are then able to use these resource points to make building upgrades which then allow you to get better units or to upgrade your current units with special abilities. It’s very close to a MOBA actually, but with far more complexity.Concerning the campaign parts, it’s okay, but the game really shines in multiplayer, which by playing the campaigns helps you improve your multiplayer skills. The only negatives I can say about the game is that the tutorial should be better, especially to help people that are more interested in just playing multiplayer, and I almost stopped playing because of not quite knowing how it all worked. Also its mini tactical map, which is used consistently, greatly needs improvement, sometimes being very difficult to see where your units are. The larger tactical map is not practical to use so the mini map is mostly relied on and therefore needs to be clearer. "

												Hello everyone, as you can see, I have a lot of hours in this game. Once they worked out most of the bugs and leveled out the factions, it turned out to be good. This game isn't the greatest ever, but It was really easy to get immersed into it. As I said, not the greatest, but I still think that it's worth playing. Playing with the computer gets boring after playing it for.... well, a lot.So then you start playing online in PVP. I quickly learned that there is a specific strategy that needs to be played in order to win, and win quickly. Everyone develops their own, so they are all different, but if you're playing with friends, and talking to them over teamspeak, you can put together a good strategy to win. When I played, we used a rush strategy. If everything went right, we would most likely win within 15 minutes. Which is really fast in this game. One thing about this game thats different from most other RTS games is the Mirco gameplay. Units like Tanks, Arty, anti-tank guns, everything was very important. Like, if you lost a Tiger tank, to you, that is a huge hit. Its just a bit different from another RTS game where you have over 1k units attacking. Different playing. It was a good game. I stopped playing it cause it gets old-ish after 500 hours. I enjoyed it, and will play it again in the future.			"

												CoH2, to this day, is still a downgrade from CoH in most ways as far as I'm concerned. The DLC system is kind of 'okay'- you can acquire every commander in the game randomly as a drop (or craft it after disenchanting drops, which is massively inefficient, the ratio is 30:1), but if you want the best available to you right away in multiplayer, you'll have to spend more.I've always loved (1v1) CoH for its slow early- and mid-game where there was lots of room for tactical play like using barbed wire, shenanigans involving HMGs in buildings, cap-points were contested for several minutes at a time, it was great. I feel like this was lost a bit with CoH2, the game definitely seems a lot faster to me, even playing classic maps like Angoville (10 more years!). Maybe it isn't even so much a question of speed in teching, but rather that there are more hard-counters, I'm neither sure, nor an expert.Performance is, sadly, shocking. Running the game on win7/10 x64 (couldn't tell a difference in performance), i5-4670K (auto-OC), 8mb, r9 290 (4gb), and while this certainly isn't the most up-to-date rig, it should be able to positively destroy this 2012-released-yet-2008-looking♥♥♥♥♥game. Instead, my CPU is vastly under-utilised, my GPU is at 100% load at all times and I don't even get stable 60 fps in 1v1- that's pretty preposterous. The load-times are absolutely horrendous except on SSDs (where they're just long) and the campaign is...calling it arduous would be generous (I've owned the game since 2012, still haven't finished it, doing 2-3 missions at a time is enough for about 9 months). I don't buy RTS games for the singleplayer component, but after the first game had such a fantastic campaign, this just feels like a pisstake.Still, it is the newest CoH, and there is only one franchise that offers what CoH does, and that's CoH (DoW is close, but it's not the same). I still love the unique gameplay CoH offers, there is nothing else like it. I don't care for the lategame, I don't like what teching has become in CoH2, but it is still the closest thing to the game I fell in love with almost 10 years ago, and it's still way more fun than games where pathing isn't the third opponent in a 1v1.

												If you enjoy playing multiplayer battles then this is a horrible horrible game. 2 thumbs down. If you choose to play German you win. If you choose to play Allied you lose. Simple as that. One of the most unbalanced games you'll ever find. About the equivalent to playing War Thunder as an American M36 tank destroyer. You have absolutely no chance unless the enemy team is 100% noob...and then you could still lose. Just pitiful.8/28/16: I'm changing my review to a thumbs up. Since my first review the game has underwent some balancing modifications and I'd say it's about even now. The German tanks are still op but if you know what you're doing you can take them out. This is a highly strategical game and a whole lot really depends on your level of experience. Also, if you're in a multiplayer match of 3 vs 3 or 4 vs 4 the number of prestige stars on either side (each prestige star denotes 100 levels) will usually determine who wins or loses. Usually, but not always. You can see I have quite a lot of hours logged on this game. It is a very fun game but can be very very frustrating also. Experience plays a major part when in multiplayer. I recommend this game.			"

												Even though Company Of Heroes 2 is seen as old to today standards it has many highlights, not only is the gameplay amazing the graphics are good and the overall effect it has on you whilst playing is outstanding. For any potential buyers there are two things that you should be aware of.  The first thing is the price of the game although it goes on sale, full price is around $60. The second thing you as a buyer needs to be aware of is that it is quite hard to begin with, there are a lot of voncepts and guidelines that you need to remember. All in all COH2 is hands down an amazing game and is worth every penny.			"

												If you're not familiar with Company of Heroes, the game focuses more on combat and tactics and marginalizes base building. So, the game feels more faster paced and there's a lot of action. The graphics and sounds are also great; it's awesome seeing a Tiger Tank obliterate everything.			"

												I used to be a beta player, but didn´t really enjoy the game back then. Now when COH1 is pretty much dead It is the only way to play MP. Singleplayer: Russian part even at general difficulty is pretty easy. American at general difficulty is nut yet to be cracked.  Didn´t really care about the plot, but I think relic went a little over the line in some cases  of RU campaign  (roasting civilians and own troops with flames). In other hand I enjoyed the feeling of ""Nas Mnogo"" (there are plenty of us)  and just sending waves of expendable conscripts to the main line of fire while flanking with other better troops.Overall RU 7/10 I wanted to give a US 9/10, but I give it 8/10 just because of DLC rangers  Scenario DLCs - nice map additions to play with a friend/s I think worth of buying through discounts 6/10 Multiplayer- I am not yet Ranked but I see 3 major problems 1) Why the duck you have to pay for other commanders 4 euro each? If I want to have CoH 1 like company with calliOP to control blobs I have to have like 25-ish  lucky level ups to earn gold, have insanely lucky drop, or pay 4 euro.... Yes if you aren´t 3lvl prestige player it is pay to win ....   2) Blobs in 2v2 and more - Everyone blobs. Rifle spam gren/pgren spam you name it... Why is it a good tactic?! Because there is only a few cap points with limited flanking possibilities (the higher amount of players and the smaller the map the worse) and counters are not really efficient enough  to be really punishing  in terms of MP (arty is much less effective than in COH1, MGS suppress fast but pins down slowly, snipers in mass are extremely team dependent, only minethrowers are descent )3) Players disconnecting in the middle of the unresolved match ... They don´t vote for surrender they just leave ...  Most of the time bots play better then them. 1v1 9/10others 7/10 even if i had most fun in 3v3 mode Overall the game is solid with a few flaws (major to be plenty of micro transactions, but in 1v1 this does not really play the role). So if you don´t like CoH1´s impossibly  long w8ting time for a match, this might be game just for you!			"

												Download size: about 15 gigabytesPlay time: about 13 hours for the single player campaignCompany of Heroes 2 (COH2) is one of those real time strategy games that is fun but sometimes infuriating even on conscript mode (easy difficulty) because of the seemingly random combat mechanics. It’s been over a year since I played the original COH, but I remember it being almost exactly the same in terms of gameplay and graphics. In COH2 however, you play as the Russians and there seems to be a lot of metagame options (DLC bonuses and things like that). I downloaded the game during the big free weekend and played as much of the campaign as I could finish, so I’m sure I missed a ton of the finer points. This is my impression of the single player campaign.The game’s story takes place during the US/USSR Cold War and follows a Soviet officer who is facing execution for treason. The officer was a lieutenant during World War 2 and the gameplay missions are flashbacks to his time in the Red army. As the story unfolds you begin to see how the Soviet leadership was willing to sacrifice as many of their men as necessary to achieve victory, and the lieutenant did whatever he could to save them. This conflict between the lieutenant and his superiors caused him to be transferred around between different units, and consequently you get to play in various important battles of the war. Gameplay in COH2 is pretty much exactly the same as the first game, so if you’ve recently played Company of Heroes 1, you can skip the tutorials. Technically the game is real time strategy, but the focus is tactical, so there’s almost no “base building.” There are 14 missions in total and I think I only had to build structures in 2 of them, and even then it was only 1 or 2 buildings. All of your units come from “off screen” when you build them, and the buildings are pretty much just unlocking the unit for you to summon them. Resources in the game are manpower, munitions, and fuel, all of which come from controlling command points on the map. There isn’t any “harvesting.” The command points are like capture the flag points in most first person shooters where you just need to have a unit standing next to it to capture and hold. Holding a command point sometimes creates a closer “spawn point” for your troops so if you buy a unit, it can get to the front lines faster. Troop and vehicle movement across the map is very slow, so having a closer supply line can be extremely important. Especially since the population cap is usually pretty low. You can’t just swarm the enemy with a massive army, you have to mix up your forces to counter whatever they have.Like most modern strategy games, every unit type has a weakness and there really isn’t a unit you can mass produce and roll over everyone (no medium tank rush). There is a large variety of unit types you can build and all of them are good for something specific. You can be pushing toward the enemy base and lose your team of engineers, and suddenly you have to stop and wait for another team to replace them, otherwise you’re without repair support. I mentioned the random combat mechanics earlier and what I mean is that most of the shots fired in the game will miss. When troops engage each other, units in cover (hiding behind stuff) will be less likely to take damage. But this is not always true. Sometimes you think you have an awesome elevated position and still get mowed down. Or you can be out in the open and still kill the enemy in their entrenched position. If you’ve played the old Command & Conquer games, you probably remember a tank firing 50 shots and missing the enemy soldier every time. This seems to happen a lot in COH2. Most of your units have some sort of extra ability that can be used for tactical advantage, for example anti-personnel grenades or anti-tank grenades. This means that micro managing your troops can often turn the tide even when you think the enemy has superior numbers. Pros:+The game is pretty much as “realistic” as you can get for small scale battles. There is troop movement time, random shots missing, and even a rudimentary morale system. If your men are under heavy fire (like from a machine gun), they can be “pinned down.” They won’t return fire, use special abilities, and can’t move effectively. +You are forced to use various strategies to accomplish your goals. You cannot mass produce a few types of units and expect to win. You do have a “jack of all trades” type unit (basic conscript) who can pick up weapons found on the battlefield and become more specialized. For example if a mortar team dies, a conscript team can pick up the fallen mortar gun and become a mortar team. The same goes for heavy machine guns and bazooka teams.Cons:-The game is quite difficult because of the randomness in the heat of combat. Don’t get me wrong, on easy difficulty you can certainly beat every level, it just might take a lot longer than expected because your troops keep getting picked off. You have to move slowly so all your units can keep up with the main force. Being a hard game is not a bad thing, but it can really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you lose 1 guy and have to wait for reinforcements to walk halfway across the map.-Some of the special abilities don’t seem to work properly. I was never able to summon air strikes when I wanted, and it wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. Was I too close/far? It would just say “you cannot use this ability on that target.” I’m the kind of guy who likes to bombard from long range so it was annoying when I couldn’t use some of these abilities on any of the levels.All in all the game is fun if you’re into real time strategy, but don’t have 20 click per second micro managing skills like some Starcraft players. It’s pretty slow paced, but I imagine that in multiplayer you have to blitz in the beginning to capture command points. The game has a significant download size, so if you didn’t really like the first Company of Heroes think carefully if you want to give COH2 a try, the games are very similar. Additionally COH2 has over 400 Steam achievements, most of which are grinding (kill x many of this type of unit). Beating the campaign on normal mode would give only about 40. Watch your average game completion % drop! "

												The downside of this game is the amount of DLC available to buy. This includes alot of new maps, coop/single player missions as well as new armies and commanders for your armies. On the other hand, the DLC is relatively cheap so as long as you don't plan to buy EVERYTHING it shouldn't cost an awful lot to enjoy alot of this game, especially the multiplayer.As i play this mostly online, the game is incredibly fun and very rarely is each match the same. The cover system in coordination with the grenades/rocket uses etc and the different ways to counter the enemy allow for an ever changing game. An example, the enemy germans have bunkered down on a key position, so you build a mortar or 2 in order to force them out of position. The enemy know you have some mortars, so they can either fall back and take a deeper defensive line, try to mortar back or try to flank with their troops or their light vehicles, thus forcing you to retreat. But at the same time, you could have been prepared for a flank with the use of an MG or AT gun sitting just behind the mortars. No matter how you play this game, there will always be a time where you think 'if i'd done this i may have won this encounter'. This game is incredibly fun and will offer hours of gameplay either solo, vs bots or with friends. I definitely recommend this RTS for and RTS fans.			"

												When it boils down to it, this game is really good. The graphics and gameplay designs are superb and it's probably one of the most in depth strategy games of it's time. Really, it's an extremely fun game... When it isn't busy crashing...In the middle of games, whenever it feels like it and the only way I have found to fix it is a full PC reboot. Other than that though, I recommend this to anyone looking for an in depth strategy game with quite a steep learning curve. The community may be toxic but there's not much you can do about that.			"

												2015 DecThis game is garbage. It has the distinct stink and aroma of pay2win, and it just WON'T go away.if you don't spend the full $300 dollars to get every commander, you will find it incredibly boring and tiresome playing the vanilla commanders while your opponents play the OP (yet still boring) units of the other commander trees.2016 AugOkay been playing this a lot more with some oldtime coh1 friends. we all finally made the move over because the automatching in coh1 for 3v3 and 4v4 don't work due to lack of players. 2v2 is also pretty slim pickings in coh1. So anyway, thats the reason for the move, and the only reason for the move. coh1 is the better game.But having started playing it a lot now, I can say we are having fun. My chief complaints is still the commander system. Commanders are still so boring. I use one ability (maybe 2) only on any given commander tree. I notice similar from our opposition. Occasionally a commander has an ability that is pretty strong (normally a off-map type call-down) and when they spam the commanders (everyone on the opposite team picking the same) and spam that ability it can decisively turn a game, which sucks...but thats just the nature of these crappy commanders.They really wanted the commanders to be the micro-transaction of the game....which instrinsically meant they had to be dull, weak and boring or else the game gets unbalanced or pay-to-win...which is bad enough, but also due to lack of balance testing resources available for any micro-transaction system applied to game mechanics, it also means an occasional commander ability can produce unforseen results when spammed in big multi player games. So...commanders suck. rest of game is good enough.Going to recommend this game, but only on special (75% off)....and never buy any commanders. Waste of money. Just wait for the in-game rewards drop of one (rare) or use the in-game supply reward purchase (common enough, but accumulates slowly, oh-so-slowly, over time to purchase the commanders)good gaming.

												Very good game. Would recommend to anyone who is a fan of strategy games. Games can get very intense and on some maps can drag on for hours. My longest game was 2:30h so be prepared for long games. An annoying thing is key customisation which is non existant which would be the biggest problem i have faced when playing this game but I heard that they are working on it. Have a great time blasting your enemies with tanks and infantry.			"

												I used to be a beta player, but didn´t really enjoy the game back then. Now when COH1 is pretty much dead It is the only way to play MP. Singleplayer: Russian part even at general difficulty is pretty easy. American at general difficulty is nut yet to be cracked.  Didn´t really care about the plot, but I think relic went a little over the line in some cases  of RU campaign  (roasting civilians and own troops with flames). In other hand I enjoyed the feeling of ""Nas Mnogo"" (there are plenty of us)  and just sending waves of expendable conscripts to the main line of fire while flanking with other better troops.Overall RU 7/10 I wanted to give a US 9/10, but I give it 8/10 just because of DLC rangers  Scenario DLCs - nice map additions to play with a friend/s I think worth of buying through discounts 6/10 Multiplayer- I am not yet Ranked but I see 3 major problems 1) Why the duck you have to pay for other commanders 4 euro each? If I want to have CoH 1 like company with calliOP to control blobs I have to have like 25-ish  lucky level ups to earn gold, have insanely lucky drop, or pay 4 euro.... Yes if you aren´t 3lvl prestige player it is pay to win ....   2) Blobs in 2v2 and more - Everyone blobs. Rifle spam gren/pgren spam you name it... Why is it a good tactic?! Because there is only a few cap points with limited flanking possibilities (the higher amount of players and the smaller the map the worse) and counters are not really efficient enough  to be really punishing  in terms of MP (arty is much less effective than in COH1, MGS suppress fast but pins down slowly, snipers in mass are extremely team dependent, only minethrowers are descent )3) Players disconnecting in the middle of the unresolved match ... They don´t vote for surrender they just leave ...  Most of the time bots play better then them. 1v1 9/10others 7/10 even if i had most fun in 3v3 mode Overall the game is solid with a few flaws (major to be plenty of micro transactions, but in 1v1 this does not really play the role). So if you don´t like CoH1´s impossibly  long w8ting time for a match, this might be game just for you!			"

												Managing troops is difficult and usually clumsy. It's not possible to slow down the time so it's mostly hectic. Either learn to use your keyboard and learn what every key does, or you are going to keep failing because you can't command your troops effectively using a mouse in such a hectic game.This game company seems to care about the community since they have an ingame Twitch support in the game. They even recommend on asking the ""helpful"" community for help in case you need some. Well actually this game company doesn't care about it's customers as much as it seems to. The game is full of bugs after updates and 'Relic' has not fixed even some of the older glitches.That's a lot of negatives. The game does have it's upsides though.- The music sounds nice- The graphics are ridicilously advanced- The story is mostly enjoyable, even though it is fictional- Succeeding in this game is rewarding3/5 Would grind soviets again.

												I've been a fan of the Company of Heroes series for a long time. I've owned the first game since 2007 (Steam doesn't have all of my countless hours with that game as I played most of it from the disc), but to this day, the original Company of Heroes is my favorite strategy game of all time. So when I heard a couple of years ago that they would be releasing a second game, this time taking place on the Eastern Front, I pre-ordered the game as quickly as I could.Company of Heroes 2, mechanically wise, is pretty much the same as the first game, but there are some slight improvements and new mechanics that make the game. You now have Capture Zones, where you can have a squad capture a territory whilst still being able to fight and makes it much easier for enemies to come in and try to stop that capture. The fog of war system was altered so that now you see what your soldiers see, making it much easier to take advantage of against your foe, or to be taken advantage of. The new winter system makes it so that your soldiers will die in the cold if not given sufficient cover or warmth, just imagine being in the middle of a firefight with your whole army and all of a sudden a blizzard begins and you have no fires whatsoever. That kind of dynamic can really alter the course of a battle.However, at the end of the day, I can only give Company of Heroes 2 a cautious recommendation. The main problem with this game is the paid DLC within the in-game store, with my main pet peeve being the commanders. In the game, commanders serve the same function as the ""Tech Trees"" in the first game, except now, you can unlock new commanders and swap them out, and each commander has different abilities to bring to the table. You can also purchase commanders, and the most powerful commanders are the ones always purchased. Sure, you can unlock commanders, but it is very rare to do so, and you don't even get to choose which commander you unlock. Commanders are, essentially, pay to win. Maybe that's a bit unfair, because you can still win without them, but your odds go down significantly. Company of Heroes 2 IS a good game, but some of its business practices may make this a tough sell.			"

												  My anti-tank squad is hunkered down behind a wooden fence. They're pinned down by heavy machine gun fire originating directly in front, preventing them from peppering the medium German tank to their right with RPGs. A few feet ahead of them is a structure where they could find temporary shelter, but making a break for it would be suicide. To make matters worse, they are freezing to death. Too long in the harsh winter away from a warming fire or holed up inside a bunker and they'll start dropping like flies. An AT shell penetrates the vulnerable rear of the Nazi tank; my heavy AT gunners have finally finished turning their confiscated weapon toward the enemy. As the German treads whirl to face the new threat and the heavy machine gunners move to support it, my anti-tank squad takes the opportunity to hop the fence and makes it safely inside the house. RPG fire soon whizzes from the broken windows, striking the Axis armor. The tank is almost destroyed, but my AT gunners are getting cut down, soon too weak in number to man their weapon. Machinery roars like an angry beast as the smoking, crushed tank turns its' wounded turret toward the building and the German machine gunners pivot in the snow. There's a high pitched whine. Then a BOOM. The tank explodes. The Axis gunners try to retreat, but the bullets raining from the occupied building prove too much for them. They soon fall, shot in the back while trying to run. My mortar team emerges from the tree line and a group of engineers are not far behind, ready to build a fire for my dwindling army. That was only one tank down, and there were half a dozen more hiding somewhere in the cold Soviet night.  Company of Heroes 2 works spectacularly on the micro level.  Maneuvering squads to ensure they have adequate cover and numbers to take on the enemy creates some truly impressive sights.  The more-zoomed-in-than-usual view makes for an experience not unlike watching a war movie being filmed from up high.  You're not just sending icons to meet enemy icons and hoping your rock beats their scissors or depending on a random roll of the dice to determine victory.  Moving each soldier into advantageous positions is nothing short of vital.  This is both a strength and weakness of the game.  If you don't babysit your crews expect them to make some questionable decisions.  They'll stand in the middle of the road as a tank rolls right up to them and cuts them to ribbons, or march right through an enemy stronghold without firing a shot.  The AI and pathfinding are questionable, so be prepared for a lot of clicking or a lot of dead soldiers.  I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not well versed in real time strategy games, having only dabbled in a handful over the years. The aesthetic and setting of Company of Heroes definitely had me engaged and willing to learn more than most other genre offerings, but some legacy problems (for me, anyway...) kept me from a long term engagement.  The fourteen campaign missions are entirely staged affairs, and aside from a general overview of what you're meant to accomplish you're going in blind.  You could build up to the (small) population cap with mostly foot soldier fodder, running over enemy forces with impunity, only to run into a wall of tanks later that decimate them with a ticking timer or other encroaching objective looming that ensures you're ♥♥♥♥ed and need to reload a save or start the entire mission over again.  These are beginner's traps, and that's not good design.  You'll find ways to finish the battles eventually as you learn the requirements and the basics of the game, but that's not a good alternative to a sufficient tutorial and clear win conditions. A developer in a tutorial video encourages you to “watch YouTube videos” and “check with the community on forums” to learn the game, which “requires hundreds of hours to fully comprehend”... Maybe a bullet point for some, but personally I find it to be a little too much to ask.  By the end of the campaign (on Easy) I was starting to get the basics down, but was running out of true single player content.  There are some skirmishes to check out and bot matches, but jumping into these scenarios seemed a bit useless at that point: more learning of specific skill sets to an overall game I'm probably not going to get much deeper into.  There's multiplayer, of course, for those who are interested in that.. but I'm not ready to jump into the meat grinder against RTS animals who have been playing Company of Heroes 2 (and only Company of Heroes 2) non-stop since it released two years ago.    I don't know if I'll continue playing the game further or not, but I experienced the game as a solid 18 hour single player diversion.  It was fine for a casual RTS player like myself.  The WWII action is visceral and immediate, and moving platoons around the battlefield is satisfying if occasionally frustrating.  CoH2 doesn't seem to entirely escape from the genre trappings that I find rather off-putting, but taken as a chance to play weekend armchair general on the set of Saving Private Ryan it was enjoyable.

												I was pretty surprised to see a fun strategy game in COH2. I was expecting a game with slow and laborious units with little territory gains, instead I got a point capture game with multiple strategic elements. My original post recommended this game. However, after I encountered so many BUG SPLAT errrors and disconnects. I've decided to thumb it down. It's also Pay To Win. They were selling the rare British commanders (Blue) for cash.$9.75+$5+$3.25PROS1. No Bob-the-builderYou don't have to build many production facilities to mass produce your armies. It really helps that you don't have to worry about issues like trapping your units within your building maze.2. Model OrientationHaving a zone of fire, front and back armour, angled shots and wall blocking really helped in creating strategy for the game. This is the one thing I don't really see in other Real Time Strategy Games, rushing from the front or the back yields the same result for other games.3. CampaignA lot of historical significance from World War II. I am unsure of its accuracy but I do hope that they got important details like dates, names, locations, who won and what went on correct.4. Unit Cap / Pop CapWorks pretty well. Having lesser units to control helps to balance the game for those with lower Actions Per Minute (APM)5. RetreatVery convenient button. It's good to use when you want your troops to run fast and back to base. Don't know why only infantry have them. Vehicles do not have retreat functions oddly.6. Terrain and WeatherSurprisingly, there are a lot of interesting terrain. Ice which breaks when fire upon or when heavy tanks run over. Snow and Mud which affects your movement. Blizzards which kill your infantry (don't really like this one since tanks seems invulnerable to blizzards, making them more valuable).CONS1. DLC, DLC, DLCEverything I see on the store page is DLC, DLC, DLC. It is annoying to know that you can't play certain sides unless you splash out the dough. I've heard that there are expansion packs but you can see that they are divided into smaller packs.2. RetreatYou can't stop the troops mid way of a retreat. They run all the way back to bask. I would prefer some kind of retreat that lets you choose either 50% or 100% of the distance back. Why? Because some times I just want to flank and I need to move fast, but retreating at 100% means I have to call them at base.3. No quick end strategyThere is no zerging in this game. You can't just end the game early as all bases have machine guns and infantry die very easily to them. I don't know if this is actually that bad.4. Mine placementVery, very slow and tiny. No circle to show the radius of explosion. They only work well with chokepoints. I was hoping if they could make a grid (minefield) instead of an extended line. Since the mines cost ammunition to plant, players can't spam them abitrarily. Also, more mines would make mine detection actually useful. You could also add abilities to scan for mines that way.5. Mine sweepingAbsolutely redundant. If there is mine, there is usually a machine gun guarding. So, the engineer has trouble removing it. Never played a game where engineers needed mine detection.6. T1>T2>T3Most games tend to be won by a high tech tank domination. The game seems to end only when one side builds up their most powerful heavy armour tanks e.g. Tiger Ace, Panther, KV-8, Elefant. I don't really remember games when light and medium tanks won.7. Bug Splat Errors ******Too many to count. Every time someones disconnects it's usually a Bug Splat error or a map problem. The game is complete at all. The errors just occur randomly or when servers are full.			"

												Download size: about 15 gigabytesPlay time: about 13 hours for the single player campaignCompany of Heroes 2 (COH2) is one of those real time strategy games that is fun but sometimes infuriating even on conscript mode (easy difficulty) because of the seemingly random combat mechanics. It’s been over a year since I played the original COH, but I remember it being almost exactly the same in terms of gameplay and graphics. In COH2 however, you play as the Russians and there seems to be a lot of metagame options (DLC bonuses and things like that). I downloaded the game during the big free weekend and played as much of the campaign as I could finish, so I’m sure I missed a ton of the finer points. This is my impression of the single player campaign.The game’s story takes place during the US/USSR Cold War and follows a Soviet officer who is facing execution for treason. The officer was a lieutenant during World War 2 and the gameplay missions are flashbacks to his time in the Red army. As the story unfolds you begin to see how the Soviet leadership was willing to sacrifice as many of their men as necessary to achieve victory, and the lieutenant did whatever he could to save them. This conflict between the lieutenant and his superiors caused him to be transferred around between different units, and consequently you get to play in various important battles of the war. Gameplay in COH2 is pretty much exactly the same as the first game, so if you’ve recently played Company of Heroes 1, you can skip the tutorials. Technically the game is real time strategy, but the focus is tactical, so there’s almost no “base building.” There are 14 missions in total and I think I only had to build structures in 2 of them, and even then it was only 1 or 2 buildings. All of your units come from “off screen” when you build them, and the buildings are pretty much just unlocking the unit for you to summon them. Resources in the game are manpower, munitions, and fuel, all of which come from controlling command points on the map. There isn’t any “harvesting.” The command points are like capture the flag points in most first person shooters where you just need to have a unit standing next to it to capture and hold. Holding a command point sometimes creates a closer “spawn point” for your troops so if you buy a unit, it can get to the front lines faster. Troop and vehicle movement across the map is very slow, so having a closer supply line can be extremely important. Especially since the population cap is usually pretty low. You can’t just swarm the enemy with a massive army, you have to mix up your forces to counter whatever they have.Like most modern strategy games, every unit type has a weakness and there really isn’t a unit you can mass produce and roll over everyone (no medium tank rush). There is a large variety of unit types you can build and all of them are good for something specific. You can be pushing toward the enemy base and lose your team of engineers, and suddenly you have to stop and wait for another team to replace them, otherwise you’re without repair support. I mentioned the random combat mechanics earlier and what I mean is that most of the shots fired in the game will miss. When troops engage each other, units in cover (hiding behind stuff) will be less likely to take damage. But this is not always true. Sometimes you think you have an awesome elevated position and still get mowed down. Or you can be out in the open and still kill the enemy in their entrenched position. If you’ve played the old Command & Conquer games, you probably remember a tank firing 50 shots and missing the enemy soldier every time. This seems to happen a lot in COH2. Most of your units have some sort of extra ability that can be used for tactical advantage, for example anti-personnel grenades or anti-tank grenades. This means that micro managing your troops can often turn the tide even when you think the enemy has superior numbers. Pros:+The game is pretty much as “realistic” as you can get for small scale battles. There is troop movement time, random shots missing, and even a rudimentary morale system. If your men are under heavy fire (like from a machine gun), they can be “pinned down.” They won’t return fire, use special abilities, and can’t move effectively. +You are forced to use various strategies to accomplish your goals. You cannot mass produce a few types of units and expect to win. You do have a “jack of all trades” type unit (basic conscript) who can pick up weapons found on the battlefield and become more specialized. For example if a mortar team dies, a conscript team can pick up the fallen mortar gun and become a mortar team. The same goes for heavy machine guns and bazooka teams.Cons:-The game is quite difficult because of the randomness in the heat of combat. Don’t get me wrong, on easy difficulty you can certainly beat every level, it just might take a lot longer than expected because your troops keep getting picked off. You have to move slowly so all your units can keep up with the main force. Being a hard game is not a bad thing, but it can really♥♥♥♥♥♥you off when you lose 1 guy and have to wait for reinforcements to walk halfway across the map.-Some of the special abilities don’t seem to work properly. I was never able to summon air strikes when I wanted, and it wouldn’t tell me what was wrong. Was I too close/far? It would just say “you cannot use this ability on that target.” I’m the kind of guy who likes to bombard from long range so it was annoying when I couldn’t use some of these abilities on any of the levels.All in all the game is fun if you’re into real time strategy, but don’t have 20 click per second micro managing skills like some Starcraft players. It’s pretty slow paced, but I imagine that in multiplayer you have to blitz in the beginning to capture command points. The game has a significant download size, so if you didn’t really like the first Company of Heroes think carefully if you want to give COH2 a try, the games are very similar. Additionally COH2 has over 400 Steam achievements, most of which are grinding (kill x many of this type of unit). Beating the campaign on normal mode would give only about 40. Watch your average game completion % drop! "

An AT shell penetrates the vulnerable rear of the Nazi tank; my heavy AT gunners have finally finished turning their confiscated weapon toward the enemy. As the German treads whirl to face the new threat and the heavy machine gunners move to support it, my anti-tank squad takes the opportunity to hop the fence and makes it safely inside the house. RPG fire soon whizzes from the broken windows, striking the Axis armor. The tank is almost destroyed, but my AT gunners are getting cut down, soon too weak in number to man their weapon. Machinery roars like an angry beast as the smoking, crushed tank turns its' wounded turret toward the building and the German machine gunners pivot in the snow. There's a high pitched whine. Then a BOOM. The tank explodes. The Axis gunners try to retreat, but the bullets raining from the occupied building prove too much for them. They soon fall, shot in the back while trying to run. My mortar team emerges from the tree line and a group of engineers are not far behind, ready to build a fire for my dwindling army. That was only one tank down, and there were half a dozen more hiding somewhere in the cold Soviet night.  Company of Heroes 2 works spectacularly on the micro level.  Maneuvering squads to ensure they have adequate cover and numbers to take on the enemy creates some truly impressive sights.  The more-zoomed-in-than-usual view makes for an experience not unlike watching a war movie being filmed from up high.  You're not just sending icons to meet enemy icons and hoping your rock beats their scissors or depending on a random roll of the dice to determine victory.  Moving each soldier into advantageous positions is nothing short of vital.  This is both a strength and weakness of the game.  If you don't babysit your crews expect them to make some questionable decisions.  They'll stand in the middle of the road as a tank rolls right up to them and cuts them to ribbons, or march right through an enemy stronghold without firing a shot.  The AI and pathfinding are questionable, so be prepared for a lot of clicking or a lot of dead soldiers.  I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not well versed in real time strategy games, having only dabbled in a handful over the years. The aesthetic and setting of Company of Heroes definitely had me engaged and willing to learn more than most other genre offerings, but some legacy problems (for me, anyway...) kept me from a long term engagement.  The fourteen campaign missions are entirely staged affairs, and aside from a general overview of what you're meant to accomplish you're going in blind.  You could build up to the (small) population cap with mostly foot soldier fodder, running over enemy forces with impunity, only to run into a wall of tanks later that decimate them with a ticking timer or other encroaching objective looming that ensures you're ♥♥♥♥ed and need to reload a save or start the entire mission over again.  These are beginner's traps, and that's not good design.  You'll find ways to finish the battles eventually as you learn the requirements and the basics of the game, but that's not a good alternative to a sufficient tutorial and clear win conditions. A developer in a tutorial video encourages you to “watch YouTube videos” and “check with the community on forums” to learn the game, which “requires hundreds of hours to fully comprehend”... Maybe a bullet point for some, but personally I find it to be a little too much to ask.  By the end of the campaign (on Easy) I was starting to get the basics down, but was running out of true single player content.  There are some skirmishes to check out and bot matches, but jumping into these scenarios seemed a bit useless at that point: more learning of specific skill sets to an overall game I'm probably not going to get much deeper into.  There's multiplayer, of course, for those who are interested in that.. but I'm not ready to jump into the meat grinder against RTS animals who have been playing Company of Heroes 2 (and only Company of Heroes 2) non-stop since it released two years ago.    I don't know if I'll continue playing the game further or not, but I experienced the game as a solid 18 hour single player diversion.  It was fine for a casual RTS player like myself.  The WWII action is visceral and immediate, and moving platoons around the battlefield is satisfying if occasionally frustrating.  CoH2 doesn't seem to entirely escape from the genre trappings that I find rather off-putting, but taken as a chance to play weekend armchair general on the set of Saving Private Ryan it was enjoyable.

												I've been a fan of the Company of Heroes series for a long time. I've owned the first game since 2007 (Steam doesn't have all of my countless hours with that game as I played most of it from the disc), but to this day, the original Company of Heroes is my favorite strategy game of all time. So when I heard a couple of years ago that they would be releasing a second game, this time taking place on the Eastern Front, I pre-ordered the game as quickly as I could.Company of Heroes 2, mechanically wise, is pretty much the same as the first game, but there are some slight improvements and new mechanics that make the game. You now have Capture Zones, where you can have a squad capture a territory whilst still being able to fight and makes it much easier for enemies to come in and try to stop that capture. The fog of war system was altered so that now you see what your soldiers see, making it much easier to take advantage of against your foe, or to be taken advantage of. The new winter system makes it so that your soldiers will die in the cold if not given sufficient cover or warmth, just imagine being in the middle of a firefight with your whole army and all of a sudden a blizzard begins and you have no fires whatsoever. That kind of dynamic can really alter the course of a battle.However, at the end of the day, I can only give Company of Heroes 2 a cautious recommendation. The main problem with this game is the paid DLC within the in-game store, with my main pet peeve being the commanders. In the game, commanders serve the same function as the ""Tech Trees"" in the first game, except now, you can unlock new commanders and swap them out, and each commander has different abilities to bring to the table. You can also purchase commanders, and the most powerful commanders are the ones always purchased. Sure, you can unlock commanders, but it is very rare to do so, and you don't even get to choose which commander you unlock. Commanders are, essentially, pay to win. Maybe that's a bit unfair, because you can still win without them, but your odds go down significantly. Company of Heroes 2 IS a good game, but some of its business practices may make this a tough sell.			"

												Managing troops is difficult and usually clumsy. It's not possible to slow down the time so it's mostly hectic. Either learn to use your keyboard and learn what every key does, or you are going to keep failing because you can't command your troops effectively using a mouse in such a hectic game.This game company seems to care about the community since they have an ingame Twitch support in the game. They even recommend on asking the ""helpful"" community for help in case you need some. Well actually this game company doesn't care about it's customers as much as it seems to. The game is full of bugs after updates and 'Relic' has not fixed even some of the older glitches.That's a lot of negatives. The game does have it's upsides though.- The music sounds nice- The graphics are ridicilously advanced- The story is mostly enjoyable, even though it is fictional- Succeeding in this game is rewarding3/5 Would grind soviets again.

												ADVISED ONLY IF YOU BUY ON SALE. Becouse extra content is actually cool! And you want to have all armies, trust.Else its really too expensive for your wallet... Specially if you seperatly buy becouse you dont have time to wait for that steam sale...Actual review should come about here now with this creeping barrage of the sentances.Ah here we are. This game does looks up to its predecesor, the original CoH and has an added in a feeling from the Dawn of War 2 when it comes to controling units sometimes. However it stays true to its interface format of the one of the CoH so one who played old CoH quickly adapts to this warmachine.It is hard to adapt however becouse tutorioal is SERIOUSLY missing. I really loved that tutorial from the Company of Heroes. It really felt like bootcamp basic training. *rides around on Panzer IV Stubby*The game rewards the hard work. Or does it? I am not particularly sure but: if you like to be rewarded with ingame currency or candy for your completed mission, and its faction you used in game: than it is. if you hate farming the three missions to get a candy, than it aint.Sometimes there are free skins for grabs around, with which you adorn your veichles that you send them to ridicolous death becouse you didnt noticed that it was already turned around and your backdrive command made it turn even more around. If you love to kite around with micromanaging, i will tell you that you are gonna have a lot of fun here. Sending in your units with machinepistols to close combat is rewarding, while your machinegun rains hell from afar. in end however a sad thing is a lot can be won by only one tactic: spam veichles.A bad thing about this game is also the fact that if you buy ONLY THE BASIC... You are gonna have a bad time. A lot of its fun content you have to pay for. but in end it is rather cool.it is definitly a game that deserved grade of 8/10 in the many gaming magazines. However that is, if you have the content bought together in a package...If you dont have main things of extra content. You can grade this game easily to 6.			"

												2015 DecThis game is garbage. It has the distinct stink and aroma of pay2win, and it just WON'T go away.if you don't spend the full $300 dollars to get every commander, you will find it incredibly boring and tiresome playing the vanilla commanders while your opponents play the OP (yet still boring) units of the other commander trees.2016 AugOkay been playing this a lot more with some oldtime coh1 friends. we all finally made the move over because the automatching in coh1 for 3v3 and 4v4 don't work due to lack of players. 2v2 is also pretty slim pickings in coh1. So anyway, thats the reason for the move, and the only reason for the move. coh1 is the better game.But having started playing it a lot now, I can say we are having fun. My chief complaints is still the commander system. Commanders are still so boring. I use one ability (maybe 2) only on any given commander tree. I notice similar from our opposition. Occasionally a commander has an ability that is pretty strong (normally a off-map type call-down) and when they spam the commanders (everyone on the opposite team picking the same) and spam that ability it can decisively turn a game, which sucks...but thats just the nature of these crappy commanders.They really wanted the commanders to be the micro-transaction of the game....which instrinsically meant they had to be dull, weak and boring or else the game gets unbalanced or pay-to-win...which is bad enough, but also due to lack of balance testing resources available for any micro-transaction system applied to game mechanics, it also means an occasional commander ability can produce unforseen results when spammed in big multi player games. So...commanders suck. rest of game is good enough.Going to recommend this game, but only on special (75% off)....and never buy any commanders. Waste of money. Just wait for the in-game rewards drop of one (rare) or use the in-game supply reward purchase (common enough, but accumulates slowly, oh-so-slowly, over time to purchase the commanders)good gaming.

												Okay so here's my review.Take what you want from it.Game as an RTS:8/10.Probably the best RTS that has an ESport scene now.Would like to see more harassment oportunities, and not so overpowered generals.Game as a WW2 experience:9/10.It shows almost every important unit in ww2.Believe me, whatch a ww2 video after playing this, and you will recognize all of the units.Still would like to see more contries like It/Ro/Japan.Sick of german words.Singleplayer.8/10.Its cool to fight in some of the biggest battles that you woud've ever seen.Still, to much 'oh I need this unit before i can move forward'.And also multiplayer scenarios are Really fun with a friend.Multiplayer:8/10:Same as the RTS section.Price:4/10.Yeah. Company of Dlc's.Just buy it from♥♥♥♥♥ you will get it for like 8 euros.Optimization:3/10:Has some serious problems for some intel procesors.I can live with 20 fps to be honest...Conclusion:Buy it from♥♥♥♥♥ watch out for some lag, and enjoy the game.

												Even though Company Of Heroes 2 is seen as old to today standards it has many highlights, not only is the gameplay amazing the graphics are good and the overall effect it has on you whilst playing is outstanding. For any potential buyers there are two things that you should be aware of.  The first thing is the price of the game although it goes on sale, full price is around $60. The second thing you as a buyer needs to be aware of is that it is quite hard to begin with, there are a lot of voncepts and guidelines that you need to remember. All in all COH2 is hands down an amazing game and is worth every penny.			"

												I like this game , as i am a big fan of rts games . I have already played on the first CoH , so it was clear that i will buy the second one as well . I recommend it to everyone who likes this type of strategy , but don't expect the level of thrill which  was given by the first one , because CoH 2 suffers from a huge amount of bugs , and there are always problems with balance  (mostly with the axis factions) . The amount of content  can't be compared to the first game , as most of the new stuff comes as  a dlc. Although it has it's own drawbacks , these are not so serious ones as Lelic works really hard to fix them . Sometimes i hate this game , and sais to myself that i will never play it again , but i always change my mind  after a while , because this game is a lovely one in the way it is  . So if u can keep up with spammers and players who use the most unskilled commanders all the time , then don't hesitate !			"

												If you like WWll real time strategys then you will definitly like this game, it blends a good story line with solid campain gameplay, but the multiplayer/skirmish is somewhat restrictive, like when you move into berlin and you can make Is-2s in the last campain mission, forget about that in skirmish unless you have the right commander, or my suggestion, get some mods. The mods in this game are great, they range from small balenceing tweaks to full on realism, like an MG gunning down 3 conscripts squads in 5 seconds. some of the mods add new units to make it interesting, like one that adds all the units you used in the campain, mods do all sorts of stuff. My overall opinion of this game is that it is really worth buying, i dont have the expanions like the one that adds the US and second german faction, but even without those the game is fun. you should seriously consider buying it if you havent already.

												The downside of this game is the amount of DLC available to buy. This includes alot of new maps, coop/single player missions as well as new armies and commanders for your armies. On the other hand, the DLC is relatively cheap so as long as you don't plan to buy EVERYTHING it shouldn't cost an awful lot to enjoy alot of this game, especially the multiplayer.As i play this mostly online, the game is incredibly fun and very rarely is each match the same. The cover system in coordination with the grenades/rocket uses etc and the different ways to counter the enemy allow for an ever changing game. An example, the enemy germans have bunkered down on a key position, so you build a mortar or 2 in order to force them out of position. The enemy know you have some mortars, so they can either fall back and take a deeper defensive line, try to mortar back or try to flank with their troops or their light vehicles, thus forcing you to retreat. But at the same time, you could have been prepared for a flank with the use of an MG or AT gun sitting just behind the mortars. No matter how you play this game, there will always be a time where you think 'if i'd done this i may have won this encounter'. This game is incredibly fun and will offer hours of gameplay either solo, vs bots or with friends. I definitely recommend this RTS for and RTS fans.			"

												If you enjoy playing multiplayer battles then this is a horrible horrible game. 2 thumbs down. If you choose to play German you win. If you choose to play Allied you lose. Simple as that. One of the most unbalanced games you'll ever find. About the equivalent to playing War Thunder as an American M36 tank destroyer. You have absolutely no chance unless the enemy team is 100% noob...and then you could still lose. Just pitiful.8/28/16: I'm changing my review to a thumbs up. Since my first review the game has underwent some balancing modifications and I'd say it's about even now. The German tanks are still op but if you know what you're doing you can take them out. This is a highly strategical game and a whole lot really depends on your level of experience. Also, if you're in a multiplayer match of 3 vs 3 or 4 vs 4 the number of prestige stars on either side (each prestige star denotes 100 levels) will usually determine who wins or loses. Usually, but not always. You can see I have quite a lot of hours logged on this game. It is a very fun game but can be very very frustrating also. Experience plays a major part when in multiplayer. I recommend this game.			"

												I would highly recommend this game to any RTS fans.  Unlike older RTS games, the Company of Heroes series puts emphasis on combined arms tactics and keeping your troops alive vice the old ""build a bunch of stuff and throw it in a meat grinder"" method of 90s games.  Cover grants troops defensive bonuses and can mean the difference of winning or losing small skirmishes.There are a some changes from the original COH in that there are less chokepoint-like maps and more open terrain.  However, the map editor that is bundled with the game is seeing a lot of the original maps ported over.  Some fans of the original are also unhappy with the DLC that is being release, but the majority of it is cosmetic - vehicle skins, decorative name plates.  The commanders can change things up as no single commander has access to all perks.  However, Relic appears to be tweaking balance as time goes on to prevent overpowered units and tactics.			"

												Excellent and instense tactical combat. Realistic in many ways but also of course, they have to balance some things out to make it a game. There is a counter for everything (which I love) because it makes it different from most other RPG's where you can just mass produce the best unit and demolish the enemy team. In COH2, not so... Everything has a weakness, and it's up to your commanding, tactical and requisition skills to win the battlefield.Offers a great variety of units, and the workshop has many mods that fine tune the gameplay in just about any way you want, even including an all units mod which allows you to build anything your faction has to offer; and the workshop has maps for days.

No body expected relic to follow up the best RTS game of all time with this kind of game but slowly and surely many of the issues with the game have been addressed and whats more because of it not being p2p like the first coh, lagging is no longer an issue. Definitely worth playing if you like strategy games but know that it's the multiplayer and a very unique Theater of War mode (sp and coop) are what this game is worth buying for not for the sp campaign (quite mediocre) unlike sega's Total War games where the reverse can be said to be true...

												Company of Heroes 2 is probebly the best RTS out there.amazing new type of game system were you need to capture and hold terittory to earn resouses and so to get victory.5 full factions (Soviets, Wehrmacht-Germans, Oberkomander West-Germans, Britains and U.S. forces all historicaly based.so thats what makes CoH2 to a super active strategy game and fun as well.but the dark side about CoH2 is the in-game store and all the DLS's and all together it's pretty expensive (so even if you start by puchasing one single part you might end up buying the rest over time).so for the gameplay  10/10!but for the ingame store 6/10 (well you could cosider it a good thing that you can pay only $2.50 for one faction and allready join the multiplayer)EDIT: and i forgot to mention that it's a heavy demanding game that you need a super PC to enjoy the high graphics settings.(i ran it on computers much higher then the required and still couldn't run it smooth on highest settings, and on lowest settings it still pretty demanding)			"

												It's certainly a graphical improvement upon the original Company Of Heroes, and is quite an impressive game. However, some of the mechanics have definitely been changed, and some for the worse. There are definitely some great improvements, such as the temperature changes, environment, and blizzards, all of which are quite interesting. However, the changes to the commander trees and economy are not as interesting, and kind of dumb the game down. Overall, a worthwhile buy while on sale, but maybe less so at full price. Also, the standalone DLC is cool. I'd recommend that if you enjoyed the base game.			"

												I would highly recommend this game to any RTS fans.  Unlike older RTS games, the Company of Heroes series puts emphasis on combined arms tactics and keeping your troops alive vice the old ""build a bunch of stuff and throw it in a meat grinder"" method of 90s games.  Cover grants troops defensive bonuses and can mean the difference of winning or losing small skirmishes.There are a some changes from the original COH in that there are less chokepoint-like maps and more open terrain.  However, the map editor that is bundled with the game is seeing a lot of the original maps ported over.  Some fans of the original are also unhappy with the DLC that is being release, but the majority of it is cosmetic - vehicle skins, decorative name plates.  The commanders can change things up as no single commander has access to all perks.  However, Relic appears to be tweaking balance as time goes on to prevent overpowered units and tactics.			"

												Bottom line:  I put hundreds of hours into the first CoH, but this one has been even more fun and addicting for me!  BEST. WWII AND STRATEGY GAME. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!Company of Heroes 2 is one outstanding RTS game, and easily the best ever made to this point.  I'm estimating I played close to 1,000 hours of Company of Heroes 1, and I do really think they took a great leap forward from that first game (which was also incredible).  There are a number of small improvements in the interface alone that make this new entry in the series TONS more accessible and enjoyable to play.  These few interface additions even multiply the ease of command and diversify your tactical options (such as infantry now being able to hop over walls and fences).  The line of sight update, which means a building now restricts your commmand view of the other side of the building in the fog of war, adds to realistic surprise attacks and ambushes.CoH2's biggest addition, IMO, is the new commander system.  Some people call it pay to win (which is silly--like any other game, it is simply pay to play....you had to buy the game to begin with in order to win, and why should expansions be free?), but it is really just pay to add variety and enjoyment to your game.  There are SOOOOOO many commander choices that the battles are extremely different every time.  Your enemy's commander choice will effect what special units you face on the battlefield, forcing you to adapt and craft new victory plans each time.The new Theater of War mode is also great.  These are unique scenario challenges that really change the game's experience.  From sniper hunts to giant tank battles to wave defenses, this mode provides WWII action that is different from what you'd experience in normal multiplayer.  Quite a few of these mission are also co-op fun with friends.  They are also historically based.The graphics are also a VERY big leap forward.  This is a gorgeous game all around.  I also appreciate the ability to choose camo paints for vehicles, adding the visuals and bringing some nice variety to the game and personalization.  The sound is also top notch, from great explosive effects to the always comical chatter among soldiers.  The men under your command have a great sense of humor.For those new to the series, it may be a lot to learn, but success in this game is immensely rewarding.  For veterans of the first game, expect more of the same great WWII combat!*NOTE: The new Western Front Armies expansion has made this game twice as good as it was at release!!!  New workshop features add thousands of maps to play on as well.			"

												Fun to play Campaign, however some of the Theater of War missions are so annoying that it's no fun to play them, take for example ""Kharkov Pursuit"" if you google it, you'll find that many CoH2 players find this mission annoying and unrealistic, considering that Partisans carry Panzerschrecks when these missions are suppose to be in 1941?  And the Panzerschrecks came out only in 1943? LOL.Haven't purchased Ardennes assault as the price of it is just outrageous.It has been a while now since they introduced workshop to the game and a lot has changed, there are many mods that allow to use all units or reduce the pop cap value of tanks and other units. Most of these mods improve the game some break the balance between nations. Also loads of cool maps to play once you get bored of campaign and Theather of war missions.I still think that the game is a bit basic, they should let you build airfields and use planes instead of calling in airstrikes and recon flight planes. Great game to play solo but even better if you have friends to play it with you, as many of the Theater of war missions are Co-op missions. You can use AI but we all know that AI is not the same as playing with your friends where you co-ordinate defenses and launch massive assault on enemy base etc...			"

												WAIT TILL THE PRICE DROPS!They took the basics from the first game and made it look a little nicer. A few tweeks with new skins and you have COH 2. I want to be able to build a defensive bunker or other basic stuctures without being forced to play as the Germans dammit!The game is good but thats only because its very similar to the first one. It doesnt feel new at all and left me feeling like there was somthing missing. I would not buy this game until the price drops! The current 40$ is way to steep. The fact that they are releasing an almost equally expensive expansion just so you can access the US military seems dirty to me. The first COH was made with passion and changed RTS's in my mind while COH 2 feels more like a money grab. I would have paid $100 for a good sequel to COH.			"

The Multiplayer is easily the best part of the game with fun fast paced and intense battles, with a lot of awsome maps and different Camander loadouts to make the game fun... Plus veicle skins are so SEXY! Company of heros 2 dosent live up to the 1st game but it is still incredbly fun. Company of Heros is coming out with a new stand alone expansion in june releasing the western armys of America and the Oberkomando West. I would recomend this game mostly to WW2 buffs.But overall i would give this game a 8/10.			"

												I have always loved RTS games and espcially ones the either are only WW2 or ones that have that era in it. And this was my first  time playing Company of Heroes. I decide to test this game out because of the free weekend before actually buying it and this is what i think. I liked it but there are some aspects with this game that either don't make sense or just plain annoying. I was playing as the Germans and I got into a fire fight with some Russian Infantry. I had two Pioneer squads and they had to fight one Conscript squad. My guys where a bit far to get good results so I sent them pretty much point blank because i figured that since my guys have smgs and they had bolt action rifles my guys would tear them up. No, that wasnt the case the russians who were not well trained because of the unit type who where literraly outgunned managed to kill half of one of my squads before i killed one of their men. This was at point blank range and my guys for some reason couldnt hit them. They eventualy did but for crying out loud that was just ridiculus. I've played other rts games that are much older with better ai than that. As for ally A.I. they were absolutey useless. It helped at the begining but when I needed help the most it would not send anything espcially when there is a tank near by that is his and could very easially send support. It would keep large amounts of units at the base espcially tanks and I had to fight enemy by myself. Again better ai in older games. All in all even though there are quite few annoying aspects the game it is still pretty fun espcially the artillery and that reason alone is why i would still recommend this game.			"

												Another great game from Relic. Major improvements and more user friendly. Nail biting missions and not to forget Theatre of War. The game gives a first hand impression of gruesome Eastern Front and bloody fight for every inch of MotherLand! Again great singleplayer story. Still many important events missing in Single player missions like Kursk, Battle of Leningrad, Seelow Height and so on.. A new and great idea of bringing Theatre of War giving indepth glimpse of cruel war from both sides. Balancing is still a major issue. The improved sights is also awesome showing only what your men can see! Also challenging multiplayer maps where the player has to also keep a watch on weather and not just on enemy. But at the end a truly awesome game to play even with some issues......			"

												The core of the game is great - better than CoH1.  It's more visceral,  more responsive, and just more satisfying.  The negatives of this game are all held in it's wrapper.  The UI, while mostly efficient and functional, to me just feels like a rough edge throughout.  There are some welcome changes made from CoH1 - namely unit's being already extended and easy to grab in the HUD.  Otherwise though, the  UI feels rough an forced to me, which unfortunately is the same thing with the Campaign.  Although the actual missions are overall very well done; good mix of challenge and reward, the story and crappy CG cutscenes are definitely something you should skip.  When you sit down and think of why you play a game though, it's not for the cutscenes or the UI - it's for watching your infantry throw a molotov at an enemy machine gun emplacement, and really feeling them burn.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.			"

												Maybe one of the worst RTS games I have ever played.It's like you are supposed to play every mission once just to check out what kinda troops the enemy will send and from where because if you have wrong troops or in wrong places you can't win. So the second time you will have a chance to win it when you know what will happen. And of course the game also has autosaves but there is no time to make any changes to your defenses after them so they are mostly useless.The only fun part of the campaign is the missions where you are supposed to attack. There you can actually plan your attacks without time limits. In defense ones the enemy will just attack way too fast. When the game tells you that the enemy is launching attacks you won't have enough time to make troops or plan your defense. The only way would be to know where the scripted attacks start so you could place your units in positions before it happens.There is also annoying bugs with pathfinding or something like that. Your troops will just run back and forth around some obstacle and won't stop unless you order them to move again.Haven't tried to multiplayer at all. Maybe that makes the game better for the players who like multiplayer stuff.			"

												Where should i start? Russian nuclear fire? It can wipe all your units in one throw and there is nothing you can do about it.  How about russians ability to run through mg-42's and drop molotovs on you and swat you like a fly. Then there was this time when my 2 fully upgraded squads with veterancy 2 went up against a russian squad (one of my guys was on full cover while his was running in) and he wiped both out and he use no abilitys. This games needs alot of work russians need nerfed. i have played alot of games and it ends up being the same everytime. Russians build units run them through machine gunners throw fire then mass produce tanks.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 does everything in its power to appear over ten years out of date. You can only move the camera by holding down the middle mouse button and pressing the ARROW KEYS. Good luck rebinding the controls, because you can't do that.

This makes sure that you frequently lose your fireteams and have no idea of what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening in the course of the battle. This renders the game virtually unplayable, which is a shame because there is a wonderful strategy game trying to come out of here and deliver fun, exciting WWII action worthy of The Longest Day or Enemy at the Gates.

												Company of Heroes 2 is a RTS based in the WWII time frame with different factions based on actual powers at the time. To sum it up you have USF (United States Forces), UKF (United Kingdom Forces), the Soviets (namely because I don't remember what they are called in game), the Wehrmacht (glorious German defense force), and the Oberkommando (more glorious German soldiers).Each faction has it's own perks (but if you ask me UKF is the most annoying), and  you start off with Wehrmacht and the Soviets. The DLC is a bit costly but if you go to sites like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you can get the full game and the majority of its DLC for a good price. Last I checked one of the major bundles was a 26$ pack that came with the full game and a bunch of DLC which allows you to play as the other factions.Pros:-Tons of fun-Skill oriented-Good knowledge = good games-Has Germany-Displays the glorious Iron Cross-Has the wonderful German engineering (as well as other nation's pathetic attempts at making tanks and whatnot)-High replayability-High learning curve as it requires more knowledge than other RTSsCons:-High learning curve as it requires more knowledge than other RTSs-Germany is not OP atm-UKF is annoying as hell-Costs a lot to access everything in the game if you don't use sites like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>-You might spend too much time playing instead of doing what you should be doing-Germans/Lovers of Germany get called Nazis from time to time despite not all of Germany being filled with Nazis. That was primairily the Waffen-SS, people.-Your first games online will be tough as the gaming community isn't as big as it could be so there are a lot of fully leveled vets in game.-Bulletins improve your army, but atm it is a random drop system and you can't choose what you want to get. (On the bright side Relic has said they will be changing the system soon so this con will eventually become obsolete.-You can't play as Germany in the campaign.-RNG can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥from time to time.-Recommending a site that lowers what you pay for the overpriced microtransactions is not okay according to this place. Overall, it is a fantastic game and I recommend it to anyone who loves RTS games as it has kept me hooked for hours and I can tell you right now that that 41.9 hrs spent on this game is probably going to double within the next two weeks. It is well worth the price. (I still recommend checking a discount site though.)			"

												As an RTS player I absolutely love this game! It is quite different when it comes to the combat system with infantry, as it is a bit more complicated than the other RTS games. I played the original CoH and imagined a new version of the game being a lot more in-depth, and then it came out just as I imagined. If a normal RTS is a little bit too simple, this is a game for you!			"

												I've always been a fan of Company of Heroes 1. It was just an awesome game and we loved to play it the whole day. Anyone who enjoyed the first CoH will love this one as well. They improoved many things but also removed a few. You can not build as much defence structures as you could in CoH 1. For few people this might be something good, or they don't care about it, because they play very offensive anyways, but for me, building a defensive fortress was always a big part of the game. Another thing is, that if you want to play as the US, you'll  have to buy the DLC wich will arrive very soon, but I think that must have been a part of the main game already. Apart from that it is a brilliant game. The performance is way better then in CoH 1 and they improoved the balancing, which makes it aviable vor competition gaming.			"

												WAIT TILL THE PRICE DROPS!They took the basics from the first game and made it look a little nicer. A few tweeks with new skins and you have COH 2. I want to be able to build a defensive bunker or other basic stuctures without being forced to play as the Germans dammit!The game is good but thats only because its very similar to the first one. It doesnt feel new at all and left me feeling like there was somthing missing. I would not buy this game until the price drops! The current 40$ is way to steep. The fact that they are releasing an almost equally expensive expansion just so you can access the US military seems dirty to me. The first COH was made with passion and changed RTS's in my mind while COH 2 feels more like a money grab. I would have paid $100 for a good sequel to COH.			"

												Company of Heroes is a brilliant RTS! While I never got a chance to play the original COH, COH 2 really impresses me with its great weather affects, a good campaign, and challenging levels. Along with the AI been very smart and affective in engaing and making desicions; I had been in a game with 4 Human players vs 4 AI and the AI gave us a very tough match. You will not be disapointed in this game, a great historic time to put it in, along with so much content you will be playing for a long time. Company of Heroes 2 is excellent game, one I feel more people should give it a shot. Pick it up as soon as you can! Its worth easily the sale price as well full price.			"

												I have always loved RTS games and espcially ones the either are only WW2 or ones that have that era in it. And this was my first  time playing Company of Heroes. I decide to test this game out because of the free weekend before actually buying it and this is what i think. I liked it but there are some aspects with this game that either don't make sense or just plain annoying. I was playing as the Germans and I got into a fire fight with some Russian Infantry. I had two Pioneer squads and they had to fight one Conscript squad. My guys where a bit far to get good results so I sent them pretty much point blank because i figured that since my guys have smgs and they had bolt action rifles my guys would tear them up. No, that wasnt the case the russians who were not well trained because of the unit type who where literraly outgunned managed to kill half of one of my squads before i killed one of their men. This was at point blank range and my guys for some reason couldnt hit them. They eventualy did but for crying out loud that was just ridiculus. I've played other rts games that are much older with better ai than that. As for ally A.I. they were absolutey useless. It helped at the begining but when I needed help the most it would not send anything espcially when there is a tank near by that is his and could very easially send support. It would keep large amounts of units at the base espcially tanks and I had to fight enemy by myself. Again better ai in older games. All in all even though there are quite few annoying aspects the game it is still pretty fun espcially the artillery and that reason alone is why i would still recommend this game.			"

At the start there was a few bugs but since then the game has been sorted by relic and there is a strong community with constant updates with new content sometimes free or DLC the game is more multiplayer focused as the campaign although enjoyable is a bit linear so if you’re going to buy jump on the multiplayer and watch your life be wasted away.

												The game held some kind of promise on release, but with every patch the game was affected negatively. The original single player campaign was balanced for the state of the game as it was released, and then promptly was ignored and orphaned.If you must buy a game, the original Company of Heroes is a much better choice, as is the original Dawn of War. With, of course, all the expansions for both games. Given the age on both of these titles, you should wait for a sale.If you MUST buy Company of Heroes 2, do so on a sale, particularly because of the IN GAME STORE with MICROTRANSACTIONS (not listed in the store page) on each and every little thing. Pretty much every decent commander is realistically held behind a few extra dollars EACH. The scary thing is that underneath all of this, a good game could be beaten out of what's here, but as far as I've seen, modding support is not to the point where one could totally convert the game into solid gold - unlike the titles listed previously in this review. Its likely this is the case because of the microtransactions.I've already put too much effort into this review, so to keep it short - don't waste your money or time on this title, you'd be better off trying to mod DOTA 2 into Warcraft 3.

												I am trying to like this but it is just a bit, well boring? The story is a bit dull and I am struggling to see any improvements over the first game. If anything it feels like there are less features from the first game and plays a lot worse. The factions do not seem that complete and do not offer anything really interesting. Units act kind of dumb and never set up where you tell them to or stick in cover. If I am honest, if you bought this cause you wanted to experience the Eastern Front and play with Soviet Units you are much better off grabbing Opposing Fronts with the Eastern Fronts mod. It is a lot more fun and replayable. Also I swear some of the units and skins are literally ports from that mod which makes me question how much effort actually went into making this game?Now if you want to actually have a good game though get Spearhead Mod since that actually makes this game playable. Tired of Infantry blobs charging past MG's? Tired of Wehrboo Panzers with 6 gorillion mm of frontal armour? Tired of P2W DLC Commanders? Actually want tactics and proper thinking? Get Spearhead Mod; while it has it's own issues it fixes more things than it breaks gameplay wise.			"

												When there's a game, and that game say, Company of Heroes 2 has a few nations that you play in a multiplayer based strategy, game then there's going to be diiferent ways of learning to play those nations.  But today we're not here to talk about COH2 we are here to talk about a little kid named Jimmy.  Now Jimmy is a little kid that just bought company of heroes 2 with his mom's credit card, and little Jimmy decides to go ahead and play his first multiplayer game as let's say, the Axis (Germany in this case).Now Jimmy plays this and he picks up on the quick and fast paced aggressiveness of the Germans fairly quickly.  But next Jimmy decides to go play as on of the Allied powers (USSR this time).  But what Jimmy didn't realize is that maybe all nations weren't created for the same aggressive purpose as Germany was, so little Jimmy lost his second game of Company of Heroes 2, and decided to leave a bad review about the Allies being underpowered and the Germans being overpowered.  But in reality little butthurt Jimmy didn't give himself (and the Allies) the time they needed for him to create a strategy for him to roll over the Germans with guerilla hit and run tactics, but instead jumped to conclusions and wrote an 'inconclusive' review.  I'll tell you why it's inconclusive. It's inconclusive because Jimmy's little (now butthurt) brain is only used to being aggressive and rushing his enemies with overwhelming force.  But Jimmy's brain doesn't think about how the little guy reacts to these attacks, (maybe not always in the 'right way') and Jimmy continues his attacks.  But.  When the little guy does develop a plan-and on Jimmy's 43rd game of playing Germany, when Jimmy finally thinks hes got it.  He sees it.  Penals with flamethrowers in an M3 half-track.  Jimmy thinks to himself ""oh that's interesting"", and hits it with a panzerfaust, and Jimmy's infantry is pinned by a nearby maxim.  Oh what's that? Here come the penals.  Jimmy finally loses.  On his 43rd straight game.  A 43 win streak and he is beaten.  Jimmy then writes another review that the Germans are now underpowered, and explains more about his double butthurtness (In both ends).  This process goes on for almost 3 years, with back and forth reviews about who is over/underpowered.  Relic desperately tries to find a medium and can't.  But that's the thing.  Shouldn't we as the players use an RTS as an RTS? Shouldn't we devise a plan or a strategy/strategies throughout the game? The answer is yes.  It is people like Jimmy who have wrecked this beautiful game.  I fully recommend this game and all of its glory 10/10-Pixo, 8.4/10-IGN, 8/10-PC Gamer, 4/5-Metacritic.  If you made it thus far in the review don't forget to leave your opinion of what you thought of my review with a thumbs up or down.			"

												Another great game from Relic. Major improvements and more user friendly. Nail biting missions and not to forget Theatre of War. The game gives a first hand impression of gruesome Eastern Front and bloody fight for every inch of MotherLand! Again great singleplayer story. Still many important events missing in Single player missions like Kursk, Battle of Leningrad, Seelow Height and so on.. A new and great idea of bringing Theatre of War giving indepth glimpse of cruel war from both sides. Balancing is still a major issue. The improved sights is also awesome showing only what your men can see! Also challenging multiplayer maps where the player has to also keep a watch on weather and not just on enemy. But at the end a truly awesome game to play even with some issues......			"

												This game has an average, forgetable single player campaign that, despite what Russians say, accurately reflects the war on the Eastern Front. But COH2 really shines in multiplaayer,where it gives the most intense online battles ever! Its like a more intelligent, tactical/strategic version of Starcraft. Not only that but the customizable armies and the bonus Theater of War single player/co-op content really makes this game one of my favorite. So despite a sort of lame campaign and a few balance issues that need to be worked out, I highly recommend it.			"

As the harbinger of ""Good Times"" my little russian patriots have fought tooth and nail against the germans and I've always felt an inevitable pride swell when I was able to finally out-play already strong german armies but this time is long past. These last few balances have really had an impact on the multiplayer play of Russia to such an extent that the faction I would consider to be unbalanced if not completely broken. Example 1:Okay, the three upgraded conscript squads (PPSH) I have in full cover are guarding a single SU-76 currently doing a bombard. One german panzershrek squad with 2 launchers (Not even full health) runs in head on into the fire and SITS in no cover and manages to fire 4 shreks over 10 seconds. TAKES ZERO DAMAGE and manages to retreat while destroying the SU-76.  Example 2: Pathing is a problem. The ""Reverse"" button causes russian light vehicles to back up before turning on the spot unlike German tanks. Using a ""Meatgrinder"" reverse causes you to travel almost the full vehicles length exposing you to side shots from AT and Shreks, needs fixing..Example 3: Manpower Surplus. The recent boost to OKW and Wehrmact manpower negates the ability for the Russians to get any type of advantage through numbers in the beginning leading to a ""snowball effect"" of superior german arms and numbers. Example 4: The Russian MG is garbage, if you like wide firing arcs (WHICH EVERYONE ELSE HAS) don't touch this nation. Example 5: The Russian Mortar is garbage. Unless you specifically go for the big boy you suffer from reduced accuracy reduced fire rate and reduced damage for near well the same price as the German 88. I mean the list goes on. This review still tries to shine a positive light on COH because like I stated I love the game I just hate seeing Relic butcher one side to appease the streamers who pre-dominately play German.FIX THIS.

												Decent sequel bogged down by endless DLC.  As a lot of simliarity with COH1 if you like that youll prolly like this.  This one is however more complicated with the many different commanders (thats where the DLC comes in, usually recycled abilities). Less DLC and more quality content please, stop the money grab.			"

												The game definitely started out poorly.  Bugs and imbalance everywhere and the DLC doctrines were pay2win.  However, now that the game has had some time to develope it has become just as fun as the first COH.  The only thing it's missing is another 2 factions and hopefully those will come at some point and this game can reach the glorious position that the original COH had.  I firmly believe the COH franchise still holds the most fun rts formula to date.  If you've never played it, now is the time to start because the community in COH2 is still pretty fresh unlike the first nowadays.			"

												Ah...Company of Heroes 2.... A MUST OWN for every rts fan out there. Pay what you want, get only what you need. but beware, this can cost quite a lot if you want everything. I personally wanted the germans OKW, and thats what i did. I only bought them, so i cant play commies or wehrmacht. The gameplay itself is VERY INTENSE and require a good management of troops, fast thinking. if you have your mind away for 5 mins its over. You can play pvp or pve, matchaking or public. Latelly ive been heavily focused on Public because of the awesome mods and the awesome maps. Numberless tactics you can use, troop upgrades, different gamestyles, different doctrines. its just huge!Overall, 7.5/10 very good game , nice graphics. There are maybe some balances issues (between players) but its still very good.			"

												This is my opinion and some things I would like to change, please don't judge.PROS:- Great graphics- Great community- Lots of problems fixed to this dateCONS:- Not having an option to play against yourself in custom game without fog of war (for example you control both US forces on one side and germans on other side and you have fun that way building whatever you want, testing some strategies etc.)- Soldiers shooting at eachother from 1 meter away and cannot hit eachother ( I understand that if fights like this were completely realistic then soldiers would die instantly, but just a little bit of more realism would be nice imo, soldier shooting is too inaccurate).- Tanks complicate too much when you want to retreat from fight against AT (soldiers) and tanks, they turn 180 degrees leaving their vulnarable rear armor open for easy shots, huge damage and easy kills instead of just going reverse while front armor is facing the enemy.- Commanders to damn expensive and if you are not willing to pay extra to get those most popular and strongest commanders you will lose so hard.- Some commanders way OP- Terrible cheating AI- German tanks OP if you ask me- If you enjoy having those long lasting battles,then soviets are bad choice to play with, from my experience, if you want to win with soviets you have to rush hard at the very beginning, when for example (decent) enemy player playing with germans brings tanks, it is game over. I like soviets and playing like this is not making me happy.- Bulletins are sh*t.- Spending money on faceplates? Cmon- Indirect fire weapons too damn OP!- Soviet molotovs literally uselessI could go on and on, but don't have time typing everything...Would I still recommend this game? Yes, especially if it is on sale.			"

												Great game. Always new contect getting relased and they have plans to support the game for years so you shouldn't get bored with plenty of single and multiplayer content already and planned to come in the future. If your looking for a newe strategy game to get into this is the one to pick up. aAs for most of the other reviews crying Pay2Win it simply isn't true.Tthe content you can buy simply adds new ways to play or have no effect on gameplay, much like heroes in moba's, some times they get relased a bit too strong but they are eventually fixed to bring them in line with the rest of the commanders. If your looking for a game that will provide fun for hours on end this game has it and won't be the same game a year from now as new content is relased, so even if a bad patch comes you can always ride it out till it gets fixed.I am a top 100 player for both factions			"

												Maybe one of the worst RTS games I have ever played.It's like you are supposed to play every mission once just to check out what kinda troops the enemy will send and from where because if you have wrong troops or in wrong places you can't win. So the second time you will have a chance to win it when you know what will happen. And of course the game also has autosaves but there is no time to make any changes to your defenses after them so they are mostly useless.The only fun part of the campaign is the missions where you are supposed to attack. There you can actually plan your attacks without time limits. In defense ones the enemy will just attack way too fast. When the game tells you that the enemy is launching attacks you won't have enough time to make troops or plan your defense. The only way would be to know where the scripted attacks start so you could place your units in positions before it happens.There is also annoying bugs with pathfinding or something like that. Your troops will just run back and forth around some obstacle and won't stop unless you order them to move again.Haven't tried to multiplayer at all. Maybe that makes the game better for the players who like multiplayer stuff.			"

												The core of the game is great - better than CoH1.  It's more visceral,  more responsive, and just more satisfying.  The negatives of this game are all held in it's wrapper.  The UI, while mostly efficient and functional, to me just feels like a rough edge throughout.  There are some welcome changes made from CoH1 - namely unit's being already extended and easy to grab in the HUD.  Otherwise though, the  UI feels rough an forced to me, which unfortunately is the same thing with the Campaign.  Although the actual missions are overall very well done; good mix of challenge and reward, the story and crappy CG cutscenes are definitely something you should skip.  When you sit down and think of why you play a game though, it's not for the cutscenes or the UI - it's for watching your infantry throw a molotov at an enemy machine gun emplacement, and really feeling them burn.  Buy it.  Play it.  Love it.			"

												To anyone who's intimidated by the negative reviews, don't let it.  They're salty about being charged for vehicle skins that have no impact on gameplay, usually.  The faction commanders do cost a lot ($4 before tax), but if all you do is buy the DLC and faction commanders, you won't be spending as much as the negative reviews make it sound (especially if you get them on sale, which is surprisingly common...on a singular basis, anyway).To all those who complain that they're out for your money, guess what: YOU'RE RIGHT.  THEY'RE A COMPANY.  IT'S WHAT THEY DO.  So please stop complaining about what they charge and learn to be thankful for what you get, charged or otherwise.  and if you don't like it, here's another thing; YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT.			"

												This game is a decent opener to anyone who is new to RTS games, and is great fun for those who are experienced in the genre. Yes, it's true, the game is riddled with DLC, but it's not a game where the DLC gives you much of an advantage over your opponent. Plus, if your truly like the game, there should be no problem with purchasing cheap DLC (no one is forcing you to buy any extra content). The game mechanics are great compared to the first CoH, graphics are impressive, and the gameplay, once you get used to the game, is wonderful. It's an intense RTS with extraordinary capabilities once the Western Front Armies are introduced, adding even more to an immersive game.			"

												Company of Heroes is a brilliant RTS! While I never got a chance to play the original COH, COH 2 really impresses me with its great weather affects, a good campaign, and challenging levels. Along with the AI been very smart and affective in engaing and making desicions; I had been in a game with 4 Human players vs 4 AI and the AI gave us a very tough match. You will not be disapointed in this game, a great historic time to put it in, along with so much content you will be playing for a long time. Company of Heroes 2 is excellent game, one I feel more people should give it a shot. Pick it up as soon as you can! Its worth easily the sale price as well full price.			"

												Company of Heroes 2 is a great World War Two themed Real Time Strategy game with a strong focus on combat. Amazingly detailed mechanics and physics, especially the dynamics of taking cover behind world objects and that you have to use variety and tactics to survive most encounters, makes this a very uniquely designed realistic and fun War experience in both Multiplayer and Singleplayer.

												Lets beggin with expensive DLCs that you can just wait some discount to buy them (or if you feel free to waste money, then go on). Then we have awesome match maker who will put you in fight with people who are 100th level of 3rd prestige while you are still under 1st prestige. Even if it says that it will put you in fight with players of ""similar skill"".... yeah right :)))) And then we have some units that are simply OP to others, but they are expensive as♥♥♥♥♥♥so other team can gather stuff enought to defeat that OP thing (for example until Oberkommando sent Tiger 2, Soviets can stack up on lots of T-34 and Infantry so Tiger 2 can be lost in vain). But gameplay is good and if you play with people similar to your level it is actualy pretty fun. Game is all about tactics and not rushing in like crazy, if you do that, you will lose for sure. So this game relys on strategy, team play, etc. So overall game is fun and fair when you play with people similar level as you, but it isnt when it get you with people 3 times larger level than you are. Matchmaker doesnt do that often but it happens. Ok now lets get to single-player. First of all officers standing in home base killing your soldiers when they retreat is so annoying... And this game... I dont know... like it defends Nazis claming that those 20 million + Soviet people were actualy mostly killed by Order 227 and not by Nazis. While in reality Order 227 was only done on aprox. 150 000 Soviet soldiers during entire war but only 15% were killed and Order 227 was mostly sending Soldiers that retreated in prisons or Shtrafbat units (Shtrafbat units are units who do most dangerous jobs and are not allowed to retreat or else will be shot... them and not real Soviet soldiers. They were mostly prisoners that are promissed freedom after war is done if they survive. But when it is soldier in question, if he does mission and survive, he will be returned to his squad). Ok, I dont mean Relic is defending Nazis... that was a joke... chill.... I think they digged on surfice only and actualy didnt care that much about that... but those officers are annoying as ♥♥♥♥. And main character acts like they do that for no reason and that they are actualy agressor and not Nazi Germany... So also gameplay is gr8 m8 but story sucks a bit and officers are annoying. So in conclusion game is fun and good but there are some annoying stuff. Probably most of you wont even read this :((((And I dont care :)))) No one cares :))))			"

												CoH 2 is a good strategy game based in II WW . Its allows to see war from soviet perspective. The story is simple and itsn't original but the story isn't also bad. As a strategy game Company of Heroes is one of the best in II WW universe. The system of commands and managment is simple and clear, what is definitive for plus. You can bulid bulidings, collect resources and make a defensive objects. But the main part of CoH is a fight and this is a masterpiece. Fighting is effective and fast. The view of a explodions is  perfect. There are a lots of units to command, from simple soliders to tanks. The missions are interesting.  In conclusion, every fan of strategy games should play in Company of Heroes 2 "

												hmm lets see..Well the game is cool with its mechanics, graphics, physics etc. If there's someone who really loves RTS games then its impossible for him/ her to not get this for their own library. The game's gameplay is quite worth for its prize (not including DLCs), but there's a badass side; the game is poorly optimized and many are wishing for the devs to do action and fix various problems like fps drops and crashes that happens in-game. But still its 10/10 for me :)			"

												Fun to play Campaign, however some of the Theater of War missions are so annoying that it's no fun to play them, take for example ""Kharkov Pursuit"" if you google it, you'll find that many CoH2 players find this mission annoying and unrealistic, considering that Partisans carry Panzerschrecks when these missions are suppose to be in 1941?  And the Panzerschrecks came out only in 1943? LOL.Haven't purchased Ardennes assault as the price of it is just outrageous.It has been a while now since they introduced workshop to the game and a lot has changed, there are many mods that allow to use all units or reduce the pop cap value of tanks and other units. Most of these mods improve the game some break the balance between nations. Also loads of cool maps to play once you get bored of campaign and Theather of war missions.I still think that the game is a bit basic, they should let you build airfields and use planes instead of calling in airstrikes and recon flight planes. Great game to play solo but even better if you have friends to play it with you, as many of the Theater of war missions are Co-op missions. You can use AI but we all know that AI is not the same as playing with your friends where you co-ordinate defenses and launch massive assault on enemy base etc...			"

												I love the game, however my friend bought Ardennes assault and unknowingly got JUST a single player game for 40 dollars. The store page makes no effort to let the purchaser know that they are not buying the mulitplayer access. They essentially split western front armies (multiplayer dlc) and Ardennes assault (single player dlc) what should be two parts of the same whole, and sold it to people seperately. Moreover the latter part doesn't include a multiplayer army, so if you purchase JUST ardennes assault, you will be completely unable to play multiplayer.			"

												If you enjoyed the original COH then this may be a slight disappointment because it doesn't really move the franchise on. There is little new under the bonnet, more just a respray which as the original was excellent is not all bad.Single player is not really where it is at but at least there you face AI as dumb as the AI of your own units which dioesn't really ruin the experience but when you get into multiplayer, especially 3v3 or 4v4 it is a real issue.The biggest strength of the game is also its biggest weakeness you see - the constant micromanagement.While that adds skill and depth to unit on unit firefights and tactics and perhaps to the strategy overall for hardcore players it is a bit of an issue for most players because the AI is beyond bad on units you do not micro.In many years of gaming AI seems to have gone backward in games and COH2 is the dumbest of the dumb.This leads to enormous furstration as units will simply stand and die while you are away. MG's won't fire or resposition or even run if a unit is stood 1 inch aay outside their arc of fire. Apparently they don't realise they are being shot by somebody stood next to them.It is the same with other units that need a facing order too and althought the fanboys will tell you it is part of the micromanagement it is clearly bad programming. You don't need the aI to be smarter than the player but asking them to face an enemy that is shooting them can't be too much can it? Or at least understand you are being shot and react in some way.It is even worse with tanks, especially SU85's and slow turning tanks, I find them almost unusable on busy maps unles i use them more as artillery toward the rear and fairly static. Even micro managing a single tank is not possible half the time as the AI countermands your orders constantly to do something dumb when more than one enemy unit is around.Give an attack order on an enemy tank 5 degrees to your left - expect it to turn 355 degrees right instead (Except it dies from a shot to the rear before that happens). If there are troops around the AI will not only ignore the enemy tank  you desperately order it to attack, it will constantly turn its weakest part of armour to it order to take a pot shot at non threatening low value target and yes die. Sometimes you will battle with the AI repeatedly reordering it to attack a target while the aI repeatedly has worse suicidal ideas and does the opposite. It ends with your tank traversing left and right on the spot and yes dying.Same with the pathfinding. Give your troops orders without micromanaging their route and expect them to go the worse possible way. Want them to go 30 yards left, nah they would rather go the opposite way and into enemy territory and die to get there the long waya round. Some maps are not too bad but others it is a nightmare.My advice don't bother unless the game is real cheap on sale. The developers could have fixed many of these issues over the 1 year+ the game has been out but they have been too busy making paid DLC apparently.Certainly I won't be buying anymore of their games based on previous history of a franchise.

The content seems lacking from COH I, but the core mechanics are still there.The DLC whoring almost broke it for me though. Seriously, it's nuts. THAT was why I didn't get it day one, and I feel enraged that I can't get my beloved Tiger tank without shelling out another 3.99 for it. THAT is garbage.

												Review only for Single Player, as I haven't had much time with multiplayer. IF my feelings about the multiplayer are drastically different, I will include them in comments. The campaign is good, better than the first game. Story isn't half-bad, could be better, but it is better than the first games imo. Way better music, better graphics, it runs pretty good. I have an older  high-mid tier gaming rig, and I play on a hybrid of high-highest (not max) at 1080p with dips every-now and then, but its easily playable.  The animations, and movements of soldiers seems more life-like than the last game. The air support is really cool to watch!Performance has increased slightly since launch through patches. Though you will need a decent rig if you really want to play this game. It will need some resources.  At the beginning of each map/mission, I have to move the camera around at horizon level, to make sure the game finishes loading, which usually smooths out the performance a good deal. I prefer this one to the first game. It has more atmosphere imo. I love the weather effects, and Ice. I haven't used the German forces yet. But I am almost done with the campaign, and have played a few of the Theater of War missions. I don't regret pre-ordering it, and recommend it to fans of the series. I hear the mulitplayer can use some balancing, which is one reason why I have waited to get on that.  "

The multiplayer is also the best of any RTS computer game to date, banding together and fighting your way to victory, there is no better gaming experience. 5 stars!			"

												With over 700 Hours on record for this game, I have a few things to say about it. 1) This game is my favourite RTS and in my opinion it blows COH1 out of the water, the combat is just so awesome... and to those people who say it isn't balanced, well you just suck, its all about how you play in this game, you can beat a King Tiger with a T-34 and beat a  IS-2 with a Panzer 4 if you use it right so don't go saying its imbalanced. 2) Lots of people say this game got ruined by adding a ton of DLC you have to buy, (At first it was like that) but it has changed, you actually have to play to unlock commanders and other bonuses the only thing you have to purchase is the Other nations (Both come together) which is relatively cheap, I mean, I got the game and the Western armies DLC for under $30NZ all together and just played to get all the commanders which were previously DLC. 3) i've played this game so much and NEVER... EVER had a bug that made it so I couldn't play, so to those people that say the game is full of bugs... Maybe its just your computer eh?!? (Maybe stop watching porn and getting all those bugs and viruses you all complain about ya idoits)I have thousands of games and to anyone reading this review, COH2 is one of the Few games i've never stopped playing, i've made of ton of friends and enjoyed playing, enjoyed winning, and enjoyed getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked. So if you like WW2 RTS games, this is for sure the game you want.. if not...♥♥♥♥♥♥off			"
