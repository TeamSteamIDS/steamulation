OverviewThe Escapists is a game about escaping prison. You play as one of the prisoners in a variety of different prisons. Despite its initial appearance, the game has an extreme level of depth and even the prison listed as Very Easy (Center Perks) is hard enough that I have yet to escape.Speaking of escaping, there are many methods of doing so, but almost anything you do can be traced back to you by the guards. You can steal plastic knives from the cafeteria and cut the vent open in your cell - but they'll trace it to you. You can climb onto the roof - but you'll get sniped by the guards in the towers. You can dig a tunnel towards the outer fence - but you might leave dirt lying around and the warden will have the hole caved in.You can perform favors for other prisoners to get money, which can be used to buy things from other prisoners. Favors might involve beating down another inmate or taking an item. Many items are illegal (red name) and you will be sent to solitary confinement if you are found with one or one is found in your desk during a cell search.Life in The Escapists is all about keeping the guards off of you, and to do that, you must follow prison routine. In the morning is roll call - you must attend this or the entire prison will be put into lockdown. You also have a job that you must do. The following is the routine on the first prison, Center Perks: Morning Roll Call Breakfast Free Time  Lunch Work, or Leisure if unemployed Exercise Showers Evening Meal Evening Free Time Evening Roll Call Lights OutYou also have skills that can be used. Speed determines your attack speed, strength your attack damage, and intellect is your crafting smarts. You find crafting recipes through notes you can buy (or steal from others), and these stats can be raised in different ways but degrade over time.But this review is getting long, and I don't want to explain every aspect of this game, so let me list off some pros and cons.Pros Very in-depth; great variety of items Large variety; many ways to escape Flavorful; lots of chatting and makes the prison seem real Complete feeling; feels like a full game even in early accessCons Buggy; sometimes there are bugs, like guards shouting at you to get to work while you are at work or people you can't interact with whatsover, i.e. infirmary staff or the warden Solitary; if something is traced to you, you go into solitary regardless of current position or state - basically instant, with no opportunity to escape it Unclear; the game only has a vague tutorial and you must learn on your own, which CAN be funLet me tell you a story.I was a prisoner at the first prison. During the first three days, I made quite a hideout. I made paper mache out of toilet paper and super glue, which I made a fake vent cover out of so I could freely climb up and down the vents without fear of leaving it open. I had a massive storage of illegal supplies, a bludgeoning weapon made out of a sock with soap inside of it, and an outfit with metal plates beneath the cloth. Most of the inmates liked me, and I constantly went around bruising people for pay/One night, I decided to explore the vents more. I left a dummy made with pillows under the covers of my bed to fool the guards into thinking I was asleep. WIth some floss, I cut through slats in the system and saw a stash on the other side of a vent which I could not bypass. I figured I could cut through the vent and go across.Wrong.I fell into the infirmary office. The door was locked, and I hadn't had the foresight to make a key from a mold. In other words, I was trapped, and the infirmary staff always lock the door when they came in. I searched all night for a way through the vent, started chipping through the walls with a screwdriver (which broke), and as the sun rose I resigned to my fate and hid in the supply closet. After morning roll call, the prison went on lockdown. As the confused inmates reported to their cells, I received a notice that the military was on their way to the prison.After a minute and a half, I was found and thrown into solitary.Final ScoreVery in-depth, great fun, and feels complete though in early access. However, it has some standing flaws and errors which interfere with gameplay.I rate The Escapists 8/10.June 6, 2015 update: I still recommend this game. There are a few DLCs which I haven't got around to playing (like the Alcatraz DLC) and it's still quite enjoyable. I'm personally burned out on it, though, and it doesn't offer much outside of the same thing over and over for its price. Wait until it's on sale and it's great value - otherwise, I would skip it.

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play The Escapists #01 (Shankton State Pen) - I'm a Murderer 

			Views: 273,994		

			This is my The Escapists Let's Play at Shankton State Pen. The Escapists is a prison PC game. The Escapists Playlist: http://goo.gl/celjzI The Escapists Epis #1: http://goo.gl/2jtEff ● Twitch:...		

After 7 hours playing The Escapists I have to say it's fun and above all addicting! I'm playing with press access. No matter what route you decide to take, a man of the block prisoner or an educate one, your objective is always the same, escape. There's no wandering for 30 years. Don't let the art style fool you, it is light-hearted but it's challenging as heck. Just like in reality you have to carefully make all your moves and stick to the plan. If something fails you're off to the solitaire, items confiscated and your plan ruined. Fortunately you can load saved games.Pros- crafting items, and there's a lot of choices- save games when you return to the cell at the end of the day- you just don't run out of things to do, the game encourages you to keep moving- it's damn challenging- play it your own way- it's damn funny watching all the incidents during the day, prisoners will interact with each otherCons- the music is repetitive, I had to turn it off and pick my playlist- no customization, I would like to customize my character other than the name			"

								Ah, The Escapists. Such a great game. Where do I start? Let's just do the old pro's and con's.Pros: +AMAZING gameplay. ""Simple"" objective (escape the prison) and there are sidequests that you can do for your fellow prisoners. +Character Deveopment.Ok, this might sound weird, but this game actually has its own way of a character development. Let's say that you do some sidequests and give away items or cash, then the prisoner(s) that you gave away items to or did sidequests for will have a better opinion on you. That's actually very important. If the prisoners rate you a good opinion (50+), then they will never attack you, give you more money for quests, and give you information when talked to. If the player recieves a bad opinion, then the prisoners that view you that way will attack you, say really useless or mean stuff to you, and give you less money for sidequests. Wait, one more thing, you can buy things from prisoners, and if they like you, then you get a discount. If not, more money. Also, there are 3 skills that your character can learn. Intellect, strength, and speed. Intellect allows you to become more smart at get higher paying jobs. Strength determines how much damage you can take before passing out, and how much damage you can deal. Speed is, well, how fast you can move. (striker311111)+Realism...kindaThis game for the most part is somewhat realistic. You're in a prison, and you have to escape. You scout around the prison and see what there is to be seen. However, time goes by really quickly (one hour in the game feels like 1 or 2 minutes). Oh yeah, and you can get money in prison. How neat is that?+Different prisonsThere are different prisons, each one being more easy or more difficult  than the others. I'm telling you, after you beat the easiest prison, you go to another one, it's gonna be really really difficult. The two problems is that the easiest prison gives a bad impression to the future ones, and that the harder ones are impossible if you DON'T use a guide. (There you go SweetJesus)Cons:-NavigationSince you're in a prison, this should be pretty obvious, but still. I have to warn you, you get so little time to move around and explore, that this game is a ton harder than it should be. You try to escape, but you see a guard in a place that you never knew about and then you get sniped and lose all of your stuff. I know it's realistic, but the player should be able to explore more of the prison.-ItemsNow, I'm only talking about hard to get items. You somehow manage to knock out a guard, and steal his key. You better escape within a short amount of time, 'cause he's gonna wake up soon and you'll get taken in again. Now, there are different keys. Each one opening a specific amount of doors. And you have no idea how to get the keys, so those items that you see in the isolated hallway is gonna be impossible to get to, and that weird room with the generator is a no-no.-TimeOne hour in this game literaly feels like a minute. I know you're not supposed to play a game for 12 hours straight, but it all feels so fast. So much you have to do in so little time, that I think it's a little stressful and intense for players who are new to this game. -The first prison (easiest)Ok, this is kind of a weird con. But I think it's appropriate that I place this here. The very first prison, the easiest one, gives a terrible impression on how future prisons will be. You do all of this work to escape, only to figure out it's really really easy. You expect the next one to be slightly harder, but no. The next prison after that is very, very hard. I still have a lot of trouble to escape it. The first prison should give the player more of a challenge. All you really gotta do is lure a guard near a door, knock him out, steal his key and go. The next prison, I didn't even know how to escape it for a long while.Overall, this is a pretty neat game. Not bad at all, only I would recommend looking up a beginners guide first to get an idea of things rather than just charging in. I rate this game a 7/10. The replay value is amazing, the concept is really nice, but there are some things that could make this game a little better. I hope this review helps.			"

												9.5/10This game is incredible. Namely, the feeling that you get when you are almost completely sure you've set up everything right, and are about to escape, but you never know if it'll work until you try.I've left the dummy in the bed, I've knocked out my roomate, I've put the poster back over the hole in the wall, I've taken enough plastic knives to finish cutting the fence, and I didn't forget to put on my guard uniform. But did I remember fatigue? Oh no! I didn't bring any chocolate bars to make it through the night! For this, I'm stuck sawing at the fence until dawn when the snipers come back and knock me out. I'm placed in solitary for a few days. I've missed my chance.			"

												I don't have much time in but I’m writing because my initial reaction was so strong.  I'll say first that I've done two years behind bars in the U.S. and almost four in a community corrections facility.  This game immediately started a mild and pleasant sympathetic nervous response (i.e. fight or flight/adrenaline/epinephrine) because of the very simplified, yet somewhat accurate representation of incarcerated life, with its rigorous, paramilitary lifestyle.  I was immediately reminded of the intense cleaning rituals, endless card games, terrible smells, awful food, and the overall lack of privacy and respect from guards and other inmates.  In light of all this, my first successful escape was EXILARATING AS HELL!  This game will appeal to squares and ex-cons a like!9.5/10 "

												Great game, it is so insanely hard. I still am on the 1st prison (I managed to finish lol, I just don't have the patience to do everything so smooth. Oops), and I have played about 10 hours. The only thing I would change is to add a co-op gamemode so I can escape with a friend. There is still a lot of DLC waiting to be added, so that won't happen for a while, but just a thought.			"

								The Escapists is a game by Mouldy Toof Studios. It puts you in one of numerous prisons with the simple goal of escaping. But it isn’t as easy as you think, the point of a prison is to keep you in your place, which is what this game does.You get the choice of one of numerous characters who you can rename, a prison, and the option to name your prisoners if you had a friend you wanted to be with during your life sentence. When it comes to content the game is incredible, there are many different items you can get hold of from soap to post cards. That’s not even all, you can combine items to make more stuff to help you escape; paper mache for fake walls, nunchucks for attacking, key molds, Dummies, glass shanks, fake grates, posters, grappling hooks and so much more!This game requires lots of planning, you can’t just beat up a guard, take his keys and leave. You need to spend some time exercising to get strong, you need key molds to keep keys or else you get time in solitary, there are guard patrols everywhere and even clogging the toilet with dirt from the hole you’ve been digging. You need to plan how you’re going to escape and balance you actual escape attempt with the prison timetable; eating, sleeping, free time, work and roll call. If you don’t fill your work’s quota then you get fired, complete the quota though and you get money to bribe other prisoners or buy stuff from them.The actual gameplay itself is really well done, everything is quite solid and the game is most definitely playable. You can choose from many ways to escape, through the vents, underground, through the front door or even starting a riot. The graphics is designed to look 8-bit, a nice look for many games that is also fairly easy to make. The audio in the game is very well made, and if you like the music playing in the background you can get the music from the game’s steam folder.If you enjoy playing games that require work and planning for you to play and succeed then this is the game for you. I rate this 10/10 in its current Early Access state, it’s a solid game worth the cost to buy it. When it leaves Early Access I don’t think there’s a rating system high enough to grade it… or at least that’s what I think will happen when it leaves Early Access anyway.			"

								What more can you want (Except later updates)?Escape from prison, in the most strange and familiar ways possible, from digging out with a spoon to beating up all the guards and been allowed to WALK out the prison, helped by the warden.This game has an incredible range of difficulty:If you want to escape a prison, then probably return because they have free food, nice guards (Bodyguards almost) and deluxe toliet paper, choose Center Perks.If you want to (Fail at) escape(ing) prison because they have inmates tougher than the guards (and thats saying something), A personal army armed with stunsticks that knock alomost ANYTHING out with one hit, A small sea and shaving cream then choose HMP Irongate.Also have glitches and a guard heat that is sometimes very funny:If you want to get shot in the balls get to breakfast late that one to many times.If you want to knock out a guard with zero retaliation, do it with a pillow on a certain map (Im not saying which, Bug exploit)Amazing inmate (And own) comments:If you want to ask another inmate whether he made friends in the shower room, do it there.If you want to swear while tring to be sneaky, break a tool while trying to escape steathly (no-one will hear you scream F-)Weapons that are really awesome.If you want to wield nunchucks, two timber and a wireIf you want to nearly kill people with soap, put it in a sockIf you want to make a weapon out of just a comb, hit it agaisnt a wallIn short, If you want to have fun, GET THIS GAME!666 out of 21			"

								This game... I saw it on Steam just a few days after it'd come out for Early Access (20th of August) and I thought it looked really cool. I bought it and wow... My brain just exploded with delight.If you've ever played Prison Architect, like me, you'll sorta understand how to play this game. But of course you're not building the prison this time, you're ESCAPING IT. It has a lot of cool mechanics already implemented into it. I won't give you any hints on escaping except you can use screwdrivers on vents.You can even take your clothes off...Guards beat you up for it...But there are a few bugs:I know I have a bad computer, but this is a Pixelated-Art-Style-Kind-Of-Thing game. Framerate is a bit of an issue for me.The guard AI can be a bit annoying aswell. Only a bit. Sometimes, when doing Morning Rollcalls, they'll have a lockdown because I didn't get there within five seconds. Then I have all my illegal items taken ;-;All in all, this game is worth it. DayZ has bugs, but everyone loves it. Minecraft has bugs, but it has grown to be one of the most ""Let's Play""ed games out there. I really think if you like the idea of this game and it's style, you should get it.Its price will go up later too. Do you really want that regret?			"

								The Escapists throws you in the deep end of a 16-bit prison with one task. Escape. Easy huh? No. Not even close to easy. I have had so far 13 hours of gameplay and have not yet come even close to having the beggings of an escape plan.... And I'm on the very ""easy"" map. Though extreemly chalenging it is a extreemly fun and addicting game, you have to follow the daily prison routine. 1. Morning rollcall. 2. Breakfast. 3. Morning free time. 4. Work. 5. Workout. 6. Showers. 7. Lunch. 8. Evening free time. 9. Evening rollcall. 10. Lights out. While sticking to this routine you must find the time to gather recorses, Make friends, make tools, defend yourself from guards and other prisoners and put together and make your escape. You can do little jobs for your fellow inmates doing things from finding a pack of mints to shanking a guard. To escape you can climb through vents. Dig under your cell, Even mine through your cell wall with a plastic fork! All in all it is a great game. Though it is early acsess with only 3 or 4 maps trust me.... You will only have just completed the first by the time this game is completed. Best £7 I have ever spent. 10/10 game and I would honestly suggest to anyone. For all you PC gamers check it out on steam. Watch the videos and look at pics. If your up for it buy it! You will really enjoy the game.			"

												Do I recommend this? YEAH I DO!The Escapists is a game where you are thrown into prison. You must escape the prison, and believe me, that's not easy.Now, I'm going to be honest and give my pros and cons:~Updated Review~Pros:- Lots of prisons, and cheap extra prison DLC.- Devs listen to us (community)- Amazing art style.- Challenging, you have to be smart to escape, as it isn't easy.- Lots of items and tons of item combos.- Lots of favorites for inmates.- Map editor + submission to workshop.- A semi-realistic prison feel.- Soundtrack is great! There are new songs during free periods.- Inmates speeches are pretty funny. (personal pro for me)- Multiple ways to escape. (Ex: first prison has about 3 (+) ways to escape!)- Custom inmate names, and choosable skins.Cons:- Lots of waiting, and can get very boring if you're not patient.- Cops / guards catch you easily. This makes a challenge, though!- Gets repetitive once in a while, but DLC makes up for it.-So, if you like prison games and have a lot of patience, then this is for you. My old review can be seen below, and I decided to update it as the game has updated a lot since then.Final Score: 8.5/10~Old Review~Pros:- Great art style. (32 bit?)- Soundtrack is great. Every prison has their own free time song that plays.- Challenging.- Tons of items.- Multiple, and I mean multiple escape routes. The first prison has over 3 escape routes!- Favors are really easy to do.- Inmates' speeches are pretty darn funny.- Developers actually listen to us (the community)- Each prison offers new items and layouts, and gets tougher each time.- Map Editor!- Has a realistic prison theme.Cons:- None, go buy the game! (If you haven't.)That's my short review.			"

												Hey, i've had this game for about a month now, so i thought i would share my opinions and experiences with you.  So when i first saw this game i was thinking ""Oh wow this is kinda neat, i might get it"" so i looked up some gameplay videos to see how good it would be, and i was blown away, now i reccomend you watch Lets Play's and other gameplay videos if you get this because if you don't, you won't escape the first prison, there are so many things to keep in check and so many things to do, i just highly reccomend it, so now on to the review portion...Gameplay - The gameplay is very fun, for those of you who need to know specificly what the game is, its basically a prison escape sim, your set down in a prison, you have to scout out where to escape and how, get the tools for it, get the stats (Strength, intellect and Speed) and wait for the moment to strike, now to be more specific, in order to escape there are three main way you have to use in order to escape (Most of the time) you go low (Digging) you go high (roof tops) and right through the center (Breaking walls and cutting fences) so for example with digging, you can use easily broken plastic spoons from the canteen, a trowel you find on fellow inmates, or a shovel you made, if the guards see the tunnel the trace it back to you and get your stuff taken away, so cover it up, and you also need wooden braces to keep the tunnel from collapsing, now the center, in order to get through the walls you need 3 types of items, a plastic easily broken fork from the canteen, a crowbar, or a pickaxe, once again if the guards see a broken wall they WILL catch you and take away your stuff so you have to make a fake wall block, or get a poster to cover it, and finally the roof, to get to the roof you need to get to a ladder and to get to a ladder you need to break a wall, so in the roof you need rope to get to every where, if the snipers see you on the roof they shoot you, if they see you on the roof with a guard outfit, you have limited time to do your stuff before they recognise your not a guard, but if its night the snipers are gone. Overall i rate the gameplay a 9.5/10Music - The music is very well composed 8-bit style music, not much to be said, overall its an 8/10Programming Bugs - Theres just about no glitches in this game, overall i found about... four? and none game breaking, permanent or effecting gameplay. i rate it a 10/10Community - Now every great game isnt what it is without a community pointing out bugs and what it should have in it, and this community is full of smart innovative people, thanks to them we can have a prison editor and multiplayer some time in the future, they also love to point out bugs and glitches. i rate it a 10/10Final Thoughts - When i got this game i just couldnt stop playing it, the overall score is 9.25/10			"

												The Escapists is one of the few games this new year that I have enjoyed. I have played it profusely, escaping 2 out of the 9 prisons (including the extra ones) and I love the way it works. You can name prisoners, guards etc, you get to pick YOUR way out, and I love the things the guards say at rollcall. It makes me lol.But, I would add a prison editor so that people can create and publish their own prisons. It would be hard to implement, sure, but it would make a valued and great addition to the game.9.9/10 starsWould add the editor.			"

												Awesome game!I play this game all the time (still stuck on Shankton State Pen though D:<) and I'm amazed by the amount of mechanics and  items in the game! When I first saw the game, I glossed over it as ""just another prison escape game."" Then I learned about jobs, storing items in a vent, prison takeovers, wrapping people in a rope so you can steal their job, and things like that!I think something that should be added is more abilities for NPCs. As of now, if an NPC has contraband in their desk, and they are called for a cell search, nothing happens. Something else I would love to see added is multiplayer, perhaps you could make a local game where two people can try to escape a prison, or there can be minigames which players from around the world can play!All in all, this is a very fun game and I think you should play it!

								Day 1- New life, new prison, new rules. I relize that I am the oldest member of the prison. I am 87 years old.Day 2- I was wrong. I am not the oldest. There is a 89 year old aswell. This  does not please me.Day 3- Lost my job. That now means i can use work time to plot my fellow senior's death.Day 4- I found out one of two things. 1: The fellow elder's name is Bill. 2: Bill also lost his job. Now is my time to strike.Day 5- I cornered  Bill in the bathroom. I had previously stolen a baton and was able to beat Bill t o death with it.Day 5 side note- The officers found out and beat me. I woke in the infirmary.Day 6- I couldn't believe it. There was Bill, healthy as ever. I had killed him hadn't I? Something is fishy here and it's not just the lunches.Day 7- I just remembered that this game was not a prison sim it was an escape sim. Tried to break out and was shot to death.10/10 would be shot as an old man again			"

												This game is a very unique prison life simulator. I find it enjoyable with all the craftable items,and how you find recipies through crafting notes. I also love the idea of the roll call where two cells are checked this really gives you a fright at each one. Honestly overall the only thing that could make this game better is if it was multiplayer.			"

												The idea is solid. maintain your prison life while secretly plotting your escape. The problem falls on the mechanics. Stats and relationships fall extremely fast. The tutorial tells you almost nothing of value. Crafting unlocks are hard to come by making the game frustrating without a wiki or tutoial. The worst offender, though, is the guard AI. They apparently hire all guards from the psychic network. Guard finds random thing in random place: blam you're caught. Guard is walking by a dark room at night and instantly notices the vent is open: blam caught. Guard goes to check your room that has a hole covered and all contraband smuggled out: he decides to look behind the poster, blam again. You've been crawling through the vents you wait until things are clear climb down: blam guard come speeding down the hallway befor you can react. And, of course if you are caught, they know instantly where everything you've set up is and undo it.I want to like this game, but it feels more like a chore than fun. There is some charm and some entertaining things that can happen, but there is little pay-off to what you put in.			"

								I am just going to keep this short, for i have only logged around 4 hours into the game as of now, but as soon as i reach around 10 hours i will write a full review.So, i was browsing youtube one night when i noticed a video on some new indie game ""The Escapists."" Noticing instantly that this was some sort of prison simulator, of which i am very fond of, i clicked it and instantly loved it. Not having any money at the time i desperatly searched for ways to get this game for the following days, finally while looking through my inventory i noticed a $ 10 CSGO weapon skin and proceded to sell it without hesitation. I purchased the game and quickly downloaded it (Very quickly) and began to play. I was hooked. It was something i had wanted for a while but could never find, a prison escape simulator, where all the knowledge i had mustered from watching prison movies came in handy. Shortly after starting i grabbed some plastic spoons and started digging, i hung some sheets over the cell bars to stay concealed, and within a few nights, i had been sent to solitary when the guards discovered my uncovered hole.So.I started again.After an hour of seemingly doing the same thing again and again i still wasn't bored and found new features at every turn.I love the pixelated graphics, the game gives off a light vibe but it is very hard.Also the new POW camp prison is awesome and i have put 3 hours into it already.With the constant updates and the way the devs listen to our ideas this game is definatly worth the money.I won't give it a rating yet but this game certainly has my attention.

								I've played this game for about an hour, and so far it's great fun. There seems to be a dozen of items to craft and find, escaping while managing routine is quite exciting, too. Everything about it is great. Except the fact that the other prisoners take the right table and the treadmills always. It's honestly really annoying.Prisoners taking over jobs is also annoying. The skills seem to take awhile to level up, atleast strength and speed.I recommend it.			"

												I nearly didn't get this game just because of the graphics, but I'm so glad I did in the end. Despite it's simplistic RPG maker looking surface it's actually a very deep gameIn The Escapists you go from prison to prison attempting to escape which unlocks the next prison in succession. There are 6 prisons in total which vary in style and increase in difficultyGameplay involves a strict schedule of showing up for rollcall (a sort of headcount to make sure no one has escaped) followed by breakfasts, work routines, exercise period, shower period, an evening meal and an evening rollcall followed by returning to your cell for lights out, with usually 2 free periods available inbetween. Later prisons have an afternoon rollcall as wellWhile going through the routine of prison life you need to devise an escape plan. Early ones are simple as there's usually only something like a locked door and a wire fence inbetween you and freedom, a couple of forged keys and a pair of wirecutters will take care of that, and most early prisons can simply be tunnelled out of if you find a good place to begin the tunnel. However the number of obstacles gradually increases with fences being electrified but linked to a generator, additional locked doors, security cameras, contraband (metal) detectors, landmines, patrol trucks, and underground electric fences or walls that cant be broken through to prevent tunnel escapes, it'll be up to you to find the weak spots in these defences. There are usually multiple solutions for each prison thoughThe game has a stat system sort of like The Sims. Intelligence unlocks crafting options, speed increases attack speed (DPS) and strength increases HP (tankiness). You can also recruit prisoners who you befriend in order to fight guards and create distractionsIn order to carry out these things there is an extensive crafting system. While you can use simple items like plastic cutlery, nail files and trowels, you will need to use crafting to acquire more effective and specialised tools, which are tied to an intelligence stat. For example you can craft together a crowbar, duct tape and a tool handle made of wood and a file to create a simple pickaxe and use it to break through walls, or do the same but with a piece of sheet metal instead of a crowbar to make a shovel for digging. Whereas you can knock out a guard or order a gang of inmates to knock him out in order to steal his uniform, you could also craft one by bleaching a prison inmate outfit and dying it with ink. Guards will react to holes in the wall but a roll of duct tape and a magazine can be used to make a pinup poster to cover the hole. If you maintain good relations with the guards they will let you hang up sheets over your cell, allowing you to dig a hole and cover it with your desk whenever you aren't working on it if you want to. Or you could remove the vent cover from your cell with a screwdriver and replace it with a paper mache replica that enables you to stash things in the vents or maneuver through the prison at nightIf a guard sees a hole, spots a hole in the wall or finds illegal contraband in your desk you'll be sent to solitary confinement for a few days, the prison will be searched thoroughly and all your stashed contraband will be found and any holes you made in the floor and walls will be filled so it's important to hide your escape plans as you progressAs if that weren't enough, the developers have produced several DLC maps, some of which must be purchases but others like the christmas inspired prisons ""santa's sweatshop"" and ""jingle cells"" are completely free and produced for us by the dev team!There is also a prison creator system and a lot of custom prisons also available to download for freeThe Escapists is not an easy game, and the path to escape isn't always clear. It takes good problem solving skills and an understanding of the game mechanics to progress or you'll never even escape the first prison.

												Key supplied by developer for review.======================================The Escapists Read on for full review!======================================TL;DR:BUY IT. Great tutorial, good music, fun and extremely immersive gameplay.Accessible as heck, but with depth.======================================Pros+UI: Great layout, simple, intuitive.+Graphics: Who doesn't love some nice pixel art? Great light/shade/colors.+Sound: A bit chunky, but good, retro, immersive.+Gameplay: One of the most immersive games I've playedCons-None so far!Neutral+/- Settings: Only so many, and sliders can't be dragged! Nbd for me.======================================So The Escapists is essentially a time management/prison lifestyle sim. This game is a delight! The graphics are very good, and serve their purpose well. Areas are distinct, everything has light, shadow, and a suitable color. The pixel art is very well done. The sprites are cute, and some of them realistic for their size. Also, every object is distinct. The UI is 100% serviceable, with distinct colors and objects of its own, and just the right amount of polish.The tutorial, also, is amazing. It's quick, easy, and gives you a nice step by step introduction to the world with a step by step instructionset, without spoiling the deeper elements to the game such as crafting recipes. The gameplay is equally as accessible, everything being a simple tap, right click, or left click away...and maybe a few alternating keys. You can customize the controls, but I'm not sure why you'd ever need to! It makes me think of the Sims, except you are playing the character, and you choose what to do. There is an ASTONISHING amount of freedom in gameplay. You can blend in, you can sneak off, you can build your stats, or trade contraband with the inmates. Start fights. Steal. Do favors, or EVEN your job! The list goes on!! But your primary goal is of course to escape, and on that note, the AI is responsive, so you better be ready. I've encountered no bugs so far.The music is serviceable, and that's about it. It isn't intrusive, it isn't bad, but it isn't amazing. It works for the setting and I definitely like it, but I don't completely love it. The sound effects are basic and perhaps slightly jarring at times.The only issues I've had with the game are the lack of resolution settings, and some desks not wanting to leave my arms easily. The RNG can create some unforgiving wait times, but it also makes things a bit intense and there's a lot of anticipation. This game has actually made me feel anxious, and gotten my heart beating at times! There are all kind of custom maps the community has made, which can offer a unique flavor or new twist or challenge, which is nice. On a related final note, the difficulty is present, with the game leaving it up to you how you want to escape, as well as how to do some of the things required to do just that, but once you figure it out, the prisons difficulty scales quite nicely.All in all, I've never so quickly felt so at home in a game.Now if only I could find that dental floss... ;)======================================If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												This is a game about escaping from various prisons. The ""levels"" are the prisons.I like the old-school pixel graphics. The GUI is incredibly fast and responsive. Controlling the little guy that tries to escape is a fun challenge. I like how you have to think out a plan and can bide your time to execute it. The independent lives of the other inmates is fun, and they can also give you missions and objects to use.The mouse-clicking for moving objects can be a bit finnicky, I would prefer the option of using the keyboard for everything. Also knowing which things can be crafted into what (like a bar of soap + sock = a weapon) could be more discoverable in-game.It's a pretty polished and fun game.			"

												A very polished and clever experience, but it seems that there is usually only one way to escape. It would be nice if future maps included more than one way to escape, and a reward for escaping in every way from one prison. Other than that, just damn fun to play. Good now, even better when Multiplayer rolls out.			"

Early Access Review
								First off you DO NOT NEED A PROCCESSOR EQUIVLANT TO THE RECOMMENDED. I have a dual core cpu that runs at 1.65 Ghz no where near the recomended 2.4 Ghz and it runs flawless for me. This game could probably be ran on a a single core processor.      If you like building prisons in the amazing Prison Architecht you will love this  game! It might look like a childish/retro 8-bit game, but think again. In this game you are forced to use your brain to the brink of it's processing power. Along with escaping you have to make it to roll call's 3 times a day, eat 3 times a day, exercise 1 time a day, shower 2 times a day, and work once a day if you have a job. If you do not manage your time wisely and are able to keep with the schedule you will not escape.      There are more ways to escape then I can count. You can dig, use the vents and roof, cut through fences, break through walls, steal keys and more. You usually have to use multiple different things out of those to be able to espcape.  There are tons of items also that you can craft to help you escape. Along with these items you can only craft them if you have a high enough intellect and in order to get and keep it up you have to work out your mind each day.      You have to be super sneaky or the guards will catch you off guard and throw you into solitary. If you get thrown into solitary they will search all your stuff and take any contraband and you will have to start over which at times comletely screws you up and can be esier to start over.       This game is full of stuff to do and has hours upon hours of gameplay and it's only in early access! I just barely escaped for the first time! It took me 15 hours! This game is complex and amazingly hard which gives it that super fun experience and the amazing feeling of accomplishment when you finaly escape!     I reccomend this game to anyone and say it is 100% worth the price! To all of you reading this, BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												I want to like this game. I really do. And it isn't really a ""bad"" game. It just has too many issues for me to reccomend it. If there were a ""meh"" option I'd pick it. I have two major issues with the game.One being you aren't given a lot of important information. Metal Detectors can find everything on you that you DON'T wear. You can have nunchuks and a metal plated uniform and it won't detect it. But if you have a nail file in your pocket you instantly go to solitary. Lots of weird recipes where you might have an idea of something CLOSE to what you can do, or maybe you have part of the items you need, but you won't ever know unless you get luck finding the recipe note. And two, RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I spent roughly 4 days in the 2nd prison with three key moulds. I had gotten nunchuks and made metal plated prisoner armor. I had accumulated a bit over 150 dollars and I spent four whole days just stuck. I needed to make a key to progress, and I was missing a lighter. I searched EVERY inmate's desk multiple times every day. I checked every inmate store. This continued on and on. Eventually I just pulled a chuck norris and attempted to beat down all the guards. Which did barely work. But felt very unsatisfying.I don't mind slow progression as long as I can make actual progression. But when I'm stuck sitting doing nothing for days in game because I am not getting an item I need the enjoyment just becomes massive frustration.There's also some kind of irritating small things, like how if a vent if missing from the roof of your room a guard will INSTANTLY notice if he walks by. I'm not sure how many guards stare at ceilings, but it seems a bit silly. Not to mention you can't seem to frame other inmates which is VERY disappointing. It's basically flavor text. You can be told they are about to search the room of so and so, and throw a glass shiv in his desk, but the guards will not give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ They only throw you into solitary.  The game has a lot of great ideas and is close to what I want, but there are some serious underlying flaws in the game. I'm not sure I'll come back, very disappointing.			"

												Great game. the first few prisons are sort of easy ( altough it took me 40 days to escape the second one) and finding ways to escape one prison is really fun. I found out that while I was digging my tunnel to freedom I noticed that I was genuinely afraid of a guard spotting my empty cell. However I must say when I was escaping prison number 2 the guards always found out that, on the night I was planning to leave, I was busy digging a tunnel. probably because of Steve. that Guard lover always warned the gaurds in the middle of the night while he was pretending to sleep. Well Steve I got out anyway and left you there! ♥♥♥♥ da police and ♥♥♥♥ Steve aswell			"

												Like some mind-bending combination of MYST and every classic top-down RPG in history, the Escapists manages to blend heart pounding moments of adrenaline and reaction, with cerebral activities, in a well paced fashion. Long and careful hours of scheming, conniving, poisoning, sabotaging, exploring, manipulating, and chipping away (literally) at your confinement, sit side by side with vicious scrums and scraps.What makes this game so amazing is that it gives you the chance to live out that mental fantasy where you imagine that you could do a better job of breaking out of jail than any number of TV or Movie characters (or even real-life felons).  Ironically for a game about being imprisoned, this game provides true freedom;  Freedom to piece together your own unique plan of escape.The game is quite robust in terms of replayability, very stable (no crashes or bugs so far in my playthroughs), and requires very little by way of system resources.  It will, however, tax your brain, your wit, and your reflexes, in the best way.			"

The cops will pay less attention to you if you stick to daily routine, but keep an eye on you if they think your up to something. Its almost like this is an online game and the cops are actual players, but there not!! I love this game so much!

												This game hits so many marks, but drops the ball in big ways that make it ultimately unfun and punishing in unfulling ways. This game has an awesome concept and has a ton of freedom in actually pulling off your daring escape,  but the problem comes from it's very unfair, unforgiving difficulty and grind-heavy RNG loot system. I don't regret getting it, but at the price their asking, this game just isn't worth it. In fact, it's only worth it for those who are curious about what a good prison escape game could look like, since there really isn't anything else like it. The biggest bone to pick is the difficulty. If a guard walks in on your doing anything uncouth, you're caught, your tools of escape are taken and thrown into the void and you're basically left to start from scratch with just about all progress lost. Now this wouldn't actually be a huge problem if the guards played by the rules. There's a lack of a more refined in-game logic. Every punishment is sweeping and is basically a soft ""Game Over,"" leaving you with 90% of you progress lost. WHERE you get caught or what you did to get caught do not factor into what the guards take from you. If you've been stashing goods in the vents for the past hour and you get busted digging a hole, everything you have in the vents is taken, even though you were caught underground. Anecdotally, I had stashed a ton of escape tools in the vents and decided to beat up a guard and see if I could steal his key. I pulled it off, but you have exactly 20-30 seconds before you receive a note saying they know you took the key and you're busted -- a.k.a. soft ""Game Over."" I can accept getting busted for taking a key after pummelling a guard. The problem is, after taking the key, I ran and stashed it in another inmate's desk along with my other tools, knowing full well I'd be busted in mere moments. The message popped, I went to solitary confinement for three days, then was loosed to get back to my master plan. I ran back to the inmate's desk to find that the key was missing, but my other illegal tools were still there. Furthermore, I went to check the vents and for whatever reason, they had taken everything out of them and replaced the fake vent cover I placed. The checked the vents because I stole a key? And they magically found the key, but didn't take the other tools I placed in the other inmate's desk? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and that's one of the big places the game fails: it just throws a blanket punishment instead of one that makes sense for the situation.The other major problem is RNG. You'll need specific items for every escape method you can conceive; not just one, but several of them to craft and for each individual step of your escape. But the game is so incredibly stingy about giving you any items you need that your best bet is to plot several different escape methods at the same time, just using tools and items as they pop up. This kind of detracts from the idea of planning your escape, since you're never really given any sort of choice or method to obtain key items necessary for escape, and with an incredibly limited inventory space, no place to truly protect your items, and a guarantee of losing near everything you've accumulated if you get busted for any single misdeed, it can take an hour just to prepare a single escape attempt, not even properly execute it.It's such a shame, because the freedom the game allows for is like something out of the early days of PC games, but this freedom means very little when you are bound to RNG for all of your tools and you can lose all of those tools in a literal second of wrongdoing -- an hour of work gone in a second. I would expect a game like this to be harsh but fair. Instead, we have a game that's just harsh and becomes a tedious grind after a few hours of play.			"

												The idea is great, but the game gets so annoying because of instabusts.You just took over the prison and the warden said you made your point and you're free to go? Well, hopefully nobody finds contraband in your desk now, because if they do it's a one-way-ticket to solitary without you being able to do anything against that. You get a message and bam. Try again. Stole a key from a guard? Oh yeah. As soon as they wake up they know it was you and they also instantly know where you are. To the solitary!I also just dug a tunnel. Over 50 tiles. Took me more than 3 ingame weeks and required♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of duct tape. My only problem was the electrical fence. So I dug to the generator room. counted tiles. I wait for the night, want to dig up to shut down the generator. But nope: As soon as my hole is open I get a message that a tower guard spotted it and that I have to go to solitary. Yeah. Thanks. Do they have X-Ray vision and are able to look into ♥♥♥♥ing buildings?Stuff like this really ruins the game, as it really restricts you in what you can do and it doesn't even make any sense the way they did that. Why not let the guards order a shakedown when they notice a key is missing? Search every cell and prisoner. This would at least give you some time to maybe frame another prisoner for stealing it or give you the last few seconds you need to escape. And it would be more realistic and less annoying. The way it is it feels more like an adventure with the solution predetermined by the developers. If I want to dig a 100 tile tunnel to escape you should at least honor that I did that instead of throwing me into solitary with a ♥♥♥♥ing message.			"

								I've NEVER reviewed a game but I had to for The Escapists. Let me just say that this game is awesome! The attention to detail is great and you can get lost playing this game for hours. It's challenging but not frustrating. I haven't even escaped from the prison currently in the game but I still can't wait until they add more. The only things I don't like about the game is that the AI prisoners walk around too fast so it's hard to click on them and they just mindlessly walk around (unless they have a job). During leisure time I'd like to see the AI go to their cell to take a nap, go to the library to read, etc. Other than that, this game is awesome. If the idea of trying to break out of prison is interesting to you... you won't regret it. I'm hooked!			"

Not saying a big group, but 2-4 would be even more fun as to try to help each other or screw each other over.			"

								The Escapists is a brilliant little title that is well worth the money even in it's early access stage.The aim of the game is simple, you must escape from your prison but it's not as simple as just waiting til the guards backs are turned and making a wild dash for it. You start in a prison with various other inmates and are told the basics (WASD to move, right click to interact, left click to use) and from then on out, you're on your own. Each day has a schedule which you will need to follow including rollcalls, mealtimes, worktime and freetime in order to keep the guards off your back. Whilst following the daily schedules you have the ability to do favours for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you, workout or read to increase your skills (making you a more proficient fighter or able to apply for better jobs and craft better items), or plan your escape. You can choose to keep a low profile and gather the items you need for your escape or you can beat the crap out of everyone who looks at you funny and spend half your game in the infirmary, The game already has a variety of features such as crafting, basic skill building, various jobs, legal and contraband items, fatigue levels and 'friendship' levels with other inmates. There seems to be various different way to escape and in the 4 hours i've played i've not been bored once which is always a good sign for an Early Access game. I think the game is worth the small price tag, and even if you don't plan on buying it yet, 100% keep your eye on it, its truly a game with great potential.			"

												The Escapists is a very well done prison-break simulator. The many different items you can acquire(or steal)allow you to escape in your own way. The increasingly difficult prisons will make sure you always have a challenge(even the ""easy"" prison will give you a hard time if not done correctly). And with a built-in map editor, you can create your own prisons, and share them on the Steam Workshop. You can also download other people's prisons to play at any time, so that you never run out of prisons to play. If you have $20 laying around, this is a great time-killer, and an uncommonly challenging, and engaging game			"

You can collect a lot of items, try u know stuff out, get a crew, do a job and have a lot of fun with the things ur inmates and the guards are saying.It's  a great Indie Game and I hope that the development hasn't stoped by now. I would love to see some more prisons or the ability to build my own jail.Totally worth the money!			"

												the escapists is hard! trying to figure out what to do and how to escape is difficult i have some problems with it one being that guards seem impossible to beat compared to you and at the moment there is little to no tutorial (which i assume will change) the hardest part is figuring out what crafts together altough they have a system (i think this is right anyway) that red named items can't be crafted [edit loutheman13 has informed me red=ilegal items and can be crafted]. crafting guides are hard to come buy and what ive seen pretty bad as require already crafted materials that you won't know how to make. But overall it is tense and so far i havn't figured out a way to escape and you can in see my time above (i will edit when i have beat and at what time) i havn't been able to leave the easiest prison which is the only one but i expect will add more as they have said so in the description. so far this game is exactly what i have expected of it and so far ive loved every second! edit: they have now added a 4th job within the first couple of weeks which i hope is a sign of the devs reliability to continue the escapists so i can enjoy this game further.edit: More prisons have been added aswell as a tab for custom prisons (steam workshop lets hope) meaning the replayability has just sky rocketed. *Tiny spoilers* Some things seem to be a bit harsh for example i filed a vent out in someone elses cell and it was unnoticed for 3 days then radomly it was noticed, linked to me i was in solitary and all contraband was taken away, i also dislike how you are instantly caught if you are in a vent or underground so there is no way avoid it (i would like to think this is just because certain elements havn't yet been added like guards underground or in vents). still believe it's worth the money and a written tutorial (instructions) have been added and i still havn't escaped. (i probably suck). Hope this helped.edit 2: This game has some real issues and if i could id change my review to a side thumb. I mean its repetitive but im ok with that, the things that annoy me are the little things and they have made me uninstall the game. For example my biggest pet peeve is that a stolen key will always lock you up, let me give you an example, i recruited 3 guys and told them to beat a guard up around the corner i went around the corner and picked up the key and placed it in somebody elses cell, guard wakes up i get sent to solitary. I mean i could understand a shakedown but no instant arrest. another issue is that other people cant seem to get sent to solitary, beating up guards? no, contraband in cell during shakedown? no, nothing. I enjoy escape mode more in prison architect and am seriously dissapointed with this but i will keep it as recommended for 2 reasons, the devs support is great and that should be rewarded, i think these things are only gonna be only slight issues for others whilst for me there so frustrating i dont wanna play this and the idea of the game is enjoyable.

You  do alot of stuff especily considering this is in alpha and still has more to come, (Hopfully like prison building and jobs and more stuff). The only thing that's wrong is a few animatons and favors (quest) glitching out. For instence you can be asked to get little Bobby a teddy bear and get $18 dollers from it, then find one give it to Bobby and not get the $18. You can escape in 1 day or 365 days (or more)			"

												As I had the privilege of meeting Chris Davis this weekend at Insomnia 54 (nice guy!), I thought I'd take the time to leave my thoughts.An awesome prison simulator, with an old-school twist. Hours of fun to be had.Each prison appears to have a well defined strategy, although alternative methods can be carried out (e.g. beating up all of the prison guards, molding gate keys., etc) Different prisons have a different routine to follow and it is vital that you get to know this routine in order to plan your escape successful. For example, a 10am rollcall must be attended to ensure the guards don't get suspicious that you're upto no good. Clearly a lot of thought went into the crafting system. Items can be combined to make new ones that you will need in order to escape from the prison of choice.I completely love the whole 8-bit vibe that The Escapists has going on. Old school graphics and old school sound effects help set the tone very well.The only bug I've personally found in this game is when getting my intellect to 100 by browsing the internet at the computer in the first prison, the achievement did not unlock for me.  I did get the chance to mention this to Chris, so I'm hoping this will get sorted out soon, if it hasnt been addressed already.All in all, buy this game if you like challenging, stategic thinking and are looking for a game that will keep you engrossed for ages!

The Escapist - helping you escape from reality by immersing you into... reality?! Let me explain. The Escapist is an in-depth, yet somewhat simplistic, simulator centered around you, an everyday con, trying to break free from prison. Achieving freedom isn't easy, so get ready to make friends with your fellow prisoners, work, work out, buy, collect and craft... and try at all time to not drop the soap. So, how is jail? There are several main prisons, escalating in difficulty. Each one of them has its own rules you must follow, tight security, number of guards and cameras. They differ in design and prompt you to vary your strategy and plans. Furthermore, you can create your own shutter, so go ahead, build your wall. The Escape. Even when you're not following the prison schedule, you have to be planning out and following your own. Your con has to decide whether to collect some forks and go chip at the wall, or whether to get a spoon and start digging. Will he work out a few extra hours or study at the library. Time is valuable and everything you do matters!  Arts and crafts... and shivs. There are many different items you can find around by rummaging through other cells, or you can just buy them off of other prisoners. Magazines, chocolate, duct tape and lighters all come in handy. Some more advanced items, however, require to be crafted, like weapons, uniforms, keys and tools - this is where studying pays off.  Talking about paying. A valued prisoner, is one who helps out his buddies. Doing favours for other prisoners is a big part of The Escapist. This is how you earn their trust and respect. Plus in return they'll do the digging for ya'. Some cons will want you to find them a specific item, while others'll want you to beat up a foe of theirs. Packing a punch requires working out, so spend a few extra hours at the gym. So where's the simplicity? The Escapist is an indie title, with colourful pixelated graphics and a friendly interface. This fools a lot of people into thinking that the game is simplistic. Underneath the flamboyant cover art lies a manual of a game. Learning all the mechanies will take you some time and your will be prone to looking up guides. Final verdict: So after all the blabbering is The Escapist worth checking out? Absolutely yes! I invested in this game while it was still Early Access and boy did it pay off! Not only will this game entertain you, but it will devour your time, as you're planning along your next big escape. So get it and put your own little twist on The Shawshank Redemption. "

												Dammit, I bought another game that was in early access and I feel screwed. I bought it after the ""Full Release"" though, so why do I feel screwed? Because this game does not feel like it should have been moved to ""Full Release"" yet.Don't get me wrong. I love the idea of it and the degree of freedom it gives in terms of strategies you can come up with. I love the 8-bit semi-goofy guards, inmates, and general prison life. I love the interactions with your peers in crime and the routines of the day that you can end up using to your advantage. I love what they've done with it so far -- and while that is something okay to say about an early access game, it is not okay to say about a Full Release.You see, none of those things feel fully fleshed out. Sure the NPCs have funny dialogue, but by 2-3 in-game days of play, you've heard it all. Oh, someone ate all the cream custards again? Or stole the warden's toupee? Shouldn't he have that glued on by now? And the amount of times your hear about an inmate's wife leaving them or dying is just not possible in a monogamistic society.You can do favors for your fellow inmates but these are a selection of 3 different types of ""Quests"" with random targets: you're either going to find them an item, distract the guards at a specific time, or beat up someone they don't like. They get pretty repetitive shortly, and sometimes they play out ridiculously -- you beat someone up, notice they have a quest item on them for a quest that they gave you, take it from them, and then give it back to them to complete the quest. Some people think that's quirky and funny but to me it's an incomplete system. Why can I give someone their own pillow and complete a quest for them? And it would be cool to see other quest types, too, like an inmate asking you to plant evidence in another inmate's cell, or have them invite you to their escape attempts or vice-versa.One of the biggest things that seems unfinished are the so-called ""Instabusts"". When you break a vent, dig a hole, steal a guard's key or do anything else ""escapy"", even when no guard is in sight or would otherwise know, you are almost intantly discovered unless you do something to cover it up. It makes sense to make a fake vent cover so a guard strolling by later won't notice anything suspicious, but they notice RIGHT AWAY, relying only on their psychic guard powers. They know it was you whether you're breaking a vent in the bathroom or have dug a hole in another inmate's cell, too. Sneakiness is out the window. Plus, the second that they detect you, you're thrown into solitary. They don't start sweeping the cells or climbing into the vents, you're just caught. With a note from the Warden saying ""Nice Try"", of course.I can practically hear a meeting between the developers where one of them said, ""And then we'll have the guards start a search or line up everybody for inspection,"" but they just never implemented it. It's a game mechanic where something more should happen but doesn't, and it feels incomplete.When you put all these things together, you realize that the game's promise of ""Think up your Own Escape Plan"" doesn't really let you do all the strategies you may come up with. Want to conspire with other inmates to set up distractions or get supplies for you? Can't. Want to go to a seldom-patrolled part of the prison and climb into the vents? The guards will know anyway. Can you even make a key out of soap, one of the most used prison-break tropes? Nope.Even as I write this, I worry I'm being too hard on this game. It's not like any of these things make it unplayable or broken. It just doesn't feel like a Full Release. In the time I played I kept thinking of mechanics and details that it would be cool for the dev team to add, but it's not in Early Access anymore. The game is even fun to play for a while, and this review is sooooo close to a Recommended. But, in the end, the game doesn't seem to have enough polish to make that fun varied or lasting. They should have finished it first.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  The concept is super cool, and the fact that it's basically a puzzle game is very interesting, but the gameplay itself doesn't have any soul.  It too often feels like work.  Very little of what you have to do is intuitive, specifically the crafting and how you are meant to interact with the environment.  Items have no descriptions to indicate their potential functions.  Characters are just pawns to manipulate, you can't really interact with them in a meaningful way to glean info on how the game works, what might be going on in your prison, or what you might be able to do with them (on top of them being personally indistinguishable from one another).  I too often just had to look something up to see if I could do it, and if I could, how, because it was rarely obvious.  For example, I knocked out a guard and immediately tried what I knocked him out for: making a mold of his key using my soap bar.  Nope.  Or how about making the key using the correct mold - molten plastic?  Got a lighter and a plastic fork and - nope.  Plastic has to come from a comb or toothbrush, I discovered when I looked it up.  Alternatively, I could pay my character's money to use the payphone to get randomized hints about what to do, but why can't I just glean this info from playing the game? It is otherwise simply not there.The stats for your character also feel like artificial blockades, and why they degrade I'm not really sure.  I don't want to spend 3 minutes clicking one spot in order to get smarter, or pressing the Q and E keys over and over to get stronger or faster.  It's just not fun, so why have it?  The worst part is you don't level these stats up in any other way besides the exercise task or the reading task, so you are forced to engage in these activities.  Increasing these stats based on what quests you complete would have been a good idea, or based on moving around the prison, but it doesn't work that way - you must exercise or read, which amounts to wasting time both in-game and in real life.  Nothing quantified how I feel about this game better than clicking the bookshelf and watching the ""reading"" meter fill up over the course of a couple seconds.When the game works, it works very well. Attempting an escape is thrilling and got my pulse going. It's just the process of getting there that is not fun. I don't want to have to have a browser window open when I can't figure out why I can't combine a pillow and a prison outfit to make a bed dummy, or why the entrance key won't let me out of the prison, and for that matter what these colored locks mean and why I have to actually obtain the keys to them before I can even see their names.This game feels like it was designed by people who are very comfortable with having a browser window open in crafting and survival games, as though that's just the accepted reality of these games.  That's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reality, man.			"

												This happened to be my first game on steam that was purchased for me by my mate and at this time, i really enjoyed the game after watching many youtubers such as inthelittlewood and jacksepticeye play it. However, its now a year later, and i find myself not returning to this game anytime soon.To start with gameplay, at first it can be really fun, i like the crafting system and the fact you have to find a way to escape each prison by using different items and i have managed to escape 2 of these prisons so far. However whenever i go back to play this game, i just find it very repetitive and boring as i'm just doing the same things every in game day with no real gameplay changes. The game can also get really boring as sometimes you have to wait around for certain things to happen and this unfortunately ruins the game for me. Perhaps im not really into simulation games and i may return to this game someday, but to me, this feels like the type of game that you could just watch someone else play to completion and still feel satisfied. I cannot recommend this game because of these reasons, however if you are into simulation style games, then this game could be for you. The only thing i recommend is that you don't play this game for to long each day as this is the main cause for the game to get boring and repetitive.Overall 5/10 - Good game but very slow to progress. Having only one prison (the easiest) prison unlocked at the beginning leaves no real option in gameplay unless you buy the DLC.			"

												I absolutely love this game. From planning your escape to the rush of putting your plot to work, it's amazing throughout. It's fun to try and find ways to hide your contraband from the guards and ways to smuggle materials from people and jobs to your desk. It's also really crushing if the guards find out what you're planning... But if they don't, the rush of escaping is insane. Regardless of how boring it must look to see someone cutting through vent grates or digging under a fence, it had my heart pounding, especially if a guard just happened to wonder by me. Overall, I think this game is awesome and it's worth your time and money.			"

												This game is amazing, it doesn't really get old, as long as you aren't stuck on one prison, wich normally doesn't happen, but there's plenty of helpful youtube videos, the mechanics are great, escaping is entence as it should be, and its not too hard, or too easy. It's not very glitchy, in my 18 hours I've only found 2, one where a guard came to search my room, then just stood in it for the night, xD. Also, people can tend to get stuck into walls, wich isn't exactly GamEbreAking! I really suggest you buy it, one thing is buy it quickly, because in the begginging it was 10$, then 15$ now 18$, so it is going up, but don't fret too much. So, my one tip isBUY IT!			"

								The escapists, a game I love more than a band of bassists.The escapists of course is about prison life, where you are the source of a lone lunatic with a knife. Attempting to escape from a desolate jail, in desperate need of a quick bail. The gameplay is simple; you need to breakout no matter how many guards/prisoners you’re required to takeout. I admire the options, no matter how dire like hanging from a wire. You can dig out, but if the prison is big it won't end well with me and my mate dizon arisen from the dirt, only to appear in the middle of the yard in fear and sniper fire. You can cause a riot when things've gotten quiet, but certainly hard when I kept losing my teeth in the yard. Or more fun escape via roof, while under pursuit before getting stomped by the guard’s practical hoof.All in all I can't comment much more beyond that, the involvement of this game is like a torrent of vomit, a spice rack of chunks of what was a good snack, but with an oversized wallet locked away in the closet it becomes quite worth it.Otherwise can recommend.

								a wonderful game but not with out flaws. the ai is rather stupid examples being if you do something illegal and escape the guards they wont attempt to track you after words they just forget about it. however the game is still great runing around scrounging for items crafting and planing the ultimate escape. there are many things i think they could ad in updates to make the game a little funner one thing being more dynamic story telling and having the other prisoners more interactive and be more diverse, iw ould also love love love love to see a sort of multiplayer were you and you friends coulf play together and escape, over all id give the game a strong 7/10* Edit*since writing my review some new features have been added; now we have steam achievments as well as a multitude of new prisons. they improved the realationship system as well as adding prisson take overs which means you can assemble a team and take the violent path			"

								Incredible game. Very light-hearted humor, but it is extremely fun. The necessity to follow your routine to maintain your cover is great, and really adds to the drama of trying to escape. Hiding your tools, using fake walls, looting other prisoners when they get beat up - it's dog eat dog, and I love it. The art style was a good choice, in my opinion. It's pixel art, which works great for this setting. Even with the limited tile size, the game manages to look good, I've never wondered ""What is that supposed to be?""The music is very catchy, though the only drawback I have is the transition between 'periods' feels disjointed. Going from, say, free time to lunch, for example, it's very noticeable that it's loading a new background song, as the first one just ends, and the other begins. The gameplay is good. The controls are very tight, and the UI is intuitive. The cursor does a good job of telling you what it's currently doing, in terms of combat, using items, or interaction. Difficulty wise, it's got a bit of a learning curve. But once you kind of learn your routine, you can start picking your times to work on your escape. It's challenging to find the right tools, or enough tools, so you do tend to have to stockpile before you can really get to work. Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10.			"

								The game is incredibly fun. You could suspect that it purposefully saves your progress in a way that makes you just want to keep on playing and playing! Except for a few bugs where NPCs glitch and get stuck in the walls, and doors disappear, it is playable AND enjoyable. I really can't wait for the promised ""Build your own prison"" mode. Perhaps a multiplayer mode would enhance the joy of this game even further, but that is just my opinion.It reminds me a lot to Minecraft and Prison Architect, which the creators may have been inspired by.The game is said to be released in late 2015, if you don't like glitches and bugs I would wait for the full release, but if you want to experience the mechanics you should buy it now.

												EDIT:  This review is very outdated, and since the addition of the white locked doors, this no longer works.I have created the best strategy at beting this game.  Ever.It took me only 27 minutes to beat it, and I beat it at lunch of Day 3.       The problem is everyone thinks of the most elaborate scheems ever to beat the game (through the vent, digging underground, etc.)  But this plan is simple, and I mean SIMPLE.  All you have to do is collect a few things:1. Tub of talcum powder2. Toothpaste3. Comb/Toothbrush4. Lighter5. Somewhat good weapon      After collecting these things your going to require at least 80 intel so you can craft the tub of talcum powder and toothbrush into a wad of putty,  then use the lighter and comb/toothbrush to make molten plastic.  After doing so get at least 35 health (70 strength), and around 40 speed or so.      Now that you've got all the hard work done, it's time for the fun part.  You're going to beat up gaurds until you have the one with a staff key, if he doesn't have the red staff key, don't take it.  When you find the one with the red staff key take it off him, and combine the key with the wad of putty.  and it is EXTREMELY imortant that after you make the staff key mold you put the real staff key back on him.  If you don't do so you will lose all your items.  Now you have a staff key mold.  craft the staff key mold with the molten plastic So you will get a plastic staff key.  Once you have this you're ready to escape.  All you have to do is when the guards are doing rolecall (So 3 of them are occupied, and 2 are guarding)  You run out the front door,  select the staff key,  click one of the doors with a red lock with you're plastic staff key, and  run out the unlocked door to freedom.      If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time to read this quick guide to win easy, and I hope it helps!			"

								I have been waiting for this game ever since it came out on greenlight over a year ago, checking each month to see what progress was made. Let me just say that this game was worth the wait. I am a big fan of 'pixel games' and this game is no exception. The game has captured the theme of living in a prison very well, making you want to escape from the dreadful prison!This game very enjoyable as is both fair and difficult. Although it can be a real challenge to escape the prison, the general gameplay is simple and lets you choose how you want to play. With very simple guidlines and controls, you get a hang of the game in a flash. You can either escape through the vents, tunnel underground, obtain fake keys or now, with the new update, beat down all of the guards! The escaping part of the game is the hardest and very intense. This game does currently have only 1 prison to escape from, but I am sure that there will be more prisons in the future as they are frequently updating the game. The most recent update allowed more ways to escape as well as new uniforms to enhance the way you play. The crafting aspect of the game is incredible. With countless things availiable to craft, you can either discover the vast diversity of crafting through crafting notes, or steam guides :). With the developers working on the game at an outstanding pace, there will for sure be way more crafting options, as well as new items, then there are now.Games with good AI are the ones that stand out for me, and this is one of them. The prisoners have their own way of doing things with there personal opinion on you. They may fight you if you have done things that they don't like which have stacked up, or join you in fighting guards if you help them enough. They have challenges for you which you can do for money, in which you can buy vital items you need to escape with. I'm am sure with the new updates that come that these inmates will continue to become more intelligent and my even try to escape from you. Being a Prison Architect fan, the idea of being an actual prisoner inside the game itself was fasinating. This game really pulled it off well, as the gameplay, AI and content all added up to this game being a thriving success. This game will continue to get better and better as the updates continue to improve the game. It deserves more popularity that is has in my opinion. Overall Score 9/10			"

												This is a great strategy game for anyone who wants to test their mental limit in planning and scheming.The map editor needs to be improved though, as it is missing some important parts (if they're already in place and I'm just missing them, please tell me):   1) More selectable zones, specifically: library, mailroom, cells 11-20, infirmary, officer quarters, and employment offices.   2) More wall/fence options, like a four-way path and more three-way paths (up-left-right and up-down-left missing).   3) Some kind of tutorial or guide, or at least more detailed/clearer info when you hover over the objects.I also feel like there should be a way to save or quick save during the day, since players currently need to play through an entire day before being able to save their game.

												Super fun game! I felt obligated to write this review to clear the air because although I don't usually write reviews I got bored and found myself reading the ones here and I notice multiple ones saying that you should not buy it because its too hard and its too easy to get caught. So from a veteran of the game let me tell you, this game is very hard. It's also very rewarding, fun, and you will NOT be able to beat every prison in 12 hours of gameplay like it seems half of the negative reviews expect to be able to. I feel like they just got upset and came straight here to write a bad review. One review stated if you are in your cell and they see something wrong like a wall broken you are caught, well no **** you are caught!! They probably had no idea that you can put bed sheets over the cell bars! This is one of my favorite games of all times and trust me, you will rage so hard playing this game, but if you don't just quit and you actually learn the game, you'll love it!			"

												This game is super cool and intense as hell. The learning curve is of an acquired taste, and there's a lot of trial and soul-and-progress-shattering error but it's well worth it and is a better experience for it.Sometimes you'll fail a lot just trying to work out the rules of the game and I can see how some would find that frustrating. But I still generally respect the decision to lean the design in this direction.If you find yourself tempted to look up crafting recipes via Wiki's etc I would advise you to try not doing so, and simply allow yourself to be immersed in this fun little prison life sim and start putting ideas together just as I suppose you really would if you we're planning some kind of daring escape! Try things out and experiment, the recipes and working ideas i've discovered just by putting two and two together were incredibly rewarding, infact so were the recipes that you get out of finding and acquiring ""crafting notes"". There's an immense sense of satisfaction in finally making your first escape after 28+ days of learning the game inside of the first prison. It feels very real and rewarding and triumphant in a way not many games can offer. Because of how open the game is, the plan you make is your plan and will in some way be probably quite different to everyone elses plan. I got very invested in my first escape when I finally committed to ""making a break for it"".It's also jusssst accessible and forgiving enough, with _just_ stupid enough AI to make the player feel reasonably comfortable with experimenting and trying out crazy ideas. A very difficult balance to get right.Awesome game.			"

								The escapists is a game that reinvents escaping prison in a nice 8-bit arcadie style game. It has a multitude of ways to escape which can vary alot along with the many tools to help you with that. The game makes you feel like you are actually trying to escape prison which makes you feel really worried/stressed if you nearly get caught (especially at night). This game is a new and exciting genre of its type that works perfectly when put into practice. Only negative comment is that some bugs/glitches can occur when getting caught for a few off reasons, but other than that it is a great game and I'm sure they will patch it (hopefully). I would strongly recommened this game to anyone.			"

												The Escapists is a great game. It has a good level of challenge, but not too much which invokes frustration and not too little which gets boring. The learning curve is cleverly-designed, as you learn immensely as you play. If you are stuck on any of the prisons in the main game, then check out my guide: It includes a full equipment list, plus steps in order to break out and unique, full-scale prison maps annotated with escape routes.

												When i first got this game, I thought it was pretty fun. But as i played further, the game really lost its charm and became really boring. There are really no fun ways of escaping, and for the most part, escaping is impossible unless you google how to do it. If there was a way to organize an escape with other inmates, this game would be leaps and bounds greater. But of course the other inmates are pretty useless for anything other than items. You always see the same few jokes that have lost their novelty 1 or 2 hours into the game, and talking to them only gets your respect up. That respect doesn't translate into them helping you in fights or building a gang; it only makes their comments change to a happier tone. They don't give you tips on how to escape, you cant task them to do your dirty work... The disconnect between NPC and the player is so frustratingly low. I hate the fact that the game feels less like a prison and more like an endless challenge with no real satisfaction.TL;DR - the game is a great concept, but it lacks complexity that would make you really immerse with the world. The disconnect between player and NPC is so large, it is actually frustrating. Its not worth your money, honestly.3/10PS: I bought this game back when it was Early Access, but i have played the full release version. My opinion still stands.			"

												This game is very addicting. You are some random prisioner as you try and escape the prision you are in. Not just any old fashion escape. But the most unqiue escape you can think of, depending upon of course the prision you are in. Each prision offers it's own unique challenges that may seem easy. But it gives players that ""false impression"". It isn't easy. You have to plan it out, and with a little luck you can escape the prision with ease.And with a fun modding community. This game makes it so much better. The only little issue about the game is mainly the save points. You can only save it before you get some shut eye. Which makes sense. But in some cases players might want a ""backup"" save just in case something goes wrong in the perfect situation so that way they can go back and do something else.Other than that, if you enjoy these type of games then this one is right up your alley. I recommend it.			"

												Edit: Before I edited this review (See original at the bottom of this review) I took it in a humorous manner, but now, I want to actually speak about the gameplay mechanics and features.     To start out, when you open the game, you  can either play the game or open the map editor (Which is an exceptional addition, but I'll get to that later). Once you have opened the game you get the usual intro of about 3 logos or so, real fast, then you're on to the main menu. Start a new file, pick a prisoner, name that prisoner (optional, default names are provided), then, just like a snap of the fingers, you're in prison for whatever reason. You have one main goal: escape. You have many ways to escape the prison/camp, but each prison/camp varies in difficulty. You can tunnel out most prisons, cut through them, and. if so you wish, take some nunchaku (NunChucks), knock out every guard and just walk out the place.     There is more to the game than meets the eye. Under the nostalgic 16-bit graphics, you have a complicated, yet easily understandable game. There are very many crafting recipes, and yes, I know what you are thinking, ""Oh no, another clone trying to rip off the ol' MineCraft crafting mechanic..."" But that is not how the crafting works. Sure, you collect items to make something new, but you're not making furnaces or desks, or even beds. You are making your means of escape. After you have made your contraband through the detectors, to your room, or wherever, and make your items, you have to hide them. Cell shakedowns are very common and happen on parameters I'm not sure on yet. Once you have everything you need, its time to move. You have to have impeccable timing skills to escape properly without detection. It took me forever to escape my first prison and that happened only a few days ago. I tried doing it the difficult way, and that only messes you up further. There are relationships between the prisoners (friendship wise), and you need some of them to like you, too. Especially your roommate if you have one.     Let's talk graphics. They're simple, yet elegant, and you can tell what the group of pixels are supposed to be. That is how you do 16-Bit graphics, my PC Master Racers.     I whole-heartedly recommend this game. Now, on to the original review!""I vote this game 10/10. I beat up a guy and took his job, then knocked out a guard with chocolate. If you don't have this game, ask yourself this question: ""What am I doing with my life?""""			"

												this is a hardcore strategy game with a limit of options avalible to you. the amount of options you have depends on which prision you are currently trying to escape from.  Tougher the security is in the prison, less options you'll have. The world is comedic, but you hardly see anything comedic, you only read them through text bubbles. The learning curve is abit steep, but the community has your back there, just check out the Guides in the Guide section on steam for any information you need.  the Ui design is abit "" right in your face "" and way too large. Everything you have can be taken from you upon death but you can also lose items if you have them. But that depends on if it's "" contraband "" or not. The maps sizes vary, but most of the maps have a huge ground to cover. The graphics help hide the real brutality which occurs alot in this game, like seeing 3 prisioners fight one another with 5 gaurds jumping into the brawl with nothing but batons. The ""death"" mechanic is treated more like ""knocked out"" in the game. But, getting shot by a sniper from a gaurd tower....kinda ruins the supension of disbelief even though the game wants you to think your just knocked out. Annd...well, that's it. That's all I can say on this.The game itself isn't much really. But, it's sure entertaining when you have a need to do a ""escape"" of sort. Ohh, and my creditials are as follows: I cleared the tutorial, Center Perks, and Stalag Flucht during early access.			"

												Now, I have only played around 15 of the games in my library of a somewhat comparatively larger 54, but boy am I glad that this is one of the games I play. Now, much like a lot of my games, if it's not tf2 I dont play it often. This stands for this game as well, though it is extremely enjoyable. The amount of luck that can go into the earlier prisons (note my day 2 escape) and the amount of skill the later ones take is one of the defining factors that makes this game stand out to me. It was quite small whilst it was coming up to its release, but many youtubers shifted popularity onto this gem and I would like to thank them. And hey, naming prisoners after your friends and seeing how they react in the new life, at the end of the day, is broderline enjoyable. It's like if sims was in a prison except not sims... Wait what? Ok, what I meant to say was it's nice to kick back to prison life and try and escape the prisons. The dialogue is also filled with references, so make sure to read em' all! I rate it a 7/10			"

Early Access Review
								Overview:This being my first game to purchase on steam, I would say it was a very good investment. The Escapists has given me countless ours of fun and enjoyment. From beating up guards to smuggling contraband around the prison, I've really had a blast with this game and hopefully I can convince you that it is too.  :)First Impressions:I found out about this game by a youtuber called Paulsoares Jr. who sometimes tries out new games on steam. It seemed like a great game; he had lots of fun with it and gave lots of tips and ultimately showed me how to play before I purchased it. I had never seen anything quite like this pixelized prison game, so I decided to scrape up the *ten bucks and give it a go. *The game price has risen a bitHow do I play?:When playing The Escapists, I was helped very much by the in-game tips and by pressing F1, I could see all of the controls; although, it would be helpful if it would have told me more about things like: opinion and how to earn it; and beating up guards and prisoners.Pros:-only $10.00, very worth it *shortly after I bought it, the price rose, but it is still very worth it in my opinion*-tons of crafting items-many different ways to escapeCons:-the game is early access so the game is uncomplete and there are some bugs-no multiplayer-sometimes pretty unbalanced in that if you get caught, all of your hard work goes away :(Summary:I would over all rate this game an 8.5 and I hope you give it a go as I did, I promise you won't regret it!

												I've played this game for a few hours, I'm gonna tell you what I think about it.Let's get the con's out of the way, shall we?- Very hard. When you try to escape, you need to make sure every guard is gone. If you want to dig your way out, you need to have a tunnel short-term. Not having and underground tunnel long-term, because everything will be gone, even your other stuff you used to escape.- Crafting is very hard, your need to find crafting recepies and you need to higher your intellect or you can't craft stuff.- Your stats increase slowely, keeping your stats at the right place is hard and requires valuable time you need to have to escape.- Guards will dislike everything you do (Not being on the right place on the right time, standing on table's, looting stuff etc.)Let's dump all the negativity and move on with the pro's:+ Very well scripted, you have different periods (You need to finish your job, have meal, train, etc.)+ This game has humour+ Very addicting (Because you fail everytime, you want to try again :P).+ Community is ok. Some immature people, some nice people.+ Missions and different ways to earn money.+ Every thing you make or do, feels rewarding.+ A lot of items.+ Workshop, all these maps are amazing.Overall: 7/10, not for everyone. If you don't like 2D games I suggest to you that you won't like this game. The con's are the reason this rating has -3 points. The game is very hard, even in the most Easy prison available.			"

												I will first say this: this game used to be fun. Dont get me wrong, I had my fair share of fun with it. But then... I stopped. The major problem with this game is that its the same concept for each level. gather items, avoid guards, break out. It got boring after a while to be honest. If there was a little comedy to this game then maybe i would revisit it more often. But I have grown tired of it for now.Still, it had so much potential... if only it had more to it besides breaking out.			"

								 I highly reccomend doing your research before playing the game (PaulSoaresJr does a fantastic job) But even if you don't want to, you don't have to!! There are literally crafting notes you can find and buy from the money you got off of beating someone up, taking their playing cards and giving it to them, distracting guards, etc... There are SOOO many different ways to escape that my mind, is just... It can't escape from the escapists. (See what I did there? :D No? ok...) Anyways, way beyond worth the 15 bucks, should be worth what it's at now, I feel it's a perfect price for eraly access, as it is it's ready for release.			"

												This game is SUPER FUN! When you know how to play it, it's really fun.Personally, I got the PC for the editor. I mainly play this game on my Xbox One.There is 6 basic prisons. Each with twists, a snow one, a one where the guards are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the one where it's 2.4% impossible. But, there is about 5-6 DLC Maps for money with special mechanics, and a Level Editor and Workshop for infinite levels! For 6$ (for the sale) or $18, it's a really good game. IF you want a Editor, get the Computer verison. If you have a Xbox One, and don't care about creating levels and you want the 6 levels and DLC, get the PlayStation 4 or the Xbox One Edition (Xbox and PlayStation is alot easier.)			"

								This game is great. It is in-depth, difficult, and overall fun. Fun fact, I actually almost donated to the project almost a year before it made the Steam Greenlight. Actually, this was the first greenlight game i'd ever approved of. I bought it as soon as i had enough money.9.5/10Pros1. Very in-depth. The prisons you play in almost feel like a real prison.2.Good DeveloperThe developer is constantly adding to the game, this game is very well-kept. I reported a bug about your character literally not being able to get out of their bed if you loaded the game in the same session you already played in, and they fixed it within two weeks.3.Wide Variation of itemsI actually had to consult the forum to get some of these ideas! Who would've thought of molten hot chocolate? not me! This game has a surprisingly accurate crafting system as well.Cons1. This game is still early accessThis game is unfinished, so if you don't like changes being made to a game while you play, it isn't for you.2. The questing system needs workThe game has a well-implemented crafting system, but sometimes you get glitched quests that don't acknowledge when you complete them. This is an issue sometimes, as i'll beat up Officer David,  and then i won't get paid. Also, duplicate quests, (i.e. bob and joe both want officer cooper beat up), means that I have to beat up officer cooper twice, beating him up once only honors one request.3.The game has a massive difficulty spike.There needs to be less of a spike between the first and second prisons. End of story.4.Duplicate ItemsA lot of items are basically the same except in crafting. For example, the screwdriver and the crowbar are identical in purpose and value. I would like to see both items work differently.Things i'd like to see1.Co-OpThis is the huge feature i'd like. Team up, or perhaps go against your friends to make escaping the same prison a new adventure.2.Prison EditorI'm aware this is a planned feature, but the sooner you add it the better.			"

												The Escapists is a puzzle and sandbox game which tasks you with escaping several different prisons (each getting harder than the last).I personally found this game to be very enjoyable, the game gives you plenty of ways to escape from a prison, giving the game a strong sandbox feel and high replay value. Don't expect to get out of prison on your first run fast though (unless you look at some guides), it takes a long time to find the right moment to take action, but you are rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment once you leave the stone fortress behind.Gameplay: The Escapists has a rich and deep system of ways to escape and content within the game. As stated earlier, there is plenty of different ways to escape from a prison. I like the way they incorporated your character's stats; you have to regularly train your character's ablities (going to the exercise room, reading, etc.) to improve your capabilites and keep your stats up high. It prevents simply maxing out all your stats and leaving the prison easily. The crafting system is complex and interesting, but I find it rather annoying that you have to buy the crafting notes from inmates (when one could simply use the wiki). Combat is rather boring, as it's simply a question of who is stronger/has a better weapon. This is easily forgiven though as combat is not the aim of the game.Graphics: The graphics is a simple yet charming 2D art style. You can really see the amount of detail that went into the art.Technical: Much to my delight, I have had absolutely zero technical issues (framerate, crashing, etc) with the game so far.Music: Simple and rather bland. Most of the time it just acts as an ambience. While it's not terrible, don't expect an amazing soundtrack.Final Score: The Escapists is a rich and rewarding game that is defiantly worth your time, although it may be a bit pricey for an early access game, it defiantly already is at a stage of completion with a few small issues and improvements that could be made.EDIT: I am very happen to see the release of the prison editor and (extremely cheap) DLC for the game. Boosts my overall score to 8.8.8.8/10 "

												Ok... So we've got a small game with limited budget and somebody on the developer's side who's smart enough not to care. I've watched games like this crash and burn in the past, but lookie lookie, with simple objebtives, and Mod-Editor, and a ton of imagination and suddenly you got something that smells like the beginnings of a Franchise!PROS and CONS: Ok so it's simple. It's works simply. It looks simple. It feels simple. It's not, drop you jaw, beautiful, nor should it be... That would be an entirely different game, if it was. (and most likely rubbish to boot.) It IS simple but it works (and primarily because it IS just that, simple.) It's funny, frustrating, difficult to learn, and good ol' fashioned, arcade style annoyingly difficult to keep up with if you don't plan ahead for eventualities. There's tons and tons of content and there will likely be tons more, at least until somebody funds the Team for a sequel or remake (God help us, it'll be a hard hurdle to clear to make something ""better"" or whatever, than this nice, annoying, addictive, timeconsuming, SIMPLE little game...) The controls are a little pedestrian and a little bit of a pain to master properly, but it actually feels like that was done on purpose to give you that old arcade feeling... The physics are a bit weird, but they work, (and, no, we'll not get into the ""recipes"" or ""blueprints"" or ""plans"" for assorted stuff you can make to aid in your escape, it's a little harsh, and probably a far cry from reality, but, also probably, not far enough...)Overall: For a ""cheap"" little game, with rudimentary graphics, gameplay and little-to-no story, this is a slam-dunk. I won't be playing this constantly (not anymore. It's so damned addictive you forget the time, once you commit to escaping,) but I am sure not gonna be judging anybody who does. And I probably will be checking in once in a while to check the content, and check to see what else the dev's have planned. - There's promise here, and fingerprints of somebody who likes to play as much as they like to make games.For what I think the dev's were aiming for: I'll put it down hard 10/10. You nailed it!On a more general basis of my own preferences: 7,5/10. It doesn't blow my mind, (not that I think it was supposed to,) but DAMN is it fun. It won't be on my top ten for ""Greatest Games,"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it will sure as hell be one of the games I WILL come back and play again, and again, and again, and again....

								Prison Simulator in old-style. In one word: awesome.The game is playable in early access, even though has *some* game-breaking glitches (going through walls and getting stuck), but when you start playing it, you get pulled in.Day after day, you do your daily jail routine, help your mates, steal, work, beat up people, collecting materials for your ultimate goal: The Escape. It isn't easy, and you've got little time, but when (and IF) you manage to escape, the feeling is awesome. The game allows you to finish it as fast as 1 in-game day, or play for a long time and become the master of your prison, going anywhere you want and doing anything you'd ever think about. The only things, that I feel, like the game lacks now, is multiplayer and steam workshop, for maps/characters.TL;DR - Awesome game even in early access.			"

												Either I suck or this game is really hard. Which means it's probably a rather good simulation of prison escaping!I'd say close to impossible without looking at guides at least for crafting recipes. It doesn't so much reward creativity as it does knowing the game mechanics, that's the only unfortunate point.There's also a bug (?) where items I hide near toilets disappear on reloading or something like that? Or the game is supposed to be rogue-like?Overall fun, immersive and challenging experience. Might be a little too hard to get into knowing the mechanics and recipes. Also some of those mechanics are annoying like going directly into solitary and having to basically ""farm"" stats with repetitive actions.Still recommanded because it's apart from other games but it has its good and bad points.

								Quite a realistic way to simulate a prison break. You fight with guards, they'll remember and beat you up everytime they see you, until they've actually beaten you up (I think this is a glitch currently). Beat up other inmates, their opinions towards you decreases . Make their opinions low enough, they'll start attack you when they see you alone in a corner. do favor for the inmates, their opinions towards you increases, and you can recruit them to join you as a gang. It feels like it's going to be a long run, not short game, as what you'd expect a prison escape simulator should be. You need to slowly build up your way in order to break out. Tools must be made yourself, and if you dig, you need to remember to flush out the dirt. And yes, there's no guarantee your toilet is functional, if you're in bad luck the toilet will just get clogged.I'm on day 24, and trying for a shawshank redemption breakout, playing cool with everyone else while silently solo planning on a breakout.

												I'd highly recommend this game to people with the patience and ability to learn from your mistakes, because you will make them and you will lose all the stuff you've spent days collecting and crafting. When you get busted and lose all your stuff it can be very frustrating, but ultimately, it's your own fault. The game IS fair, its just a steep learning curve i'm guessing many of the negative reviews on here never fully climbed.This is a prison escape simulator, not a prison hardman simulator so you have to play accordingly. Sure you can just craft a weapon and go on a rampage but you'll just end up in hospital or solitary - minus your contraband.I'm making progress by keeping a low profile, following the routine, staying out of trouble and quietly going about collecting items and planning my escape, and like real prison, it's progress by inches.So if you're looking for instant gratification and think you can spend an hour or two escaping then move onto the next level - This game is probably not for you. I've been playing this game for two days straight and i'm still on the first prison.If you like a challenge and have the mental fortitude to play the long game, then i think you'd love this game as i do. Just remember boys and girls, the devil is in the detail - one small oversight can set you back days or weeks of scavaging, Brutal but fair.Best prison game i've played, and i've played - and loved - prison architech.

												Well this isn't a complete review, but i will give my thoughts on it so far. Right now i am on day 5, i wanted to continue so badly but i wanted to try the dlc which is ok, but i wasn't finding myself wanting to continue (If you are wondering, i got The Walking dead dlc). I found that the humor gave me a chuckle, even when i lost my best gear. One fustrating thing is trying to make a plan, Which, is WAY to hard, i mean i get that it is supposed to be hard but i am still in the first prison. Sure you can just retry that plan, but it could fail again. Once i remember i tried to escape by stealing an officers outfit from the laundry room and trying to find a shovel, Well i haven't found anything to help me dig yet so it hasn't worked yet. But this is is really entertaining and i reccomend it to those who have that prison feel. Thats not to say that those who don't have or like prison feels won't like it but you never know.			"

								This game, though it may not look like much, is much harder than one would expect. Even on the easiest prison, every move you make must be carefully calculated. You're gonna need to make sure you keep an eye on your heat to make sure you take on the more appropriate jobs. Hunting down the people selling things can be a hassle, and doesn't always end with good results in terms of buyable products. You have to be extremely careful to leave no evidence, the guards find even a small chip in the wall and it's off to solitary and reset progress. It's important to find a place to store your contraband before you overstock on it. Schedules are important, miss a day of work and you're out of work. This is a game I recommend to anybody who enjoys strategy games.			"

												Pretty fun. Shame how I'm not going to finish it. ""But why not, Peace?"" Because I'm a lazt ♥♥♥♥, that's why.The escapists is a game where you try to escape the prison, make friends with the inmates do jobs for money do favours to rain reputation and money and so on. Try to beat the guards up (no murdering tho, even if you shank them twice with your makeshift glass shank).You start off in a prison, figure out the prison routine, and do things for a few days while you start digging holes, unscrewing vent covers, and so on. Be all sneaky-beaky like.It's great fun, unfortunately the gameplay is kind of repetitive once you start getting into it (duh, it's a prison game).Full price is 17.99, I have played 16 hours so that's roughly a dollar an hour. But I got it on sale, for half price or something. So it is definitely worth it on sale.Full price? Eh... Might as well wait and play CS:GO or Dota 2 or whatever your ""free to play"" (costs your soul though) game that you play at the moment.			"

												The Escapists is awesome! That's what i would say when it came out. (IF ITS TL:DR check the bottom.)Seriously, my friend usually would ask me to make a broadcast to watch me play the game.The game its self is really cool, a bit repetitive and a spice of luck is required, but if you are a chuck norris badass you can always get your gang and beat up everyone in the prison while you escape through a tunnel.BUT THEN.........THE FNAF/SELLOUT YOUTUBER PANDEMIC CAME.Seriously its even worse than the one from Gmod (amazing game by the way)You browse through you workshop and will find something like this JACKSCEPTIC ULTRA BOSS MEGA PRISON PLS PLS PLS PLAY.FNAF ULTRA SPOOKY HEART ATTACK SO COOL PLEASE SUBSRIBEAnd the worst part, very good and original maps like one which is based IN A ROCKET PRISON IS SPACE. Is less famous than THE ULTR AJACKSPECTICEYE ULTRA ULTRA PRISONLike holy hell its spreading, THE DESEASE IS SPREADING. The game would be PERFECT if it wasnt for its cancer like community. A game gets ruined always if something like this happens:Step 1: Sellout youtuber plays game that wasnt very popular yet very respectful and cool within its players, sharing their ideas.Step 2:Sellout youtuber makes around 10 million episodes of the game making the youtuber send its brainless army to the game to destroy every good piece of art with infected crap.Step 3: Community of the game is COMPLETELY ruined. CongratulationsSame happens with FNAFTL:DR The community right now makes you want to suicide.			"

								The Escapists is a ingenuitive game. I haven't seen many like it, so the originality impresses me. Moreover, the gameplay is intriguing- you're constantly on your toes, hoping the guards won't search your- oh damn, too late, they searched my cell!The crafting system holds nearly endless possibilites, and the excercizing/reading system has my fingers on thier toes (pun entirely intended) Overall, the Escapists is a very well planned game, and I would give it a 9.5/10.Mouldy Toof and Team17- thanks for entertaining me!

								Finally Early access done right.Regular updates, it already got two prison maps !Dev is posting weekly updates too.This game remembers me of the old 2d metal gear solid games.Your a prisoner and have to escape. But you have to watch your back, because the guards can get supsicious quite quickly!There are daily routines like prison job , workout , food times etcBut the fun part starts when you leave those routines and start to discover the prison. There are many areas to discover.Outside court with several job places. Inside areas with kitchen , workout rooms. And you can even visit several floors.Fun and entertaining. Everyday you discover new craft recipes and tools to make.Best thing it seems that's the job of one dude !TL;DRBasically its a blend of 2d metal gear and terraria. Sneaking mechanics with tons of craft recipes and discoveryAt that price its a steal!Edit: It got now tons of prisons. It had so many updates i cant even follow up all the prisons. I think currently it got round about five different prisons and now even a prison break race event started!So obviously still recommended and the updates are amazing :)			"

								This is an amazing game and it is so much fun to play.  Here's a few pros and cons that I have put together after about 18 hours of gameplay:Pros- Cheap- Multiple prisons to escape from- You get to name your character (who doesn't love that)- Controls are simple and easy to learn- The feeling of success after escaping- Early Access means that they are going to add lots of new content (YAY)Cons- Addicting- All of the other prisoners act the same- It doesn't even seem like gaurds have a pattern- Other than getting all your contraband taken away from you, going to solitary has pretty much no drawbacksI really like this game and I'm excited to see how it turns out.  Oh, I almost forgot,  YOU SHOULD BUY IT.  "

												IF YOU DON'T READ MY REVIEW I JUST RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY ""PRISON ARCHITECT"" INSTEAD!!! THEY'RE STILL UPDATING THE MECHANICS AND STILL GIVING OUT BIG MONTHLY UPDATES FOR BOTH THE MAIN GAME AND ESCAPE MODE! (EDIT: Escape mode doesn't seem to get any better. Buy it anyways for the awesome prison mechanics)The game was sadly very promising before final release.They had so many plans and promises. (I'LL SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST)   What we got, was predictable AI with telltale signs of where they're going with numerous glitches.      Most gamebreaking being guards switch which way they're heading when you enter and exit inventory or other menues and prisoners getting stuck in walls indefinetly. These glitches were precent in early versions of the game and has yet to be fixed.No in-depth relation with prisoners.   They are basically a chest that needs money to give you things to dig out of prison.Escaping is not fun or original.   You do always have a shining sign with the message ""EXIT HERE."" You either dig your way under a wall, dig trough a wall with a fork or try to beat up guards with hot chocolate. If you get caught THE ENTIRE MAP JUST RESETS! All your hidden stowaways are magically found, broken walls fixed and holes filled by the guards because they found dirt in someone elses toilet and ""tracked"" it back to you. Did I mention the glitches that will never be fixed?   I mentioned AI already in the ""Predictable AI"".    Your inventory lags in some weird way making you have to wait about 1.5 seconds between clicking anything when you try to spamclick 3 times per second.   If you get shot by snipers the star effect sometimes sticks, even when you save and exit.    Some toilets make guards glitch when they try to unplug them. They're supposed to make that 8-bit alert sound once to signify that they have found something out of the ordinary. They're then supposed to check the contents of the toilet to make sure that no contraband is found in it and then just unplug the toilet and walk away. Instead they keep making that annoying alert noice every 2 seconds and just stand there until you quit.   Dirty spots and weeds stack on eachother and only count as one when you work as a janitor or gardener making you work extra, a thing you dont have time with.The maps are plain and the ""snipertowers"" are sprites of guards surrounded by a 3x3 wall.And the absolute worst thing about this game, is that they have the guts to dare to shove lackluster DLC for this UNFINISHED game down our throuts. 5 are out already ranging between 1€-2€ with more probably incoming. These are just single maps. I would be ok with this in some degree if it wasn't for the CONSTANT reminder to ""BUY THE DLC!!!1!!""I checked the game today before making my final verdict of the game and the first thing I see is a pop-up menu with all the DLC that i should buy. When I clicked out of it and clicked ""New Game"" i got a little red notification AGAIN to buy he DLC.    Some special items are only usable in the DLC maps but they still show up in a normal DLC free save. Their paywall is even thcker than anything I've seen come out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of EA. Atleast their DLC mappacks containg multiple maps that are goodlooking instead of this piece of crap.   I wouldn't be angry if they were honest about their plans for DLC, because I wouldn't have touched it.TL'DR: THis game is lacking in content, is glitchy, mechanics are not even scratching the surface for an ""escape from jail"" game and the devs are shoving crappy DLCs down our throuts. Buy ""Prison Architect"" instead!			"

												A great retro-style prison simulation game. You can either act as if you are in prison and do the everyday tasks, or you can come up with a plan to escape a prison. There are quite a few prisons included in the base game, not to mention the massive content on Steam Workshop.Overall, I give it a 9/10. Only criticism I have is the low resolution (though with a game like this, it doesn't matter too much. Just that it looks a teeny bit stretched on my monitor)			"

								The escapist is an 8-bit adventure game based in a prison. You are able to chose from a variety of characters at the beginning to start off your quest to freedom. The aim of the game is to escape (incase you hadn't figured it out) and there are many ways to do this. There are no hints and tips in-game to get you out. you just need to use your initiative. You can go great escape, or steal the keys and hope you can out run the bullets. To do some of these tasks you need to buy equipment from the other inmates. This obviously requires money, which you earn by doing favours. While there are only a few different types of favours in the game at this time, they always seem rewarding, whether that be money or because you punched someone in the face during showers and outran the guards, i dont know. What i do know is the monotonous of buffing up is very.. well monotonus. It doesnt take just a few days to get your strength to a good standard where you can win a fight, same for  intelligence so you can craft certain objects. Other than this, this game has so much potential and i enjoy playing!			"

												Who doesn't like a good puzzle??  If you don't, make time for this one because if you aren't down with the puzzles, this game lets you have fun!  You're in prison.  Objective: break out.  Do favors for inmates, assault them, assault the Correctional Officers (if you dare), make an honest prisoner's wage, buy materials, steal materials, make alliances, whatever it takes to survive and escape!  Think top-down old school Zelda-style play action but your options are only as limited as your efforts.  Break a hole in the wall all Andy Dufrane-like, cover it with a poster, dig a tunnel and hope you come out clean on the other side!  Do not miss this one!			"

												The game is amazing, i really love it. Theres a very real sense to it. Unlike some games where its the same over and over, this is different every time. Very fun. I would give it 8/10. Here is why. The only thing i do not like, is that i get heat easily. Even when i have no illegal items. Now im trying to break out of the first prison and i have a screwdriver, no heat. But then i walked into the bathroom and boom 99 percent, snipers took me out fast. Either its bugged or someone ratted me out (which is unlikely, since i have rep over 50 with every inmate) perhaps if that was changed id give it 10/10. Also the sniper towers are too op. They do add to the realism and hardness of escpaing, but on a super easy prison that shouldnt be the case. Either way you can escape in one day super easy, heres how (on the very easy prison)You will need comb/toothbrushtoothpastetaucum powderlighter2 pillows3 pillow sheetssome form of wall breaking tool (most likely you will only have plastic knives, get exactly 4)all of those are legal, now the illegalsguard outfitany form of wall breaking tool that is better than the knivesThe pillows and sheet you can get from right clicking beds, get those and put them in your deskNext, get either a comb or toothbrush(they are inside every inmate desk, including yours)Also toothpaste, again should be in desksYou may have to knock someone out for the lighter and taucum powder,also DONT FORGET you need to rasie your strength and intel. Raise strength till you have 35 health or more. And i believe somewhere around 70 intel, maybe more, maybe lessDuring your job (you start with laundry) clean the clothes (or dont, but i reccomend you do)After you meet your qouta, get a dirty guard outfit, clean it, then equip it.Why equip it? so the detector doesnt go off when u walk out, then quickly put back on prison outfit and now you have a guard outfitGet knives from the food courtnow begin training and whatnotafter that crafting2 pillows and a sheet make a bed dummylighter and the comb or toothbrush make molten plasticpowder and toothpaste make puttyput the extra 2 sheets on your prison bars (equip it and click on the bars)now the hard partYou have to knock out a guard to find the PURPLE keyfor me, everytime you go to a set period (lunch, gym, etcc) there will be the SAME 2 gaurds, one of them has the key. I tend to pick the one that walks outside more, or is in the upper right corner, but its always one of those 3.When you knock him out, take key and begin crafting right therekey plus putty is moldmold plus molten plastic is plastic purple keyput the key back on the guard asap (if they wake up without a key they put u in solitary)now you waitat evening rollcall make sure you have the knives (4) (or another good wall breaking tool) guard outfit and key. Make sure u have the bed dummy in your bed,equip outfit and leave out the bottom doors outside (this is the only time youll use that key)next go to the right, pick a wall and beginafter some time you will get fatigued, wait a bit, then continue.boom, wall breaks you walk out and escapesnipers are not active at night.also guards might see you, if they walk near you just stop till they leave.

												The escapists is a game where you need to escape prison (duh), but there are many aspects of the game.There are hardly any times where I found this game boring, but I do tend to get a lot of anger when my contraband is taken!You need to locate many strategy to escape each prison step by step. This is a great simulation of what prison would be (except for the dropping the soap).I would also like to mention the DLC's and custom maps are even cooler. I like the fact that this company is trying there best to publish more content for people to play.And finally, the map creator is really fun but will take you time to make! 9.5/10			"

								This game is everything you want in a Prison-escape escapade adventure. With in-depth Crafting, dozens and dozens of different items and with several updates already in line for the near future, this is a must-have game. There are several ways to escape and there is nothing telling you what makes what or where to go, it's down to your instincts! Definitely give it a go, or if doubt, watch my series here to get an idea of the game:

												There are certain games that most everyone likes but just don't capture you for some reason. It's often not the fault of the game but just a bad marriage between game and gamer. So it is with me and The Escapists. To be honest, I don't get it. There's no direction, the art style is best phrased as butt-ugly and the controls aren't easy. I'm forever getting stuck on the edge of doors because you have to be lined up perfectly to get through them. I don't find the gameplay very compelling. I know what I'm supposed to do - work on your stats, get into a job that allows you to steal the components you need to escape and then do so - but I don't find it very engaging. In that I know I'm in the minority. That's ok. I'm just not good at it. The side quests are simple, the other prisoners seem to be fairly faceless, the routine dull and just the whole thing for me falls flat. I haven't even been able to escape the first prison and to tell you the truth it's not really worth my time trying. I should like it - I'm a fan of strategy - but I don't. Now again, that's just my experience. But I also know I'm not the only one. A friend of mine also bought this and felt the exact same way. In the meanwhile the reviews are very positive, so I know and accept that I'm in the minority. Yeah, if this sounds like the classic ""it's not you, it's me"" line, it pretty much is. I'd probably like the game much more if the controls were better, if the graphics are clearer and if the strategy was more robust. But it's not and I regret buying this one. If returns were allowed when I bought it, I would have done so. But they weren't and so it gets a thumbs down from me. YMMV.			"

 This is a review for version 1.0, I will be updating this as the devs update the game, respectively  Overview In The Escapists, you play an unfortunate prisoner, who ends up in prison for doing simple things like murdering your family or eating all the cake in the town. As a prisoner, you go about your daily prison routine to avoid drawing suspicion from the guards, all while plotting your escape. You start out in the most luxurious of prisons, gradually advancing to crummier and more difficult ones as you escape each one. There are many different ways of escaping, and the prison life is well simulated.  Overall Rating: 7/10 A seemingly simple prison escape game that offers a lot of gameplay for very little hard drive space. It's a nice casual/strategy game to play to get away from the other games Steam has to offer. Although, like many relatively new games, could use some improvements. Price:7/10 The original price of this game in Early Access was $9.99 USD, which is what I purchased it at. Since then, the price has steadily rose due to various game expansions and improvements the developers have implemented and has settled at a reasonable $19.99 USD. Even at $20, the developers are continuing to plan and add new features, making it well worth the price. Gameplay:9/10 As I've mentioned before, this game offers a surprising amount of gameplay for the little amount of hard drive space it requires. So, in the game you play as a prisoner who has to follow the daily prison routines (rollcall, eating meals, shower, exercise period, lights out, etc). While doing so, however, you must also plot your escape, utilizing various seemingly ordinary objects (duct tape, socks, files, etc) to make the tools in which you need to escape (pickaxes, weapons, shovels, etc). You can gain those items by looting your fellow prisoners' desks or simply purchasing them with money (yes, they give money to prisoners!) There are also many methods of escape, which range from accessing the air vents, tunneling your way out, pretending to be a prison guard, and organizing a prison riot. All these keep a player entertained while enjoying the pleasures of prison life. Length: 9/10 In Early Access, there were very little guides. I had to figure out all the crafting recipes myself, figure out all the methods of escape myself, and spent many hours just learning the game. Now, in addition to the new content that the devs have provided us for the full release, you can easily rack up over 20+ hours just trying to escape all 6 prisons. That's not all, you can spend even more time trying to get the achievements, if that's what you do. Story: 4/10 In short, the stories and text in this game are mediocre. The reason I have it as 4/10 as supposed to a 1/10 is because of the witty banter. When you see a prisoner or guard or warden or staff, you often will see them saying a humorous line or two. Things like ""I should drop you right here"" or ""My baton does the talking"" or ""Address me as your king"" or even ""Taking your wife out to dinner"". I would suggest that each prisoner and guard have their own personal diary, and depending on the person and prison, they would each have their own backstory. I also suggest that you can have actual conversatiosn with other people instead of just clicking on them and having them respond. Maybe certain things you say would affect your reputation with them.  Graphics: 8/10 Nice, simple graphics and animations for a nice, relatively-simple game. I suggest that the devs should implement more detail, though. If a guard is unconscious because you whacked him with a baton, a little blood on him wouldn't hurt. Little things like that will make this game better. Music/Sound: 6/10 A lot of the sound in simple, and that complements the game well. More detailed sounds would be nice. Example: Steve pours molten chocolate on Officer Whitney. I would like to hear sizzling sound, or a scream, anything that shows that the chocolate is hot or the officer is in pain. As for the music, repetitive. I like how you have different types of music for different times of day. There's eating music, workout music, shower music, and night music. However, that gets repetitive, especially if you have to repeat the same daily routine over, and over, and over again. Have at least 3 tracks for each time of day. Also, having music unique to a specific prison would be nice.  Performance: 10/10 Performs smoothly, as expected for such a low performance-demanding game. Have found very little bugs in my time playing, which have all been minor, such as not being able to flood other prisoners' toilets, only mine. Objectives: 7/10 The main objective is good (escaping), is good for the most part. The devs are planning on adding more ways of escaping and I hope that they'll balance the methods out. For example, in the easiest prison, there are several ways of escaping, but it's not balanced at all. Method one: you just need a cutting tool and an easily crafted bed dummy to escape (which can be achieved on day one) Method two: You need to dig a tunnel until it extends past the fences (which can take many days!) See what I mean? Now, for the side-quests. In this game you can do tasks for your fellow prisoners in order to earn money. These tasks range from giving them a specific item to beating up a certain person. I'd like to be able to get another prisoner to do a task for me instead of slaving, for once. I'd also like to be able to trade items with them and sell items. It would make the system a lot more realistic and fair. World: 8/10 The prisons are unique in themselves, their layouts being different to provide a challenge to escapists. I like how you can explore between the walls of the prison and find loot. I don't like how you can just walk out of certain prisons and find no more landscape to challenge you or to explore. For example, Stlag Flucht, the second easiest prison in the game. You can simply walk out when you escape and find no more challenge. Where's the frozen tundra, or the frigid forest? That kind of detail in the world design would make it better. Characters: 6/10 I'd like to be able to customize my inmate's looks and read their backstories and interact with them like an actual person. Give them a personality in conversations; don't have every prisoners say the same thing. Make each character unique; give them a dominant hand, give them a family that visits them, give them a gang that wants to rescure them from prison, give them body types. Example: Bob may be slightly overweight, but he can take a lot of guard tower shots. Bill may be slightly underweight, but boy can he run! Also, a very simple skill tree could enhance the game a lot. Example: a point in Sprinter would allow your character to boost his speed for a short period of time. Even your fellow inmates and guards could have skill trees to balance out the game. Item Variety: 7/10 This game has a decent variety of items, some people may disagree and say this game has a lot, but I'd say decent. There are sock maces (they exist!), powered screwdrivers, fake fences, plastic key molds, flashlights, dirt, deluxe toilet rolls and so much more. The weapons I think could use some balancing. Make each weapon have its own benefits. For example: A Super Sock Mace would have a range advantage over the Hammer, which has more damage. AI: 5/10 The AI is basic, needs many improvements in my opinion. Prisoners just walk around the entire period during free time. They don't try to exercise to gain strength or speed, or read books to gain intellect. Their stats should also degrade as well, which would give them some incentive to do so. Also, have them planning their escapes, too. I would like to see other inmates escape with me. "

								This game is a fun game though it does get quite repetitive. From what I've  played it seems like the basis of advancing to a higher tier in game in which you are well situated and familiar with the prison is crafting which requires you to find crafting plans, guess, or look it up on a wiki (which makes the game reliant on external sources other than itself for its gameplay hence not self-sustaining). The ""favors"" or quests that you complete for other inmates are repetitive too as there are only two different types: A, beat someone up; or B, retrieve an item. However, there is a fun puzzle aspect to the game in figuring out how to sneak resources out from one of the three jobs you can pick as well as how to use these materials to access new areas and bypass locked doors. That being said, the worst thing in this game I would say is the leveling up system where you are literally performing menial button pressing over and over and over in order to level up and leveling up is essential as many jobs and crafting require you to have a minum level in the intellect area and you stand no chance in any type of combat (needed for the inmate quests) unless you have a high strength skill. It would be ok if you could achieve max level once and be done with it but it diminishes over time, not slowly either, so a signifigant portion of the gameplay is simply pressing q and e very fast or clicking and waiting. Being that this is an alpha build im sure these issues will be addressed, but untill then it is a decent game with some great roleplay features associated with a prison and some terrible features associated with a prison.Overall Rating - 6.75/10			"

								This game is super addictive and fun! its only alpha and there are still so many things to do and the game is not that easy.And last thing I want to say is you can play again and again to escape from different ways like digging, stealing the keys and an outfit, from the elevating system etc...

												At first I was really excited about this game, as the ways to escape are varied and interesting. However, the various items you need all come from an extremely repetitive source. Every in game day you have to check them and maybe you'll get something useful. In addition to that, your characters stats continually decay without 'exercise' which is a mindless button mashing game that must be done very frequently. So the puzzles presented by each prison are interesting, but the main obstacle to solving them is the amount of repetitive drudgery between you and the solution.			"

								Day 8____My mission to hoard as many spoons as possible has been failing quickly, my cell is only 7 blocks from the exit and after 3 i hit and rock and when i tried to go around the game said i needed to put support beams down.I've obtained the craft note for support beams, now to sabotage the woodshop guy's job >:)I still cant beat this guy to woodshop, i think i'm gonna have to get this guy tomarrow.Day 9 ____Today the warden called me and my roommate for inspection, i ran back and had to take all my contraband with me.After inspection I put the stuff back and went to the work station to wait for the woodshop guy. To be continued......Guys this game is one of the best i've played on early access in a long time, I can find myself playing this game for a long time to come.I think the ""Easy"" Prison and the ""Very Easy"" prison should be switched because I escaped ""Easy"" but still cant escape ""Very Easy"" If anyone is doesn't want to buy this game, you are making a mistake, this game is harder then it looks and I can assure you it will provide gameplay for hours,  I know it says i've only played 2.9 hours, but i've been playing at a friends house for like 5 hours in total now and i LOVE this game so much :DI really suggest anyone who is wanting it but still not sure to just go for it and buy this game!  :D			"

The only reason why I marked it only as a 9 instead of a 10 was because there are not many guides to help new players. I know it isn't fair to do that because the game is new but I struggled at first. Besides that I would have given the game a perfect 10/10! Happy escaping!			"

								Okay...I LOVE this game!  The 18+ hours showing on my review has been accrued in roughly a day and a half, despite my hectic schedule, my family's schedules and the additional game hindering chaos three kids provide. Despite my varied, somewhat conflicting, game library on Steam (which I share with my family, teen daughter included and yes, those are the anime VN novels in my library) I am generally a Fantasy/Sci-Fi RPG and FPS/RPG gamer (truthfully, it's story and a heavy immersion factor that I look for in a game) and yet I have become absolutely addicted to this fantastic little strategy game!  It reminds me of the simple fun games used to be.  Having been a gamer since the days of Amiga, Atari and Nintendo, it has become a rare thing, in recent years, for me to stumble upon a game that can hold my interest past the two hour mark...and this one certainly has.  I am now obsessed with figuring out all of the illegal contraband I can assemble from toothbrushes, wires, toliet paper, duct tape, super glue, etc., and am extremely, mischievously pleased when I can successfully beat a fellow inmate, for a favor or for an item I want, or when I beat a guard, take his key, imprint it into my putty, place it back on his person and get back to my exercise routine, no one the wiser but myself and my unfortunate victim...not to mention the ever-present goal behind all of my subterfuge and mayhem; escape! I still cannot believe this was only an 18mg download  o.O  ...and it's far more entertaining than innumerable games that take up far more voluminous amounts of space on my hard drive than 18mgs!As this game is in its early access stage of development, I fervently hope that the devs only add and never detract a thing from this game. People may complain about the pixelated graphics, but in my opinion, it keeps the tone clear; this is just a fun, clever game...not American Me or Shawshank Redemption, (however, there are some references to famous jail break movies within the game. ;-)Remember the hour, day and week consuming fun of Earthbound or the original Final Fantasy & Super Mario Brothers, which always left you feeling frustrated, entertained and happy all at once?  Simple concept, tough to accomplish...so much to discover and do as you fight your way to the ultimate end goal of beating the game...The Escapists is so very much like those good old games of yesteryear.Do yourself a favor...Give this wonderfully entertaining and amusing game a try!  It's not flashy or on the cutting edge of gaming tech, but it is enormously fun, frivolous and entertaining...something video games once were and rarely are these days.			"

								Literally one of the best games I've ever played.You're in a prison and you have to escape, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it is  wayyyy  harder than you think. You gotta be elaborate, intelligent, and clever to escape, so you're probably not gonna escape at first. But that's what makes it so addicting. You always try to find new stuff and initiate your plan, and as soon as you start...A guard or nighttower knocks you out. You're wake up with nothing you had equipped besides the stuff in your cell desk. You rage yet start again, finding out a new plan to escape or just go on with prison life.That's what makes this game so enjoyable. There are so many different ways you can escape that once you find one, you stik to it until you fail and make another fail. It's like one big cycle that's broken once you escape. But the repeatedness isn't annoying.The music is also great too, it sets a nice ambience for each activity in the prison, and kinda funny when you're trying to beat up a guard or something and the same music just goes on.Overall,  amazing  game (considering it's still early access) by Mouldy Toof Studios, and I'd really recommend getting it. It's worth the 15 dollars.10/10			"

Just imagine how awesome it would be playing with friends, team up, make tactics and escaping the prison.

												This is the most amazing prison simulator game I have ever played!As most players you would do tutorial then center perks and as you progress threw the tougher prisons you begin to feel something..... you are the best damn escapist that ever lived, escaping high security, custom made prisons, DLC prisons with awesome textures and new characters and just overall one of my all time favourite games. I extremely recommend this game. it's worth the 20$. And now a free DLC for santa's sweatshop is just amazing, way to keep in the christmas spirit.			"

								The prisons are all fun and different, the characters have some of the funniest dialogue I've seen in a video game. You play the game at your own pace, do what you want, when you want. The crafting system is great and simple, the favor system gives you things to do when your bored, or to make some extra cash. Jobs are also a thing, you can be a mailman, a janitor, and much more! You will earn a lot of enemies in prison, but maybe some friends along the way as well!The only things that are cons for me are as followed:- It will sometimes take forever to get what you need, the things people sell are most of the time just useless for what you need.- When trying to escape, if the guards find you, you are automatically caught and put in confinement without a chance to fight back, I feel that you should atleast be able to put up a fight!- The jobs ""Janitor"" and ""Gardener"" are all based off of luck, if not enough spills/weeds are around the prison, you lose your job, and sometimes it is literally impossible to complete said jobs.- I dislike that you can find the same ""Crafting Note"" over and over again, making most ""Crafting Note"" purchases worthless.- Some people dislike the workout system, of having to rapidly press ""Q and E"" to workout. Personally, I have no problem with it, but to some it's annoying.My review of ""The Escapists:"" 10/10			"

								This is a brilliant, cute, light-hearted game all about escaping prison. It uses the classic 8-bit graphics combined with a top-down view and fantastic gameplay features of today. Believe me, you really should get this game. It's definitely kid-friendly, meaning that there isn't any foul language and the fighting that exists in the game is cartoony. Don't worry, though! It is still ridiculously fun (and funny) to play, and many adults play it.I'd suggest getting it as soon as you can. It's definitely worth the money.//Ron			"

												So simple yet so much fun. Great concept, challenging gameplay and amusing dialogue from the guards and other inmates. You are dropped into the prison routine without much direction on how to escape. Read books, work out, build relationships, learn the map/routine and MacGuyver yourself some tools and weapons. There are different strategies and play styles for you to discover as you go along. The prisons are increasingly difficult and there are community-made maps and a map editor when they get boring. This game is definitely worth the price, even when it's not on sale (but it's a STEAL when it is... get it? eh?)			"

								This game has exceeded my expectations greatly. The ""Do it yourself"" approach to escaping is brilliant. When you're thrown into prison with nothing but a few tutorials to keep you alive, escaping is entirely your job. The game won't step in and say, ""You can use these materials to make a shovel."" or ""No guards patrol around here, so you can dig a hole in the ground to escape."" It's all you. You make the plan. You watch for weaknesses in the system. You create your own tale and escape in your own way.Across two different maps, with more to be added, and with a large prison, bustling with security flaws, angry prisoners and guards, and many different tools and methods to help you escape, the Escapists will provide hours of fun, as you try various escape plans, and discover through trial and error which plans will work or not, and ultimately, will contribute to the whole ""Do it yourself"" approach.Run on sentence much?

												CONS- graphics feels like $2 game;- sound feels like $2 game;- slightly annoying degrading skills, needs regular repetitive top up (but game might be too easy otherwise);- consequences of being caught not harsh enough, they just take away yr contraband;- not random gen only 9 fixed prison layouts so far, once u've worked out a prison it's quite easy but a prison editor is in the works; - leaderboard has ppl breaking out in 1 day on the easier lvls;PROS+ wickedly fun gameplay;+ great escape from prison atmos;+ good chilling music, i rarely leave game music on;+ numerous ways to escape not just one route;Don't be fooled by graphics, the devs done a great job on the gameplay. I'm totally immersed in the prison break atmos. Started digging a tunnel to freedom while everyone's working mwahahaha...balls! Guards are coming to check my room! Everything in my room is contraband!?!?!? It wasn't me!! Noooo don't put me in solitaryyyyy. If only triple AAA games put some of this effort into games.Some of the leveling up minigames are a little repetitive as they degrade over time, but the game would probably be too easy otherwise. It is an indie game so it does feel a little light in some areas, there's not a great deal of items but they are rare to come around, some of the logic is very dodgy eg, u can beat up a guard and take his gear but there isn't any harsh consequences. But it's great fun to hatch out an escape plan and literally chipping away, making sure yr timing is executed perfectly.At current price I'd probably won't recommend if not for the devs adding a prison editor (not sure if free update or dlc). The prisons feel varied enough but once u've worked one out, replayability is left upto u to escape differently.			"

								Pros-You can be sneaky by diging a hole on another inmates cell.-Do jibs to get cash to buy combes to make a shive.-Get people on you good side so you can start riots.Cons-You play as one,so you can't go around with you gun hanging out, and beating up other cons.BUY IT			"

												Really, its more like Prisoner Simuator 2015, the Junior Novelization ^^And honestly, its really fun xD obviously the objective of the game is to escape, but there's a lot of RNG going on, the randomness means that any given escape attempt from the various prisons can take anywhere from a couple in-game days, to a month of planning.  Crafting is a huge cornerstone of the game (which I imagine is fairly realistic), from using a comb or toothbrush as a shiv, to using bleach to color a prisoner outfit to look like a staff uniform.  You can craft a dummy to place in your bed at nights while you dig a tunnel, there's a makeshift sailboat that has to be constructed for one map, there are fake vent covers, plastic key-copies, etc etc and you more or less have to discover what your options are by experimentation, there is an item that gives you a random recipe but you couldn't really depend on that alone. Mercifully, the game pauses while you're on the crafting screen.Largely because of the randomness, it can be difficult; for example twice each day at morning and night, the guards pick two random prisoners and search their cells for contraband; if you haven't made yourself a convenient hiding place for your stash - and properly hidden THAT, ie crafting a fake vent cover or girly poster to put over the enormous hole in the floor/wall you've dug with the tools you've also crafted - if they find contraband at any point they confiscate it, which can put you back several steps in your escape plan, as collecting all the materials you need can take so long, and require varying amounts of risk. I wish you could bribe guards with your money, or otherwise gain their favor, so far I haven't found any means of gaining favor over guards or at least getting them to look the other way (though its still a possibility, the game does very little hand-holding).If you've ever wanted to recreate the ending of Shawshank Redemption, this will do the trick for you; just without the dark tone, nobody dies in this game (only knocked out) and the only hint of sexual abuse is an achievement for dropping your soap in the shower xD that's the level of humor you can expect, though its largely G-rated. I don't think I've even seen ""bad words"" in the game, but it doesn't need them either unless you're wanting some HBO-level♥♥♥♥♥♥If you're interested in it, I recommend it :) Also, prison editor with Steam Workshop for user-made prisons, I didn't even realize at first, that's awesome!! There are 6 (8?) non-DLC prisons included and each is fundamentally different, so that's really good.  Also apparently Alcatraz is offered as DLC, if I ever get over my boycott I may buy that <.<			"

								Great game! No problems with it but if they could add the ability to co-operate an escape plan with other prisoners... like, for example, you tell a prisoner to start a riot and have 3 others attempt to take out the guards while you get the keys to escape that would be kinda cool. also having all of the other prisoners benefit form working out would make for a more interesting game. :-)			"

								Early access review, review is about the game at 2014-9-5A very interesting concept with very interesting gameplay behind it. It has a lot of interesting methods to play and interactions. I've found it to be very good already, but it can use some more explanation on the interface. At the moment, it does not explain enough about how to perform actions when you have the tools to do them, so you'll mostly have to experiment. Even then, you'll be able to work out how things go easily enough.Even when you figured it out, it's not easy to break out of prison!Definitely worth getting already, with a lot of potential for later builds			"

												the Escapists is hard later on but still fun. I guess it is like a RPG (role playing game), you have to grind all the time in the hardest prison which is bad but the game makes up for it by making you happy about escaping or finding the rare item that you need to craft something to help you escape which might make or brake the game for you. But you can't say its not a great feeling when you overcome something difficult. The art style is good for pixels, the top down point of view or POV is ok but not great. NPCs are cool with a like you meter as i call it it is a meter that tells you how much an NPC likes you and that will affect many things to how much discount you are given to if they will fight for you or look the other way if you beat someone up. If you do that the bar will go down a little bit they also make many references to a variety of movies, games, books and TV shows. Combat could use a better system because it is hit space and then left click once and you sit and wait it does not need to be a click click click to fight just like a power attack or quick attack would be fine and the layout of all prisons are great hugely different and detailed. this game gets a 9.0 maybe 9.4 for new update with building prisons but not many great ones yet hopefully in the future there is. Thanks for reading and i recommend this game. I guess i have zero punctuation ha ha ha			"

 The following is a review of the  Early Access  game. This is a game that got my attention during the Early Access phase after I had watched a few videos (one being OfficialNerdCubed (AKA Dan Hardcastle)'s video on The Escapists. This lead me onto watching a few of Paulsoaresjr's videos of the Escapists. This game looked great and the reviews I saw and heard made it sound better. This caused me to pick it up on the store, which I do not regret.Those who do not know what this game is can watch videos and look at the store page. I'd rather not type it here since you can clearly see what it is about on the store page of this game, which isn't hard to navigate to at all.The graphics are pixel-based. No anti-aliasing (It would just look like sharp edges if it did have that), and no 512x or whatever textures you have now. This game is 16-bit, surprisingly, despite it looking 8-bit.This game does not follow a linear path. We know this because you can freely choose how to escape, and how you will get the required equipment to escape. I won't say a way of escaping, since I don't want to spoil anything (and don't say that I can use spoilers for that, everyone has an urge to read them even more when they have a black bar covering them).It's Early Access. It's a rare occurence for me to buy an Early Access game, as I have had coincedents in the past with Early Access games (like with The Stomping Land). This game is actually frequently updated. I see new hotfixes appearing very frequently, and updates none-too-far-apart. Although this game only got nigh-over £7,000 on Kickstarter, this game is one of the most frequently updated in my library, if not the most. This shows a high level of appreciation that the developers have for their own game, since they continue to constantly update their game frequently despite it having an incredibly low budget (I personally only see Kickstarter funds as motivation to continue making the game, and not as a budget, though) (£7,000 is not much when it comes to games).Finally, it was published by Team 17. So, it's not an indie game by definition, but in our hearts it is. If you didn't know (in which case, shame on you), Team 17 were the developers for games in the Worms series. That's what they are known for, you can't deny that. If a developer like Team 17 who made one of the most iconic game series known to man published a small game like this, they must have a whole lot of trust in this. And most likely for a good reason, too.			"

								Quite the interesting game, attempting to escape from prison. The gameplay is very interesting having you switch between ""agressive"" and ""passive"" mode for combat by hitting ""Q"", and taking up random favors for your fellow inmates ranging from finding a Paper Clip to beating the tar out of a guard to get his Uniform for the cosplaying Inmate. There aren't many possibilities for escape besides the typical tunnel out or sneak out. The game at this time is still in EA so bugs are expected but they aren't terribly game-breaking. Just remember... Never drop your soap in the Shower...			"

								Never has a game captivated me so much as this game. It is a very exiting game. You have to escape from a prison. I amgonna play this game again soon. Also, the publisher is a good publisher, because they make good titles. You shouldgive this game a try. Why would I say this? Well, this game has some great gameplay, since it is all about strategising.you should really buy this game. Team17 would extremely enjoy it if you were to buy this. You should put this gameup on your Christmas list, if you do not have the money to buy this game. If you write this game down, your friends willnever think of you the same again. You will be the envy of your friends if you buy this game, because it is fun. Are yougonna get this game now since I wrote this good review? You really should buy this one of a kind game. You shouldlet yourself buy this art. It is the ultimate prison simulation ever made, and you will be proud to know you got this.You will help support the developers by buying this game. Isn't that great? Now remember, write this exciting gamedown on your wishlist, please!			"

												The guards are basically precogs from Minority Report because they can detect you doing things like climbing out of a vent that they don't have line of sight to instantly and teleport you into a solitary confinement cell while undoing all the progress you've made towards escaping.Oh and have fun waiting days on end for someone to be selling that last crafting item you need (probably duct tape), literally doing chores until that happens, and when you do finally manage to get the item have fun not actually being able to craft what you wanted to because your stats decay stupid fast unless you do even more chores to keep them up.Could be fun, but far too much tedium and far too many ""oh come on!"" moments keep it from that. Also the price tag is pretty high for what you get- the core gameplay loop is walking to certain places at certain times, occasionally doing a minigame that's either clicking on different objects repeatedly or pressing ""Q and E rapidly, then doing it all over again the next day.

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. A puzzle game about breaking out of jail? You bet! But it's a frustrating mess. If you want to play without cheating you'll spend 15-20 minutes getting all the pieces in place for your genius escape plan only to discover that NO, THE GAME DOESN'T WANT YOU TO DO THAT.This would be fine except it's quasi-rogeulike and you will spend an enormous amount of gameplay marking time until you have the opportunity to try out your idea. At this point either bad luck or horrible, illogical puzzle design will prevent you from doing so and you'll have to decide if you want to spend 20 minutes trying again or, like I did, just quit. There's no room for ingenuity, it's just trial and error. To give one example: carrying a guard's uniform through a metal detector sets it off (seriously, so does a piece of rope). Wearing that same uniform doesn't. This sort of fuzzy logic is fine if the rules are spelled out (it's a contrband detector rather than a metal detector - but you're never told that!). I assumed wearing a guard's uniform would set the alarm off, so never tried it - I only found out through a walkthrough. Oh and that guard's uniform that's invisible to the detector? The tower guards will straight up murder you if they see you wearing it -unless you wear it at night of course. Once you realise this is the level the game operates on you're essentially doing things at random to see what works. This does not make for an enjoyable gaming experience in my opinion. A promising game, poorly executed.			"

												Let me just say first of that I absolutely loved the first few hours of this game, the soundtrack, the art direction, the concept, everything amazing. It takes a lot for a game to make me hate it after completely loving the first few hours. The Escapists managed that.Luck in this game is managable, you find items of varrying usefulness in inmates desks and may end up with some pretty poor luck with running in to guards, that's all fine.Where the game really starts to lack is around the fourth or fifth stage. The luck aspect becomes almost comically bad at that point, where some escapes can be made LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE depending on where the guards are in their patrols each night, where some guards decide to stand and not move for ages and many other factors.Also invisible land mines that the player cannot see at all and can be in varrying locations...even going so far as killing you when you no longer have control of the player. Great game design. Really.Like I said, it takes a lot for a game to make me absolutely hate it after loving it for so long. The Escapists does that. Do not buy.			"

								I have always loved the idea of escaping a prison and when I saw this game I knew I would love it. I've played 9 hours on one map and loved every minute. It's super addicting and very interesting. I have a couple of suggestions such as adding complex escapes with other inmates and bribing or making a deal with an officer to keep him quiet. I have a couple map suggestions such as Alcatraz or maybe a Area 51 themed prison with alien inmates sorry I'm a bit of a sci-fi fan. I like the weapons system but would love to have some effect debuffs such as on fire or bleeding or even a type of steroid or something to make you stronger and faster. I love the game in the state that it is in and can't wait for new maps and items in the next update.			"

								A game with a lot of potential. The game is open for you to explore any means to escape prison... Or you can just spend your time beating up officers or other prisoners for money (or for fun). The design is simplistic and cute, the music is awesome. More features are needed and promised. Can´t wait for the full version to come out <3.			"

								In its current state it is kind of confusing to get started. I didnt know how to complete trade with other prisoners at first and some iteams they asked for where very hard to find and some sounded as if they needed to be crafted. Also i cant figure out  how to obtain stollen iteams from other prisoners ether. I wish there was some kind of tutorial because not manny things are straight forward. I search the game online and there is no tutoreals out there as of yet. I might make one if i accually learn how to play. "

								Its an awesome game, the graphical style is so fitting for the way this game is played. Its one of a kind in my mind, the opposite of Prison Architecht. Plays at a good pace to keep you interested and isnt all over the place. You can do so many different things and then you realize your in such a small prison yet it feels so vast. I reccomend picking this game up ASAP, dont wait for a sale....just get it...because really when was the last time you saw team17 doing anything other than worms?Ive been incarcerated for 37 days as old timer, made 3 escape attempts and all of them stopped by random shakedowns /  searches.....need more money so I can hide my stuff better! maybe a fake vent? poster over a wall hole? we will see after I loot everyones cells for goodies tonight..... but right now I have to go beat down Craig with my soap in a sock while hes still in the locker room.

								First hand impression of game: It's nice and doesn't seem to big, a game i think i will complete in no time1 Hour in:Ok so this is getting a bit harder than i anticipated, got the metal job after getting a 70+ int inmate. I have been to the shu 3 times already, apparently digging holes in the toilet area doesn't fly with the decan.2 Hours in:I got marcus bleeding, covered up his cell and snuck in via the vents during night time. Shanked him and stole all of his meds, he had 3 of them and duct tape! Hah teach him to give me a discount. Luckily i was quick enough too jump back into the vent before guards came.3 Hours in:Ok i think i know how to get out i just need more files and a better shovel, but Officer Wyatt is unto me. I need to get that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ down, luckily i am almost 100 in strength. I got a super sock mace that will knock him out cold in no time, i got a nice supply of metal sheets from the job, still going strong - got a good rep with Brad so i get cheap stuff from him. Can't believe he wastes all his lighters like that.4 Hours in: There's been comments on missing spoons from the cantine, searched Edgars stash and found 3 spoons. He didn't even offer me a spot in his escape, like what the heck man i gave him free chocolate. I'm going to stab that guy back to the medieval age.4.7 Hours in: I have all the materials i need now, just need for it to be night. Jones tried bashing me in metalshop, used the baton i got from wyatt earlier to smash his head in. Took his outfit, that will teach him proper manners. Anywho he's not going to be a problem now.5 Hours in:I escaped, i was a bit on edge when digging under the wall. Was a bit scared of getting spottet while digging, because those guys keep filling up my holes and restoring the vents whenever they catch me doing my business.Overall a pretty good game for few money, i used the same amount of time on completing this game as i have with 40€ Games, and i am actually satisfied with my accomplishment. The game is nicely wooven together, 10/10 for an Early access game can't wait to see development.			"

 The Escapists After 28 hours of this game, I still haven't came anywhere NEAR escaping the prison.Countless hours of gathering contraband items, and coming very close to escaping, all of that coming down to an early room search or accidentally going past a metal detector. Graphics 8/10 The graphics aren't advanced in any way, but they are simple and it looks quite good the pixely way it is, giving it a nice feel. Gameplay 10/10It is, strangely enough, a very addictive game.You can spend countless hours playing this game, and it doesn't really get boring, with the new updates nearly every week.OverallOverall, The Escapists is a very well recommendable game. It is fun, simple to get the gist of, and most of all, not all that expensive! I very well recommend this game.9/10			"

								This game may not be for everyone, but as someone who typically only likes a specific type of game I am definitely enjoying this. This is a hard game, if you aren't willing to spend a lot of time constantly scrwing up and having to change your approach to finally figure out your escape plan, then this game is not for you. If you are willing to do that, then get this game. Even has a great soundtrack (especially considering its a game about being in prison). For only 15 dollars this game is quite a steal.			"

Pros :Great game, good basic maps and a lot things to do, many ways to escape, good music, can be very challenging,immersive gameplaygood pixels graphics but...Cons :... I wanted an option to upgrade these pixel graphic like the escapists Walking Dead, it would be awesome (yes I know, it's another game engine but why console get better graphic than pc ? ) And it's my only huge regret after playing the walking dead escapists, I was expecting similar graphics..Not much prisons so more good prison maps made by the devs (because community creations are all buggy xD) 9/10 :) "

								If you take the aesthetic of Game Dev and mix it with the whole concept of Prison Break then you you get The Escapists! An awesome little game, from the creators of Worms, will keep you entetained for HOURS. It's the attention to detail you'll like; you have a daily routine which the guards amke sure you stick to, you can get a prison job and make cash, or you can help other prisoners and gain monetary gain that way. Also there is a prison black market where you can buy anything from chocolate to files.All of these help towards your ultimate goal of ESCAPE! And what route will you take? Vetilation? Digging? Pure determinationa and SKILL?! The main point I would like to convey is that this game is simply a must buy for fans of indie gaming, or gaming in general as it delivers immensly-especially seeing as it is an Alpha.Lastly when you start a new game, grab a spoon from the canteen and make sure you can dig a whole, as this is a bug that has been identified within the game.

												This game is so good.Many prisons with different levels like easy ,hard, vrey hard..This game has many crafting recipes that you will need for your escaping attempt. In game are many posibilities to esccape and you just need to be creative, and the NPCs (prisoners and cops ) makes the game more happy with them texts and more challenging with prisoner's missions. Another good feature is that you can create your own crew in the prison if you complete missions from NPCs or if you give them some stuff, if you do this you will earn them confidence and you will be able to create a crew that can help you in beating cops.In Conclusion this game is so good for 15euro price and i hope the multiplayer will appear soon but good.Develpoers pelase take how much time you need to make the multiplayer good.

												This is a really fun game. Despite its low-rez graphics and simple animations, the Escapists is a fairly in-depth, interesting and complicated game which provokes strategical thinking from the player and requires you to plan your actions carefully. This game is worth playing for the feeling you get when you escape a prison!I've only beaten the first prison, but so far it is 100% worth the discounted price I payed for it, and I'm sure It's worth the full price too.Pros:-Fun-Interesting-Time-consuming-Cute graphics-It feels BLOODY AMAZING when you escape a prison!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons:-If you screw up it's a bit hard to get back up to were you were-Time-consuming-Wierd controls-Inconvinient save systemOverall I give this a thumbs-up, although it's probably, as with most products of this price range, worth waiting for it to go on sale.11/13 shiny and chrome razors			"

								In its current state it is kind of confusing to get started. I didnt know how to complete trade with other prisoners at first and some iteams they asked for where very hard to find and some sounded as if they needed to be crafted. Also i cant figure out  how to obtain stollen iteams from other prisoners ether. I wish there was some kind of tutorial because not manny things are straight forward. I search the game online and there is no tutoreals out there as of yet. I might make one if i accually learn how to play. "

								Its an awesome game, the graphical style is so fitting for the way this game is played. Its one of a kind in my mind, the opposite of Prison Architecht. Plays at a good pace to keep you interested and isnt all over the place. You can do so many different things and then you realize your in such a small prison yet it feels so vast. I reccomend picking this game up ASAP, dont wait for a sale....just get it...because really when was the last time you saw team17 doing anything other than worms?Ive been incarcerated for 37 days as old timer, made 3 escape attempts and all of them stopped by random shakedowns /  searches.....need more money so I can hide my stuff better! maybe a fake vent? poster over a wall hole? we will see after I loot everyones cells for goodies tonight..... but right now I have to go beat down Craig with my soap in a sock while hes still in the locker room.

												The Escapists is an amazing game, with a fun style, great music, and loads of features.Pros:- Easy to understand how to play.- 6 base maps, and then two extra ones outside of those.- Map editor where you can create your own prison.- Awesome background music.- Challenging, yet feels great to escape.Cons:- Needs more duct tape.- Needs more duct tape.- Most importantly, NEEDS MORE DUCT TAPE!(Also, key remap should be available after you enter a prison)			"

												The Escapists has a style of simplicity and the mechanics of complexity for an overall nostalgic feel. It brings the gamer back in time to a style of gaming that many has come to enjoy in their early childhood. This game also brings us to the world of prisons that not many games have touched. Live your fantasy in a prison and execute a plan from a wide array of items that you can utilize. There is so much to do; make friends and enemies as you try to escape your way through these prisons.			"

Train your skills to ridiculous levels and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone you see, causing a prison lockdown (if done extensively enough, the warden surrenders and lets you out)4. Eat food off the floor5. Give food from the floor to other prisoners to make them like you6. Get shot by guard towers7. Get a job8. Lose your job as a janitor because you couldn't find any ♥♥♥♥ing messes to clean up9. Use a pillow as a weapon10. Use a hot cup of chocolate as a weapon (which actually one hit KOs guards btw)11.

								I found myself utterly enthralled with The Escapists. Unlike other games, which don't trust you to go to the bathroom unless they've told you to, The Escapists basically says, ""Alright look, you're in prison. Now get out of prison. Good luck!"" It shows a maturity of design to basically let the player loose in to a playground instead of stepping them through the process, piece by piece.The Escapists isn't a game for people who need to win on the first go. It's one of those games that you have to be alright with suffering MANY setbacks before you finally succeed. When it isn't being buggy (which isn't all that often, the devs are doing pretty great with keeping up on bugs) you still have to watch for a single mistake, because one pile of dirt left on the ground when the guards pull the bedsheets off your cell, and it's back to square one. The biggest piece of advice I can give on this game is to LEARN. When you mess up, start looking around for what changed. Figure out WHY you messed up, and how you can avoid that. And ALWAYS BE CRAFTING. Experiment with EVERYTHING, and figure out how to craft yourself some gear. Good: A truly open world sandbox title that does freedom of gameplay in a phenomenal way. The visual style is appealling and interesting, the music is fun, and the game is wholly and comepletely addictingBad: The combination of how hard the game cracks down on contraband, how little you know of crafting, and how few and far between hints are means it's going to take you a little while to figure out crafts, and believe you me, you aren't getting ANYWHERE without crafting. A slightly more accessible crafting interface would not have gone amiss.Ugly: Steps that still need to be taken: I would love to see a little more play with your relationship with other prisoners. I wish anyone who came to hate you would start plotting against you, or gather their own posse to rival yours. While I'm out just after lights out to beat up inmates, None of the others are. Also, I'd love to see dead drops implemented, where prisoners can stash things for each other. And yes, there are ""stashes"" hidden in the walls, but I mean for more common things like leaving a shiv under a table for a quest for a fellow inmate. It could add variety to questing.Over all, if you can put a little time in to it, BUY THIS GAME. You will not regret it.			"

								This game is ADDICTING. Such a fun little game and it's really different from anything I've ever played. The music is awesome, the gameplay itself is very fun and it makes you think without being overly complicated. The crafting system is cool and I keep learning more stuff about it the longer I play. Great as a time-waster while at work (if you can play games without getting caught) or to just play for hours on end because it's fun. You'll love this game if you enjoy crafting games, puzzle games, games with good music, simple (yet surprisingly difficult) concepts in games, and a host of other reasons. This game is still in development so be warey of that as it could change, but as it is right now it's completely worth the price and you'll be sure to dump some serious hours into playing it.			"

								Let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of games with pixel-graphics, so I may have some bias.The Escapists is a game where you assume the role of a prisoner with the goal of escaping the prison. You can go into vents, dig tunnels, and a bunch of other things in an effort to make your way to freedom. You can gain attributes such as intelect and strength, in order to better your chances in doing certain things.I would recommend this game to pixel-graphic fans or prison break fans!			"

												The Escapist is an awesome sandbox prison game where you take the role of a prisoner that you can name and choose a look. The game provides a tutorial, three save files, six challenging prison maps to escape, four DLCs, a whole community of map makers and the tools to make your own map with the additional Escapists: Map Maker (comes along with the purchase of The Escapists)Start off with daily routine and earn cash by doing jobs for the prison or for fellow cellmates, steal from guards and cellmates, craft dozens of unique tools and weapons, break open vents, dig underground tunnels, make gangs; whatever required to escape the prison! I highly reccomend it for those who love strategic games and crafting games. I'd give it 4 Stars and a 9/10. There still are some glitches like the NPCs getting confused when you sit in a seat the bots target to sit in at lunch and some just annoying things like the player immediatly getting sent to solitary while trying to escape. (guards should just come out and find the player if they are to be caught.) Developers should fix this but those are small details that don't ruin the entire game. They have gotten annoying to me though. Anyways 4 Stars/ 9 out of 10!			"

THis was my first indie game in a while and it got me started to play old indie games and what not.  I cannot beat the second prison though ....  I love the concept of the game from a role plaing prspective.  Only a coujple more things they could do to make the game a lot better.  They can add multiplayer so its fun where all the players are prisoners.  Where there players are prisoners and guards(Could be a lot of trolling but what ever).  They could also make a gamemode where you are guard .  Other than those addition this is an overall fun game .  So if your board of whatever you man game is , I would check this out.			"

Not to mention you gotta be on your toes since all characters are fast.How do you get out? Do you dig thru the fence? dig a hole? steal a key and disguise to get out?But again this takes a while. Took me several hours just to get out of the first level on my first time and thats WITH guides!But thats why i love it <3			"

Not many games have me using google to learn how to play the game, this is one of them. I would recommend this game to anyone who's played Prison Architect or a fan of prison themed movies/games. Very difficult to escape the prisons. About 9 hours in my first prison and still haven't escaped. 8/10 is my score.  "

The trick to this game is patience, it took me over 60 days to pass the first level, it is also an enraging game. The rage part are the cops, they are always snooping around somewhere and somehow always figure out things you've done. This game is also good for those who like easy survival.

You can go into vents, dig tunnels, and a bunch of other things in an effort to make your way to freedom. You can gain attributes such as intelect and strength, in order to better your chances in doing certain things.I would recommend this game to pixel-graphic fans or prison break fans!			"

I also think that adding drinks to the game and then a hunger and thirst bar to it to make it more ""Realistic"".

								An amazing game with countless ways to escape from the prisons. The only thing that would make the game better for me would be a form of Coperative where you can either work together to escape or race to be the first person to escape from the prison. I am not sure if it is a bug but when i beat down a guard that guard will constantly chase me even after multiple beat downs untill i end up in the infirmary. This happens even when my heat is 0%. Taking into account all of this i rate the game 8.5/10 :)			"

												Great game! 1 of my favourites, and also not very expensive! Also, more dlc's, the better (unlike most games where dlc's are crap). You can also now build your own prisons, add prisoner stashes, security perimeters, sniper towers, electrified fence that will fry you, and even a mobile vehicle! But, it takes quite a while to build a prison, aproximatly 0,5h-2h, not to mention editor been confusing and buggy. Game also lacks multiplayer, but makes up for it with workshop support (up to a point).Long story short:Pros:- Great and fun game simulating prison escapes- Cheap and great DLC's (I recommend them all)- Prison editor and workshop! If you can't escape them, build them!Cons:- Prison editor is somewhat buggy and maybe complex a the beggining (NO coding)- No controller support (sadly)- No multiplayer, what really misses in this game9/10 people			"

												 Im sure you`ve seen many youtubers play this creative game. It really is quite unique and has its own style that can really be enjoyed! I bought this game a while back and really enjoyed it and if your on the verge of deciding you should definitly buy it you`ll be happy you did. I really enoy their retro style and should definitly should be praised for it. I can tell the developers spent many months perfecting and programming this game.			"

												A VERY GOOD GAMEYes this game is very good as a prison simulator in which the objective is to escape. Yes there is a few weird things in the game such as you cannot craft a sockmace until your intelligence is twenty and also your skills will deplete overtime strength I understand but not intellect. The game would be better with some added things like riots, gangs and one thing that is kinda disturbing but um... Shower rapes seriously make it happen and this will be a full fledged prison sim. Now what would I rate this game out of a ten, ten being the best game I've ever played in the genre and one being the worst in the genre I would give this game a... 8/10 a very good game I reccomend you get this game especially while it's on the discount right now.

								seriously, i love this game! simulators are cool to me but most of them are made to rage or are just plain normal. that's why i love goat simulator but most importantly, that's why i love this game! it's a pretty cool game and the guards are very realistic. i've never been in jail before but i'm pretty sure the guards act almost exactly like that. the game reminds me of the shawshank redemption (soz if spelt wrong, i don't know how to spell a couple of words) and it's pretty difficult to escape when the guards are breathing on you neck. the suspense is why i love stealth games. out of all the time i've played this game (not long) i haven't dicovered any bugs or reasons to hate this game! there are a couple of things missing but not enough to well and truly hate it. that's why i have a reccomendation list for what i think this game needs.multi player: the game's AI is really good. but imagine how much fun one would have playing with ones mates.workshop support: this game really needs the ability to make your own prisons.cops and robbers mode: if you ever decide to implement multiplayer, there should be the option to become a cop.i'll let you know if any more ideas come to me.keep up with the good work! i really don't want to see this game disscontinued.

								This game is ADDICTING. Such a fun little game and it's really different from anything I've ever played. The music is awesome, the gameplay itself is very fun and it makes you think without being overly complicated. The crafting system is cool and I keep learning more stuff about it the longer I play. Great as a time-waster while at work (if you can play games without getting caught) or to just play for hours on end because it's fun. You'll love this game if you enjoy crafting games, puzzle games, games with good music, simple (yet surprisingly difficult) concepts in games, and a host of other reasons. This game is still in development so be warey of that as it could change, but as it is right now it's completely worth the price and you'll be sure to dump some serious hours into playing it.			"

												Sit Down and listen to my story of my Escape from Centre Perks, The most relaxing Prision known to man (Unless you see the end of a baton).How I Was Caught: Life was so simple, I was an escape artest for a team of highly train, extreamly agile, over level 9000, Ninja Like CowMen, My Name was BillyGoat. I was caught after i murdered and buch on ManBearPies with a roll of Duct Tape and plastic knifes. My first day of prison life begins.Day 1: Woke up with guards ring the bell for rollcall, My Name was called ""Them Sheep"" I Said in anger, first day and my name is call, well it luckly all I had in my desk was a toothbush, toothpaste and I don't know what else.Food Time, I love the taste of over cooked bland chicken that tastes of sawdust and comes fresh from a can, ""Plastic Fork, These will be handy"" I grab a few and looked for a sutable wall (Don't ask, just know it works).The Shower room was empty and for some reason guards were every dumb. I kept chipping at the wall till it broke into another block of wall (This is impossable right).I put the wall block and thought of my escape even more ""I need knives... Plastic ones"", I rushed back to the canteen and grabed a few (It was lucky, all I need four for my daring escape).Next step, Make a bed dummy... mmm two pillows and a blaket, that will work, the guards here have a memory of a goldfish and a attention span of another goldfish after finding out he was born.OK... put that one bed, make a rope. All I need for that is two bed sheets Nice.The cover of night fall.... Im Batman... Wait no, Correction.... The night rollcall of the annoying blasted bells rang of couse I get... no wait false alarm, I missed the shakedown, sod it its time to do the escape.I rushed to were the wall was broken.Up some random ladders,Used Rope to get to ground,and.....Day 2: Used the knives on the fence till it gave away.Then I walked out like some kina boss man, acting badass after a meeting about cakes,I turned around and saw the guards making tea, I casually walked in,Stole there donuts,and walked back out (Well I needed food for the walk I guess)End10/10 Would be put back into confiment agian...Wait a sec!!

												The Escapists is a simple game with a lot of charm. The first point of business it has a wide range of tools and a new artistic design on graphics the graphics have been pushed to 2D wich in my opinion gives the game a unique style. The game is as it says in the title you have 5 (and two bonus prisons) wich grow increacingley harder in difficulty, the main aim is to go about the daily routine and in the spare time buy from other inmates the tools requerd to escape in multiple ways each distinctley with there own risks and rewards. The game is a fun twist on the life of an imaate and and entertaining way to waste away a sunday afternoon as you become stressed becauce you were so close to escaping when a guard discovers youre tunnel and robs you of youre tools or the patronising dicision to either wait another day and save or to risk loosing all of youre hard erned tools. however the game lacks in the lenth as each day can be a struggle as the ever repeating time table gets werey fast and for the most part yo must follow this. there is also recentley a map editoe wich gives the players an ability to make there own prisons on the steam workshop however fun this is this is just a beta and currentley has nimerus bugs and gliches but if you persevier it is well worth the effort.overall this game is worth a 7/10 this is becauce of the repetative timetable as it gets so boaring in the later stages thanks for reading my take and i hope i have helped you in youre decision to purchase this title. please comment if there is anything i have missed thanks.

I'm talking about when I dig once I dig one more block of dirt I get a message from the warden saying he found me and puts me in solitary and i lose all my stuff. Or I am prying a vent while I'm up in the ventilating system and my file breaks and the vent isn't broken but damaged and I go off to sleep but I get the note from  the warden AGAIN losing everything.

												This is a game about escaping from prison. How you do so is up to you, though, and that's the charm of it. Want to tunnel your way out of Shankton State Penitentiary? Go ahead.Want to start a riot in Stalag Flucht and shank your way to victory? Go for it.Want to create an extremely elaborate and high stakes escape plan that requires the cooperation of your fellow prisoners? You'd better get started now.Want to just stay in prison, living through the game as a prison life simulator, doing favors and hoarding all the chocolate? You can do that.It may look simple, but what's here is actually much, much deeper than you can possibly imagine.Buy it.10/10			"

												The Escapists is a great, retro strategy game that is challenging, but satisfying. The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an ""!"" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory. It would also be amazing if there was an online co-op where you and your friends could escape prison together. Overall, a great game, but needs some improvements.			"

												Ok, The Escapists may look like a short game, with only 7 (originally) prisons, but it has so much play time into it! It's humorous, fun, and never-ending! It takes around 50-100 hours to beat the ""normal"" prisons, and that's in v1.0! It's already v1.05 (i think), and it's so good! They even have a prison editor/steam workshop planned, which wil make the game NEVER ENDING FUN! (Wait... It's already endless fun! But it will be even endless-ier! Endless-er? Whatever) It is DEFINITELY worth the $13.49. Or 17.99. Or; (endless numbers of prices). Point is;It's worth it.			"

								This game is OK. I am recommending it just because for the time I did play it, it was very enjoyable. But, later on, it got very repitive, which is somewhat understanable since your living your life as a prisoner with a tight schedule. For the most part, it was nice beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of fellow prisoners or reading in the library. It then does come down to crafting and finding the right pieces and what not you would expect. Just to quickly sum it up, I think this game has pretty good potential, but just needs more features. I think there needs to be a lot more crafting recipes, whether they do something or not. For example, I want to be able to combine a wire with a knife to create a knfie with a wire around it. Pretty point less, but it'll give you MUCH more choices...hmm choices...there needs to be also more ways to escape. Jumping the fence, holding a guard hostage, etc. tl;dr:the game needs more features to it.			"

								By far not my favorite game. But it is well made, humorous, and most importantly, it is hilarious. How many other games can you walk up to a man, shank him, steal his Teddy Bear, and then sneak through the ventilation shafts. Once on the roof of the building at night, you take your rope, and repel down the building. But here's the best part. You didn't even have to take the mandatory shower! 7/10			"

								I have not played much of this game but I love it. I like it because I actually have to cover everything to escape the tiniest things can get you caught and thrown into solitary. From what I have seen there are a few glitches  in animation and AI but there is nothing game-breaking, and It does lag after a while but saving and loading it back up fixes that. If want to make your prison escape dreams a reality I would suggest this to you and also you could just play this as a prison simulator if you wanted. In my opinion this is worth the money now.			"

								Even though I ahve played very little of this game, it is just AMAZING. However, you need to be quite smart to escape the prison as it is not easy (I have attempted to leave, and just get shot in my head and get a one-way ticket to the infirmary). But, with a skillful mind and a evil plan, you might actually escape. This game is well worth $10 (Or £7.99) and should be bought for anyone that likes Pokemon graphics with a puzzling adventure around a prison.What should be added:-More wide-spread prison-More Jobs (+ to get paid more cos im always broke xD)-Better Contraband items (Such as maybe a Looted Pistol)-Ability to customize your character (Change the hair, bodyshape etc.)Otherwise, I rate this game...1337/420, keep up the good dank m8's @ Mouldy Hoof.

								The Escapists is such a fun and addictive game to play. With its pixelated graphics this game reminds me of retro games that people used to play at arcades. At first glance it looks like a small game and nothing special, however that is wrong... Once you dive into this well scripted game you discover it is filled with cool content, from crafting abilities right to ""Dirty mags"" found in inmates draws. The Escapists is worth every penny and I would strongly recommend this game to others. Great job! Now I have my PC back up to speed expect my playtime on this game to rocket up!			"

												The Escapists is a great, retro strategy game that is challenging, but satisfying. The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an ""!"" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory. It would also be amazing if there was an online co-op where you and your friends could escape prison together. Overall, a great game, but needs some improvements.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game a lot. It's fun to find all the multiple ways to escape, many of which end in failure, but that in itself is funny enough to watch. The music is good, call me a weirdo but I like the shower music the most. Yes, even the shower music is good.The only bad thing I can say since the last time I played it (which was a while ago so it may have been fixed) is that if you close your device or let it go into sleep mode for a bit while the game is open, when you come back the clock will be ridiculously fast, you won't have time to make it to any blocks so you're heat will instantly hit 99, meaning all guards or snipers will get to unload all their anger on you.

												This game is amazing! My friend told me to get this game saying that it was pretty good, but once i played it i relized that ""pretty good"" was an understatement. this game has a retro feel and requires lots of planning ahead, and unlike many games, every action could make or break you during an escape attempt. every escape attempt is nerve racking because if you mess up your progress is almost compleatly reset. Anotther cool thing about this game is the fact that there is so many ways to escape and each way has its own benifits. In conclusion, this game is amazing if you are into games that rely on thinking ahead and careful planning, opposed to games where you run and hope for the best.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game a lot. It's fun to find all the multiple ways to escape, many of which end in failure, but that in itself is funny enough to watch. The music is good, call me a weirdo but I like the shower music the most. Yes, even the shower music is good.The only bad thing I can say since the last time I played it (which was a while ago so it may have been fixed) is that if you close your device or let it go into sleep mode for a bit while the game is open, when you come back the clock will be ridiculously fast, you won't have time to make it to any blocks so you're heat will instantly hit 99, meaning all guards or snipers will get to unload all their anger on you. If you miss rolecall then the entire prison will go into lockdown (just for little old you) and you'll get fired from your job too, which sucks.So all I should say is that it's a good game, and also everybody is obsessed with Duct Tape (thanks Martyn).

												The Escapists is a great, retro strategy game that is challenging, but satisfying. The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an ""!"" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory. It would also be amazing if there was an online co-op where you and your friends could escape prison together. Overall, a great game, but needs some improvements.			"

												oh, the escapists. it's a love/hate relationship between you and me.you play as a little prisoner who was sent to jail for an unidentified reason, and you must collect materials to slowly, yet sneakily break out.the escapists is a prison simulator that can really test your ability to be sneaky and stuff. there are about 6 maps currently, which range between difficulty. the hardest, being HMP Irongate, that isbased on alcatraz. (You know, the prison on the island in san fransisco?)you can buy materials off of other prisoners too, but only with money, which can be earned by doing a favour for a prisoner (like beating up 'this' person) or doing your job.your prisoner starts off with puny stats, and you can improve these by going on a treadmill or doing push ups. Also going on the internet raises your 'intelligence' so you can craft better items and apply for better paying jobs.I really like this game, but i hope for more to it in the future.8/10			"

												This game is amazing!!! It's challenging to those who refuse to look up recipes (like me), but still fun even if you do. Learning to make new and unique items is one of the best aspects of this game (Planning your escape route and starting full out riots isn't far behind.) Plus the new map builder is a great way to make this experience endless! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the RPG, Sandbox, and even the Strategy generes of gaming. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have. 9.5/10 (Would give it a 10/10 but I have encountered a few game breaking bugs in my travels, but if they fixed them then consider it a 10/10.)			"

								Sitting at rolecall in Centre Perks, the guard says ""Hugs"", I go to hug him and they beat me up. I feel heartbroken as my love for the guards died. 10/10 Needs more girl prisoners and needs more guns.Okay seriously, I think this game is awesome, It has lots of detail for a WIP Game and is fun. Every Prison is Unique and requires different ways to take them down. I suggest getting this game while its cheap :)EDIT: Dropped Soap in a shower and got an Achievement... 15/10			"

												I bought this game while in early access and I am updating the review as this game has changed quite a bit. This game is a strategy game that requires timing, knowledge, and patience. You will not get through this game doing nothing but beating up guards. I played this game without looking at the wikipedia, and in my 50 or so hours I beat every normal prison, none of the DLC prisons, even though I own all of them, (Including Fort Bamford because I bought the game in Early Access). This game is worth the money just looking at the hours of playtime you get from it. Enjoyment is a different thing, not everyone will like the game. Foremost is graphics, it is a 2D top-down view, and the art style is very pixelated. However, this means you do not need a high end computer to run it. Most computers will be able to run this game as it is a lightweight program. The gameplay like I said earlier is very strategic and it requires a bit of luck with the patrol of the guards. You need an escape strategy and, depending on the prison, sometimes there is only one way out that requires specific items. Most items needed in escaping are contraband, they will be taken if seen by guards, and you will be reset if guards find any in your desk or find a hole in a wall or the ground. This makes for very chaotic gameplay, ""Quick. move the desk, get in, dig dig dig, get out, place the desk!"", that sort of thing.In conclusion I would reccomend this game, it is an amazing single player game and I definitely consider escaping some of those prisons as achievements.

								Very good game, with so many ways to escape each level has reply value -Soon adding level creator- so plenty of ways to succeed (and fail). Also refrences to pop culure in phrases said by inmates and guards. The main attraction of the game is the combination of having to work out what to do with the many recipies and escape routes alone with the stressful task of doing it. However cannot save during day which can be annoying, but also means that you're punished for mistakes.			"

												I really like this game. It has a unique learning curve, and the tutorial isn't much of a 'tutorial' at all, you learn more about the game as you go on, and i personally like that. Each map is unique and differenciate from the other maps, as you would expect, the maps get harder and harder as you complete them. Decent replay value, but can get a bit dull over time if you overplay it. I do enjoy the homage 8 bit graphic design, it almost gives a sense of comfort and relaxaion when you play. The music is pretty good as well.Overview: Great game, awesome art style, good music, not for the person looking for a story based game, but it can be interesting to see people complete certain maps, it can be one of those games where you get the sudden urge to go on wikia and study up about the game. And for anyone looking for a prison simulator, this and prison architect are your best bets. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, unqiue game to sink a couple dozen hours into.Hope this was helpfull! :D			"

												This is a really great game! I really enjoyed all the prisons and the way it lookes and the challenge. I have a few suggestions for a update for the game. Maybe you could add a Multiplayer mode where you can play with friends and become a police officer. Another thing was that you could just play single player on prisons like San Pancho as a guard, instead of a plain old prisoner, with a goal that I don't really know, but It could be your choice, really. It's your game, not mine. You don't have to do it, but it's a suggestion that I think would make the game better. Anyways, I love the game, it's great to play.			"

Train your skills to ridiculous levels and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone you see, causing a prison lockdown (if done extensively enough, the warden surrenders and lets you out)4. Eat food off the floor5. Give food from the floor to other prisoners to make them like you6. Get shot by guard towers7. Get a job8. Lose your job as a janitor because you couldn't find any ♥♥♥♥ing messes to clean up9. Use a pillow as a weapon10. Use a hot cup of chocolate as a weapon (which actually one hit KOs guards btw)11.

								I found myself utterly enthralled with The Escapists. Unlike other games, which don't trust you to go to the bathroom unless they've told you to, The Escapists basically says, ""Alright look, you're in prison. Now get out of prison. Good luck!"" It shows a maturity of design to basically let the player loose in to a playground instead of stepping them through the process, piece by piece.The Escapists isn't a game for people who need to win on the first go. It's one of those games that you have to be alright with suffering MANY setbacks before you finally succeed. When it isn't being buggy (which isn't all that often, the devs are doing pretty great with keeping up on bugs) you still have to watch for a single mistake, because one pile of dirt left on the ground when the guards pull the bedsheets off your cell, and it's back to square one. The biggest piece of advice I can give on this game is to LEARN. When you mess up, start looking around for what changed. Figure out WHY you messed up, and how you can avoid that. And ALWAYS BE CRAFTING. Experiment with EVERYTHING, and figure out how to craft yourself some gear. Good: A truly open world sandbox title that does freedom of gameplay in a phenomenal way. The visual style is appealling and interesting, the music is fun, and the game is wholly and comepletely addictingBad: The combination of how hard the game cracks down on contraband, how little you know of crafting, and how few and far between hints are means it's going to take you a little while to figure out crafts, and believe you me, you aren't getting ANYWHERE without crafting. A slightly more accessible crafting interface would not have gone amiss.Ugly: Steps that still need to be taken: I would love to see a little more play with your relationship with other prisoners. I wish anyone who came to hate you would start plotting against you, or gather their own posse to rival yours. While I'm out just after lights out to beat up inmates, None of the others are. Also, I'd love to see dead drops implemented, where prisoners can stash things for each other. And yes, there are ""stashes"" hidden in the walls, but I mean for more common things like leaving a shiv under a table for a quest for a fellow inmate. It could add variety to questing.Over all, if you can put a little time in to it, BUY THIS GAME. You will not regret it.			"

												 Developed by Mouldy Toof Studios The Escapists places you in the role of a convicted felon trying to escape from prison. Prison games aren’t the most original of ideas right now, but there take on it is quite unique. It’s currently out on Early Access on steam, so expect bugs and issue’s if you take the plunge. The game has an 8bit style that’s reminiscent of the games on the NES and gives the game a really stylised feel. The Escapists isn’t afraid to poke fun at its self too, you’ll often find yourself chuckling at the odd line a guard says or an awkward moment in the showers. The main idea is of course to escape, but the game gives you a huge amount of choices on how to do that. Will you build a tunnel under ground, or pose as a guard? Will you climb into the ventilation system or chip through the walls? There is no set method and no dead set rules. But before you even think of escape there are other considerations. Prison life starts in the morning with role call, this is where you will find out who’s cell will be tossed. If its yours I hope you’ve not left any contraband or signs of escape for the guards to find as this will set you back to square one again, you’ll lose all you’ve worked so hard to acquire and all your holes and false walls will be filled in. After role call your day will be broken up into meal periods, exercise time, shower time and free periods/work periods. Through out the day you will be interacting with other inmates, buying items from them or taking jobs from them. These jobs range from acquiring for them a comb shiv to causing a distraction in the showers so your fellow inmates can dish out some rough justice. These jobs will improve your standing with said inmate and earn you money but might cause the victim to take a less positive view of you, eventually they may come looking for revenge. Guards that you’ve had run-ins with in the past might attack you on sight and leave you in the infirmary. You’ll find your constantly walking a popularity tight rope, it adds a nice dynamic to the game. Your inmate has three skills that he can improve too, strength is the first. Improving strength with bench presses or push ups will increase your health. Speed is the second, this is improved by running on a treadmill or other cardio workouts. This skill is strange as it doesn’t improve your movement speed but rather how fast you can attack. Lastly is your intelligence skill, Improved by browsing the web or other knowledge based ventures. This improves what you can craft and is perhaps the most important skill in the game. You may want to take the time to improve these skills to keep you alive long enough to put you escape plan into action. Don’t be fooled by the cute graphics or stylised charm of The Escapists, the game is not easy. It draws you in with a nice easy tutorial, but that’s it. After this you don’t get any help, your on your own. At times this can be infuriating, when you’ve been struggling for hours to put the perfect escape plan together only to be caught by a slight miss step. But! And its a big but, when you get it right its amazing. The game can be hard, but I can promises you that you’ll find yourself going back for more and more.For full review see http://cyberusuk.com/2015/01/27/the-escapists-review-should-it-be-kept-behind/ "

Train your skills to ridiculous levels and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everyone you see, causing a prison lockdown (if done extensively enough, the warden surrenders and lets you out)4. Eat food off the floor5. Give food from the floor to other prisoners to make them like you6. Get shot by guard towers7. Get a job8. Lose your job as a janitor because you couldn't find any ♥♥♥♥ing messes to clean up9. Use a pillow as a weapon10. Use a hot cup of chocolate as a weapon (which actually one hit KOs guards btw)11.

								I'll just get this out of the way, the game is a lot of fun. as a matter of fact, this game is so fun, it was NOMINATED for TIGA game of the year award. at the time of writing this review, ""The Escapists"" is only 2-3 months old.PROS-as i have said before, the game is fun-mostly kid friendly-combat is simple and easy, yet on the inside complicated, and I'll tell you why in just a sec-weapons are fairly balanced, and can only be made overpowered via work by you. You.-it is possible to make certain types of armor, worst being ""Cushioned Inmate Outfit"", which is easy to make and great for beginners, best being ""Plated Inmate Outfit"", which requires some hard work to make.CONS-EVERYTHING gets blamed on you. EVERYTHING. you stick a item called, no joke, ""Dirt"", not Pile of Dirt, which would make much more sense if you've seen the item, outside, and you will soon get a note which basiclly says ""We know you tunneled, go to solitary"" but here is the thing, you can find Dirt in other peoples desks! So you may not have created the item, but you get blamed for it.-Snipers. f***ing Snipers. if you do something that sets you all the way up to 99% guard heat, you'll soon notice that you were just running from the guards to being in the infirmary. Way too Powerful.-Bugs and Glitchs, which are common in Early Alpha, but i have met some very game breaking bugs, such as, having a inventory full of rare contraband and having all of it dissapear before my very eyes, etc.now you may be thinking ""all of this and you're still recommending the game?"" and the answer is, yes, yes i am.8 outta 10 amazing game and definetly worth $15. screw you large, repetitive games like CoD, I think I'll just sit by the fire and play some of this.

Saving anywhere would remove some of the challenge, but if there were save locations other than 'going to sleep' I would not rage quit as much.It is still worth a play, but I think its present price tag is a little high.

								Get this game. It's worth it.What a game. Well worth the money, can easily put a lot of time in to the game if your new to playing it. Great buy for Early Access, despite being one level.There will most likely be a prison editor so people can share prisons. which I really can't wait to be released.			"

												I dont really feel like writing a big review for this game (at least yet), so I'm just gonna give a pros and cons list:Pros:-Nice looking graphics-Requires careful planning to escape-You can make a gang of people that follow your orders-Customizable names of inmates and guards, which can make the game pretty funny (although whenever I rename people there are many bugs such as multiple people spawning with the same name and people not spawning with the correct name)-Various different ways to escape each prison-System of buying items from other inmates-You can get a job to earn money and sneak contraband items out-Takes a while to escape, so you feel satisfied when you doCons:-No way to escape with the help of fellow inmates(as in, have other inmates help dig tunnels and stuff like that)-No multiplayer-No way to sell items to other inmates-No way to save the game until you go to sleep at night (so if you get a ton of stuff done during a day but have to go or somehow get caught before night you have to redo everything you did that day)Overall, I'd say it is a good game, but wait for it to go on sale to buy it.

												This is the tv show Prison Break with SNES graphics.Tutorial done in 3 minutes, good i understand the basics.First very easy level, pfft this should be done in 10 minutes.5 hours later...ARGH, They caught me again!This game is awesome, it thought of everything.I've been buying many new games recently.Steam is plagued with incomplete games made by trashy developpers trying to make a few bucks.This is not one of them.This is by far my best purchase.I can't imagine someone buying this and regretting it.Buy it now.Especially if you're browsing for any cool game and you're unsure which one will be worth the most.Trust me, this is the one.

												These types of games usually greatly apeal to me, tedious planning and working towards a goal slowly, I can do that for hours.This game didnt feel like that, its just felt...boring. There feels like there is almost no depth, the entire game is grinding your stats with tedious button mashing, and collecting/crafting items. You cant incite riots, or team up with other inmates to work towards a plan. You cant pickpocket guards or inmates, the only way to steal things is beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them, and when a guard wakes up, they automatically catch you. Your best hope is just hoping that a inmate is selling the contraband you need to progress your plan.When I finally gave up, after being automatically teleported to solitary again (No manhunt states or anything, just teleport you when they know you are up to no good) I was a little bummed when I realized I probably couldnt refund the game, as it felt like I had been playing it for upwards of 4 hours.I had been playing for about 1 hour...its the anti-civilization.I cannot recomend this game, not for nearly 20$ I feel Prison Architects slightly broken ""in there just for fun"" escape mode, has more depth than this.

												Playing in the first prison only shortly after having completed the tutorial, I figured a screwdriver would be my best friend and the vents would be my best method for escape/transit in the wee hours of the night. I finally got my hands on a screwdriver from some chump in the showers and waited until lights out to begin my exploring. Got the vent popped off, headed towards the infirmary with my eyes on the chest, assuming their would be lots of drugs and needles and other prison goodies hopefully guaranteeing my success in #prisonlife. I dropped down only to be met with an inability to open the chest, as well as an inability to leave the room. At all. Guards see my cell is empty, place goes on lockdown, apparently no guard could figure out I was in the infirmary so Mr. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Warden MD Ph.D ""calls in the big dogs"" to sniff be out and I end up in SHU, losing my once invaluable screwdriver. I then dig a tunnel under the fence and flip the entire level the bird.Fast forward to the 3rd prison, I decide to get serious. No matter what I do these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s figure out I broke into a vent, so we're giving up on that. Tunnels are the way to go. Minecraft trained me for this. The original Red Faction trained me for this. Ez Pz get a shovel and we're squeezy. I build up as much metal and duct tape as I can, rek that bummy Aiden from the woodshop so I have an easy supply of timber for braces, then get working on two sturdy shovels, a sturdy pickaxe, and keeping my toilet full of timber braces. The night comes. I've kept cool for 6 days now, I've got all the bars in my room covered and a bed dummy just incase. I start digging. I get under the floor. I continue digging towards the closest fence, only to realize I just dug up into my own cell and now my cell practically has no floor and I have nothing to cover it with. I get back into one of my holes to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, when I realize I dug into an endless abyss from which I could indeed escape the prison, absolutely no digging required. This game makes no sense.10/10 "

												(there will be misspells, sorry)                      The Escapists is a great game and defianatly worth the money, i think it is sort of an uplifting game with stratagey and excitment. You have jobs, inmate's and guard's Al is awesome, and there are many different prisons. The prisons go from easy to hard and there are 6 of them, the DLC prisons arw great too. Inmates can ask you favors to get a specific item for them, a distraction at a certain time, and beat up someone. Your inmates also can sell things that you need to escape. Of all singleplayer games out there, i would rate this one as the best.                                                                                                                                                                        45/10 MR.Ca$h approves :)			"

								Well, the 999th review. This game is pretty dank. It's a lot of fun, provides constant updates from the great developers, and is definitly worth the money. With every alpha game, there are bugs, but it is rare to find any game breaking bugs. Some bugs are quite funny: in the jungle compound, randomly, everyone gets KO'd and you can run around and loot them all :3 the only bug so far that has genuinily annoyed me is a bug with the leaderboards, in which it will not update your days taken to escape if you get a faster escape on that prison. I escaped in 8 days from the jungle compound, and then later on escaped with 4, but it only updated my score and not my days taken :( Anyway, I would recommend this game greatly!			"

								even with the glitchy overlapping inmates, no way to choose which item/person on a bed to interact with, and very little in the way of prison intrigue like the ability to frame others by planting contraband, it's still a fun game.  always satisfying to see all your hard work come to fruition.

												At first this game looked fun and promising, but the fun fell out at about 2 hours. Repetition broke in and it felt less like a game, and more like a menial task. There was nothing new and you learned everything during those two hours. It basically became a game of luck as to anything, and there really in no skill. I would say don't get it for full price. If you do still plan on buying it, get it on sale for at least 33% off.			"

Eventually connected them all with tunnels, which was about 50+ blocks of dirt and stone. Filled my hidden rooms with contraband. Super proud of it, have everything I need so I dug my escape... 8 blocks to the right... and won... Oh.10/10 would connect tunnels again.This game is still unfinished, but it's quite playable and fun. I look forward to seeing additional features down the road.			"

												Well it is a great game in many ways, it also lacks in many ways.It's a lot of fun to escape in different ways each time, but there is one MAJOR problem:Guards can detect you trying to escape in ways they would never be able to IRL, but on the other hand you can get away with methods that would never work IRL either.Guards announce a cell search during role call? Run off to your cell while they talk and fit your pickaxe, shovel, guard uniform, and cell key in your pockets! Well this review probably is harsh, I am giving the benefit of the doubt that these sorts of things will improve over time. That, and as I said before, the replayablity makes it worth the cons (pun intended.)			"

												Prison escape is a fun premise for a game but the way it's executed in this game is lacking. You find yourself locked in a jail and spend a lot of your days trying to sneak away from your daily routines to scout for weak points in the jail's security. After you find some you'll need to craft some tools to use in your escape -- if you can find the required components. Every day you can purchase or steal items off of fellow inmates, but the items available are randomly generated! Meaning you normally have to play through several days just waiting for somebody to have a chocolate bar on them because that's the one item you need. It would be much better if you could request the basic items you need from inmates instead of them being completely random.Ploting your escape is fun. Repeating the same in-game routine over and over until a basic item becomes available for you to use is not. Unfortunately, I spent the majority of my time doing the latter.			"

												This game is a lot of maintenance, a lot of RNG, and very little pay-off.  Everything that happens is highly-transient.  Buff yourself out?  Better spend a lot of time lifting weights, or you'll get weak.  Got a shiv?  You'll lose it when you get beat up, when your cell gets searched, or when someone else's cell gets searched.  Good luck getting the key you need; it'll vanish as soon as the guard wakes up--whoever's desk you hide it in, they get searched the next day about 80-90% of the time.As for how to play?  Just beat people up, steal their stuff, lift weights for half the time, and get beat up to clear all the negative stuff.  You'll spend most of your time trying to find one item (a screwdriver or a key).  You can get a job for money, if you want to spend 4 hours of gameplay getting $20; or you can spend 40 seconds lifting weights, then beat up inmates for other inmates.  You could craft a weapon, or just weight lift a hell of a lot.It's a lot of doing nothing.			"

												This is actually a really fun game, and a fantastic premise - you are an inmate with grandiose dreams of escaping prison, and it's your task to spend your days observing prison life and stockpiling the resources you'll need to actually do it. I really enjoyed the time I spent with it, but I seem to have a bug which ruins the game for me.Whenever I reload from a previous state - whether in game, or when I come back to my computer and load the game up fresh - everything except the day I have saved on resets. Any items I have stashed away disappear, regardless of whether I leave them in safe or non-safe places (yep - all desk items simply vanish), all of the crafting notes I have collected are removed from the notebook, and anything my player was carrying (both in terms of equipped weapon and the 6 inventory slots) either randomises or disappears entirely. Sometimes items will randomly reappear on other unconscious inmates, but that's about it. The only things actually ""saved"" when saving the game seems to be my stats, and the tasks saved on my to-do list.If this pretty essential feature worked, I reckon I'd be quite a fan of The Escapists and recommend it as one of the most interesting indie titles I've ever come across. There is little to no hand-holding in this game which I especially love about it - you are literally left on your own to observe, explore, discover and devise. But if all my hard work observing, exploring, discovering and devising is going to be wiped any time I come back to the game (or even simply reload the day with the game still running!), I'm afraid I couldn't actively recommend this to anybody.Update: Heard from a friend that this bug was ""fixed"", so uninstalled and re-installed the game only for essentially the same things to happen again. Everything I've stockpiled disappeared. And I'm never warned or given solitary time, so I can say with certainty that it is the game itself and not the guards clearing those areas which is the problem. I don't mind that you can't save until the very end of the day; I can deal with that. But simply having everything as it was at point of saving should really be a given for a save feature... so this will sadly remain a downvote. A real shame, as I love the gameplay itself.			"

												Games that expect you to use a wiki to figure everything out are not my thing, and the systems in this game are designed in a way that makes me feel gross.You find crafting recipes or buy them with character-specific dollars, and your ""crafting recipes found"" journal is per-character. This makes me feel like I have no progression because I want to start a new character if I end up hating the layout of the loot and how I've done on my current character and I always start from square 1 with the crafting stuff.There is only one prison until you beat that first one, and beating the first one is a hell of a task. This means if you ♥♥♥♥ up on the first one 25 times and start to get sick of the exact same routines and level layout every time you are SOL unless you manage to beat it or play the other two, much harder prisons that are unofficial.The fullscreen on 16:9 monitors is just the normal aspect ratio of the game stretched grossly wide, like an emulator set to stretch an NES game to 1080p that makes Mario twice as fat. It's really terrible and is the only option.The emergent gameplay of the prison is minor and less deep than it seems at the outset. You can easily knock out any prisoner by hitting them once and then running them into a guard while they chase you, let them hit you once and then the guard beats them to unconsciousness. You can make people miss their quota for their job by beating them up a bunch during work hours and then take their job. You can plant contraband in their cells. You can make people hate you and then coax them into fighting you and use them to cause a distraction or go somewhere they wouldn't. These things are kind of cool. But not enough to base a game around.If you fight a guard, all you can do is knock them out for 30 seconds, and if you take one of their keys they immediately game over you when they wake up. Also, if you run away after beating them up sometimes they just forget, sometimes there is no repercussion, sometimes they chase you around forever, and sometimes an unseen sniper in the corner of the map will shoot you in the face until you die. Which of these four things happens is decidedly random.Escaping, the whole point of the dang game, sucks. Digging is this awful minecrafty thing where you have pickaxes or pickaxe-like items that very quickly decay as you use them to dig through a foot of dirt, and then when they break you have to go get more. Tools you need desperately are either totally randomly found, difficult to craft with no way to figure out how the recipes work, which have some amount of sense, but, come on, paper meche = toilet paper & super glue? People who have played the early access version rattle off absurd, stupid crafting items like a ""bed decoy"" and 'fake vent cover"" that just scream that the game's systems are buried so deep in their own BS that they feel the need to overdesign to cover their own flaws. Why build a game where you need three tiers of pickaxes and bed roll decoys and cell curtains and instant death snipers? Silliness.Vital items are hidden in one-time random loot crates that disappear forever after finding them and can contain garbage or incredibly valuable things and the seed changes every time you load so you have to save scum if you want something in particular.Oh and all the text stuff is all over the place in grammar and spelling, full of memes and nonsense most of the time, and you read it all within the first few hours. Sure there's some neat ideas but pulled off in a way that feels very mediocre.I still find myself coming back and might revise this review. It's kind of fun in some ways but just so frustrating.			"

												Its like day 15, you have literally everything u need to escape the last prison. You're super exited and nervous and go through the escape plan again just to make sure. While practicing your escape play, u pick up everything u need to escape with and go through everything. Its almost night time, u have ur bed dummy in place and ur guard outfit and shovels in hand while waiting in roll call and praying u dot get searched. Then, all of the sudden, u accidently press left mouse button and start digging in the middle of the ♥♥♥♥ing prsion during roll call and lose everything.420/69 would misclick again			"

												Maybe I'm just too impatient, but playing this game feels like being actually imprisoned.... Like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I thought escaping would be fun, but mostly it's just going through the routine of a prisoner's life... Forced to eat, work out, and attend roll calls at particular times. There's no actual need for food but you ""have to"" sit in the cafeteria for almost a full minute to avoid getting in trouble.I learned my lesson, I never want to go to prison, and I probably never want to play this game again either.

								After playing it for what feels like 13 hours (15 maybe? Lost track of time.) I have to say it's insanely fun and I'm looking foward to all the features that will be added in. The sprite style is adorable, the gameplay is quite fun, and all around I enjoyed plotting my escape, though I have yet to succeed.If I could add anything to the game it would be A female prison that way those who like to use female sprites can do so. A capability to design your ""Family"" so that way the visitation area can get a use and your family can slip you contrabands. Would also love to see a way to choose what crime you were jailed for to set up Relations between prisoners and guards.All in all a great game and well worth the ten dollars so far.			"

												This game is very well done. The prision life is hard and it will make you use you brain to think of ways to escape.Just be careful those guards to watch you closely.I do highly suggest getting this game.The only other thing I think wold be cool is if they added cheats just to test the game to its max, so it would make it a little more interesting for the experinced and completed users.And no programs like Cheat Engine or some other varible changing program that messes up your pc with malware and viruses.But still it is a great game and I suggest you buy it.

								As the game currently is, it is prone to swings of luck and can feel a bit grindy. Not to mention that a single bad luck or mistake can dramatically cripple your progress so far and set you back tremendously and I'm only talking about prison of ""moderate"" difficulties (harder ones are not yet implemented). But all of this make success all the more satifying.It's a quirky game with it's own charm. It certainly can make the blood of rage quitters boil. But those who welcome games that can be harsh at times will become obcesed with pulling off that perfect escape and grabing that high score. Sinking many hours in this doing so.This is only an early access game and should not be judged as a full release. But I have to say that what the game already have is pretty decent and makes me hopeful for it's future.			"

[Day: 1]Aw well, saw it coming a mile away...Mikey stuck me up for an apparent 'murder' which I did not commit. The evidence looked solid but wasn't true, well we'll see how he likes it when I get out of here and give him a suprise visit...[Day: 5]Thank god the guys here are friendly, seems the prison is filled with crackjobs but heck they sure do give a guy what he needs. Met a guy called Spy, nice french guy gotta' admit. He's been supplying me with some goodies to help me outta' this dump. Should be out in a week or so at this rate.[Day: 7]Weakened the vent in my cell and I'm rather suprised nobody has heard me unscrewing the damn thing. Unfortunetly my plan can't go yet, nobody has had any supply of ducktape in a while so I've gotta' lay low for a few days before I can put my plan into full flow.[Day: 15]Spy has went quiet and hasn't been supplying noffin' seems the other inmates have it in for him. A lot of the other lads keep asking me to pummel the guy for dosh...Poor lad, might have to.[Day: 32]Seriously...No duck tape yet.[Day: 45]JESUS HOW HARD IS IT TO BRING IN CONTRABAND DUCK TAPE!? They can bring in drugs and knives but they can't even bring in freakin' ducktape!?! You know how hard it is to eat something that feels like dried concrete powder going down your throat? PRETTY DAMN HARD! Starting to lose it...[Day: 50]Attempted escape plan without the shovel...Improvised with a plastic spoon I took during evening meal. Ended up taking a full sniper shot to the leg, spending time in the medical room...[Day: 52]...I give up, I'll spend the next 6 years of my sentence waiting for ducktape.			"

												I bought this game in early access and I liked it, I really did. However, once it became a ""full release"" I really lost intrest. Much like ""Pixal Piracy"" it saying that it's done just kills it.So there I was thinking ""Oh, they're not goining to fix the annoying instant solitary system and implement somthing that would show effort and really add to gameplay"" and ""So the leveling up system of clicking in place and maching Q and E till your wrists hurt is what they intended, and not just filler to get the game off of the ground"" and ""Oh, they're not going to add in more quips so you don't hate every line of dialoge after an hour"" and ""Oh, so they're not going to make a multiplayer mode that this game has been crying out for"". I was just left feeling sad and angry.It is a fun game and I love the concept, the open ended levels give a great sense of freedom and you can escape however you like. But if you are on the roof or in vent or even in a tunnel, they should at least make it so that you aren't instantly caught if you happen to have a key stolen off of a guard or miss roll call. It sets itself up incredibly but through sheer laziness misses the mark tragically.And flipping heck the DLC takes the cake. The game isn't done, and it certainly isn't looking for a Walking Dead (tm) crossover that costs more than the actual game. PS:By instantly caught I mean that a window pops up and you get teleported to solitary immidiatly			"

												This game is surprisingly fun and can be quite intense to deal with when trying to escape from the end tier prisons (Screw you prison inmates!). There are a few issues I have encountered with the game. For one, guards bug out all the time and when you mess around with other inmates toilets to flood them, you see my point. Also, there is a bug where, if you tie up an inmate with duct tape and carry them outside, drop them to the fence, cut it then grab them while the fence is still being cut. The fence takes damage and rinse and repeat until you can escape and this is during the day. With a hostage, the tower guards can't shoot you so... Otherwise, fun game and would recommend it while it is on sale.			"

It felt like a cut down version of Habbo hotel.Strangely, this is one of the few games which is more enjoyable to watch somebody else play than play it yourself.			"

												in all my play through all i chould think about was this quote from The Shawshank Redemption 1967 Parole Hearings Man: Ellis Boyd Redding, your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence. Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?Red: Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means.1967 Parole Hearings Man: Well, it means that you're ready to rejoin society...Red: I know what you think it means, sonny. To me, it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?1967 Parole Hearings Man: Well, are you?Red: There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is awesome			"

												It's a brilliant game!This is a prison escape simulator that offers you many creative ways to escape.The pixel style fits the game,aswell as the soundtrack.I Really loved this game because it makes you creative, there are lots of ways of a prison but you escape you're own way.The characters and dialog in the game are very funny and intresting aswell,this is a an alpha game and has lots of prisons and items, crafting plays a big roll too, there are lots of different crafting recipies which can be discovered by crafting notes which you can buy or find  in someones desk.That is my personal opinion on this game. MY Rating is 8.5/10It's a really good game but i cant rate it better because it's in alpha and things can change so im hoping it gets better :D			"

								As the game currently is, it is prone to swings of luck and can feel a bit grindy. Not to mention that a single bad luck or mistake can dramatically cripple your progress so far and set you back tremendously and I'm only talking about prison of ""moderate"" difficulties (harder ones are not yet implemented). But all of this make success all the more satifying.It's a quirky game with it's own charm. It certainly can make the blood of rage quitters boil. But those who welcome games that can be harsh at times will become obcesed with pulling off that perfect escape and grabing that high score. Sinking many hours in this doing so.This is only an early access game and should not be judged as a full release. But I have to say that what the game already have is pretty decent and makes me hopeful for it's future.			"

												Personally, I found this game very repetitive from the 20 minutes that I played of it. Training stats, talking to people, searching and crafting is incredibly tedious and doesn't feel rewarding in the slightest. Maybe simulation games aren't for me, or maybe this game is not very good. It felt like a cut down version of Habbo hotel.Strangely, this is one of the few games which is more enjoyable to watch somebody else play than play it yourself.			"

												The Escapists is a different kind of game. I personally have never seen anything like it before in my gaming life. At first, it is very, very confusing on how to do day-to-day tasks within the prison and what not, along with how to gain items to even plan and make your escape. I find $18 for this game is very steep considering how much the game actually contains and the pixelated graphic style. If you can get it for free somehow, or have a friend give it to you as a gift, I would recommend it. Otherwise, do not drop all that hard earned cash of yours on this at the moment.

												This game constantly keeps you on your toes as to where you store your red items. Red items are contraband and get you in trouble! While grinding skills is part of the game, the routine system discourages this so you've always got something productive to do, unless you wanna get in trouble.Don't get this game unless you research prison life ahead of time through Jacksepticeye, videos in the community hub, or the wiki. It's important to know what's required of you, and the last thing you want to do is waste time, since time spent in the slammer is accounted into your final score.I escaped Center Perks by cutting through the fence at night wearing a guard outfit after spending a few days bulking up to knock out a cop to replicate his key to get outside after Lights Out. I think for the next jail, I'll be digging a long tunnel under my desk because electic fences seem problematic.10/10 would call the escape hotline to be notified of the electric fence again.			"

I have done the same day on one prison about 16 times by now, the game needs to make a fast foward button if you don't wanna do the stuff on the day, whenever you fail because of the late responses, boom. You're doing the day over again. I also would want co-op added into the game.			"

												A game should let you learn the rules naturally to beat the game, as you go along. If you get all the rules all at once, the game might be boring as you know everything and all is easy. If the game gives none, you have no idea what to do, it might  become boring as you have no idea what to do. The escapist gives you no idea what to do to escape. The tutorial level does not really work to teach you anything, and the only way to beat it is if you tried everything (Which would take ages, and be boring) Or watch/read an online guide (Which requires no brain power and is boring)This game is boring, 5/10			"

If you can get it for free somehow, or have a friend give it to you as a gift, I would recommend it. Otherwise, do not drop all that hard earned cash of yours on this at the moment. Wait for a sale!			"

												This game constantly keeps you on your toes as to where you store your red items. Red items are contraband and get you in trouble! While grinding skills is part of the game, the routine system discourages this so you've always got something productive to do, unless you wanna get in trouble.Don't get this game unless you research prison life ahead of time through Jacksepticeye, videos in the community hub, or the wiki. It's important to know what's required of you, and the last thing you want to do is waste time, since time spent in the slammer is accounted into your final score.I escaped Center Perks by cutting through the fence at night wearing a guard outfit after spending a few days bulking up to knock out a cop to replicate his key to get outside after Lights Out. I think for the next jail, I'll be digging a long tunnel under my desk because electic fences seem problematic.10/10 would call the escape hotline to be notified of the electric fence again.			"

												This game is great if you're willing to spend hours upon hours with a wiki open, figuring out how everything works. Apparently, that works for 93% of Steam users who bought this game. I, however, found it frustrating.The game provides a tutorial, but it's so brief that I still wasn't really sure what I was doing or how to do it. It took me an hour to figure out how to do favors for people because I didn't learn how from the tutorial. (I can't recall if it was in the tutorial and just got glossed over, or if they neglected to mention it at all.)This game is fun once you know what you're doing. I've seen it from Let's Plays on Youtube, which was the whole reason why I wanted this game. It's just tedious and frustrating to get there, and I don't think it's worth it.			"

												I bought this game in early access and I liked it, I really did. However, once it became a ""full release"" I really lost intrest. Much like ""Pixal Piracy"" it saying that it's done just kills it.So there I was thinking ""Oh, they're not goining to fix the annoying instant solitary system and implement somthing that would show effort and really add to gameplay"" and ""So the leveling up system of clicking in place and maching Q and E till your wrists hurt is what they intended, and not just filler to get the game off of the ground"" and ""Oh, they're not going to add in more quips so you don't hate every line of dialoge after an hour"" and ""Oh, so they're not going to make a multiplayer mode that this game has been crying out for"". I was just left feeling sad and angry.It is a fun game and I love the concept, the open ended levels give a great sense of freedom and you can escape however you like. But if you are on the roof or in vent or even in a tunnel, they should at least make it so that you aren't instantly caught if you happen to have a key stolen off of a guard or miss roll call. It sets itself up incredibly but through sheer laziness misses the mark tragically.And flipping heck the DLC takes the cake. The game isn't done, and it certainly isn't looking for a Walking Dead (tm) crossover that costs more than the actual game.

												This game is surprisingly fun and can be quite intense to deal with when trying to escape from the end tier prisons (Screw you prison inmates!). There are a few issues I have encountered with the game. For one, guards bug out all the time and when you mess around with other inmates toilets to flood them, you see my point. Also, there is a bug where, if you tie up an inmate with duct tape and carry them outside, drop them to the fence, cut it then grab them while the fence is still being cut. The fence takes damage and rinse and repeat until you can escape and this is during the day. With a hostage, the tower guards can't shoot you so... Otherwise, fun game and would recommend it while it is on sale.			"

												This is by far one of the best prison sims i have seen and played on the market. This game has many prisons plus the thousands of fan made prisons and the downloadable content. I cant see why people arnt taking advantage of buying this game when its on sale for 10$. 10$ is a steal for this game for it is worth 20 to 30$ Even tho i bought it back when it was 15$ and let me say its worth every penny i spent PLUS many more which im glad i was lucky to get it at the price i did. This game runs amazing, and has little to know bugs and the amount of times i have experienced any bugs and glitches can be counted on one hand. The game paly never really ends and it has an amazing replay value!!! I still play this game to this day and plan on starting recordings of it on my youtube channel HippieGamerDude and me and my friends shared account thealwaysgottengamers!!! So thats my opinion on this game i give this game a 7/10 to much water. JKJKJK!!! I give it a 11/10 with a slight amount of meat loaf on the side!!!			"

												I'd like to start off by saying I really wanted to like this game.A cool prison sim, yay. But unfortunately it's more than that.Here are some things that I find ridiculous about the game:1. If you accidentally dig in someone else's cell with a SPOON, somehow the warden will link it back to you and you will lose all your items :D!2. If you take a guard's key, they will somehow ""link it back"" to you, and you will lose all your items :D.3. If you're digging and you leave the hole behind, they will somehow ""link it back"" to you, and you will lose all your items :D!4. To dig out of the prison, you need to use Timber Supports, which take 2 timer per square -- I'd like to add that timber is very rare to find in someone else's desk, and no one sells them...5. Things like Paper Mache Cell Vents have odd durability, so you can only use them like 5 times before they break...I really wanted to like this game, I really did. But it's gotten to the point where I'm still on the 1st ♥♥♥♥ing prison and I keep having to reset my game because it's LINKED BACK TO ME.5/10, would not play again			"

												When I bought the Escapists, I was hooked. The initial reward is very fun, exploring the first prison increasing relations, collecting items, and stepping out of line. It all culminated in my daring escape plan which involved simply collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences. I then moved on to the next prison, and as it turned out it was as simple as... collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences.You'll love the first 1-2 hours and dread the monotony of the rest of the game. It's incredibly repetitive and lacks enough depth (even with its incredibly difficult prison maker). Get prison architect instead- it'll last far longer.Pros:-Great concept-Fun first few hours-Great humour and visualsCons:-Very repetitive-Not much depth5.5/10			"

								Thoroughly enjoyable in its current state, ""The Escapists"" is a puzzle game that tasks you with escaping a prison.  It features a crafting system and a number of safe/contraband items to loot.  There's a relatively moderate learning curve, though this is offset by the in-game help menu and recipe tracker (which I'm thankful for).  I had a lot of fun trying to figure out how to escape while observing the day to day routine whilst leveling up your character's stats, though I was prone to accidentally punching people in the face due to how easy it is to switch to combat-click mode.  You can find it on Steam's Early Access program for $9.99 with a price increase scheduled later down the line.

												Is it fun? Yes. But it's broken when it comes to game mechanics. Steal a key from a guard to make your escape, and your magically caught when he wakes up. Drop some dirt on the ground, you're caught. It gets frustrating especially when it takes so long to prepare yourself for an escape, and while this can be a great game when it works, when it doesn't you just feel cheated.			"

InstallationThe game is a very small file, which is expected of an 8-bit game. It took me less than a minute to install. It does use a launcher though, which is quite annoying.GameplayThe objective of this game is to escape from a prison (as you probably guessed). There is a routine that you must follow (like  roll call, breakfast, job/leisure period, etc). Whilst doing this, you must collect items that will help you escape from the prison. There is a lot you can do, and some pretty cool hidden features. There are currently 6 main prisons, with a bonus 8.Final ThoughtsThis game is definitely a must-have for those who love puzzle/escaping games. For 15 dollars, the price is a bit steep, so you should wait for a sale before purchasing. Below is a list of pros and cons:Pros- Great game mechanics and features- 8-bit style game- Active community- Replayability- Steam Community WorkshopCons- Only able to save after a full day has passed, which is several minutes long- Repetitive dialogue- Somewhat unreasonable priceIn conclusion, this is an excellent prison escape game, with its major setback being the price. -8/10			"

												This game is great if you're willing to spend hours upon hours with a wiki open, figuring out how everything works. Apparently, that works for 93% of Steam users who bought this game. I, however, found it frustrating.The game provides a tutorial, but it's so brief that I still wasn't really sure what I was doing or how to do it. It took me an hour to figure out how to do favors for people because I didn't learn how from the tutorial. (I can't recall if it was in the tutorial and just got glossed over, or if they neglected to mention it at all.)This game is fun once you know what you're doing. I've seen it from Let's Plays on Youtube, which was the whole reason why I wanted this game. It's just tedious and frustrating to get there, and I don't think it's worth it.			"

												I can understand why people like this game. The simplistic, pixellated graphics - look really good - at least in windowed mode. The concept of escaping from a number of prisons using nothing more than your wits (and what you get in your drawer. And what you get from doing favours) is brilliant in theory. The soundtrack adds to the feel of the game. But The Escapists, for all of its successes and positive press, is not without its shortcomings. For me, when I first picked up the game, my first thoughts were ""Is this seriously the loading screen..."" and ""How do I get this into fullscreen?"" After fixing the settings and starting the game, I found that the graphics, which seemed to be stretched to fit the entire screen, made the squarish tiles seem rectangular, the text seem stretched and all of the characters seem out of proportion. The text boxes that appeared over the characters' heads didn't add to the aesthetic either - they just seemed like people yelling out the same random drivel day after day - no conversation, no dialogue, no nothing.The gameplay did nothing for me either. The tutorial was just enough to explain the basic controls, which felt unnatural to me. Clicking on things to interact with them but requiring (or at least showing) WASD to move felt like it was a bit of a nuisance to move the cursor every time I wanted to even so much as look at my desk - not to mention how easy it was to accidentally pick it up and annoy the guards - but the gameplay itself to me felt very grindy, with little payoff and no sense of progression. After the first few days in the first prison, I felt that I was getting nowhere, had no clue what I was supposed to be doing, and was just repeating the same day over and over with no real way of going forward (which the tutorial should have explained.) It was just a matter of: Get up. Stand in one spot for a few seconds. Go and move to a room and sit in the same spot. Look for people to trade with. Do the laundry. Go and spam some buttons. Stand in the same spot for a few seconds. Look for trades again. Go and sit in a certain spot. Go and stand in a certain spot. Go to bed. Repeat.Once again, I feel like this was a good concept, poorly executed for a PC game. I would be fine with it as a premium mobile experience, but I feel like it is a bit simple for a $20 PC game.

												Great im going to try give an accurate guide on how to escape the first prison (very easy)1. train up your HP to 100% (untill your hp is 50) 2. train your intellect a bit3. get a metalshop job (this is the job you get paid most for) 4. fill your desk with forks and knives get a screw driver too 5. move your desk so you can climb the vent in your cell 6. at night time use the knives to weaken the vent to 5% durability (dont let the guards see) use your scredriver to finish off the vent (it should appear in your inventory) make sure to place a bed dummy (this is really important) cover up the vent too7. search for loot8. steps 4 5 6 and 7 were optional so if you don't want to bother you dont need to 9. get 2 pieces of timber and some green wire 10. craft nunchucks (powerfull weapon)11. get some rope 12. get a guard outfit 13. during free time knock out guards when they are alone and strolling by themselves14. tie them up with the rope 15. knock out all the guards you can16. tie them up with rope if you have some 17. you should get a letter from the warden about the main gate being open18. put on the guard uniform19. walk through the front gate like a boss20. you've escaped and should've got a achievement have fun guys ;)			"

												When I bought the Escapists, I was hooked. The initial reward is very fun, exploring the first prison increasing relations, collecting items, and stepping out of line. It all culminated in my daring escape plan which involved simply collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences. I then moved on to the next prison, and as it turned out it was as simple as... collecting cutlery and cutting through walls and fences.You'll love the first 1-2 hours and dread the monotony of the rest of the game. It's incredibly repetitive and lacks enough depth (even with its incredibly difficult prison maker). Get prison architect instead- it'll last far longer.Pros:-Great concept-Fun first few hours-Great humour and visualsCons:-Very repetitive-Not much depth5.5/10			"

Cool AIs, lots of favours, and a good game desin. All the jobs are pretty much the same, though. Idea=simple Planning=simple Escaping=hard.

												A game should let you learn the rules naturally to beat the game, as you go along. If you get all the rules all at once, the game might be boring as you know everything and all is easy. If the game gives none, you have no idea what to do, it might  become boring as you have no idea what to do. The escapist gives you no idea what to do to escape. The tutorial level does not really work to teach you anything, and the only way to beat it is if you tried everything (Which would take ages, and be boring) Or watch/read an online guide (Which requires no brain power and is boring)This game is boring, 5/10			"

I had literally 5 seconds to read 4 messages describing what my job is and what I have to do.Too bad I only realized after buying this game that the speed in the in-store videos is actual game speed. You can't slow it down, there is no pause, there is no delay for reading messages, just pure hectic and being pushed through daily prison routines.That pretty much took all the fun of exploring out of it for me.

												I'll start this review with the positives of this game. The Escapists does a few things very well: the dialogue, the crafting, and the prison layouts. However, the negatives greatly overweigh the positives. This game has a significant amount of grinding, and just pressing q and e to raise your players stats. The creators of this game could have tried to make a more engaging way to raise your characters statistics, but they failed at their attempt. Another complaint that I have is that the quests that other inmates give you are bland and boring. ""Beat this guy up"", ""Someone stole my Pedicure Kit"". It is extremely repetitive and gets old real fast. I would not reccomend this game, and at the steep price that it comes in at, I would not reccomend it even more.			"

												Clever title worth a few hours of fun, but not eighteen bucks worth.  Overpriced for the amount of content offered.  The prisons tend to be limited in scope.  The challenge lies not in your skill or cleverness, but in the amount of patience you have.  Sometimes you must wait days for an ingredient to become available.  You engage in lots of trial and error, little challenge really.  Pick it up on sale, under ten would be worth it.  Spend the twenty on an older game from a big developer you’ve not played yet.			"

TL/DR REVIEWThis game has a lot of potential for me, but makes great misses on the way that ruin the fun. This game offers a lot of freeding, no hand holding in this game! You are on your own to try and figure your way out. The process for every level/prison is pretty much the same. Get items, avoid guards and then escape. Even though this can get repetitive after a while, there is not set in stone path to escape which gives keeps it interesting. There is some unfairness in this game that ruined it for me though. There is RNG of the item finding, which is not that bad but a little irritating. Most importantly, when you get caught with even a minor offence, the WHOLE MAP will be wiped clean! Had a fist fight with another inmate? Too bad. Now your secret stash of supplies and tools you carefully hid in a vent are gone! GONE! If you are willing to look past this, get the game, it's great (trust me)! But for me, it got stale after a couple hours.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. "

Constantly having to collect RNG items and stuff so that you can build one tool, just to then accidentally punch someone and lose it after 40 minutes of getting the components happens a lot.The game isn't poorly made, its just far too tedious and boring for my taste. The game also doesn't give you anything as help so you basically wander around until you fiugure out what to do. The game just doesn't feel rewarding or fun. :/			"

												Read more negative reviews or watch some gameplay video before buying this game.Mostly a let down, it doesnt simulate anything very well and nothing is explained. I played it to long to get a refund but most of my time on it was not having fun. I might try to continue going to see if it gets better as I learn more but so far it is very lack luster.Although it is claimed that there are lots of ways you co do things almost anything you try will fail due to illogical AIHere are some examples.All gaurds carry various keys but you can't pick pocket them and none of them go to the main gate.If you knock out a gaurd and take a key then run and hide, when he wakes up you will be magically teleported to solitary confinment without them finding you.Stashing contraban in another prisoners cell does not get them in trouble. Also no one can permantly die, you don't have an actual sentence or anything and there is no long term repercussions for good or bad behaivore just a bit a skill drop if you spend the night in solitary,It's hard to explain in text but the game just feels stifling and pointless.There is no shake downs or lock downs. You don't follow inmates in line or get marched around, really its all choas.you can spend the whole day hiding or doing something you not suppose to get caught and then hit a gaurd with a weapon and then just run in circles until your Heat level dies back down. Or just walk right past gaurds and go somewhere you shouldn't be and they just complain a little and do nothing until your heat is at 90% and again you can just run around in a circle and wait for it to die down to 89% and then just go back to where you should be.Nothing makes any sense in the game, like none of it is simulated. i could go on but really I have nothing good to say about this game except that maybe its a challange.Read more negative reviews or watch some gameplay video before buying this game.

												The Escapists is a strategy-simulation game that has you doing the everyday tasks of a prisoner, while having the extra challenge of escaping from prison.There are so many ways to escape from prison. You won't know how you'll be escaping by day 8. There are so many things to think about. I need friends so I can beat up people. I need to workout so I can beat up people. I need to think about intellect. I need to think about everything that could go wrong during the escape and plan ahead for everything. I need to think about how I'll escape.This game is a lot harder than it looks. And challenge isn't a bad thing. It just more of a reward when you actually do it, you really feel acomplished when you escape.And when you've escaped from every prison, there's still the workshop prisons. Yes, you can make your own prisons and share them. That was a really good call.I think The Escapists is worth the $17.99. I give it a 9/10. "

												A pretty cool little game where you find ways to cleverly escape from large prisons, that's pretty much the gist of it really. The graphics are appealing and the music is quite nice, the freedom you get is also very refreshing (For how much freedom you get in prison anyways). However the game itself gets very repetitive in the later prisons with it feeling like your escaping the same prison over and over again with more security and slight gimmicks which really make little difference. It's one of few games where I'd honestly suggest watching a walkthrough of it rather than playing it yourself, since on one hand it's fun to see all the crazy ways to escape, but on the other there were so many moments where I just felt I had spent entire in game days making zero progression. A fun game at first but sadly it's very hard to recommend.			"

												Really good game, a bit difficult for beginners.Pros:- Many different ways of escaping- Big variety of prison types in the workshop to continue playing even after beating the main prisons- Each new prison unlocked introduces a new option to escape- Really thrilling when escaping prisonsCons:- Very difficult for beginners- Tutorial doesn't demonstrate legitimate ways of escape- Some of the DLC packs are very easily escaped (I escaped alcatraz with nothing but 2 keys)- Some prisons take a long time to finishThe Escapists: The Walking Dead is almost the same thing, so I do not recommend buying the walking dead version.

												Loved playing this and I love the choices you can make to escape from starting a riot and tie up every guard till they let you go, to climbing upo through the vents slapping on a guard utfit and just walk out in the middle of the night.Pros:Game made you think about your escape instead of just doingguards are somwhat smart and can ruin your plans with one lookyou feel a bit of satisfaction after each escapeif you actually wait a long time then you can actually leave the prison by doing the timeCons:you can trap yourself in the ventsand undergroundone wrong move and your back at square one rather than getting caught but some of your items are still there.I'll give this game a 8/10 the other 2 was for how angry you can get from failing constantly.

												I realy think this is a great game. i know sometimes when you think you've escaped guards just come and ♥♥♥♥ you in the♥♥♥♥♥ or you forget some items. overall i liked this game a lot. even when i started it. i reccomend to try this AWESOME game yourself. you can maybe wait for a sale and then purchase it, or if you are a rich man you can buy it normaly with no sales. anyway i think thats all... have fun enjoying this great game.Pros: You can hide ALL of your stuff in great places. you can make cool weapons that help a lot with fighting guards or inmates. i LIKE it when you steal a guards outfit and you dont go to solitary (SHU). combining your tools with other tools or ducktape to make amazing new and useful tools to help you escape.Cons: it sucks when you want to dig a hole or wall outside and guard towers just shoot you every time. one of the prisons called: ""Jungle Compound"". Where You Escape And That STUPID jeep ALWAYS gives you a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ trust me i have failed to escape this prison MANY times myself. getting items for your tools can take a LOT of time. i reccomend if you have trouble with finding some items use these tips: 1. Work and get a LOT of money.(or complete tasks)2. fink inmates who are selling♥♥♥♥♥♥3. but those items you need. (or just serch as much desks as you can in your freetime)I hope this helped you with your gaming skills on The Escapists. if you have any questions please comment on this comment. and have a great day!

												Meh, pretty boring. It's a grind game masquarading as a puzzle game.  Also, $17.99 is an outrageous price. There's a trailer where we see the player craft a tool, dig a tunnel, open a vent, lift weights, read a book, and run on a treadmill.  That's about 90% of the content.  Unless you're a six-year-old, you will be tired of it in the first hour.  The trailer is designed to pique your curiosity.  Don't be fooled.EDIT: my girlfriend's little brother has been playing this game on my computer all weekend, and he loves it. He's an eight-year-old.			"

								It's a good game, very hard and interesting, the gaurds are good but they have yet to be improved as of 28/08/14. All that needs to be sorted is the minor details such as being able to plant a eleagle object such as timber in somebodys draw and watch them be punished. The game allows you to do certain tasks but you cannot set tasks for others or interact with the other inmates to possibly escape with another. Hope fully in the future this all will be added but as of right now that's the only down falls to the game and a little more technical things. Great game though amazingly fun to attempt a escape.28/08/14 VOTE YES.			"

												The Escapists is a fun 2D up-down gane about escaping prison (obviously). This game was a huge challenge for me considering that I get angry somewhat easily. It is a game about thinking. Planning out your escape is not easy, for you will be bombarded with obstacles such as, mines, walls, and my least favorite, ROCKS. Getting the basics is simple, friend your cellmates, buy materials, craft, craft, craft, break a wall down, hide the tracks, etc. Guards will get angered and in later prisons, way more easily. About a rough 25% consisted of me being chased by guards and then dying over and over. Yet thats the reason I love this game. Because all of the suffering it puts you through, it worth it to see the ""YOU ESCAPED --------,"" screen. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and is strategic. ;)			"

								The escapists is a really fun prison simulator in where you are a prison inmate and try to plot your escape. The game is in early access and there is only 2 prisons at the moment, but there will be more soon. Theres so much do to in this game and it can take anywhere between 3 minutes and 3 weeks to escape. You can become friends with other inmates, start riots, bash the guards up, steal peoples things, the list goes on. There are also mini quests you can do that can earn you some cash, aswell as buying things from other inmates. All up the escapists is a awesome game and i reccommend it to anyone that enjoys RPGs, Sims, Adventure, Arcade and Strategy style games. 9/10 (for now as its in early beta, in the future it might get a 10/10) Watch my video guide on how to escape in 3 minutes

												Ah, The Escapists. As of right now, there's 2 games (for me) that have the potential to pull me away from Counter-Strike. They are Garry's Mod, and The Escapists.I'll start off by saying that I've never actually escaped from a prison. I'm terrible at this game, but i like exploring the prisons and discovering new items & poop like that. I like beating other prisoners up and stealing things from their desks.I don't want to say too much, because the game isn't finished. Let me just say, it's a very sound investment.9/10			"

												This is certainly an entertaining game with maps that constantly change around. With new additions where users can make their own map and place them on the steam workshop, this provides a real thinking game.With different methods to solve the map you are on, it provides fun and entertainment as you try to build your supplies to escape from the prision without getting caught. If you are into Management/Escape games, this would be an outstanding game for you. 8/10			"

								It's a good game, very hard and interesting, the gaurds are good but they have yet to be improved as of 28/08/14. All that needs to be sorted is the minor details such as being able to plant a eleagle object such as timber in somebodys draw and watch them be punished. The game allows you to do certain tasks but you cannot set tasks for others or interact with the other inmates to possibly escape with another. Hope fully in the future this all will be added but as of right now that's the only down falls to the game and a little more technical things. Great game though amazingly fun to attempt a escape.28/08/14 VOTE YES.			"

												Pure boring... After trying this for a couple of hours, it turned out to be repetitive, boring, not fun at all game. Quests are silly as in ""Go beat officer Supercol for me"" who the f** is ever called Supercol?Inmates will just rush around all the time, fulfilling their ""agenda"", work, exercize, eat, rollcall, sleep... just here and there they will spank each other and an officer will come in to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them and be done with it, leave their bodies there untill they wake up.Its about escaping right, you can buy some items and make some others with it so aid with your escape... and when you fail the attempt, cause you will, you'll just have to get back to the same boredom activies as to spank people, exercize (so you can spank them better FML.....) use computer a bit so you aint tard enough to not know that you can use your blanket and pillow as a dummy... or to be able to make licence plates cause you're a friggin moron that can do it would anyone simply explain to you wich lever to pull... then go do some more cardio so you can spank other inmates even more, all that so you can attempt to escape again, and keep doing so, untill you just know exactly how its done and escape, and CHRIST if you're not already bored to death with this... you're some saint...Oh and before i forget, guards too. You can BEAT THE F%%% OUT OF THEM, and just run for it cause they will do nothing to you for beating a guard... yeah, they will try to spank you back, and if other guards see they will help, but after a couple of hours... you and them will be just having a cigarrete and talk about each other moms like nothing happened.This game is horrible, and the whole idea of the escape wich is what would make this game attractive, simply blows, its plain boring, not worth the damn normal price by far!

Do you hear what I say from under my breath?Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak somewhere in the town.Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak so don't you be around.Tonight there's gonna be trouble.Some of us won't survive.See the boys and me mean business, Bustin' out dead or alive.I can hear the hound dogs on my trail.All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail.Like the game if you lose go to jail.Tonight there's gonna trouble, I'm gonna find myself in.Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak, So woman stay with a friend.Tonight there's gonna be a breakout, Into the city zones.Don't you dare to try and stop us!No one could for long!Searchlight on my trail!Tonight's the night all systems fail!Hey you good lookin' female, Come here!BREAKOUT!

Early Access Review
								The Escapists tests your knowledge on prison life, not even kidding you can use everything down to the plastic cutlery to use in your devilish escape plan.I love this game from all the cool crafting recipes that real escapists have used to free themselves from prison, like a shovel to dig your way to freedom only problem is what do you do with the dirt well I remembered watching The Great Escape and they dropped the dirt out in the yard so this is what I did and eventually dug my way home free. The witty comments and remarks that your fellow inmates and guards make are just too amusing for me not to smile.If you like fast intense mashing to level up your health or constant clicking to get your job quota or even learning that a guard is undergoing psychiatric help all whiles trying to make a break for the fresh air then this is the game for you.I give this 11/10 cookiesI’m also hoping to see a prison based on multiplayer aspects so you could have up to 10 friends in the same prison and you can work together to escape, of course id like to see this in a maximum security prison so that it makes it almost impossible to get keys and contraband around the prison undetected.

												The Escapists.Alright, I have a few things to say about this game... First of all, the graphics are terrible, I know it's just the style of the game but... I don't know :/. This game was popular only for a short time. When I first started playing it, it seemed okay, but got boring REALLY  quickly. The game just seems repetitive for each day... Nothing really unique happens... I just got bored of it, and now looking back, this is a complete waste of money.			"

												An Amazing  Game with prisons and items made from insane events that actually happened for instance the 2nd prison in the game Stalag Flucht is based upon a POW camp in germany that british scientists escaped from during WWII and the prison HMP Irongate is nicknamed ""the rock"" and is actually based on the prison alcatraz surrounded by icy waters. Some of the games items are the raft you can make for the newest prison which although made out of balsa wood instead of the 160 raincoats used to escape Alcatraz is still a referance to the actual escape. You can even put blankets on the bars of your cell like in the Alcatraz escape!!! 10/10 I reccomend this game to anyone who likes things like prison architect or watching the escapes from the actual prisons Such a fun game!

Early Access Review
								I've been wanting to get my hands on this game for ages, and it was only early access that put me off. Unfortunately, too many people let Early Access games off easy because they are 'still in development'. My desire overode my common sense though.This is genuinely a good game at it's heart. Unfortunately, it's pretty poorly implemented. Basically, it's unbalanced. The decay on stats is too quick and the grind to get them is too difficult. It feels like the stat decay and grind is there to make an already difficult game even more difficult. The basic premise of trying to escape prison is great and the crafting and schedule mechanics actually help to make this a really great game. You can seriously spend ages over your escape plan. You can explore and take your time making an escape plan that won't fail, or you can rush through and choose a risky strategy. That is a fantastic idea. Unfortunately, the stat problem I mention earlier is the real hinderance. I don't think I would mind the button mashing if it weren't for how quickly stats decay, if they decayed at a slower pace then you'd wouldn't mind the constant mashing and grinding to get the stats up.The final criticism is that there is no game manual. There's no understanding of how the game works or the more advanced mechanics of the game included in the tutorial. There is a reason that games come with manuals, and if you're selling the game for actual money, there's no excuse not to include one. So buy this game, with the expectation that you'll need to do some Googling to find some information and you'll have to grind to a stupid level in order to raise your stats and keep them raised. It is a good game though. It can be slow paced and relaxed, but it can also be adrenaline fueled madness. It's good fun overall despite is significant negatives.			"

								Amazing game! You have to know what you're doing in order to get out of that prison! It takes time, hard-work, and a heck lot of effort, but man is it worth it in the end when you escape your first prison. Good times. Cri evrytim :D			"

												The Escapists is a prison simulation game. Not for the impatient. The game is an incredible experience, full of new surprises to prevent you from escaping! The guards can be relentless, and sometimes you have to fight them for the keys! But make sure you make a copy of the key and return the original BEFORE he wakes up. The walls are breakable but cover the hole. The game is difficult, and I escaped 3 different prisons. If you are looking for a game that is enjoyable, challenging and a bit funny, buy this game! There are many ways of escaping, from digging under the walls to making copies of all the keys and cutting the fence. You can even steal guard outfits and walk outside at night! I rate this game 9.5/10			"

								The Escapists is probably my favourite game on Steam asides from CS:GO at the moment. It's challenging, with the easiest prison taking me a while to escape; although I imagine it's all about the luck of your items. The recent addition of being able to name your fellow inmates and superiors is quite enjoyable, however I'd like to see the devs take it one step further with being able to write backstories for the prisoners. I have also got two other save files on the most medium prison and the hardest, and I personally feel that if you have a tough time on the easiest prison, you'll have almost no chance escaping the hardest. The Escapists is a lovely, well thought out original game offering hours of fun, frustration and thinking in order to escape confinement.			"

												The Escapists is a fun 2D up-down gane about escaping prison (obviously). This game was a huge challenge for me considering that I get angry somewhat easily. It is a game about thinking. Planning out your escape is not easy, for you will be bombarded with obstacles such as, mines, walls, and my least favorite, ROCKS. Getting the basics is simple, friend your cellmates, buy materials, craft, craft, craft, break a wall down, hide the tracks, etc. Guards will get angered and in later prisons, way more easily. About a rough 25% consisted of me being chased by guards and then dying over and over. Yet thats the reason I love this game. Because all of the suffering it puts you through, it worth it to see the ""YOU ESCAPED --------,"" screen. I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes a good challenge and is strategic. ;)			"

An example of the terrible bugs of this game are this: I work in the Luandry station, and when it transitions to Exercise Period, I leave the station, and I am killed by the guards! Besides the bugs, this game is amazing, and once the bugs are sorted, you should buy it, but as it stands, I would wait. "

You can survive and thrive, mingling with the officers and doing favors for your prisoners, or you can break out of prison on the first night. Either way, gameplay is amazing. Such a cleverly designed game.The thing about this game, though, is that I feel like it's preparing me for something. Some kind of difficult life situation I'll have to break out of.

												So hard yet so fun. You should try if you like strategy games with many options to complete a goal.Would be great if we can play this game multiplayer (some as prisoners and some as guards)			"
