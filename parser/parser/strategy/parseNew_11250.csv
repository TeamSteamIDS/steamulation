												I find the gameplay and interface too clunky. If you are comfortable with the interface of Theatre of War then you will be fine with this game, otherwise just buy Battlestations: Midway/Pacific.			"

												I really don't understand why this game was not more popular when it came out. This game has more unique aspects and additions to what is losely a grand strategy RTS then any game i can think of. It's a dated game, very dated...but it's a risk sized grand strategy map, where you deal with battles on a RTS scale, with very realistic combat, nice graphics and the ability to take personal control of the units. This makes it sort of a grand strategy/RTS/Plane&ShipSim all in one. Seriously...why the hell did i not know about this game earlier?			"

												This gem is one of my all-time favorite games.  It brings me back to PTO II on the NES system.  It can be a little overwhelming for beginners, but once you immerse yourself in the challenge, you won't be able to turn it off.  Grab some redbulls and enjoy.			"
