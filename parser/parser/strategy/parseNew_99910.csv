												Puzzle Pirates is an excellent MMO puzzling game that is past its prime, yet still very playable and a good way to amuse yourself for hours. It is also a game I have played on and off for over 9 years now.You get to be a pirate, and you perform your tasks(Sailing, carpentry, navigation, swordfighting and many more) by playing puzzles. The puzzles done interact with eachother, making it a unique challenge to run a functional ship together with others. While you can play it for the social aspect of puzzling together and having a great pillage among friends, it is equally possible to just puzzle on your own, or to join easily accessible pickup groups('Jobbing') just for the puzzling.Sadly, due to its age it is now unlikely that you'll find a large amount of people - An issue in any social game.With your rewarded or pillaged money you can buy outfits for your pirate, customising your pants, hat, shirt and boots with plenty of different clothing and colour options - As well as allowing you to buy a fancy house, paint it, furnish it, and just have yourself a humble abode, a shack, or a magnificent mansion. The customisation in the game is excellent, with many years of content to keep you busy furnishing, clothing, painting and customising every bit of your pirate, house and if you have the money even your ships.But sadly, you won't be able to do too much with it, as the ingame economy has almost wrecked itself. This game has a very good economy model, with supply and demand, freight trips, and commodities being produced and moved all by players, fashioned into their end products by players, and bought by players. However, to deliver anything but the most basic of goods you need to pay a delivery cost. There are two currencies, Pieces of Eight(PoE), and Dubloons. PoE are the money of the world, you get PoE from your pillaging, from working for the navy, and as payment for labour(Also a puzzle!), and Dubloons, a currency you can only buy with physical money from your own wallets outside of the game.Of course, nothing is ever truly fully free, is it? There are two kinds of servers for Puzzle Pirates. The first is a subscription ocean, where you have to pay a monthly fee to have access to just about anything(But you do get to play and puzzle for free as an unlimited trail), the economy on there is actually pretty decent, but if you aren't subscribed and do not plan to subscribe you will be locked out from a large amount of content. The other is dubloon oceans, where you are free to play - But you need dubloons to deliver anything more fancy than a broken crate and a bedroll, and you need to buy badges with dubloons to unlock content such as anything rank based in your crew(Read: Pirate version of a guild/group), Sea Monster Hunting, and playing some of the puzzles and parlor games(All shipboard working puzzles are always free. On-shore labour and parlor games are free only a few days a week depending on the specific puzzle).Luckily, dubloons can be bought using PoE in a market system, so you can technically get everything without ever paying anything for a dubloon but your ingame currencies. Sadly, this means that you will need to spend -A LOT- to get them. As demand for them is set incredibly high, with almost everything of any note costing you dubloons and a large part of the remaining playerbase being rich their prices have gone up to nearly 4000 PoE. To give that some context, you gain about 20 for an average performance with the NPC navy for one league point, on a trip that lasts 20 or so minutes. At this rate, you have korean MMO levels of grinding just to be able to afford the basics for your pirate, and it is not at all uncommon for an item's cost in PoE to be negligible compared to the dubloon costs. Dubloon costs for everything has sunk the economy for all but a few, but at least the puzzles themselves are enjoyable, even if the MMO part of the game is a mess.As long as you have your expectations right this is not a problem, with well designed puzzles you can surely find ways to enjoy yourselfEdit: I wrote a guide to help you enjoy the game, all the way at the bottomAs you might tell from the economy bit up there, it is not very friendly to newcomers, mostly thanks to the prices becoming impossible. Aside from that though, it is a very friendly game and easy to pick up. Easy controls, easy to learn but difficultt o master puzzles and an appealing artstyle are part of the draws. The population on server is friendly, helpful, and tries their best to enjoy a good game, but without reaching for your wallet it is unlikely that you will ever get far these days - And if you plan to make your own crew you are out of luck as this is one of the most expensive (in dubloons) things one can do. In addition, if you do not buy dubloons or subscribe, you have around 6 weeks since your last login to come back. Else your pirate will be deleted. As amusing as the chatfilter is with pirate-y-fying your swears, and as amusing as the puzzles are, as friendly as the community on server are, and as satisfying it is to build up your home and move somewhere bigger over countless pillages, Puzzle pirates is on a straight track to the cliff of abandonned old games and nobody seems to know if the developer has plans to slow down and save it, or given up hope to just let it fall while hoping to get some final payments out of it for dubloons.If you do join the game, please get on the Emerald Ocean, it's getting lonelier by the dayEdit: A guide to get you started

												First of all, let me state by saying that I used to love this game. About ten years ago or so, I played this daily, was part of a nice crew (Eowyn's crew, in case anyone remembers those days of old), and I puzzled my weekends away. For those days, this MMO was one of the best to play on old computers, there was always tons of stuff to do.Nowadays though, islands and ships are deserted.I always felt that after they introduced Poker, the game just got worse. You had some people winning millions with poker and if you went on a Sea Monster Hunt for hours in a row, you would be lucky to get 5K and a few nice items (that were probably old...)I really enjoyed the puzzles though. I was amazing at Carpenting, pretty decent at Bilging and Sailing too. I sucked at Navigating though and never got more than a ""good"" on that puzzle. To me it just feels like the economy of the game has been completely messed up after Poker was introduced, and I'm not surprised that hardly anyone is playing this anymore. It was a GREAT game though. If I had a dozen friends who would play with me, I might go and try again, so that we could fill up a sloop and plunder. But on your own, it's hard to find a good crew. *sighs* I am sad, cause I used to love puzzling in this game, but it just feels like a big waste of time nowadays.			"

												One of the most dynamic games I've ever played - Shoot a fellow pirate's ship and you could start a war, start an ironmonger, and the cannonballs you make could end up blowing holes in your ship. Lose at poker, and that money could go towards your enemy's funds for blockading your island. Everything you do can (and will) have an impact on the world. There's a real sense of achievement when you continue the game - you start as a pirate with a bandana, a few clothes, a flimsy foil sword, and you can end up the ruler of an island in a month. There's no real skill level grinding, due to the rating system that rewards natural puzzling skill. The game is fuelled by it's vibrant system of crews and flags, supported by the sense of close community - after all, you can't sail a big ship on your own. The economy is fairly deep, and it is nearly entirely ran by the people who play the game. Need some sugar cane for your distillery? Order it from an island and ship it in, or wait for someone to do it for you.The game is filled with colour, and the cartoon design adds a nice friendly touch, the games are addictive and fairly plentiful. The range of things you can do as a pirate is massive once you get in to it. A really fun and addictive game. :)			"

												this game is pretty damn fun you can get your own crew and/or shoppe and even conquer islands and things like that.It looks very childish, but it's all about them booty. I once owned a blacksmith and got mad booty.Also, everything in this game is done with minigames. Brawling is bubble shooter, swordfighting some kind of variation on tetris, but oh man, everything is so fun. Gotta get some friends though.			"

												Here are a few pro's and con's followed by a short story of what I have encountered having played over 10 years.Pro's-Fun puzzles-Well designed game-Lots of things to do-Many ways to customize your pirate-You get to be a effin pirate-Just fun gameplay in general-VERY addictiveCon's                                              I-Pretty much abandoned due to  \/-In-Game economy ruined by poker-Very expensive in game currency -People are being banned for no reason (under the cause ""ban evasion"")-FULL of people using bots. Since stats are important for Crew positions this kinda ruins the game...-Unlawful Activity... At least I think so, Read the story.At one point in time I would recommend this game. It WAS amazing, life controlling, full of life... Now its abandoned.Ive spoken to several 10+ year players, We talked about days where the game was playable for days on end. The battles we fought with thousands of players involved. How epic some of the player were. How the chat at the inns were so alive you could barely get a word in. Yea, the ""good ol' days"". Then we talked about how disappointed we are about where the game is now. How the islands and ships are abandoned. How the only players online are in a trance at a poker table. Staff are banning people for no reason and saying ""ban evasion"". Stats arent earned, they are botted. I put alot into this review because of how much I actually played. How much I loved this game. And how disappointed I really am.I am banned from the game. I played over 10 years ago, When I was very young, And I got banned. I created a new account (10 Years later I stress). Only to play with my younger cousins who I introduced to the game recently. I have moved away, I own a new computer, New internet. The whole 9 yards. To any other game I am a new person completely. Never before seen. Puzzle Pirates SOMEHOW found out that I was banned 10 YEARS AGO. And banned me for ""ban evasion"" Even knew my old username... FROM 10 YEARS AGO!!! I honestly think they are using un-lawful methods to track down """"Ban Evaders"""". There are no ways to trace me back, No credit cards, No steam accounts, No emails, No IP Address, NOTHING.Do not spend money on the game, Not worth it. If you want to play for the puzzles go ahead. If you want to become rich, or play for community, or for fun. Dont. I hope this was useful. Or entertaining.  "

												Puzzle Pirates ReviewThe world of Puzzle Pirates is what you'd expect from a pirate-themed game. Clipper ships and war brigs sail the seas, crewed by all manner of scalawags and sailors. Islands populate the landscape, inhabited by numerous seafaring folk. Like most any MMO, the populace of Puzzle Pirates has to earn its keep by performing assorted labor tasks, like being part of the crew on a ship or taking on assorted tasks for businesses while on land. However, you don't run around killing monsters or collecting rare items like you would in most any MMORPG. Instead, you perform your work via puzzles, and each one is uniquely tailored to the task you're charged with.For instance, when on land, you can opt to take a job with an apothecary, a distiller, or a shipwright, among others. If you choose the apothecary, you'll see several orders for potions and concoctions that have been placed by actual players in the community. The puzzle itself revolves around rotating a number of pipes leading from colored jars at the top of the screen to a position where they'll pour out into color-coded vials at the bottom. You can create combos to up your rank, but if you screw up, you'll break your jar. Even though you can just play the puzzle as it is without even worrying about the available orders, you'll earn more money and a higher rank by filling the orders. Every task is just like this, featuring a unique type of puzzle that fits the type of work you're doing, and essentially providing you with a way to perpetuate the economy. You earn money for your work; you help a local business fill its orders; and you help other players get the items they want.From a technical standpoint, Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates is just about the easiest thing in the world to boot up and play. The game starts up instantly and quits out just as easily. It runs on basically any machine, from a high-end PC to a Mac to even a Linux box. Granted, this is because this is just a Java client that doesn't take up more than a hundred megabytes on your hard drive. Make no mistake; Puzzle Pirates isn't bad looking at all. The puzzles all have a nice look to them, and you'll see an appreciably precious art style while you're wandering around a ship or island. Because of the game's visual limitations, you won't find anything especially impressive. However, the visuals are just fine for what they need to be here.Overall a nice little game and is also free so there is no reason not to try it.			"

All i can say is that I wouldn't be in a great a place I am now.			"

												This game sure is unique. A MMO game where just about every task you do is a puzzle game. Of course being a game about pirates, there are plenty PvP puzzles as well. Don't let the cartoon-like graphics fool you, it really isn't a game just for kids. But speaking of the graphics, there are quite dated... But that's understandable with the game being so old. All things considered I think the game is worth a shot. Especially if you enjoy puzzle games. Afterall, it's free. There are micropayments but noone is forcing you to spend real money on this game.

												If you are looking for a game that kills time and meet great people, this is the game you should try.All puzzles are unique and are challenging/fun, i have MUCH more hours on this game off steam, ive played it twice in the past and it is still a great game with a strong economy.You can play puzzles that help out during pillages that include Bilging, Carpentry, Sailing, Rigging, Navagation (or Battle Navagation),Gunning (CAUTION: Really hard to get used too), and the new PatchingThere are puzzles outside the sea, Crafting skills include: Blacksmithing (My Fav puzzle!), Tailoring, Distillery, Shipyard, Alchemy and more!Also during pillages you may find treasure islands which contain the Foraging Puzzle, depending on what island it is you can forage for treasure or forage for Gems, you can also find sunken ships which contain the Treasure Haul Puzzle, the more you haul the better the loot.Also Some awesome PvP Puzzles like: Swordfighting and Rumble (Combat Puzzles); Poker, Spades and hearts (Usual Card Games); and some funny puzzles like Coin Drop or Drinking Game, all of these can be found at all TavernsThe community on this game right now is really friendly, Crews are a great way to interact with other people if you manage to find/make a good crew, though there are some unfriendly players. they are rare to see around.There is ALOT more to this game then you might think, i say give it a try and see what puzzle you may be great at!

												I started Puzzle Pirates around 2005-2006. At the time, sloops were around 20-25k and dubs were around 500-1k. The game had a flourishing community and I happened to live on Aim Island where the population kept growing. Through many battles, explorations, flotilla attacks, and puzzles..I was having a blast. Things back then were very affordable and if you were good at SF, Rumble, Hearts, Spades, or TD, you could easily make enough to buy a manor and a boat. A lot of expansions happened between now and then. LE Boats were a lot of fun to own, I enjoyed the continued competitions, I liked collecting gold box items, and I really got into SMH and CI/CIT'S. A fatal problem occured, however, when Poker was released. The economy was a spiral that nothing or no one could stop. At first, it didn't really effect things too drastically. Dubs had gotten to an all time high of 2k but it was overlooked. Months and years went by as the community decayed and the pirates I knew for years quit. Things became too expensive and I knew I had to do the same. What was once an innocent and engaging game became a festival for botting and gambling. Of all the years invested in this game, I will miss those were apart of my pirate story. Though the puzzles are still fun today, the game itself is a rotted corpse of what used to be an actual experience. Do not play it.			"

												I've dedicated 8+ years to this game and I regret nothing! This game if played correctly becomes a way of life, you get to earn your place in a community of pirates and work your way to the top to reap in riches and rewards. It's based around a series of mini puzzles which contributes to your surroundings in ways like enabling your ship to sail or fixing damage. You can PVP other players or head to the inn to do some casual gambling, join a crew and make friends.. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone and highly suggest everyone give it a good hard go. The more time you put into understanding it the more you understand the simple-yet-intricate mechanics of the game and the more fun you can have!			"

												This is probably one of the best games i'll ever play, and it is extremely unique and the community is absolutely amazing. There is no game like it, and the people in the game will give you the shirt off their back which is rare in online games nowadays. I usually don't play the game through steam and have played for 6+ years, unfortunately the days of this game are numbered.The game is abandoned and being bled for money, the only updates are those which contain items they sell for real life $. Outside of draining the game for money, there's no communication or hope for the game. Unfortunately it's your average story of an amazing game concept going to waste by an awful team behind the game. Unless the game gets sold off and a team that actually cares about the game steps up, the game is dead. Player base has dropped by 500%, communication has ended, and they're really just bleeding the games for money. Really a shame considering how much people loved and backed this game.			"

												Great Game overall, I totally recommend it.One of the few unique pirates MMOs out there where everthing is a small challenging puzzle. You may find it hrad a little when you start but, it gonna be so easy with some practice. The cosmetic part of the game is just amazing, with so many outfits that you can have and houses that you can furnish as you wish. Also, the pets in this game ,ahh, thats my favorite feature so far along with the fact that you can play card games like poker in the game.Now, like any game there is a negative part. I realy wanted to hate this game but I couldn't. why hating it?well, I got a permanent ban just like more than 70% of those who played the game. yes I said 70 because there are just too many players who can not play anymore for unfair reasons which in return made the game community so small comparing to what it was 8-10 yeas ago. However, the reason i got the ban for is ban evasion so, for those who are new to the game, never ever log-in from a PC thats not yours and you should be safe.Finally, I noticed some people talking about the game as a P2P or P2W game. well, I spent more than 300$ and I'd say that yes it will make the process faster and buy you some time if you buy doubloons; Other than that it would not change anything if you don't pay.NOTE: I did not cover everything that this game features like the face that you can have your own ship and sail with your friends. I'll just leave it to you to try the game out and enjoy the content.			"

It's a fun and enjoyable game for the whole family to play. The people you meet in puzzle pirates become your family and close friends. I haven't played the last 2 years only, but it's a game that I can easily kill time and get carried away for hours. Probably needs some updating, but overall good game :D			"

												I have 500+ hours of Puzzle Pirates played outside of Steam, and every single one has been well spent. It's an engaging puzzle game with a pirate theme, but it is also so much more than that. The game world and economy is largely driven by the players, and there is a huge metagame with crews, alliances, royalty and other social structures if you get tired of just puzzling. Eventually you can buy your own ship to go pillage with, form your crew with other captains under your command or even gain control over an entire island with an alliance. It's free, so try it out!

												I've played this off and on for ten or so years and enjoyed the game whenever I decide to pick this game up randomly. I found this more of a time waster, but I have to appreciate the game throughout the years. If you plan to pick up this game and randomly play for fun, it'll be a fun experience for sure, especially if you meet up with people on this game. (You'll be surprised of how many adults play this game.) There hasn't been a real disappointment for me, except for restarting because I lost my account information.If you plan to pick up this game as serious play, then you'll be disappointed because there are tons of islands, resources, and places that are outdated and needs to be refreshed. This game has only been patched for various updaes, but never had any real work under the hood, because I still remember people's houses, shops, and various things still existing several years down the road and they're abandoned now. Also, be careful of gambling tables--you'll develop a love-hate relationship with it.			"

												Oh, this is such a good game. I played it for hours and hours with a few friends about five years ago. I decided to hop on this week for the first time in a long time. It's still a wonderful game with so many good puzzles and fun to be had in multiple ways. But there's next to nobody playing. It's really upsetting to be honest. Understandable - it's an eleven year old game now. But there are so many fewer ships running compared to the old days.Still give it a go, there are people playing it - but the heyday has passed.			"

												Despite being a very old game and dramatically past it's shining prime almost two years ago, this game remains a part of my life. The game can be for anyone of any age if you simply enjoy doing puzzles, and being social at the same time. Sure the game is out dated in terms of graphics and functionality, but it still has it's own unique features and functions that make it a great game still. Other than that if you like the gamble (Poe, etc.) then you can wager in puzzles, or even Texas Hold'em style Poker. There is also a very dim but noticeable political system still for the flags (and crews) that own, run, or are allied to flags that have islands. Played this game for the first time when I was like 14 years old, probably younger.			"

												It's quite an addictive little MMO... I downloaded it on Friday night, played it for most of Saturday and a fair portion of Sunday... now I'm about to go back on for the start of my bank holiday Monday. It's first and foremost a roleplay game, where you have a character. You can get to all of the features without paying any cash if you're sensible and patient, which suits those of us in austerity-stricken Britain.All of the tasks in the game are represented by addictive little minigame puzzles - so when you want to repair your ship, it's a fill-in-the-holes puzzle, when you're in a sword fight it's a ""send things to your opponent's board"" Tetris-type game... all the puzzles are imaginative and varied, keeping the pirate theme quite well.My one complaint is the screen resolution. It runs in 800x600 and always in a window, with no scaling options. On a 1680x1050 monitor, that makes it pretty small. Even if the game's native resolution stayed the same, a little upscaling algorithm and full-screen option would be awesome.			"

												It's a great game if you like puzzling. However as it stands without throwing money at it it's hard\time consuming to actually make some Poe (Ing currency) And you'll find yourself struggling to buy badges to do something other than just the normal pillages. I mostly use it to simply play some Poker. The inflation of the paid currency (which you need to unlock certain activities within the game) is also a downside. Back in the day 1 Doubloon (Paid currency) could be bought by 1K poe. Right now it's over 3k. Which makes it even harder for new or returning players. So unfortunately I would not recomend this game to others. Unless you're a puzzle and pirate enthusiast I'd say don't even bother trying. If you are however, come right in and join the comunity.			"

Then the company started getting ran by the Ocean Masters because three rings couldn't afford it and it went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ My boyfriend got banned for botting when he had all new stats on his account so there was no possible way he could have. I used another account because I forgot my old account and I got accused for real world trade. We emailed the staff of this game about the bans and they provided no reasoning or proof, just simply said it is the rules and linked the rules and perma banned. It's like they want this game to die. People are getting banned left and right for no reason and the community is basically dead so don't waste your time and do not play this game.			"

												While this game is not as well populated as it used to be, do not let this discourage you.This is a pirate mmo where pretty much everything is driven by different puzzles. It's extremely complex and has great depth, and the more you play the further down the rabbit hole you go and the more things you discover. The attention to detail in the amount of game mechanics this game has is astounding.The community is very friendly and helpful, and the majority of the people still playing are in their respective clans. Joining one of these crews lets you get into the game faster, as you can pretty much always depend on help from your crew mates when you can't find documentation online. Just make sure you ask them what time zone they're in to make sure you get the most out of your playtime.There are two types of ""oceans"" (servers). They're both free to play, with the difference being that subscriber oceans require you to subscribe for an amount of time to unlock all activities, while dubloon oceans allow you to buy into those activities you want. It's a matter of taste mainly, but I prefer subscriber oceans since you can sub for a week as the least amount and get access to all content.All in all, this is a game that I just keep coming back to.Keep yer deadlights open fer me on the high seas, matey.

												This game is a hit or miss thing. It's a puzzler, entirely. Each puzzle is unique to each one, even though they do share elements. Something like bilging is for your match 3 type of people. Something like patching is more for people who like mazes. Being f2p in the game isn't bad once you get going, and if you're really good at the puzzles, you will easily be able to advance through the game at a relative pace. The community is still pretty lively, albeit the number of voyages available have dwindled since I first ever played this game. Over all, there's a number of good things, but a few quirks in the game.Pros:*Technically not P2W. You can get different things, but only being good at puzzles will make you win*Music is good when it's there*Puzzles are diverse*Crews work nicely if you can find an active one*Learning how to do the puzzles better is very rewarding*There's not really much wrong with the game, if you find it enjoyableCons:*Music isn't always there*Advancing can seem slow if you aren't very good at puzzles*It's a time sink*Only the Emerald Ocean is all that lively.Conclusion: Definitely a yes for people who like puzzlers.

												Pluses:- atmosphere- variety of puzzels- music- graphics- wide map- lots of achievement's, trophys, customizable items- you can own pets! Multiple!Minuses:- a fee in Doubloons for most of items you can buy (see the last paragraph)At first I installed it for the puzzles. When I first opened the game, I couldn't stop myself from whistling along to the intro music. And then it was only better.The atmosphere of the game is admirable. The music and sounds are nice and not distracting, graphics are nice to watch. The world is wide and there's plenty to do - you can sail on different kinds of voyages, run a workshop, take care of your house. Things are generally cutomizable, starting at your clothes and ending at your ship, when you earn enough for one. The variety of puzzels is wide enough not to get bored. Your character is constantly developing and you can see the progress as your reputation and trophy board grow. And last but not least, people. There are gamers of all ages and from all corners of the world, so for kid's sake there are some manners enforced, but not to the point where it could destroy the ""piratness"" of the atmosphere. Players are generally helpful, newbies can ask any question and get a solid answer.The only minus are doubloons. In game you earn Pieces of Eight which are used to buy things. Problem is that you also have to pay a fee in doubloons, which is usually 3-4 times higher than the prize of an item itself. You can exchange PoE for them, but the course is really high - about 3000:1, when on an average pillying you earn a bit less than that. Or... you can buy them for green cash. So if you decide to start the game, be prepared that either you'll pay, or spend the first week of playing on earning for a decent bed. Despite that, you can still play quite freely if you're just there for the puzzels and sailing.			"

YPP has a an awful habit of punishing the wrong people.  I have played this game since the beggining but I think this game is done.  There is not enough people playing this game anymore for you to find someone to do something with without some serious waiting and the way the staff administers the game is largely at fault.			"

												Save your time and don't play this dead game. This game is not what it used to be. The 400 active players in the game are all either very rich poker players, botters or their alts. You will never get rich in the game the traditional way. You won't even come close to 200k, the pokerbuy-in that everyone has an endless supply of.  It only revolves around poker and buying familiars worth millions. This game used to be good, but now its a poker game.			"

												Puzzle Pirates has been one of the best free games that I have ever played on steam. It may seem like a kids game with the graphics and such, but it is reach in depth and detail. You can do anything from owning your own home to working an hourly job to pay for upgrades. Joining a crew and building relationships with other people is a big benefit to this game. Everyone works together to reach their goals on the vessel which is accumulating as much loot as possible on a single voyage. Your personal ability benefits all the other players around you so you really do have to work together and can easily become an asset to other pirates and captains. All of the puzzles are challenging and provide hours of gameplay. The best part for me is that it has steam achievements which is awesome for a free game. I recommend this game to everyone who loves puzzle games and pirates.			"

												This is one of those F2P games that I keep on coming back to - and often find new content - the puzzles are fairly straightforward, but that does not mean that they are boring. On one hand if you're not feeling adventurous you can complete the puzzles mediocrely and your crew will get by just fine, however if you're in the mood for showing off - or if your ship is being attacked by ravenous pirates - the puzzles have a rating system based on how quickly you solve them and also how many points you aquire.The only let down is that a lot of the content is locked unless you put some money into it, however it is possible to buy these things with in-game currency.I would definitely recommend this game even if it was not F2P.

Yes, it did lose a lot of its player base, but still, you can find people playing, regardless of when you join. Community is pretty helpful, the economy is still running, islands are still being blockaded... If you wanna spend some time relaxing and doing puzzles, this is the game for you.			"

												The only MMO that doesn't make me claw out my eyeballs, Puzzle Pirates is a game where you accomplish piratical tasks (sailing, brawling, shipwrightery, alchemy) by playing a wide variety of puzzle games. Most tasks and items/rewards are determined entirely by puzzling skill. Expect to see nautical versions of Dr Mario, Puzzle Fighter, Bejeweled, Bust-A-Move, and more.Even in short bursts of playing time, it's rewarding and fun.Be sure to check out http://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/ for beginning tutorials, puzzle dissection, and comprehensive game information.

												I have come across many games in my time, and Three Rings Design's ""Yohoho: Puzzle Pirates"" is one of the bes- no, THE best game I have ever encountered.This fantastic, free to play MMO comes with the highest quality graphics, pumping ""Pirate-styled"" music to keep you're mind running (that definatly does not play too loud or get annoying), and of corse, not to mention the wide range of puzzles that a Captain needs to sail his ship and bring in the booty!Your first launch of each server allows you to create three different pirates. Choose from a fantastic seletion of hairstyle, shirts, pants and gender. The wide range of colour for each piece of clothing can really make your pirate stand out and become unique from others. Recomendding this game to people who do not own it will allow you to recieve a complimentary hat!Overall, fantastic game, awesome graphics, amazing audio.I give this a ""Prikle approved"", 10/10 stars.A tip of the hat to Three Rings Design. Bravo.			"

												I have played a great number of MMO's, ranging from First person shooters to RPGS and one game stands out amongst them all.Puzzle PiratesThis is an incredibly well-made game, with a surprising amount of depth in it. The entire game is ran by players, from the economy (you can own your own shop, from blacksmiths building swords and cannonballs to shipyards building ships) to the politics and warfare. Various player- ran crews can form a flag, wage war on another flag, and even blockade an island in hopes of capturing it for the flag.But if you have no desire to get in to all that, there is really no need to! (Aside from the fame and wealth) Casual players alike can hop on, do a few fun puzzles (There are competitive puzzles from sword fighting another player, to loading cannonballs as the ships gunner, to navigating a ship in a tense sea battle) and make some loot. Money (Pieces of Eight or POE) can be spent on anything you like, from fancy clothes, ships, pets, houses, swords etc.I can't reccomend this game enough if you have an interest in MMO's, Pirates, or Puzzles.

												Your enjoyment of this game largely depends on your patience. When you pick an ocean (server) there are 2 distinct types, subscription and dubloon. Each has their pros and cons. Subscription oceans limit you from doing quite a bit in the game if you are unsubcribed. But when you subscribe, you cannot really buy your way through the game. Dubloon oceans allow you play completely for free unless you want to buy dubloons for real money. Dubloons can also be bought through in-game currency, so if you have the patience, you can play the whole game for free.			"

												Update Review: 'The little dinghy that could' should define this game. Is it in its prime? No. Does the player count immerse you in dangerous seas? No. But for a game that launched in 2003, do you expect it to? I hope not. The boat still sails and this game is still alive. You can still enjoy the fun puzzles and get on a ship to enjoy the core game. It might take awhile to get the bigger ships filled depending on the time of day, literally needing dozens of people at times. But the navy ships are auto pilot by AI and can teach you the puzzles whenever, so don't fear testing the game out. The updates (monthly uniques and events) still rollout like clockwork, quite literally clockwork actually, so don't think the game never gets new things added either!I said it at the end of my original review, which I am leaving below, and I will say it again here because it is a good point to be made:It's a free to play game, why not at least try it?**Original Review**Ignore the 'hours played' displayed, I have been playing this game off and on for eight years. I don't know when it came to Steam but I always forget to load it through here when I decide to play. Hence the little time Steam thinks I've put into this game. I won't claim to play too much recently, but it is still a game I can come back to and pick up in no time and enjoy myself.For most purposes it is still the same game it was when I started, some massive overhauls to features and many new minigame additions have occured but it is still the same base game. Think of Puzzle Pirates as a game full of minigames where sailing a ship is a compilation of various stations with different games each with different goals (get it, PUZZLE Pirates). There are easy to learn minigames that you can enter the game and pick up quickly but enough intricate details and strategies in each and some harder minigames to master to strive to be the best on the Ocean. There are some competitive 'PvP' (not to kill but you can bet money) minigames for direct competition steaming from a simple swordfight to a ship battle with cannons ending in a sword fight or rumble minigame (note the minigame word you will not run at another pirate with a sword or your fists).There is a quirk, as with any able to be free to play game, to encourage spending real money to make things in game easier to obtain. These are not neccessary to buy by any means and can be obtained in game for in game money, though it takes work and it based on the player market. The game is fully playable and enjoyable without spending any real life money and (I believe) every item can be obtained in game without having to spend real money.Eight years later and I still enjoy this game, I only sporadically play it because it's hard not to play for hours once you start. I can go on about this game and do a full review but who wants to read that? It's a free to play game, why not at least try it?			"

												Okay, on first glance, this games looks like a kids game. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are pretty colorful and childish, but it makes it up with gameplay. This games has one of the best MMO mechanics in the industry; you, the player, get to own ships, shoppes, and even islands (if you're rich enough). The direction of the economy is at the finger tips of merchants or pirates -- you choose.The infusion of puzzles with the jobs on the sea makes for a great time if you join a random crew or sail with your friends. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a pirates life (and puzzles).Another great thing about the games is that it's cross-platform with Android and iOS.			"

												Sure this game looks bad, it may not have the best graphics, or even guns. However, this game is not played for these stupid reasons; Puzzle Pirates is a game where you live the life of a pirate, doing sea monster huting, pillaging NPCs or even other players, attacking flotillas, blockading islands so your 'flag' (nation) can take islands for themselves. All of these activities are done through puzzles that are easy to learn, but hard to master. There is a huge economy in this game where shoppes require materials to produce anything from rum to furniture for your own home; these materials are provided by foraging on remote islands, pillaging other ships for the materials required and then moving these goods across the sea and many archipelagos, all in the name of pieces of eight. This game is the best pirate game I've ever played, maybe not the best puzzle game because I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥at puzzles but that's not the point. Once you get into this game you will be hooked.			"

												Before the days of standard F2P there was this little game. It was java based. I played this game in 2005 til about 06. It was one of those I used to take away from WoW(Back then things were much different). I'd puzzle and hang out with people. Got a girlfriend to play it, broke up with her. Faced her crew in a blockade and sunk her ship. All to say this, the game WAS fun. However, it should have sank a long time ago. The subscriber oceans(Business model much like the current Sub games) is dead. There were 2 and they were well populated, now they are 1 and the last tally I did had 70 players on it... that's 1.2 islands to each player.The dubloon oceans(The F2P counterparts) are still active but pulling in 1/5th the numbers they used too. And most of those are people searching for people who used to play the game and finding no one. This Jolly Roger should be retired. It's sailed more than it's fair share of lasts.			"

												The game features are usually locked behind some kind of paywall. That said, you can still do some of the basics without paying. But BE WARNED: the company requires you to pay money to them or have your account deleted after 6 weeks of inactivity, no matter how many ships and items you have on your character. I paid and was still deleted, lost an entire clan and ships.Overall, I can't recommend this game for the following reasons:- Account uncertainty- The need more microtransactions- The pure repetitious gameplay- Questionable communityThe first is explained above. The issue with microtransactions is that they are around every corner. Some things can be purchased with in-game currency but not much and the amount of grind to just get a ""badge"" for 30 days saying you can play a feature in the game is ridiculous. Which leads into my next point: repetition. In order to get anywhere you need to up your skills, which in turn means you are playing the exact same tetris puzzle over and over and over again. It's so mind numbing it actually starts to become physically painful. You get the idea.Finally we have the community. If the repetition and wallet-poking don't run you off, you might be ok with the community. The players in game are an odd mix, comprised of the following demographics:a) Those that will talk to you and try to recruit youb) Those that ignore chat or are too stupid to use itc) Trollsd) Jerks and all-around unreliable people who take up a slot on your crew and then disappearI'm sorry guys, I love pirate games and sandbox games but this isn't worth the trouble. It's garbage for many reasons. I don't even know why I bothered writing a review for it, you can easily install it and find out for yourselves. Good luck.			"

												I used to play this game back in the day when I was younger and now I'm back playing it again. I don't think I was into it much when I was younger as I was too busy being addicted to RuneScape (haha don't laugh, :P it was pretty immersive!) but now I find myself getting addicted to Puzzle Pirates lol. :S There are a variety of puzzles to play and the game play is pretty good as well as the graphics and overall theme of Puzzle Pirates (pirates are awesome y'all), so I think it's easy to find yourself immersed. This then leads to looking at the time going ""Wha-? I didn't think I was playing for that long???"" which I think if you're trying to analyse whether a game is worthy, shows that it obviously is! "

												This game. This game is hard to explain. It is a game where they took the long and forgotten game Pirates Of The Carribean Online, and combined it with the Popcap game Bejeweled. It is rated 13+ which makes NO sense cosidering there is only minor alcohol reffrences. The gameplay is nice. You can go on a huge voyage at the start of the game and get all the gold you'll ever need. There are tons of islands and puzzles and, Oh no! I see a bunch of premium advertisments! NO! Well, uh, anyways, so you can also get different swords for puzzle battles and different pets and you can buy crap for your house. This game is I'd say maybe, 7.7/10. I remember playing this when it first came out. It's changed alot since then but, It's still decent.			"

												ARGH! I warn everyone about this game! The more you try to get involved, the higher ranks you reach, the more it becomes your prison! The game itself is awesome with smart puzzles for various pirate duties, but... Be very careful if you play this. I used to play too and I got in serious trouble. If you want to lead your own pillages, navigate in sea battles and such, you need to become an officer, but there's where your trouble begins: going for a pillage requires a very long time usually and you can't leave your ship in the middle really, very bad idea. Then there's the whole political part: responsibility for the crew, having to come online regularily and do pillages so your crew can earn money with you. Voting on issues, later perhaps running your own businesses to help you gather necessary supplies or make money: this requires following the constantly changing prices, often trade missions to transport resources between islands... WAY TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES. You'll go insane.			"

												You'll like Puzzle Pirates If you enjoyed '90s puzzle games like Puzzle Fighter, Dr. Mario, Bust-A-Move or Yoshi's Cookie.  The focus is purely on skill, and not how long you've been playing, what gear drops you've found or how much money you've poured into the game.When they say ""free to play"", they mean it; you can easily scrape up the currency you need to afford the badges that unlock additional content.  The community is wonderfully laid-back and helpful, and the visual style is unique.  My only real complaint is that the client is a resource hog, especially for a game originally released in 2003.

												Best expearience of my life. Imagine Les Mis x10. This game makes you cry, scream, and shout. You just want to let it all out. This game is the best thing you will ever see in your life. If you haven't downloaded this game then you need to put down that hot pocket and give this game a look. ""10/10 Like Skyrim with guns"".			"

												Doubloon exchanges just to pick up clothing. Doubloon costs to buy labor, seamonster, and every other badge, which last a finite number of days. If you want a mobile cash-grabbing game that you can play on your computer, this is it. It's really sad, too, because other than the pretty blatant money-sinking, its a cute game.			"

												Literally the best game I've ever played. Pls release for Xbox One and PS4 too.I just bought the new Call of Duty (AW) and this game has still taken up most of my time. The distilling mini game is the epitome of human progress thus far. Who needs 3D graphics, DirectX 11, or any of that stuff. I literally sold my GTX 660 ($200) because this game doesn't need it. I actually installed Windows 95 because it runs perfectly on it. I almost get 144fps on it, but I needed to turn the textures down.Literally my life.			"

												This game has always been one of my favorites, started about 7 years ago and ive played it on and off for quite some time. Sadly though this game isnt as popular as it used to be. There are still a ton of things to do but not as much as it used to be. Used to i would sail with some pretty enormous ships on blockades and now there are only a few that do them. You could always meet some pretty cool people too on there just hanging around the outside of the Inn or town center but now you are lucky if you see the occasional person walking by. Dont get me wrong its still a fun puzzle game but its just becoming less popular :/			"

												Puzzle Pirates is a free to play game released in 2003.  It worked, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Graphics Theme Looks childish.  The Puzzles this game has are clones of all the puzzle games out there.  There is gambling in game also.  Try it, if you like and good at puzzle games.For more info:

Yes he did, did the oceanmasters accept? no they didn't they were too lazy to, my friend wasted so much time on that useless game and later regretted he played it, he was permamently banned ofcourse and the worst Oceanmaster of Puzzle Pirates is...

												Puzzle Pirates has been a longrunning game which has almost been around for a decade from what I recall, either way.Puzzle Pirates is a game orienting on the exploration of a virtual sea world in which you will plunder, hunt (and potentially bet thousands if you're a poker player). Last time I had played this game was in 2009 and it is still familiar to me with barely any extreme changes that would put me off, the game itself is nowhere near Pay-2-Play and is entirely F2P as the economy relies on people who pay into the game. Gameplay itself is quite simple and revolves around minigames to either gain money, prowess or for fun.Either way I recommend this to anyone who is wanting to play a simple F2P game and you have time aside to get accustomed to the game.

												Stay away from this game.I have more than 220 hours in past 2 years. Played, enjoyed and payed money. Ended up getting ban with no reason. It says i'm botting. I didn't use any third party program or anything. Contacted support, they sent an automatic message and no other response.No wonder why this game died. People get ban easily if they accuse you falsely with something and there is nothing you can do about it. There is no support you can talk with.			"

												The good stuff I like: - if you do manage somehow to get some in game currency, customising your character, decorating your house, ship and if privileged enough your island can be fun. - Running a shop can be fun and a tidy profit if you have good business sense but be prepared to be committed as you will be charged island tax and your shop and all items closed and removed if your tax is left unpaid over time- The puzzles can be fun provided you're allowed by the captain to do one you like- Most of the community players are friendly and awesome, if small (I'm still friends with a bunch of them.)The reasons I don't recommend this: - There's not enough players on subscriber oceans to make paying subscription worthwhile- dubloon oceans will have you working your knuckles off or paying out real money if you want to buy anything or do anything besides basic puzzles (and the stuff you do buy does eventually decay to dust!)- You usually can't choose what puzzles you want to do on a ship, you're assigned by the ship's captain.- Your status page stats are compared to everyone else and their alt and do not reflect your actual abilities which ships rely on and you're judged on this by anyone recruiting you for a job offer- You're pretty much forced into social co-operation as you can't profit from solo play, or if you do its so pitiful its not worth your time. Based on this, its a bad idea to buy a ship; which is kind of sad because anyone who plays this dreams of having their own ship!- If you do run a ship, you have to be good at typing commands quickly - some of the time other players cost you supplies/money because they stand on your ship doing nothing or leave during a battle with another ship- Joining a job could be a waste of time if the captain messes up with battle navigation- Loads of items which are no longer obtainable - this is a pet peeve of mine, its like being punished for being new to a game!

												The puzzles in this game are fun, but you have to pay to do basically anything, and then everything expires. Buying something for a game that you are only going to play for a few hours maybe once or twice a week,but it is going to expire in two weeks...very stupid. Experence also expires. I really wish they would just get rid of everything that expires and then only made me pay for stuff once...until then not worth the money. All puzzles can be played for free across the internet. All things that make this game unique and interesting, require money.			"

												Pretty dull, and the animations/sound effects are crap, which kills a game like this. Minigames are basically just poor man's versions of of Columns, Puzzle League, Bust-a-Move etc. The interface is confusing and cluttered. Maybe in the grander scheme of things the game picks up, but if you want to match blocks and gain numbers, there are much better puzzle games out there. Probably ones about pirates too.			"

												Very odd game concept in my opinion. There is pretty much zero tutorial (only a brief introduction to the UI) followed by some introduction pages for the games one can open. The introductions are insanely confusingly written, most I've read twice or three times and was still not clear how the game works. So I learned the rules pretty much every case finally by trial and error. Not good.The individual games are either puzzles (just click on the one you want and it just opens) or missions (it asks to do something, bit like a mini-quest, sometimes it ports you somewhere for this). The minigames are diverse but rather pointless besides ""play a game, get a little bit of money, rise the skill level which seems to have not much impact on anything"". At least so far I haven't found anything to motivate you to play a game besides that you hopefully want to play that particular game. Many of the games are not accessible without paying money for Doubloons or grinding enough ingame currency to buy Doubloons from the bank. Individual game sections (crafting, monster hunting, ship navigation & gunning etc) are all split into ""pay with Doubloons for 30 day badge"". Most money comes from pilfering trips with other players on a player owned ship, you can have up to ... (25?) players on a ship, individual tasks are all minigames. If you are on a ship you can't just leave (bad style) and if the game/task you like is already occupied by enough others you have to do another one (freeloading is frowned upon). So you basically spent hours doing the same minigame over and over for very little money to hopefully encounter other ships often enough and then try to plunder them (or be plundered). There are treasure chests and crafting goods besides the money, but it seems those stay exclusively with the ship owner? So you get money to buy Doubloons or maybe other clothes or weapon or resources.Crafting minigames do not yield any resources or items. You just lend a shop(pe) your workforce and receive a little bit of money in exchange.All very puzzling honestly, the minigames are to some degree not too bad but it feels to me somehow pointless. I've played a lot of FreeRealms and minigames gave resources there which I could then use for crafting in other minigames. Usually I played the minigames for the sake of the minigames but there was a meta game on top that made it feel more like an actual world and overarching motivation. Completely lacking here.Oh and if a shop does not have items pre-made available (the norm) then you can order it for ingame money - but it usually needs to be ""delivered"" (despite you showing up at this island and shop) for Doubloons usually. Which means you are either spending real life money for a few pixels or you grind ingame currency to exchange for Doubloons. Just to give you an idea: puzzles give 25ish coins, plundering a ship 500-800 coins maybe initial (and a bit more at port if you stay so long) - and a Doubloon is roughly 4000-5000 coins. But you need 5 Doubloons to have the monthly crafting badge activated and simplest clothing or furniture cost 1-5 Doubloons to ""deliver"" usually. Besides clothing and furniture there seems very little to buy anyway (besides the ship you want, but for which you need for navigation an officer badge ... more Doubloons).So no, I don't really recommend it. Wouldn't mind paying a monthly fee if this whole Doubloon extra charging was then gone, but it isn't. Feel like an insane nickle and diming with barely any explanation and no point to grind.			"

												it is the most romantic film that has ever been made about a nervous lady getting slapped all over the place by a millionaire hunk that is right it is the erotic comedy thriller that is called 50 shades of grey. this morning when it was the morning time i went to see 50 shades of grey on my own at the cinema for a romantic treat for myself to help get me in a valentines day mood and as soon as the film starts it shows ana who is the main girl in the film going to do a interview with a man who is called christian grey who is a millionaire ex model hunk because she is doing a essay about millionaire ex model hunks for her college course and when ana gets to christians office she starts feeling dead nervous because of how much of a hunk he is and the camera does loads of close up slow motion shots of her biting her bottom lip and licking her chin from all different types of angles and my best bit in the whole of the film is when christian says to ana that he wants to show her something and ana says so show me then and christian does a half smile and he slowly walks over to a hidden door that is in his office and he tells ana to come closer to see what is behind it and as ana steps through the hidden door she looks around the room and she sees that it is completely filled with thousands of sausages tied to the ceiling from stings and christian looks at ana and he says this is my playroom i wanted you to see it and ana turns to christian and she stares into his eyes and she can see the reflection of thousands of uncooked sausages shining back at her and it was almost as if she was having a look into 2 tiny butchers windows and then all of a sudden christian does a really high pitch screaming laugh and then he starts running underneath all of the sausages with his mouth wide open and he starts dipping all of the sausages into his mouth like he is having a quick taste of each and every one of them and ana just stares at him watching his every move and she can feel herself tingling with excitement and after about 15 minutes of watching him she cant even contain herself anymore so she starts running around the room doing the same and then after watching them dipping the sausages into their mouths for about 45 minutes they both go to grab the same sausage at exactly the same time and their lips meet and they share their first kiss together under the blanket of dangling meat and at that very moment the whole of the world stopped just for them and then christian gently puts his fingers next to anas mouth and he says i wont do you no harm and ana says ok and she closes her eyes and she slowly puts christians fingers inside of her mouth and then she just starts swallowing his arm like she has been possessed by a erotic snake and christian says what the hell are you doing and ana trys to say i thought that you told me to swallow your arm and christian shouts no i said i wont do you no harm and then he starts screaming oh my god please god stop it please you are crushing my arm and as he trys to pull his arm out of anas mouth her throat just gobbles it back up even more like it has got a mind of its own and before they could even call for help ana had swallowed christians arm right up to his shoulder and then after them struggling for ages to get christians arm out of anas mouth christians whole body starts turning completely grey and that is why the film is called 50 shades of grey and then right at the end of the film there is a slow motion shot of ana lying on the floor with christians lifeless grey body hanging out of her mouth and it really is such a beautiful ending to such a romantic film so if you want to feel a extra slice of spice this valentines day then this is definitely the only film that you need to see.

Grade: 65/100Difficulty: Varies, depending on activity.Pros: A variety of things to do and puzzles to play.Cons: Not very immersive, very bland graphics. Games are either too complex or too easy. None feel engaging enough to replay on a consistent basis.Replayable: No. Do not recommend unless you're really bored.			"

												I hated this game. I thought it would be something fun to do while doing other things, but it was just boring and clunky. I'm definitely too old for it, but I can't really see younger kids wanting to play either. It seemed like a bunch of lousy versions of mobile games grouped together into a weird MMO thing. I'd rather just play a mobile game I guess. Just not for me.			"

												In a shed . . . was a pile of about 40 completely naked human bodies in the last stages of emaciation. These bodies were lightly sprinkled with lime, not for the purposes of destroying them, but for the purpose of removing the stench.When the shed was full--I presume its capacity to be about 200, the bodies were taken to a pit a mile from the camp where they were buried. The inmates claimed that 3,000 men, who had been either shot in the head or who had died of starvation, had been so buried since the 1st of January.When we began to approach with our troops, the Germans thought it expedient to remove the evidence of their crime. Therefore, they had some of the slaves exhume the bodies and place them on a mammoth griddle composed of 60-centimeter railway tracks laid on brick foundations. They poured pitch on the bodies and then built a fire of pinewood and coal under them. They were not very successful in their operations because there was a pile of human bones, skulls, charred torsos on or under the griddle which must have accounted for many hundreds.			"

												Awww.. Puzzle Pirates was one (if not THE) first online game I've ever got addicted to.I remember back in the days, when I had no possibilities of getting online cash to invest in games... Getting jealous over other people, being able to own a ship and get a higher level badge...The game is very user friendly tho!If you're a captain, you can hire people to become your crewmembers and sail around with them.The game comes with alot of puzzle games, many of them are fun to play. (I especially liked the pumping game)And if you're a good and active crewmember, the captain can always award you with a pirate medal. :3Sadly the game seems to be very dead.. At least the servers I tried..I'll get back into this game one day tho. I love pirates too much, and this is simply cute.Review? Do I recommand giving it a try?Why yes, it's free. And it's very fun, even if you're limited to certain things in the beginning.You simply need to join a bigger crew, you'll be able to be parts of fights and earn looots of money!			"

												The games can be a little tedious at time but really think about it. You are a pirate afloat in the carribean sea, many of these games are like the actual jobs they are based upon, not realistically though.. and many of those jobs were tedious to do. They are not that difficult to do though. And although there is premium content in the game, everything can be done without ever paying a cent as if you get in with a good crew that travels and does pirate things on a daily basis, you can get enough poe to trade for dubs and buy the premium items such as ships and ranks and commerce badges and such.. It just takes a little more work.			"

												Despite the Badge required for puzzling freedom, Every puzzle are entertaining and fun. The puzzle that I most enjoyed are Foraging and Poker because I find foraging the funniest puzzle I ever played and poker is about risk and my most favorate palour puzzle. Still I like how you can purchase doubloons with steam credit like I got 24 for just £3.40, just put £4 in or use the steam market to sell your goodies such as TF2 stranges and genuines, getting these is made much easier. In my conclusion, if you like to have fun puzzles like these, go for it.			"

												Don't let the time logged in Steam fool you. I've played this game quite a bit. It's a great game. The community is a lot friendlier than the typical MMO community. The puzzles are a good diversion even if you do not have the time that a typical MMO requires, but it's definitely not necessarily a casual game, as there is a lot of higher-level in-depth stuff as well.

												Deceptively simplistic. You'd think this is a kids game at first glance, but it's much more complex, which is a good thing. The game contains a myriad of puzzles, which are all easy to learn, but difficult to master. I've played for a while before, and am playing now, but still haven't found a puzzle which I am good at, just mediocre. An expansive economy is also a part of this game. Puzzles earn you pieces of eight, which are the basic currency of the game. These can be used to buy items such as clothes, weapons, ships, houses, and even commodities for player-owned shop stalls. You can have a shop stall and earn money that way if you don't fancy a life of adventure, or you can trade commodities with other shops. If you're really good, you can even own and govern a whole island. All in all, a very fun and time-absorbing game, with challenging puzzles and a nicely made economic system.			"

												Most complex economy in a free-to-play game. Ever.Honestly, I can't believe this is a kid's game. You may own islands and be a governor, you can own shops and stalls, can own ships and crews - it's very sandboxy for its time.Every time you want to craft items and sell it in your shop, you HAVE to play a mini-game. You can hire other players to 'work' for you. Every amount of orders they fill, you pay them. The puzzles are challenging but simple as well.Prices for commodities go up and down just like in real life. You need these commodities to fulfil orders in your shop.Long story short: this is the perfect game for any person who wants to become someone in real life but they can't. It's like a real-life simulator in a way.9/10 - if they updated the graphics and made the game more action-oriented it'd get a straight up 10 from me. A masterpiece.			"

												Being a veteran player of this game (before it was on Steam), I can say this game is simply awesome, and probably the best MMO I've played. This game is something you can be dedicated to, or just play an hour a day. Start as a crew member, pumping the water out of the ship, rigging the sails and such... Then rank up and start navigating your own ship and commanding the crew! Eventually you can own shops, houses... You can have your own guild/clan with it's rival guilds, alliances, hell, even your own island or a whole archipelago if you're good enough! Everything is player-driven and it's all just puzzles like connect 3! And the best part... You can gamble like a true pirate!The game has micro-transactions, monthly-payment or you can buy doubloons, which makes progressing faster. It shouldn't affect the gameplay that much, I haven't had any problem with it. There are subscriber oceans and doubloon oceans. You can play the whole game and not pay a single cent on it!			"

												There was a time when liked PP for more then just a casual puzzle game, run up threw the ranks learning the puzzles all the while managing the sails to bilging or even loading the guns (my specialty) yet after awhile it gets to be a real sense of dejavu.I suppose thats why you just run a shop on land and not worry about venturing out with a flag... yet were is the fun in that?Yet i digress, it is a fun game... sunk many hours and many doubloons even just running gambling on immensely outfitted ships. Yet soon it seens that evenything will degrade, and the worst is clothes. Granted was only a member of a flag, never scraped together to purchase own sloop... yet its always a possibility yet then there is the need to combat, or the likeIm on the fence to say its has alot of replayability value, besides IF really find something that makes it seem worthwile.10/100 (10 is much to low as abit dated yet still stable)			"

												Rating based on current state of play, as per my last login. The last time I logged in, there was nearly no one to play with, things were stagnating, and there was far less to do as a ""greenie"" (nonsubscriber on subscriber oceans) than there seemed to have felt like in the past. Even if I had resub'd, there didn't see that much to do, let alone anyone to do any of it with.I played Y!PP on and off for SO. SO. SO. many years. I believe my first account was made somewhere in 05 to 06, putting me at roughly the 9-10 year mark. While I played more off than on, those times during which I did play I would get completely sucked back into my ocean for weeks, if not months.When I was a bit younger, this game was tremendous amounts of fun. This has more to do with the fact that the ocean(s) were far more populated back then than they are these days, even after the colossal oceans merge. I was originally on Cobalt I believe, which during the prime of my play-days was THE ocean to be on. As I got older, I began to better understand the mechanics of the games I was actually playing, which made me better at them - but, alas, there weren't many people to play with anymore.The puzzles themselves are clever and a LOT of fun. Most of them are simple enough to begin with that anyone could jump right in; still, they also have layers of depth enough to keep amused those whom understand the advanced concepts to each (insane amounts of chaining, combos out the booty, etc etc).The variety of things to do seemed pretty much endless for awhile. From jobbing to running pillages; sloshing down drinks and throwing down rounds of poker, hearts, spades; exploring uninhabited islands; playing borderline-impossible games of hide-and-seek with me mates and trying to make everyone play on the fair (aka clickable; looking at you, dock arrow hiders!); running a shoppe; blockading islands; and so much more. There are so many awesome puzzles sprawled all across the game, and they are all extremely unique. You can spend hours working on your ability to perform Incredibles on one of the half dozen or more ship/duty puzzles; then go manage your shoppe/stalls and put in work hours at the awesome crafting puzzles; then spend a couple hours running commodities from port to port; go in search of El Polo Diablo for kicks and giggles and much insta death lols; then chill out at the tavern with drinks, game puzzles, swordfighting duels, and players buying, selling, trading, looking or advertising for crews, trying to pick a fight, and more. Then there are blockades, monster hunts, skeleton/zombie island take overs, contests, avatar outfitting, homes and ships of all sorts of sizes and designs to buy, paint, and decorate, parties to throw... Yeah. Lots to do.As a game that was hugely social in its prime, seeing the excruciatingly slow and painful death of Y!PP (esp the sub oceans) was... really, really sad. I miss this game a LOT, and really wish it could be revived. Once Spiral Knights started to take off, things went downhill.I've never really found any other games quite like PP. The thorough permeation of theme, the way it was kid-friendly but not so much so that it was off-putting or unappealing to adults, how one could play casually, socially, or fer-srs. This game is both niche yet massively appealing to the masses, especially in the casual mobile gaming world of today.What would be SUPER. FREAKING. AWESOME! ? If Y!PP were to produce a sequel, or a spiritual successor, or something like that. The system itself worked quite well - $10/month subscription is very fair. Some things would need to be reworked a bit, and I can EASILY see how expansive it could get. An enormous open-world you could explore on your own or with your crew, finding hidden, previously undiscovered islands in the far corners of the world, exploring overwhelming jungles, diving into the deep-sea ruins of Atlantis in search of treasure and adventure, brave the misty swamplands of the cursed isles, all while interacting with diverse wildlife and a population of both advanced AI NPCs and other players; yet  still keeping the original base concept of the game (crews, pillages, plunders, and puzzles)...  I lost many hundreds of hours to the original Y!PP - and I can easily see myself pouring hundreds more into its successor, if it were done right.But right now? The game isn't worth playing unless you want a poor social experience (if any), a few puzzles to play (these days the only puzzles you can play without a subscription are ship duty puzzles such as bilge, carp, sails, rigs, etc), and an empty, empty, linear world in which you don't so much explore as you do sail in a straight light along a pre-dotted path from island to island, archipelago to archipelago. Perhaps you could even buy up a stash of little blue potions and whisk yourself to quiet, abandoned port towns and long-forgotten jungle islands, just to see what could have been.			"

												Ah would easily recommend this game to others. Once upon a time there were thousands of players, the game is still just as fun as the day ah first laid eyes upon it some se'en years ago. You start off a weak greenie pirates, but as you get better at the puzzles, people will invite you to pillage with them, an you can use the money earned there for Doubloons. Using those Doubloons, you can buy a Bravery badge so that you cn go to the Newest attraction: The Kraken! Ah used to loathe BNav, but after the Kraken was introduced, not only do I enjoy the experience now, but it made me a more competent BNavver during even regular encounters. There as many things to do here. Aside from the puzzles you can own shops and stalls, make Rum, Shot and Sword! Ah find one of my Passions is ship buildin. After you go make loads of Poe and Dubs, you'll have to find someway to while away the time. Ye can ave fun Flirtin and drinkin in the Inns, lots of games to be had there Poker, hearts, spades and Drinkin! There are too many to list, but ah like to meander through the shops and look at, try on, and buy clothin to wear. All in all, ah'd say this game still has mmuch to offer the would be scallywag lookin fer a place to make port... Weigh Anchor, and set sail... and when ye get thare, tell em Licentious sentcha!			"

												>>EDIT<<So... ok I have no idea why I'm going back to edit this review but I feel some need to share a bit more on the game. So here be my list (or what I can at least remember) of PROs and CONs. Be advised that these can be different from person to person and will possibly be missing A LOT of things in between.PROs:>>The game is ADDICTIVE.>>You can buy houses. Own a stall. Be the governor of your own island and captain of your own crew and king/queen of your own flag.>>Over the years more puzzles have been added as well as challenges. For example, there's Treasure Haul, Foraging, Weaving, Patching and that other sailing puzzle I keep forgetting about. There might be a furniture crafting related puzzle in the future but that's just me and my wishful thinking. As for challenges there's Kraken Hunts, Brigand Hunts, Atlantis- I am naming all these things that came out over the years and not just recent but yeah you get the point.>>Tutorials... well I don't know how that works now but in the past (ok fine, over a decade ago) your newly shipwrecked pirate's whisked away on a crew ship where you're spoon fed all you need--- about puzzles. Yeah, no real clue about the other details of the game such as starting a crew, governing an island, owning a building and other things but basically, there IS a tutorial and I might just be stating this after seeing a review about the game not having a tutorial.>>It... actually has some replay value. Sure the game's not much different- (well not at all) since the day I first started, however, new features, games, seals, trophies, etc. make the game something worth coming to. And you'll be surprised at how easily you'll get lost in playing it again after a while, but of course, that differs from person to person.>>You CAN play and experience every feature in this game even WITHOUT paying real money for it. Of course, this still requires the use of dubloons, grabbing badges, etc. etc. The dubloon exchange exists to allow players to exchange pieces of eight for dubloons to use in buying badges necessary to unlock certain features of the game like Kraken Hunting, Atlantis, stall jobs, job puzzles, those cards/drink/swordfighting/rumble puzzles and officer privelages. Just know that the dubloons aren't being sold cheap and depending on your luck and the times, they could be running from 2.5k to 5k (pieces of eight mind you). Trust me... I was surprised to see how expensive they are now too.>>Following up on the puzzles, certain puzzles are available on certain days. Wanna go play Smithing? Wait until Tuesday. Foraging? Wait until Wednesday. Rumble and Swordfighting? That's on Monday! DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT REMEMBER THE DAYS THESE PUZZLES ARE ACTUALLY OPEN. The badges are basicaly just there to allow you to play the puzzles at your own leisure and earn even more pieces of eight via jobbing. Of course, this does not apply to hunts, flots, etc. which require the Bravery Badge.>>The community... well. Let's just say the community is... SPECIAL. There are those that are weird. Those that are down right rude. Those that are friendly. Those that are- basically just your average online community. You might have to be a tad bit lucky and a hella bit persistent if you wanna find a goodcircle to indulge in but, trust me, if you find the perfect crew you won't be sorry. Course, times change and people do come and go in the game so expect to see new faces and miss old ones over time, especially when you're the type that tends to disappear for long periods of time like I do. (Read, years.)>>There is this thing called GREETER PILLAGES. As people know, some pirates hold greenie pillages, or pillages for green users. These pirates usually have pink names and are called greeters and are players who spend some time to help acquaint people to the game. They can take these new pirates on trial pillages, hunts, etc. and teach them about the usual game etiquette and jargon used in the middle of a game... Actually, this is the best the game has to offer when it comes to tutorials. And it can be fun, especially when the greeter's got some good sense of humor in them.>>You can always STOP. I think this might be the most important part. You can stop playing the game at your leisure. It's FREE for crying out loud and you can enjoy it fully just by- well, enjoying it. All the features are within arm's reach if you just keep playing. And if you get tired of it, you can just put it down. No need to waste money and all that if you feel it's not worthit.CONs:>>The game is ADDICTIVE.>>You'll end up playing for hours on end and might end up with a huge migraine from staring at your screen for too long or from the puzzles.>>The game reminds you to take a break from playing.>>It DOES get repetitive after a while, and to a mind numbing level at that. Addictive and repetitive does not go well together.>>Inactivity CAN lead to DELETION. I don't particularly know or remember how long it'll take before your pirate gets deleted from inactivity but one review said it only takes 6 weeks. Now, before anything, you are sent an email before your account is deleted and all you need to do to keep that from happening is to log on for... just over a minute. Or well, not even that long. After that you can close the game and say goodbye to it until your next warning. Now, as for what happens when your pirate is deleted- well, obviously EVERYTHING goes poof. Badges, pieces of eight, dubloons, ships, crew, achievements, trophies, pets, houses, EVERYTHING. So it's usually a good idea to log in every two months or something to make sure this doesn't happen. ESPECIALLY if you actually care about losing progress.>>The... community lol. Ok as I said earlier, the place is a hotpot of people. There are good, and of course there are the bad ones. There are plenty of scammers EVERYWHERE in this game. At least from when I first started. These days, I haven't seen a single one though that can be accounted for my lack of activity but not many have talked much about any scammers recently. The other thing, are elitists who only pick pirates based on their reputation or skill level as depicted on their pirate page. This has often times dissuaded a few people from playing the game or trying out a new feature, and other times, most especially in a hunt where everyone's cooperation is needed, these people who are in charge can get... a little out of hand. You can'tentirely blame them due to the losses you can suffer in these hunts but still, that is what greeter pillages are for.>>Lags and glitches. Lags and glitches everywhere when you least expect it.OTHER THINGS??>>I won't call it a pro or a con, but the graphics of the game are... well fine. Walk animation- what is that? lol. Minimal interaction with your environment? Yeeeeerp. Puzzles bright as heck and burns the eyes? Yeeeeep. Basically, the graphics... well they aren't perfect, but they're a decent fit to the game.So... TL;DRThe game introduces new puzzles and pillages/hunts every now and then. You also have events that give you one time trophies as well as monthly seals that might be out of reach if you don't have badges sometimes or a good crew that would take you in. All the features are unlockable either through insane amounts of effort or minimal effort depending on whether you're lucky, have good friends, or money you feel like throwing at the game. Aaand you can quit at any time.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fun, fun, funI must admit this game did give me a huge headache when I first started nearly a decade ago but once you get around, you'll find it quite addictive.There've been a good many puzzles added through out the years and features and quirks as well and each one has it's own unique charm that gets you coming back every single time.

												Haven't played this in ages, but used to as a kid. Had some great times back then, and even now the puzzles are always exciting to play, given the competitive twist the dueling system adds to them. If you like pirates and RPGs (and don't suck at tetris) then this is a really fun time-waster. [Warning: It IS a time waster.]			"

												I have 300+ hours on the Steam client, which came out in my 7th year of play, and toward the end of my hardcore playing days. From the time this game out on Steam, I've spent maybe 10% of my total hours on the Steam client. My best guess has me at over 10,000 hours. That's well over a year of game play. Not even kidding you. The game has been in a state of ""dying"" for about 5 years now. At its peak it saw 5 free servers, 2 sub servers, 2 foreign servers, and 1 kid server, with ~5,000 concurrent players daily. Now it's down to 1 sub, 2 free, and the 2 foreign servers, with ~800 daily. The Spanish and German servers are literally down to 10 people. As a game to get started in, things are pretty daunting. There is a bit of a tutorial experience for players, but the real fun stuff begins once you've amassed experience/money. There are puzzles for every type of player. There are 2 combat puzzles, one similar to Tetris, the other similar to any ball-pop game you've played before. There are 3 shipboard station types: Sailing, Carpentry, and Bilging. Sailing and Carpentry both have an alternate puzzle. There is also a Navigation puzzle. The Battle Navigation Puzzle is where the person in charge moves the ship to outmaneuver their opponents, and is the most important role on the ship. There are 5 ""Carousing"" type puzzles, including Poker, Hearts, Spades, and two puzzle PvP games. There are 6 ""Labor"" type puzzles, that require a labor badge on the free oceans. These puzzles are uniquely tailored to fuel the game's economy system, as every puzzle helps produce labor that produces products you can buy throughout the game.With all of these puzzles, you can take on a variety of personas. There are the hard-core puzzlers, the ship-masters (they run pillages, sea monster hunts, etc.), the carousers, the traders, and many more. It's really up to you to decide who you are.The best part about this game has to be the social aspect. There is literally a chat function for almost every group imaginable. I've met so many great and wonderful people playing this game. You can get the best experience imaginable if you 'put yourself out there' so to speak, find a crew, open yourself up to voice-communications, and amass a list of 'hearties'. This game will suck up your time. You just have to dedicate maybe 30 hours to getting used to the puzzles and interactions, and it opens up completely. There is an extensive experience/rating system for each puzzle. There are hundreds of trophies to mark your adventure with. There are thousands of items to collect. Dozens of ships, with many 'limited edition' versions to collect, each with their own, fun, and unique niche. Still hundreds of people to meet, across a number of oceans. Hundreds of Islands with their own unique histories.... the list goes on.You can pillage the high seas; fighting brigands, barbarians, hoards of monkeys, Brigand Kings & Queens, The Infamous Black Ship; exploring Treasure Wrecks, Forage Spots; Raiding Vikings, Imperial Outposts. You can explore Sea Monster Lairs including: Atlantis, The Cursed Isles, The Haunted Seas, and The Kraken. You can engage Brigand Kings at their very own Flotillas. You can job for flag vs. flag or flag vs. Brigand King Blockades. You can join the navy to gain experience. You can spend your time at the inn, playing poker or settling disputes with a swordfight. You can collect pets, familiars, ships, houses, trinkets, swords, trophies, whatever you'd like. You can make ships, potions, clothes, MONEY. You can sit on the docks and harass random players. You can do absolutely nothing. You can do absolutely anything. Seriously.Play this game. 10/10 would spend another year+ of game time on this game.			"

												Even back when the game was young, it was already breaking the norms and creating something entirely different among games of its time. It continues to do so, now more than ever,  being a sandbox MMO that offers something no one else can.Skindeep, the game floats on dozens of different puzzles representing combat, keeping your ship seaworthy, crafting, harvesting, and just having a good time in the inns. The game is still much more deeper than that; the game is built on the shoulders of its players with a constant world heavily impacted by the politics of massive crews and flags and the entrepreneurship of individuals.The path you choose is entirely up to you. As many will find, you will probably start off getting jobs aboard ships but this can quickly branch off into what YOU would like to do. You can continue to keep jobbing for crews or join your own doing the same thing, work at shoppes, run your own pillages as an officer in a crew, become a trader sailing island to island, become an adventurer or monster-hunter sailing to unknown dangers and looting giants, join the polticial scene among many of the top flags and crews who run a good fraction of the ocean, or even conquering entire islands owned by other players.It's presented with a 2D setting and environment, but its very stylized and clean. The only true downside is the lack of effort put in by the developer's interest; the game has constantly taken blows due to poor management and bad decisions. You'd think a game like this would absolutley THRIVE in the current situation we are in now where puzzle and casual games rule. Alas, even Three Rings botched that up making a failure of a transition to mobile.Still, what the game truly needs is more player activity. It's a highly social, very detailed yet entirely simple game that may be the best MMO made as of yet. If you're looking for something new and fresh, that is skill-based, detailed but without a steep learning curve, easy to learn but hard to master, or simply just one of the best casual games there is, then I highly recommend this to you.

												Rating based on current state of play, as per my last login. The last time I logged in, there was nearly no one to play with, things were stagnating, and there was far less to do as a ""greenie"" (nonsubscriber on subscriber oceans) than there seemed to have felt like in the past. Even if I had resub'd, there didn't see that much to do, let alone anyone to do any of it with.I played Y!PP on and off for SO. SO. SO. many years. I believe my first account was made somewhere in 05 to 06, putting me at roughly the 9-10 year mark. While I played more off than on, those times during which I did play I would get completely sucked back into my ocean for weeks, if not months.When I was a bit younger, this game was tremendous amounts of fun. This has more to do with the fact that the ocean(s) were far more populated back then than they are these days, even after the colossal oceans merge. I was originally on Cobalt I believe, which during the prime of my play-days was THE ocean to be on. As I got older, I began to better understand the mechanics of the games I was actually playing, which made me better at them - but, alas, there weren't many people to play with anymore.The puzzles themselves are clever and a LOT of fun. Most of them are simple enough to begin with that anyone could jump right in; still, they also have layers of depth enough to keep amused those whom understand the advanced concepts to each (insane amounts of chaining, combos out the booty, etc etc).The variety of things to do seemed pretty much endless for awhile. From jobbing to running pillages; sloshing down drinks and throwing down rounds of poker, hearts, spades; exploring uninhabited islands; playing borderline-impossible games of hide-and-seek with me mates and trying to make everyone play on the fair (aka clickable; looking at you, dock arrow hiders!); running a shoppe; blockading islands; and so much more. There are so many awesome puzzles sprawled all across the game, and they are all extremely unique. You can spend hours working on your ability to perform Incredibles on one of the half dozen or more ship/duty puzzles; then go manage your shoppe/stalls and put in work hours at the awesome crafting puzzles; then spend a couple hours running commodities from port to port; go in search of El Polo Diablo for kicks and giggles and much insta death lols; then chill out at the tavern with drinks, game puzzles, swordfighting duels, and players buying, selling, trading, looking or advertising for crews, trying to pick a fight, and more. Then there are blockades, monster hunts, skeleton/zombie island take overs, contests, avatar outfitting, homes and ships of all sorts of sizes and designs to buy, paint, and decorate, parties to throw... Yeah. Lots to do.As a game that was hugely social in its prime, seeing the excruciatingly slow and painful death of Y!PP (esp the sub oceans) was... really, really sad. I miss this game a LOT, and really wish it could be revived. Once Spiral Knights started to take off, things went downhill.I've never really found any other games quite like PP. The thorough permeation of theme, the way it was kid-friendly but not so much so that it was off-putting or unappealing to adults, how one could play casually, socially, or fer-srs. This game is both niche yet massively appealing to the masses, especially in the casual mobile gaming world of today.What would be SUPER. FREAKING. AWESOME! ? If Y!PP were to produce a sequel, or a spiritual successor, or something like that. The system itself worked quite well - $10/month subscription is very fair. Some things would need to be reworked a bit, and I can EASILY see how expansive it could get. An enormous open-world you could explore on your own or with your crew, finding hidden, previously undiscovered islands in the far corners of the world, exploring overwhelming jungles, diving into the deep-sea ruins of Atlantis in search of treasure and adventure, brave the misty swamplands of the cursed isles, all while interacting with diverse wildlife and a population of both advanced AI NPCs and other players; yet  still keeping the original base concept of the game (crews, pillages, plunders, and puzzles)...  I lost many hundreds of hours to the original Y!PP - and I can easily see myself pouring hundreds more into its successor, if it were done right.But right now? The game isn't worth playing unless you want a poor social experience (if any), a few puzzles to play (these days the only puzzles you can play without a subscription are ship duty puzzles such as bilge, carp, sails, rigs, etc), and an empty, empty, linear world in which you don't so much explore as you do sail in a straight light along a pre-dotted path from island to island, archipelago to archipelago. Perhaps you could even buy up a stash of little blue potions and whisk yourself to quiet, abandoned port towns and long-forgotten jungle islands, just to see what could have been.			"

												>>EDIT<<So... ok I have no idea why I'm going back to edit this review but I feel some need to share a bit more on the game. So here be my list (or what I can at least remember) of PROs and CONs. Be advised that these can be different from person to person and will possibly be missing A LOT of things in between.PROs:>>The game is ADDICTIVE.>>You can buy houses. Own a stall. Be the governor of your own island and captain of your own crew and king/queen of your own flag.>>Over the years more puzzles have been added as well as challenges. For example, there's Treasure Haul, Foraging, Weaving, Patching and that other sailing puzzle I keep forgetting about. There might be a furniture crafting related puzzle in the future but that's just me and my wishful thinking. As for challenges there's Kraken Hunts, Brigand Hunts, Atlantis- I am naming all these things that came out over the years and not just recent but yeah you get the point.>>Tutorials... well I don't know how that works now but in the past (ok fine, over a decade ago) your newly shipwrecked pirate's whisked away on a crew ship where you're spoon fed all you need--- about puzzles. Yeah, no real clue about the other details of the game such as starting a crew, governing an island, owning a building and other things but basically, there IS a tutorial and I might just be stating this after seeing a review about the game not having a tutorial.>>It... actually has some replay value. Sure the game's not much different- (well not at all) since the day I first started, however, new features, games, seals, trophies, etc. make the game something worth coming to. And you'll be surprised at how easily you'll get lost in playing it again after a while, but of course, that differs from person to person.>>You CAN play and experience every feature in this game even WITHOUT paying real money for it. Of course, this still requires the use of dubloons, grabbing badges, etc. etc. The dubloon exchange exists to allow players to exchange pieces of eight for dubloons to use in buying badges necessary to unlock certain features of the game like Kraken Hunting, Atlantis, stall jobs, job puzzles, those cards/drink/swordfighting/rumble puzzles and officer privelages. Just know that the dubloons aren't being sold cheap and depending on your luck and the times, they could be running from 2.5k to 5k (pieces of eight mind you). Trust me... I was surprised to see how expensive they are now too.>>Following up on the puzzles, certain puzzles are available on certain days. Wanna go play Smithing? Wait until Tuesday. Foraging? Wait until Wednesday. Rumble and Swordfighting? That's on Monday! DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT REMEMBER THE DAYS THESE PUZZLES ARE ACTUALLY OPEN. The badges are basicaly just there to allow you to play the puzzles at your own leisure and earn even more pieces of eight via jobbing. Of course, this does not apply to hunts, flots, etc. which require the Bravery Badge.>>The community... well. Let's just say the community is... SPECIAL. There are those that are weird. Those that are down right rude. Those that are friendly. Those that are- basically just your average online community. You might have to be a tad bit lucky and a hella bit persistent if you wanna find a goodcircle to indulge in but, trust me, if you find the perfect crew you won't be sorry. Course, times change and people do come and go in the game so expect to see new faces and miss old ones over time, especially when you're the type that tends to disappear for long periods of time like I do. (Read, years.)>>There is this thing called GREETER PILLAGES. As people know, some pirates hold greenie pillages, or pillages for green users. These pirates usually have pink names and are called greeters and are players who spend some time to help acquaint people to the game. They can take these new pirates on trial pillages, hunts, etc. and teach them about the usual game etiquette and jargon used in the middle of a game... Actually, this is the best the game has to offer when it comes to tutorials. And it can be fun, especially when the greeter's got some good sense of humor in them.>>You can always STOP. I think this might be the most important part. You can stop playing the game at your leisure. It's FREE for crying out loud and you can enjoy it fully just by- well, enjoying it. All the features are within arm's reach if you just keep playing. And if you get tired of it, you can just put it down. No need to waste money and all that if you feel it's not worthit.CONs:>>The game is ADDICTIVE.>>You'll end up playing for hours on end and might end up with a huge migraine from staring at your screen for too long or from the puzzles.>>The game reminds you to take a break from playing.>>It DOES get repetitive after a while, and to a mind numbing level at that. Addictive and repetitive does not go well together.>>Inactivity CAN lead to DELETION. I don't particularly know or remember how long it'll take before your pirate gets deleted from inactivity but one review said it only takes 6 weeks. Now, before anything, you are sent an email before your account is deleted and all you need to do to keep that from happening is to log on for... just over a minute. Or well, not even that long. After that you can close the game and say goodbye to it until your next warning. Now, as for what happens when your pirate is deleted- well, obviously EVERYTHING goes poof. Badges, pieces of eight, dubloons, ships, crew, achievements, trophies, pets, houses, EVERYTHING. So it's usually a good idea to log in every two months or something to make sure this doesn't happen. ESPECIALLY if you actually care about losing progress.>>The... community lol. Ok as I said earlier, the place is a hotpot of people. There are good, and of course there are the bad ones. There are plenty of scammers EVERYWHERE in this game. At least from when I first started. These days, I haven't seen a single one though that can be accounted for my lack of activity but not many have talked much about any scammers recently. The other thing, are elitists who only pick pirates based on their reputation or skill level as depicted on their pirate page. This has often times dissuaded a few people from playing the game or trying out a new feature, and other times, most especially in a hunt where everyone's cooperation is needed, these people who are in charge can get... a little out of hand. You can'tentirely blame them due to the losses you can suffer in these hunts but still, that is what greeter pillages are for.>>Lags and glitches. Lags and glitches everywhere when you least expect it.OTHER THINGS??>>I won't call it a pro or a con, but the graphics of the game are... well fine. Walk animation- what is that? lol. Minimal interaction with your environment? Yeeeeerp. Puzzles bright as heck and burns the eyes? Yeeeeep. Basically, the graphics... well they aren't perfect, but they're a decent fit to the game.So... TL;DRThe game introduces new puzzles and pillages/hunts every now and then. You also have events that give you one time trophies as well as monthly seals that might be out of reach if you don't have badges sometimes or a good crew that would take you in. All the features are unlockable either through insane amounts of effort or minimal effort depending on whether you're lucky, have good friends, or money you feel like throwing at the game. Aaand you can quit at any time.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fun, fun, funI must admit this game did give me a huge headache when I first started nearly a decade ago but once you get around, you'll find it quite addictive.There've been a good many puzzles added through out the years and features and quirks as well and each one has it's own unique charm that gets you coming back every single time.

												This is a pirate themed MMO (yes, MMO!) where the progression is based on puzzle games instead of third person combat.  The community is cool, and the economy is entirely player driven, which makes for some fun free-market games.  Implemented in Java, though, so graphics are a bit limited.Tip: do a dubloon ocean.  You need only 1 dubloon per 30 active (actually logged in) days to be able to do everything in the basic game, and by the time you master that, you can probably buy the 5 dubloons it takes to add one feature from the more advanced game.  Basically, you can play for free unless you decide to delve into the advanced stuff.			"

												I have 300+ hours on the Steam client, which came out in my 7th year of play, and toward the end of my hardcore playing days. From the time this game out on Steam, I've spent maybe 10% of my total hours on the Steam client. My best guess has me at over 10,000 hours. That's well over a year of game play. Not even kidding you. The game has been in a state of ""dying"" for about 5 years now. At its peak it saw 5 free servers, 2 sub servers, 2 foreign servers, and 1 kid server, with ~5,000 concurrent players daily. Now it's down to 1 sub, 2 free, and the 2 foreign servers, with ~800 daily. The Spanish and German servers are literally down to 10 people. As a game to get started in, things are pretty daunting. There is a bit of a tutorial experience for players, but the real fun stuff begins once you've amassed experience/money. There are puzzles for every type of player. There are 2 combat puzzles, one similar to Tetris, the other similar to any ball-pop game you've played before. There are 3 shipboard station types: Sailing, Carpentry, and Bilging. Sailing and Carpentry both have an alternate puzzle. There is also a Navigation puzzle. The Battle Navigation Puzzle is where the person in charge moves the ship to outmaneuver their opponents, and is the most important role on the ship. There are 5 ""Carousing"" type puzzles, including Poker, Hearts, Spades, and two puzzle PvP games. There are 6 ""Labor"" type puzzles, that require a labor badge on the free oceans. These puzzles are uniquely tailored to fuel the game's economy system, as every puzzle helps produce labor that produces products you can buy throughout the game.With all of these puzzles, you can take on a variety of personas. There are the hard-core puzzlers, the ship-masters (they run pillages, sea monster hunts, etc.), the carousers, the traders, and many more. It's really up to you to decide who you are.The best part about this game has to be the social aspect. There is literally a chat function for almost every group imaginable. I've met so many great and wonderful people playing this game. You can get the best experience imaginable if you 'put yourself out there' so to speak, find a crew, open yourself up to voice-communications, and amass a list of 'hearties'. This game will suck up your time. You just have to dedicate maybe 30 hours to getting used to the puzzles and interactions, and it opens up completely. There is an extensive experience/rating system for each puzzle. There are hundreds of trophies to mark your adventure with. There are thousands of items to collect. Dozens of ships, with many 'limited edition' versions to collect, each with their own, fun, and unique niche. Still hundreds of people to meet, across a number of oceans. Hundreds of Islands with their own unique histories.... the list goes on.You can pillage the high seas; fighting brigands, barbarians, hoards of monkeys, Brigand Kings & Queens, The Infamous Black Ship; exploring Treasure Wrecks, Forage Spots; Raiding Vikings, Imperial Outposts. You can explore Sea Monster Lairs including: Atlantis, The Cursed Isles, The Haunted Seas, and The Kraken. You can engage Brigand Kings at their very own Flotillas. You can job for flag vs. flag or flag vs. Brigand King Blockades. You can join the navy to gain experience. You can spend your time at the inn, playing poker or settling disputes with a swordfight. You can collect pets, familiars, ships, houses, trinkets, swords, trophies, whatever you'd like. You can make ships, potions, clothes, MONEY. You can sit on the docks and harass random players. You can do absolutely nothing. You can do absolutely anything. Seriously.Play this game. 10/10 would spend another year+ of game time on this game.			"

Everything you buy rots away, and your account will rot away too unless you log in every 4-6 weeks or pay for in-game currency/status(Doubloons or Subscription, depending on your ""ocean""(Server)).Paying the dev is already a bad idea considering that you're not paying to make the gameplay better(As i mentioned, its just puzzles that they can just copy), and because the game is dying(With a slight pop increase during Blockades and other Events).Overall, i would not recommend.

												Deceptively simplistic. You'd think this is a kids game at first glance, but it's much more complex, which is a good thing. The game contains a myriad of puzzles, which are all easy to learn, but difficult to master. I've played for a while before, and am playing now, but still haven't found a puzzle which I am good at, just mediocre. An expansive economy is also a part of this game. Puzzles earn you pieces of eight, which are the basic currency of the game. These can be used to buy items such as clothes, weapons, ships, houses, and even commodities for player-owned shop stalls. You can have a shop stall and earn money that way if you don't fancy a life of adventure, or you can trade commodities with other shops. If you're really good, you can even own and govern a whole island. All in all, a very fun and time-absorbing game, with challenging puzzles and a nicely made economic system.			"

												There was a time when liked PP for more then just a casual puzzle game, run up threw the ranks learning the puzzles all the while managing the sails to bilging or even loading the guns (my specialty) yet after awhile it gets to be a real sense of dejavu.I suppose thats why you just run a shop on land and not worry about venturing out with a flag... yet were is the fun in that?Yet i digress, it is a fun game... sunk many hours and many doubloons even just running gambling on immensely outfitted ships. Yet soon it seens that evenything will degrade, and the worst is clothes. Granted was only a member of a flag, never scraped together to purchase own sloop... yet its always a possibility yet then there is the need to combat, or the likeIm on the fence to say its has alot of replayability value, besides IF really find something that makes it seem worthwile.10/100 (10 is much to low as abit dated yet still stable)			"

Just because of the graphics most people dont even check it. It is a game for people who likes puzzling and communicate with people actively. Because this game is about being a team most of the time. In a ship where people stands together. In most cases if one futy fails the other ones will fail too. Also wants patience and skills for some puzzles. There is some singleplayer puzzles of course. But the main puzzles are multiplayer.			"

												Most complex economy in a free-to-play game. Ever.Honestly, I can't believe this is a kid's game. You may own islands and be a governor, you can own shops and stalls, can own ships and crews - it's very sandboxy for its time.Every time you want to craft items and sell it in your shop, you HAVE to play a mini-game. You can hire other players to 'work' for you. Every amount of orders they fill, you pay them. The puzzles are challenging but simple as well.Prices for commodities go up and down just like in real life. You need these commodities to fulfil orders in your shop.Long story short: this is the perfect game for any person who wants to become someone in real life but they can't. It's like a real-life simulator in a way.9/10 - if they updated the graphics and made the game more action-oriented it'd get a straight up 10 from me. A masterpiece.			"

This is obviously a game for kids, but I enjoyed it nonetheless because I like some casual puzzle games as well. Everything, down to the ""pirate fights"" are solved with puzzles, which to me earns it a differentiating point. So if you're into casual this sort of causal games, you should try this out.			"

												This game is a piece of gold, polished trought ages, too bad that I never bought a membership.The games basically is a pvp puzzle based game where you can craft all of your items, if you have the time.The only thing I feel bad about this is that for doing anything else than just puzzling (crafting, changing clothes, weapons, basically anything outside the ""quick-play"" button) you need a membership.But boy oh boy, it will be worth every cent.

This is obviously a game for kids, but I enjoyed it nonetheless because I like some casual puzzle games as well. Everything, down to the ""pirate fights"" are solved with puzzles, which to me earns it a differentiating point. So if you're into casual this sort of causal games, you should try this out.			"

That problem is lag. Lots and lots of it. To the point of crashing the game at times. If they ever fix that lag I would recommend this game until then....			"

												This game is awesome. Puzzle awesome I mean. Many of the puzzles are really easy to understand, the tutorial is very good and its easy to become someone in this game. Many oceans (specially the subscriber oceans) are empty and because of that some end game stuff such as gigantic boats and other stuff become really difficult to do/achieve. On the populated oceans it's easy to find a Grand Frigate jobbing for Atlantis (although on these oceans, you require to make microtransactions of real money to unlock certain types of content).All in all, this game is super good, but it lacks people. There are 2 methods of payment, and these methods are separated, as in, you have to choose a dubloon ocean (microtransaction oceans) or a subscriber ocean (although the name implies a mandatory subscription, it's not needed). Dubloons are used to unlock certain features of the game for a smaller price, while subscribing unlocks all the content all together, overall for a MUCH cheaper price.8.5/10.			"

												This game has some serious problems. First of all it's 2d, so it should be very easy for any computer to handle it, because it's not even ""high graphics"" 2d with effects and stuff, it's very basic, so it SHOULD NOT produce ANY HEAT at ALL! instead this game makes my processor go from 41c to 60c! sniper elite v2 dosent even get me to 55c!

												This is a very interesting and relaxing game. It gives me a good nostalgia factor because I remember my friend's older brother would play this game. The puzzles are easy to play but hard to master, the combination of mmorpg elements and puzzles is a very interesting combo that only Puzzle Pirates can achieve. There's plenty to do in this game so you never really get bored. It's extremely fun when you have a crew of friends together on the high seas.			"

												Being a Pirate is something I've always dreamed of becoming. Battling through the medium of puzzle solving is also another dream I wanted to come true. This game is an excellent time guzzler, and is something I always pick up every now and then. I'd give the game a solid 9/10 for the concept; however, since the game deletes your account after a certain period of inactivity, they'd get a lower score just for that.

												I've played this game on and off for several years, and although the number of players has dwindled significantly, there's still a dedicated fanbase that makes the experience enjoyable. Pros:- Nice variety of puzzles- Many activities require cooperation, which adds to the factor of challenge- In-game community is fairly welcoming- PIRATES!! (yar har fiddle dee dee)- Related to the previous note, the game has an amazing chat filter that translates your text into ""pirate speak""Cons:- Currency isn't the easiest to come by- Because the game's well past its prime popularity, it can be a little quiet (especially on servers that aren't Emerald or Meridian)- Trouble playing on Mac, usually a compatibility issue whenever there's a computer software updateOverall, I'm really glad that the game's still available for play. It's very easy to pick up and get lost somewhere in between all of the puzzling.			"

												Roleplay? Checked.Pirate duties? Checked.Strategic team battles? Checked.Good community? Checked.Pushes your mind to the limit? Checked.Competitiveness? Checked.This game has everything you want in a role-playing game. You can customise your character, own pets, get a house and furnish it. Join a crew and play your way up the ranks or start your own crew if you're confident enough. There is also a very good community. I'd recommend playing in the Doubloon servers. Doubloons are the ""premium"" currency in the game however don't let it deter you from playing. You can trade the in-game currency (PoE or Pieces of Eight) for players who are selling it. Go check it out! It'll be worth your time.			"

												Before reading, look at my time spent in game. The game's population began to decline immediately after houses were introduce, and poker shortly thereafter. It then became YoHoHo stay in house and never mingle Pirates! The inns emptied, communities fractured, and it became a colder environment for new players, so none of them bothered to stay.I have played this game on and off for ten years, and there is everything to love about it. I've made some fantastic friends with people from the genuinely outstanding community over the years, and have always felt at home within this game. From cutesy pirate characters and fun, creative puzzles for everything, it's an adventure worth having.			"

												Really great MMO; you grind for straight-up skill at the game rather than better gear. Takes a long time to play and is very repetitive, but if you don't mind that, it is very fun. (Also, play on the Emerald Ocean as it's the most active.)			"

												This game brings back great memories and was the most fun I ever had on any MMO. That being said, it is very sad for me to say this but this game is well past its prime. It was fun while it lasted and I'm still looking for a game to fill its void. RIP Puzzle Pirates.			"

												I really ove this game but it needs somethings. It's basically a Puzzle MMO. It's pay to play in that you have to get badges to have access to everything all at once. You dont have to pay but you need to grind hardcore to get sufficient in game currency to buy badges. Now, This game is a blast when there are lots of people playing. Like 5 years ago. Now it's  a ghost town. You can still find some crews. This game needs a serious revamp, New Puzzles maybe just update the puzzles. But it is fun and very addicting considering all that.			"

												I absolutely love this game! I was hesitant at first cus I don't typically like games where you wander about and develop a character but the mini puzzles are so much fun to play as well as the parlor games. I play for hours now where no other game could capture my attention for more than a half hour or so before. I recommed this game to everone!			"

												The joy that I experience whilst playing Puzzle Pirates is ineffable -- no written dialect has the capability to portray it. No tongue to convey it either.Despite my obviously limited hours playing Puzzle Pirates using the Steam client, I've been a decade-long patron to Three Rings; a few months shy of when ye olde Barnabas the Pale, the Widow Queen, Gretchen Goldfang (etc.) were released. Back when it was Ell Pollo Diablo, and not The Black Ship!In case ‘ya didn't check the tags out, Puzzle Pirates is a massively multiplayer online game where its fundamental gameplay aspects are based on... Well, puzzling! Should you board an in-game piracy vessel akin to any 17th century vessel, you'll find a broad variety of puzzling games to indulge yourself to your heart’s content, ranging from hoisting the sails and adjusting your pulleys as you catch every forceful gale to sail your ship from island to island, league to league; or maybe you're the on duty officer and you're the one at that’s set the course of the vessel! With your hands on the ship's wheel and your eyes flickering between gazing beyond the bow, then up to the stars as you align them to your wheel for none other than smooth sailing! Or you want to be the ships temporary carpenter. With both hands hammering and nailing away at the deck and hull in an effort to keep the ship in tip-top shape as you repair the hull breach your sloop just sustained from enemy cannon fire. Maybe you're the one filling the ship's cannons as your on duty officer engages in 'fair' piracy naval combat with graceful Atlanteans as your crew invades the antediluvian's outpost in an epic ship-versus-sea monster warfare with your boot-licking lazer pirates hauling the glistening rewards right out from the waters about your vessel, all thanks due to your captain's warfare supremacy against the water-dwelling beasts.Puzzle Pirates primarily focuses on voyages about the ocean, about battling and boarding other Brigand or Barbarians as you pillage their ships to your heart’s content, or if you could board other player vessel’s if you so choose! You can organize a renowned 7-man assembly of players to traipse into some Cursed Isles. Disembark from your sloop as you invade the cultist’s beach, engaging in a fierce brawl with the insane homunculus’s and zombies and (hopefully!) subduing their forces so that you’re granted an ample amount of time to forage for their caches!'Course, Puzzle Pirates isn't all about ye olde harr-ty yarr-ty ship-based puzzling! Well, 99% of Puzzle Pirates is… Puzzling. On land, you've got a plentiful amount of relaxing activities to engage in. This includes: Chatting with your fellow Puzzle Pirate’s, managing your very own shoppe, governing your own island, defending the shores of an outpost from a fray of haughty skeletons as you and your posse of friendly pirates engage in an act of team oriented swordfighting puzzling... Oh, and some minigames!You've got the opportunity to play a few carousing games, ranging from one-on-one sword fight duels against another player -- you with your ever-glorious stick, and them with their blue and yellow enamored dadao, or one can play a relaxing and genial game of Spades or, Hearts. Alternatively you can have some stakes up and running with if you’re feeling lucky enough with those. And then there’s the pinnacle of gambling in Puzzle Pirates: Texas Hold ‘Em. A parlour game where players use their hard earned pieces of eight  after a long days worth of pillaging in an attempt to double, triple, quadruple, or lose entirely their dosh.Now, if you’re the one with a fire in their eyes, the type for some competition among your fellow pirates, then hone your skills in an attempt to raise your Puzzling Standing, a system put in place to keep track of a certain player’s proficiency in a puzzle! As you become more efficient in your methodical practices in a certain puzzle, your Puzzle Standing will rise, and so too will your work output aboard the vessel or shoppe. Marvelously, the Puzzle Pirates’ community is tremendously forgiving for those new to the game, and are always willing to lend a hand, or… Hook, to those in need of tutoring in certain puzzles. There’s no sense of obligation to improve your bilging standing beyond renowned, but you are rewarded for pushing forth and developing your tricks of the trade(s) to reach the ‘ultimate’ puzzle standing for that in-game trophy for recognition, proof of dedication, and the general sense of accomplishment. And if attaining the ultimate puzzle standing wasn’t enough, there’s a leader board set up for those who also have the ultimate puzzle standing as they cheerily climb over one another to reach that #1 ultimate standing for the entire server (Known as an ‘Ocean’). There’s a plethora of in-game trophies readily waiting for you to obtain as you simply play and enjoy the game at your own leisure that aren’t all about competition, of course!With so many puzzles readily available for the player to, well… Play, one would think that there’s a puzzle that plays out similar to another, right? Mmm-mmm. Three Rings did a gorgeous job on keeping each puzzling game within Puzzle Pirate’s unique from one another. Rigging is entirely different to sailing, patching has no correlation to carpenting, and sea-batlte navigation is a whole different minigame in itself compared to regular navigation. And let’s not get started on that golly-gosh-darn distilling puzzle! Trust in me when you read this, but Puzzle Pirates is an astoundingly complex and intricate game, but only if you choose to live the life of an esteemed conqueror! The process to govern an island is an arduous journey – Form a crew, make a flag, earn enough PoE (Acronym for Pieces of Eight, the in-game currency) for a warbooty, decide which player-controlled island you wish to blockade, declare war on the govener’s flag, schedule a blockade… Then blockade! Or you could manage your very own apothecary and concoct paint for ships, houses or furniture; or potions to whisk you from one island to another; enamel jars of varying colours for blacksmiths or furnishers. The commodities required to produce these goods don’t appear out of thin air, though! You’ve got to plan on how to acquire the commodities – Do you play the longer but cheaper route of placing bid tickets at an island’s market, then transport the goods to the island your shoppe is located? Or do you play the faster, more expensive option of buying what you need on the island your shoppe’s located? Either way, you’ll be putting your back into whatever relevant puzzle is required to produce labour required for your orders to be… Well, worked on!Now, Puzzle Pirates is indeed free to play with the purely optional choice of spending Earth-ly dollarydoos (Talkin’ about $$$ here, yo.) to obtain in game doubloons, a secondary currency that can be obtained via in game means through trading with other pirates, or going to an in-game bank and converting your pieces of eight into doubloons.And then there’s the Subscriber Oceans, where doubloons are a nonexistent concept and it’s solely pieces of eight. Players are free to do what they like, but there are restrictions put in place that prevent free to play pirates from engaging in a good portion of the game’s content. This restriction is uplifted once you’ve purchased (With dollarydoos of course) a subscription! And it’s… Just like how it sounds. It’s… A subscription. (For comparison’s sake, exactly like Runescape’s Membership. Weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual fees etcetc.)There’s so much for you to do, and oh is there so much time!TL;DRAMAZING GAME. Play it. Ten/Ten. Puzzle on, people. Puzzle on. Recommended for everybody. Please play this game. The more the merrier, and Puzzle Pirates could use with a bountiful influx of players!			"

I love that it has the option to play as a group or alone and the chat can be lively.  My group uses Ventrillo for voice communication as well as a separate forum. Head on over to Hunter Ocean (server) and look for Texasborn (me). I have a crew (Titans Rebirth) and flag (Golden Destiny) waiting just for you :)			"

												Fun, entertaining. CONFUSING.Seriously, I don't understand anything in this game. Ranks for how good I am at something? Captain of the Archipelago? Island Admiral? Badges? Doubloons? Pieces o' Eight?NOTHING MAKES SENSE.I'm not saying this game isn't fun, though. I'm saying that while it is fun and entertaining and kills the time, if you want to be a Captain or Island Commuter or something, you'd need to read an online wiki for HOURS researching it all.I suggest you buy this game if you easily understand anything related to this.If not, you can still buy it as the mini-games are quite fun, but don't try to advance way into the game and become a Ocean Master or something.

												I had played Puzzle Pirates since about 2005, shortly after it was released. The game is now 13 years old and it's age has shown. Puzzle Pirates was released in the early days of MMO's, and for many years kept me interested for its involving fun puzzle gameplay and live econemy that was effected by the players. It also helped that for the years of WoW's massive popularity, every other MMO in existence was a WoW clone or so it seemed. The game offers a wide variety of fun puzzles, both single player and multi player, and a large amount of missions such as tournaments and raids to profess your puzzling skill. Many things feel terribly dated and strange compared to the way game are played today, such as the way we move around islands (you could click to walk to areas for no reason or simply teleport to important areas on the map). Large raids could be very difficult to pull off as finding 50 people online to sail into Atlantis could be vastly difficult. If you are a fan of puzzle games, you could have a lot of fun here. The game has aged heavily, and it shows. No amount of updates and polish could save it in that regard unfortunately. It comes down to how you rate a game. Rating this for its time I give it a hearty 5/5, and for today, I could reccomend it only to puzzling fans and more casual gamers. How I dream for a modern re release of this game..			"

												This is a great game to play for all ages and contains many fun, puzzle-oriented minigames that help pass time quickly. However, the game is more than a decade old now and suffers from a lack of active players. After playing on and off for many years, it's kind of sad to see how much the active population has dwindled over time, but I would still recommed playing it for the sake of the entertaining and interesting minigames.

												I've played this game off and on over almost a decade, and despite its childish theme it has the most mature community I have seen on an mmorpg. It's very enjoyable and completely open leaving you free to do as you please. Only downside I could think of is the unfortunate lack of players now-a-days. While the game is still alive and playable with the current numbers, there are only 50-300 players on the busiest servers (And that's counting the people playing poker instead of the game).			"
