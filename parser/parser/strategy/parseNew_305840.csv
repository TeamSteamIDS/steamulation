								Pro's - Amazing attention to detail to ships, stations, and back drops. - Personalized ships for any situation- Forming and commanding an armada - Has a Homeworld/Gothic Armada feel to it- Open world sandbox? - Modding support (which is planned its not currently in game) Con's- U.I. is clunky and makes it difficult to select specific units. - Asteroid Deposits feel Distant from starting points in certain maps- Only have a certain amount of MP for ships to luanch your fleets - Crashes just from changing your graphics settings - Quick battle lags to about 5fps, then crashes- Multiplayer isn't implamented yetKEEP in mind this an early access game some things are bound to change. currently quick battle needs major optimizing, and the Alpha Sandbox is basically an optional tutorial.

								For a game in Early Access, the potential is definitely there. Being able to customize your ships in both appearance and loadouts is a great feature. The visuals are certainly stunning, from the ships to the skybox, there is lots of eye candy outside of just the explosions.The drawbacks are that there is not a whole lot to do at the moment, meaning the single-player campaign is not in place, no Multiplayer, and the ship selection is still fairly small. Of course, these things are all planned features, but the level of communication and activity level from the devs shows that they are committed and passionate about finishing the game.			"

								It has been a while since we've goten a good Real Time Tactics games. So long in fact, when you consider tha Nexus the Jupiter Incident was pretty much the only one. Considering that it is in ALPHA -let me stress again ALPHA (so expect the occasional bug)- it is still a solid product, that has one of the most responsive, consistent, and interactive devs I have ever meet. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the ships beautiful, and the atmosphere being built around in te Shallow Space universe is totally indepth. Shallow Space, even in its current iteration is gently, but surely scratching that itch, left by Nexus.			"

								NOTE: Early Access Review, 2016-04-03TL;DR was TL;DR: Buy it. Right now. Video review at 


YouTube™ Video: Shallow Space Alpha: A Review 

			Views: 3,184		

			Shallow Space is an Early Access space strategy game for all computer platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X). TL;DW? It's not done, but I love it, and if you're a strategy fan, you will too.		

TL;DR: Do you like Rome: Total War? Do you like Homeworld? Then you absolutely must buy this game. Are you a fan of RTSs but never played Rome or Homeworld? Give it a try anyway. Are you a CoD or DOTA player who's never touched real time strategy? Buy it for the pretty spaceships and explosions. Basically, buy it.So, what is it? In short, it's Rome: Total War in space. Line up armies, face them off against eachother. A campaign mode is coming, but is not here yet. It's so much more, as well; ship and fleet customization give it a whole extra dimension of depth above most RTSs. Nonetheless, it's very intuitive and feels incredibly responsive.The good: Graphics and UI are beautiful and very well designed The UI, while not typical of RTS games, is impressively intuitive. I went from ""how do I move"" to feeling like Ender in  about ten minutes, WITHOUT a tutorial. The Tab-key locking and simple move queuing makes complex strategies a joy to plan and execute. The UI again - it's so good, it deserves another entry. With such a complex game to control, and what with not being finished yet, the game could be forgiven for being confusing and hard to learn, but it's not. In addition to what I've mentioned, the game slows when planning moves or when enemies are first detected, giving you the chance to think a little more about strategy - very important for new players. The music. I'm not sure if it's dynamic or not, but it's highly appropriate, highly atmospheric, and greatly enhances the immersion. The fleet maneuver dynamics. Watching an entire flotilla wheel around and steam head first into the enemy, guns blazing, might not be the most astute strategy, but it's certainly impressive. Even just flying a fleet around in space is fun.The bad: The most obvious first: It's not finished. There is no campaign mode and no tutorial. There will be - the buttons for them are there - but they aren't implemented yet. Honestly, I don't think a tutorial is really necessary, but I for one will be happy to see the campaign mode. Minor gripes in re: not being finished yet: I'd like to be able to move the camera by clicking on the minimap, and a few other things like that, but really who cares? It's Early Access. They'll fix it.A few observations:When I first started up a skirmish, I didn't realize it was fully 3D. I accidentally held down the left button during a move and saw the prediction line shoot up into the void, and I thought, ""I could really get lost out here."" That's a great thing, in my book: a space game that really gives a good idea of the vastness of space.I run Linux - an unsupported version, no less - and the game runs flawlessly. I do appreciate that effort from the devs.Conclusion:Buy it. Just buy it. It's only $15, and it's already an incredible game - and it's certainly not going to get worse as Early Access goes on.EDIT: Yes, I posted this review after playing for about 30 minutes. The game really is that easy to pick up.			"

Early Access Review
								I had decided to back this game before it entered early access, based on the old demo, interaction with the developers, and the idea itself. As a reminder, the game sets out to create something of a hybrid between Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Homeworld. To achieve this, it builds around ""squads"" of spaceships commanded by officers that will gain RPG stats and progression later, adding special abilities and deep customization to the mix, and aiming for an expansive, strategy map-driven narrative campaign. Of course, we aren't there yet. At the currents stage of development, the name of the game is instead bug-hunting in the skirmish mode and customization hangar, which offer somewhat limited functionality, but definitely enough to determine the mechanics and decisions the game will be based around. Reaction of the developers to bugs reported on the forums are prompt, with many bugs fixed in the next update, which come in every week or two, and also add more ships and modules to play with. Currently, the tally stands at 3 hangar-stored shiptypes - light through heavy corvettes - 3 cruisers - also light through heavy, for variety - one battlecruiser with one more to be added in the next update, this class boasting heavier weapons, such as a fast-firing centerline gun on the Pleiade's Homan class, two battleships, light and medium and one carrier. Each of those ships offers several slots for weapons and equipment, and different strengths and weeknesses, somewhat dependent on the faction that constructed it. The bulk of the current selection is the sleek, elegant designs of the Pleiades Corporation, with the battleships hailing from the Mineral&Fusion Corp and being decidedly blocky, and the third corporate faction, Incorporated (^^) currently in production for their modular designs, with eleven modules for the cruiser-size alone. All this information is also available on the game's blog (http://shallow.space/blog/) and actively discussed in the forums (http://forums.shallow.space/).While the game is addmittedly in its infancy - alpha stage, in fact - it runs smoothly and crashes are typically around transitions, with the most easily triggered ones already fixed and work progressing on the rare others. While the selection of combat scenarios is small and map scripting limited so far, the combat is fun and proceeds apace, even though balancing is only scheduled for when more assets are placed. The railguns really need to be buffed, for example XD (inside joke). The developers are also eminently approachable, and while they have a set concept, they are willing to listen to user suggestions and discuss their decisions. Production of ship models and coding are currently progressing side-by-side, and for an independent, largely self-financed project, the speed and even more so the quality achieved is quite respectable - and this is by no means the final graphics, many effects are still simplified, with the goal being the sort of stunning vistas space games are known for.In conclusion, while it is understandable that some people may not want to buy the game at this mostly skirmish and ship configuration testing-stage and join the hunt for the remaining bugs, the price is low enough to easily gain entrance now and only play extensively once the beta hits, and the options become more complex and the tactics more varied. The campaign, though, will have to wait until release, to preclude spoilers - but some tidbits of story are on the blog as well.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, I don't play RTS games, so I cannot really compare this game to anything else.  But, although I am unfamiliar with the genre, I can tell that Shallow Space is aiming to be something unique.  Most importantly, the game is in early access, but the developers are very active on their website and on Steam, and respond to almost every post; whether it be feedback, praise, criticism, or just general questions.  Disclaimer: This part of the review is about the game as of 22, February, 2016, and will likely change with further additions/changes to reflect the current state of the game.As for the gameplay, currently it is all about outfitting your ships and building up your fleet to send into battle.  Right now, there are a few Skirmish matches and a simulation mode, which allows you to test out your custom or generated fleets and flotilla configurations against a similar fleet of AI.  You can choose to mirror your exact fleet for the enemy to see how well you perform with certain ships, and possibly see how the AI uses them to better advantage.  There is a lot of depth to how the ships can be set up and positioned, as you have a fully traversable 3d environment.  Plotting the courses for your ships to take is a dream and even at this very basic level of functionality is quite intuitive to use.The ship design is gorgeous.  There is a ton of detail in the models, and the visuals for the backdrops are similarly amazing.  You can customize every ship in your fleet with various kinetic and energy based weapons, outfit them with extra generators for more power, deeper scanning radius, and you can issue further commands from Carrier or Capital class vessels, such as deplying smaller Corvettes or issuing focused-fire commands.  Future updates will include resource gathering and station building/management, added depth to ship shields and weapon mechanics, and much more.There are some crashes and a few bugs here and there, but for Early Access the optimization is great and it runs really well.  Most negative reviews on Steam are from user-error through interface malfunction or bug related issues, but much of that seems to have been corrected by now.The developers have some amazing things planned for this game, and they are very passionate about making it as good as it can possibly be.  A planned feature is to let you take executive control of your ships in battle, and to expand the current skirmish style gameplay into a more open-world one.  If you like space games, and you want to command a massive fleet of warships either to engage in all- out tactical 3D combat, or if you just want to  SEND THEM ALL TO DIE....then this game is definitely one for you.

Shallow space is for the time being, somewhat shallow. But take note that there is constant bug fixing and features getting added, right as I'm writing this. These are very dedicated and social people, they talk, chat and listen. The game itself is solid. There are already fun to be had currently. "

								After UPDATE 7 of the game i have to revisit this review to reflect the current state of things.The game plays without problem now in a Ubuntu system with :AMD Phenom II X4 9654 GB RAM 200 €  nvidia GPU + propriatery driver In my debian 8 + amd 5870 + radeon open driver i cant play the game. (it has 16 GB RAM andi7 cpu so definately RAM in not the main issue here, or cpu power).I keep my first review below-------I love the 3d space movement and using spheres in the UI, My main problem is that although i think my system covers the middle ground of the requirements i experience issues of stability and crashes in game and in the fleet compose screen.So i reccomend this game to linux users with a warning to pay close attention to their system  and driverand assuming that in an Early Access Game those issues are common, ( i hope for not long!)For example my card Radeon 5780 is higher in GFlops from the recommended R9 270X but i have halfthe memory 4GB. With opendriver radeon the game wasnt playaple (graphics were tones darker) and withthe catalyst closed one thinks are better.I'd like to hear from other linux users their experience in relation with their system.Putting the technical issues aside the game is promising and bring fresh ideas in the genre.

								Shallow Space is a deep, unique, and beautiful RTS! Even though the game is only in early access at the moment the devs are frequently updating and adding to the gameplay experience. This will doubltessly be a game for anyone who is looking for a space RTS that has depth and customization. Pros:- Devs are very active interacting and taking community feedback - they're also plugging away at this game basically every 2 weeks a big update hits in the Alpha so far- Customization of ships is pretty awesome a good number of modules to choose from that can really vary a fleet- GRAPHICS!!! I'm not normally a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥ but the ships and the enviornements are beautfully rendered. Even little things like shield resisters lighting up when a ship gets hit blow me away especially considering the game is only in Alpha- The Devs also have a pretty clear roadmap so you should have a pretty good idea of what the game will include which is nice considering sometimes Early Access games offer a lot of vague promisesCons:- Not every system is in the game you might say duh its a EA title, but it does leave for less replayability than the beta or of course the final product will have- only 1 of the 8 factions that will be in the game is playable right now- Some systems aren't clearly explained as I'd like (tooltips)Overall it is shaping up to be a great game! While I can't wait for the final product I have already managed to put 10 hours in it!

It's like discovering a treasure chest in the middle of the desert.Shallow Space is a game that is pretty much still on its early steps, but don't let that stop you from supporting this underrated game.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay is really on its bare minimum as of the moment. The AI's pathfinding is sometimes weird and frustrating at times. The game plays out like Homeworld, so if you enjoy the command system of Homeworld, you'll surely like this one. When the game releases, expect an open-world style strategy game which is persistent. Pretty exciting huh?VISUALSOh the visuals! The visuals are magnificent in this game. I love the ship designs and the weapon designs. The maps look beautiful and unique. I am really hoping for an overhaul of the destruction system because the explosions, for me, does not look glorious enough. Get ready to take screenshots while a battle is going on. Overall, this game has great potential in the future. I am really excited for the Open-World Overhaul update that they promised. I will continue to play and enjoy this game. Go and support the devs by buying this game now! I really hope more people will start to recognize the game and it's developers.			"

								Very much an alpha at this stage but a great idea with lot of development time behind and constant updates.At this stage - Dec 2016 - is a ""framework of a game"" but you can see all the pieces start to be together to make it a final product in a year or so.So definitely recommended to support developers and see how it is going and help a project that is very unique			"

								Well I have backed this project quite a while ago waiting for its completion. The Dev's made a detour on the development early in 2016 opting for a open world feel. This choice was prompted by feedback from backers. I must admit that they made the right choice and this game is coming together amazingly. I play it whenever there is an update and can see the deference in development direction and polish.This project personifies what “steam early access” is all about. Players giving Dev’s feedback and the said feedback being implemented into the game. It is an Alpha… so if you’re not into backing games that’s in development take a miss on this. However, what’s currently in game is exceptionally promising and I highly recommend Shallow Space!  "

								This a very interesting game from what I see, it's kinda like if Homeworld, Nexus TJI, Sins of a solar empire and FTL fused together to make an ULTRA SUPER SPACE 4X RTS!!! or something like that...The things that I like about the game right off the bat is the customization of you fleet. Not only can you change the color of each ship you enlist in your military force, you can also choose their loadouts in terms of weapons, sensor equipment, shield enhancements as well as energy modules. So you have fun blast away your feeble foes and look good doing it.UNLEASH THE PINK BATTLESHIPS!!!Space combat feels very much like nothing I've seen in a space game. It's a beautiful mesh of homeworld ship scaling and Nexus the jupitur incident's combat manuevers, when the capital ships engage they are constantly flying and zipping around it's target dealing damage while fighters fly around with guns ablazing trying set its enemy ablaze! It's very easy to get lost in the beauty of it all.... until you notice that huge explosion at the corner of you screen was your best battleship.Exploration is an amazing thing to see in a game like this. I thought it was going to just be like a traditional rts but instead, it's going to also have 4x elements to the game! Having a persistant fleet and traveling the stars in search of glory sounds like a joyride in my book. As for the cons the most obvious one is that since it's early access you will run into some bugs here and there. Now the one I see a lot are nervous buyers that like what they see but feel a cold shiver go down their neck once they see the tag ""Early Access"", I too also dread to see that tag as well. Also theres no multiplayer and I'm also not sure if it will be implemented since it's primarily a singleplayer game. so you could either wait for release for the game or hop in ready to help make this game become one of the best space games on the market, your choice. Me? I'm blowin up space nerds with my pink battleships :)10/10 would fire all Lazors again			"

								One of a kind space RTS game that is going to be simply amazing once they complete the overhaul.  I have been watching and playing here and there this game for over a year now and you will not find a more dedicated and responsive team behind this game.  The idea was to make something similiar to homeworld type gameplay but now it has been expanded upon until its just its own complete animal and I LOVE IT.I cant speak highly enough of the devs on this, they released this game for a really cheap price because they didnt want to overcharge in there minds for a game that i fully believe should be worth at least DOUBLE what they are asking.  Then in response to player feedback from there first release completely reworked the entire game into and open world RTS game that has taken them serious time to implement.  You just dont find that kind of integrity very often among EA games.  This game has AAA production values and looks stunning.  If you love space games at all BUY THIS NOW!			"

								Game crashes once in a while for me but it's early access so I'll excuse it. Other than that, game looks gorgeous, plays gorgeous. Love the customization options. Looking forward to future updates.EDIT: Game lags and crashes when too many things occur at once. Controls are confusing as there are no keybinds to analyze/customize and the Help window isn't very useful. Can't customize ships like before. I mean, it still looks great but, despite the newest update, I feel like it has lost some of the gameplay aspects I had originally got it for. Overall, I'll still recommend this game since I still hope that it'll be what I expected it to be by the end of early access.			"

Early Access Review
								Shallow Space has a ton of absolutely fantastic ideas and concepts, and the obvious influences from Homeworld and Nexus are very present (The Angelwing has a look-alike as a ship class, and the 3D interface).  The problem, however, is this game needs more time to bake.  The UI needs a lot of work (which I understand they're working on, which is fantastic!), the sandbox elements are very confusing (Yes, I researched, but my google-fu came up mostly empty), and I couldn't figure out how to custom design my ships (yes, I found the wrench), though I admit it's possible overlooked something.  The tutorials are lacking beyond basic controls and ship types/weapons, with no information how to access the more advanced features, but I know this will get fleshed out in time.For now, I say skip, but I'm going to be watching this game.  There's a lot of potential here, and I really hope it gets the development time it deserves, and it looks like it will.On a technical note, when this game crashes, it crashes the most gracefully I've EVER seen a program crash.  It doesn't lock up.  It doesn't crash to desktop.  It goes to console, copies the error into your clipboard, and tells you how to exit.  As a software engineer, this is beautiful design.			"

								My steam account suggests I've played 1,4 hours of this. In reality that is just how much time I've spent rebooting it after crash-to-console and typing 'exit' since this is currently in a rather... let's call it vunerable stage. I have thus far had a chance to click my ships in a direction and watch them get halfway.This is an all to early on the access and I can not see it becoming a finished game even fueled with all the listed ambitions.

								To be clear:  This is definitely an early access game.  The current build crashes frequently and most of the game isn't actually implemented yet.However...what IS implemented is fantastic.  The 3d navigation is fantastic and quickly becomes intuitive.  The UI design needs work but for the most part is both clean and functional.   The way the dev has built their game areas and connected them together is both novel and effective at making you feel the void of space.Combat I think needs more work, as right now your forces quickly devolve into a jousting match, especially if any ships have frontal weapons.  This might be remedied by increasing the weapon range or decreasing ship speed.I will be watching this game with much anticipation.  I think if the Dev continues on the path he is on we are in for a real treat.			"

								I can see what the devs are going for and I like it!  Shades of nexus and homeworld. This is early access so if you like the idea, and remember those games fondly then  I was seriously consider investing in this game. The brief bit I have played; the mechanics of the ship movement and the idea of a more tactical operation of ships of the line are spot on. It needs story, polish, up updates ect but I would defo recommend.			"

								Do I recommend this game? No. Not in its current state. The two modes I saw were - 'Start' and 'quick battle' start drops you into a strange region of space where friendlies fly about their business and you command military ships. Except without any weapons and directive. Quick battle on the other hand was interesting where you can command ships in combat and is the games true focus, but again some ships had no weapons and from what I understand there used to be a ship builder in game and since I cannot access this feature I have to say it was not an enjoyable experience. I had difficulty understanding what was going on in game + the controls are mind numbingly complex and annoying. However I shall stay interested in it's development			"

								!! i've changed my review a bit, because a certain person thinks i'm an 'idiot' because i expect that i have the possibility of playing the game, and that if other say the game is good, my review cannot state otherwise. Even I do not want to be called names at. !!According to steam 'early acces' means: get instant acces and START PLAYING. That last is not possible, so no, i cannot recommend this game. Let me explain.I cannot play the game because i found the controls horrific and the game crashes within 2 till 5 minutes of it. I posted the problem and a developer responded to it. To my question when the problem is fixed, the answer was 'perhaps next week, perhaps not'. Wel, if i cannot play the game and there is a possibility that i can never play the game, then a refund i guess. To the person whome thinks i'm an idiot or my review should be wrong because others state it is a good game: i think it is not. Besides the problems i have with the game itself (this can be fixed in the future) i found the game not that exciting after all.Yes the universe (background) looks awesome, it really does. But ask yourself, do you see this even after a few gams? I do not, the gameplay itself should be awesome, sadly it is not. My advise: let the developpers first prove that they can finish this game till a version where it is playable, then look it up.			"

								This game could be fantastic.  I keep coming back from AAA titles to see if theres been progress on it.  I usually end up stop playing when it crashes.  I have no doubt that with proper funding this will be a huge hit.  It doesn't seem to log play time when it crashes, I have far more than 4 hours playing it.  In fact, I think the 4 hours it logged were from leaving the menu open once and then exiting.This game still needs a lot of work, but can be quite fun for a few hours at a time in its current state.  Be ready for crashes and freezing.  If you think it has potential, give it a thumbs up and tell your friends.  I think it has a chance to be something really innovative and blow the socks off of anything else in the genre.			"

								Unfortunately, I have to change my review to not recommended. I'll refrain fromspeculation here on what / who / how, but there has been complete radio silencefrom the devs for quite a while, and my gut feeling says this project might be deadat this point.-----original review below-----Just launched on EA and still in early alpha stage, I wouldn't recommend it for a general audience yet as there is only a limited set of the features to come implemented. It currently features a small portion of the ships/weapons/modules that will be available, two skirmish battle missions you can play on four maps, and ship customization designer.Having said that, it has huge potential and is on track to become the definite must-have spacefleet battle simulator game of 2016. Sitting kinda in-between the strategic elements of Homeworld and the tactical focus of Nexus, it is a nice breath of fresh air for the genre.			"

								Like what some of the reviewers have mentioned this is something between Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Homeworld.The game right now is still buggy and need lots of work, but the potential is there if the developer were to pump in more contents and fixed up the single payer sandbox.Multiplayer wise would be better to implement after the single player sandbox have been properly roll out.The tutorial still needs alot of work currently there is still bugs, this is very important as new players will need to understand how the mechanic works and hints/tooltips should be added along the way so that it is easier for the developer to update the tutorial at a later stage.Right now the game is really at it's infancy stage where by this alpha build is really bugged and may not work well most of the time.Will wait for updates before updating my review again!

								The base game is in here. The foundation is set and it's up to the developers to create a great game from it. They've taken a sidestep and had to re-evaluate the direction they wanted to take the game after we gave them a bunch of feedback.They've said they now have a clear vision of what they'll build on this foundation, now we'll see how it goes. *The game is WORTH the $15 as it is currently, as updates continue to roll out it'll be worth the usual $30 indie game price.
