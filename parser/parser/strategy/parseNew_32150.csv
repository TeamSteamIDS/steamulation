												Do you like logic games? Then you should play this game because it's amazing and has a ~ridiculous~ number of puzzles in it. It's also very calm and relaxing to boot.Are you dumb? Then this game is perfect, because difficulty ranges from insultingly easy to challenging for autistics, with a nice difficulty curve that increases puzzle complexity as you go. You can stay at a difficulty level as long as you want, or you can jump to higher levels pretty quickly if you want. YOU CAN DO ANYTHINGDo you like sudoku? Then I'm sorry, because sudoku is an inferior baby game for babies. If you are a baby, then by all means go play sudoku instead, you big dumb baby.This game is so fantastic that it will put hair on your chest, even if you're a woman, so if you're a woman and you play this game, enjoy your hairy chest and awesome puzzle game.

												What is this game? Well, first of all it is not really a game but rather a collection of simple mathematical riddles where you have to fill a field of nxn spaces with the correct numbers, as can be seen in the screenshots. There really isn't much more to be said, the game is nicely done and while all the riddles can be logically solved, they will keep you thinking if you choose the grid size that fits your skill.This one has so many riddles, if you're into that kind of mathematical casual game, you have something for many hours. If you go however for achievements, it will be a real grind to get the final one.It can't really be compared to other games, for the reasons given. It rather can be compared to riddles, such as Sudoku, and there it would stand as an own genre.Recommended: Yes			"

												This is a fun puzzle game.Other reviews relate this to Sodoku....and this is not that gameThis is KEN KEN or rather a game where you are given lots of clues as to what numbers go in which squares.  Alot simpler then Sodoku but in some ways more challenging. This game makes you use your math skills and as you play you will notice it is teaching you or getting you to use basic Algebra.  Until you get to the most advanced puzzles which are very thought provoking.I recommend this game for people who like puzzles and basic math skills to solves puzzles.Music is top notch as are the sound effects.  This game also gives you clues as you go...and you can always redo a puzzle if you want to.  "

												Hey, it's this game, and they finally started selling it again!! It's really addictive and a fantastic time waster. The game has gotten some kind of legendary status due to its extended absence from the steam store, so I'll say if you're expecting it to be the second coming of Christ in the form of a puzzle game you may be disappointed. But it's a really solid game that you can sink a lot of time into, and I'm glad it's back.			"

												Pretentious Title: SquareLogic is an abstract puzzle game that takes the concept behind sudoku and twists it to create something far more interesting and engaging.  Like sudoku, the goal is to fill a square grid such that the numbers appear only once in each column and row.SquareLogic's twist on the formula is in the cage system.  Instead of prepopulating the grid with enough numbers to solve the puzzle, SquareLogic divides the board into arbitrary chunks, called cages, and assigns a mathematical rule to each.  For instance, one cage may require its content to sum to 8, another may require its smaller value to divide the larger value 4 times.  Other cages impose inequality operators on the divisions between cages, indicating that one square must contain a larger or smaller number than its neighbor.  The puzzles have extra mechanics beyond the cages as well, including double-puzzles, where two grids contain the same solution but different cages, each providing too little to solve on its own, but enough to solve when paired with the other.  Other puzzle types may leave some cages unfinished and require the player to paint them in as they go.This formula would likely be overwhelming and tedious, especially on full-sized 9x9 puzzles (the game ranges from 4x4 to 9x9).  However, the game automatically removes numbers from tiles when that number is used elsewhere in the column/row, and players can right click any number to remove it as a viable option.  This effectively automates the more menial part of the puzzle, leaving the logical problem solving front and center.  The game also highlights possible valid combinations for cages in a small window, so you don't have to constantly keep a calculator by your side to determine what factorizations are possible for a number set.  Because of these features, the puzzles go by quickly and rarely feel like they're ever wasting your time.SquareLogic isn't flawless though.  The 4x4 puzzles are almost comically easy due to their small size, while the 9x9 and some 8x8 puzzles can become frustrating and tedious because there is simply too much information to pore over.  It becomes less a game of applying logic and more of a mindless search for the next clue you can use.  Luckily, the game still has plenty of 6x6 and 7x7 puzzles, which feel extremely well paced.Another problem is the immediate error highlighting feature.  When you first boot up the game, go into options and turn this setting off immediately.  This setting causes the game to tell you the very instant you make a mistake.  It's a feature that is quite literally too helpful, as it quietly encourages you to start guessing whenever you begin having trouble.  With this disabled though, there's still an incredibly nice hint feature to help you out of jams.  Rather than openly tell you what's wrong, it simply highlights a section of the grid where you should be able to either eliminate possibilites or find a correct number.  It's especially useful on the large puzzles where it's easy to have too many options to pore over.The one last problem is somewhat debatable.  The game simply has too many puzzles.  It has 6 regions, each with a staggeringly large number of available puzzles.  The first area alone contains 4800.  That is not an exaggeration.  While it certainly means the game has incredible value, it can be a little disheartening to know that you're not likely to ever even come close to finishing all of the puzzles.  Oh, and anyone obsessed with achievements would do well to avoid this game for that reason, unless you want to solve all 4800 puzzles in the first region for a cheevo.Overall, for anyone who likes abstract logic puzzles, SquareLogic is pretty much top class.  It's fun, mostly well paced, has a ton of puzzles and lots of good mechanics.  Well worth the $5 asking price.			"

												A great time-wasting puzzle game.If you want challenging, they have challenging grids (9x9).  If you want brain-dead easy (for when your brain isn't working well), they have easy, 4x4 grids.  There are many different solution-types for every grid size, making a huge number of total puzzles to solve (maybe 15-20K).The last achievement is a grind, but I've still played for many, many hours since getting it.  Now if they would just add one for doing ALL the puzzles...  (Actually, I'd like them to make another game instead!)			"

												First off: It astonishes me that this game has had such a long shelf life. I've been playing for years (prior to purchasing it on Steam), and the discussions board is still pretty active. Those who play it, generally keep playing it.So, with a name like ""Everyday Genius,"" it's pretty easy to be scared off; one could be forgiven for thinking this to be a hardcore math game. It isn't. It's more logic puzzle than anything else, although it remains unique. It is not like Sudoku, except that it uses numbers and the process of elimination to reach a solution. Simply put, you're presented with a single grid (to start). Inside each grid is a series of puzzle boxes that contain different mathematical symbols along with the numbers 1 through 4 (I said math isn't really needed, and I didn't lie; keep reading). An equal sign (for example ""4="") inside a box simply means the answer is the number 4. Two boxes reading ""3+"" means that the answer will be 3, and it is achieved by adding two numbers together (1+2). Like Sudoku (which this really isn't), numbers can only be used once in each row or column. Each puzzle within the grid can be several boxes, and they are painted the same color so that you know they are one puzzle (for example, 1x2x3=6, might all be painted green). You get the idea.What keeps it from being less math and more logic is that mousing over any box will automatically show you all possible combinations for the solution. As you solve more puzzles inside each grid, these possible solutions will also change, due to process of elimination. Eliminated numbers will automatically disappear from each puzzle, and you can also manually remove them by right-clicking. Because of this, it really is possible to solve each grid without much math skill.The variety offered here is stunning. You will use greater than and less than symbols; straights (3,4,5,6, etc); even / odd numbers; multiplication and division; and more. The real creativity comes when boxes arrive unpainted, leaving you to color them in with the correct colors. Color them incorrectly, and you'll be solving puzzles that don't exist, meaning your entire grid will be incorrect! Some times, you may have puzzles without any equations; other times, an entire 9x9 grid may consist of nothing but less than or greater than symbols! The difficulty level amps up until you are solving two grids simultaneously, with factors up to 9.There is no time limit, the colors are vibrant, and the music that is here is soothing and ambient. It's casual puzzle solving at its best. There is truly nothing else like it, and it remains a classic...for those of us who actually know about it. Some people, like myself, are still playing it years later, and you'll not solve the 20,000 included puzzles (not randomly generated, by the way) any time soon.  Even better, it can be played with one hand, for those times when my grandson falls asleep on my lap!At less than $5 US, there is not a single puzzle game on Steam that offers this much game time per penny. Highly, highly recommended.Puzzle fans: Join the new  Puzzle Lovers Steam Group, and get bundle and sales info, contact with game developers, contests and more! "

												So glad this game is available again, its the greatest newspaper-style puzzler to come about since sudoku.  literally more puzzles than I could fathom are contained within this game, ranging in difficulty from ""bash your head against the keyboard to win""  to ""bash your fists against the keyboard becuase **** this is hard"", however mistakes are never punished, and you can artificially decrease the difficulty at any point (automatically hide unavaialbe options for this row or column), or even ask for hints.I've sunk more enjoyable hours into this game than I have into 99% of my steam library, its a fun way to unwind.  There are so many puzzles. the difficulty curve is very gentle, but it ramps up to the near impossible.  If you dont like impossible puzzles, dont worry there are tens of thousands of easier puzzles.A great rainy afternoon game for when you're taking a break from HL2.exe engine games.			"

I have to recommend it, because...*whispering* ..its brilliant. So I spent couple of hours and I was playing it.. ye..really playing it. Strange in this Idling Age. Some kinds of puzzles are unique, I didnt play something like this before. I like this game, its nice, simple and rules are clear. I am prefer listening my music or something from youtube - sounds are fine. Puzzles which can be compared to sudoku are in the last region. - I wish only kindly recommend to add some button what allow me to fullfil all cages - when there will be only one solution. I am usually boring when I see one solution and has to manually fullfiling whole grid, what is a bit .. *cough* wasting my time? .):goldenpiece:  4.75/5			"

												Brilliant Sudoku remix. It was taken off the Steam store for about a year, and it’s finally back, so get it before something happens again.If you're an OCD completionist gamer or achievement hunter, however, stay far away. You'll need at least 1000 hours to complete every puzzle. And easily over 100 hours just to get all the achievements. So just be aware of what you’re getting into.But if you like Sudoku and want to see the formula turned on its head in dozens of ways, don't think twice. Grab it. Really great way to keep your mind in shape, even just by playing for a few minutes every day. The word ""Everyday"" in the title is there for a reason.			"

												Oh man I had forgotten about this game, it is a great casual math puzzler similar in style to a SudokuExcept, as you can see in the screenshots there are a bunch of differently shaped colored areas like someone just won at tetris.  Each colored area has a ""rule"" associated with it (you can see those in the screenshots also); for example you might have to make a 4-tiled ""L"" shape's numbers multiply all together and equal 36.  Or rule might be that the area can only contain even numbers. You have to use each number once per column and once per row; once you fill in a tile it automatically removes that number from the rest of the row/column for you.   As the game gets harder the rules get a bit more complex, the areas get larger, some tiles won't have the color filled in, you'll have to use your brain to figure the colors/rules, THEN the numbers for each tile.  There's really no penalty for putting the wrong number in a tile except for your ""shortest number of moves to complete this one"" personal best ego boost.  I also feel it does a very good job of explaining and working each new rule/aspect of gameplay as it is incorporated into the rising difficulty.  By hovering over a tile, if the rule for it's area is known, all possible solutions are shown to you so you really don't have to be super good at math; this is a logic game that uses math as a tool not as a requirement to play.  I happen to like math so I never had to use the displayed possible solutions very often but I admit there were times when it saved me a headache and the game doesn't make you feel bad about it, it displays this for every tile you hover over on purpose so you don't have to feel the pressure of MATH.Overall a fun casual puzzle game that combines simple math, 'sudoku' style numberplay, and logical processes of elimination.  I think the screenshots showing the puzzles will help pull this review together, highly suggest taking another look if this review sounds interesting.			"

The game becomes more difficult gradually until you come to a point where you notice you are actually challenged to solve the puzzle. The variations on the same theme are big with increasing levels of difficulty. I'm currently 7hrs into the game and haven't even completed all the 12 intro levels of every stage. There are 5 stages in total which all are increasing in difficulty. The first stage is a 4x4 grid, then 5x5, etc. Within every stage you get a couple of variations on the theme. The amount of puzzles and depth you get is huge for the amount this game costs.Would recommend to every puzzle enthousiast			"

Almost 120 hours in and I still haven't gotten that final region achievement. Really glad to see this back in the store, I remember it being taken out not too long after I first bought it.

												I'm normally not one to write a recommendation for a particular game in my library; my tastes are quite diverse and everyone else's tastes are different. However, Square Logic is a unique game with a unique place in my gaming heart. It is a puzzle game in its purest form: no animated characters, no falling objects, no globs of goo, no skeletons in the closet, and no laws of physics... but most definitely rules of math.  If you don't know how to add, subtract, multiply or divide, you will have trouble with this game. (If you can't count to 9, you'll have even more trouble, but for that you can watch Sesame Street.) Square Logic is a perfect game to give your brain a daily dose of exercise, a mental twice-around-the-block if you will. Some people will argue such a workout will help you think better in all aspects of your life. To me, it's just fun.The game forum will provide more feedback from those who have already joined the Square Logic addiction. See you in the Beyond!			"

Sudoku except sectioned off into areas of differing sizes and shapes that follow a variety of rules instead of exactly nine blocks that contain the numbers 1-9.  Also most of the grids in this game are smaller than 9x9.  Some puzzles have you work on two grids at the same time, too.There's thousands of puzzles available to complete, so if you never get tired of it this collection will last you years probably.Achievement hunters beware: the last achievement will take a long, long time.

It's pretty peaceful and well-constructed as far as the layout and rampup in difficulty.  I would highly recommend it.			"

												My playtime is not accurate for this game, FYI. First play the HexCells series before you invest in this. They are very similiar, yet much better. This game is more focused on numbers, and mathematical operations. Graphics are real meh - almost subpar. Music is meh. Game play is fun, in a casual coffee-break kind of way. Somewhat addicting.I would almost add that there seem to be too many levels, as well. For example, for each challenge I finished, I unlocked nearly 800 levels. Ain't nobody got time for that. Thankfully you can just 'skip to the main boss challenge thing'. Once again, HexCells gets around this with random levels (hence, infinite).I wish there was a 'maybe' option, but for this title I will give it a thumbs up with the caveat that you know what you are getting into. Its fairly cut-and-dried.			"

												This is a great puzzle game that is a combination math puzzle and Sudoku. Even better is that it starts off easy and then gets harder, with more interesting challenges and variations as the levels increase. There are probably hundreds of hours of play in this game. I bought it 6 years ago after reading a glowing recommendation on Jonathan Blow's blog (he's the creator of Braid and the upcoming The Witness). This is probably the only game in my Steam library that my both my wife and 80-year old father in law enjoy. They love Sudoku but this is so much better.			"

Posted: August 8, 2015
												A lot has been covered about this game already, so I'll contribute what new points I can.  First off, I was hesitant about this game.  Seemed too simplistic, wasn't sure if it would offer enough of a challenge and thought it might, maybe sit on my list unplayed and forgotten.  Months later, this has become my most played game on PC.  (Don't trust my 'hours played' number: I mostly play it on my laptop when I have no connection.)There are THOUSANDS of puzzles for you to take on in this game.  They all work off of the same basic concept, with some fun little variations (such as working with two interconnected boards that share the same answers, but different formulas).  Each one offers a new challenge though and with time you pick up on the patterns and logical shortcuts that you may have missed before.As for difficulty, you really can make it as easy or difficult as you want.  There is no ""real"" penalty for just guessing every single box.  So, if, for some bizarre reason, you want to just barrel through guessing the whole way, you can.  Or, if you're like me, you can aim to finish each puzzle WELL below the Par number of moves with no mistakes and only the bare minimum use of the right-click-to-hide-invalid-numbers function.  If you're extremely sharp and/or have too much free time, you can also hide the box that shows the possible solution combinations.  Not an issue when you're dealing with two or three boxes, but at five or six it becomes a little more impractical; even with the solutions, you still have the challenge of figuring out the logical placement of everything.  You could be at a single puzzle for hours.If you use a laptop like I do, you'll also probably appreciate the low demand it will place on your battery and system resources.  Makes for many hours of what we nerds consider ""fun.""			"

												The interface looks a bit odd if you just look at the screenshots but it works remarkably well when you're using it. All the numbers are big enough so you can fully concentrate on the math/logic in your head and not on having to pixel-perfect click on the right numbers. Very quickly you'll find yourself in ""the zone"" clicking away and moving to the next puzzle.The game mechanics are simple, just click on the number you know must be correct and the same number will disappear in the rest of the row/column.When you know a number can't possibly be in a certain square you can right-click on that number to hide it. Eventually you’ll end up with all squares filled with the correct number.These are fast-paced math puzzles (don't worry, without a timer) and you have thousands  of puzzles to choose from in a variety of configurations, all organized in groups from easy/medium/hard. You will not run out of puzzles any time soon and it's a great way to pass the time doing mental gymnastics.p.s. The solutions on the right hand side can be turned off in the settings in case you also find them to make the puzzles too easy, at least in the first couple of locations.			"

												If you like Sudoku or logic games, this is the game for you. It's like an upgraded version of Sudoku, making it more fun and challenging than your average number puzzle. There are more than enough puzzles, all with interesting mechanics and twists. The soothing music goes well with the overall theme, which really polishes a well-made game. It even has achievements and Steam-cloud so you could have your profile on multiple computers. If they ever make a sequel I would instantly preorder it. Highly recommended!			"

												The only sudoku-like game on Steam and a pretty good one. I can't play it for very long for some reason. I guess it's only meant to be played a few puzzles at a time.Plenty of new mechanics are introduced in every world to keep it fresh. There's enough there to keep you going for ages, too, as the game contains a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of randomised puzzles (I'm talking thousands of puzzles here.) Pick it up for under $5 if you can.			"

												This is a kenken or kendoku game: it is similar to the game of sudoku but involves more math. If that doesn't scare you off, then SquareLogic has some truly fun and challenging puzzles, being just different enough in approach from sudoku to offer a different experience. I realize not everyone here is a puzzle (or a math) fan, so I'll note that there's a demo version you can try out to see if it is your kind of game (though the demo doesn't really let you get into any of the difficult puzzles, IIRC).

Bullet points  ""Sudoku on steroids""  More puzzles than (almost) anyone could ever play through  Fresh game mechanics that make Sudoku ""new again""Full reviewIn a previous review I called Hexcells ""Minesweeper on steroids"" (an assessment behind which I gladly stand), and in the same vein I'm going to introduce SquareLogic as ""Sudoku on steroids"".  Again, you have a game inspired by an original, but taken to wholly higher levels with new gameplay mechanics.With ""Pretentious Title: SquareLogic"" (thanks to Deluxe Breakfast Companion's review for that one...I had to stifle a giggle) you're taken beyond the scope of regular Sudoku as the board gets divided up into arbitrary sections, each with its own independent ruleset.  Then -- in contrast to Sudoku which starts you out with some cells already filled in -- you fill out the entire grid, using the rules for each section (in the game's terms, each ""cage"").  The result is a wide variety of puzzle times that don't get stale like regular Sudoku (for me, anyway).The other nice thing about SquareLogic is its wide variety of assists.  You can configure it to immediately highlight errors, show you a list of possible combinations for the ""arithmetic cages"".  (SquareLogic is not a math game, but some basic arithmetic does organically result for this particular cage type.  We're talking adding and multiplying single-digit numbers.)  These two features can be turned on and off independently, and there's also a hint button (which you can choose not to click).  In addition, it's possible to ""cross off"" candidate numbers (for example, if you know a particular cell cannot contain a particular number); for an additional challenge, you can solve the puzzles without using this feature (easy enough in the beginning, but try that on a 9x9 grid!).The background music -- I mean, it's not really music per se, more ambient soundscape -- suits the ""deep thought"" premise of the game nicely.  However, the audio is never part of the gameplay, so you can definitely play with any other tunes you like in the background (or silence).At the end of the day, this seems like an obvious choice for a Sudoku fan who's looking to grow into something more -- I won't say more challenging, because the harder Sudoku puzzles I've found are certainly more than challenging enough for me at least -- varied.As for replay value, if anybody ever finds out, let me know.  There are 20,670 puzzles in the game, so I'd hazard a guess that once you've completed the set, you can probably start over from the beginning and not remember the ones you've already solved.  :)If you like this game, check out...

												If you like sodoku, jigoku, or anything similar, you'll think this is an absolute bargain for the price tag.I particularly love the combination of puzzles all combined into one, and having to solve two boards side by side. Don't worry about the later puzzles being too complex though; you'll have more than enough time to go through slowly and complete puzzles at your own pace.Having played this for over 150 hours so far, I know it's worth at least four times the price tag for the value I've already gotten.

												A very nice logic puzzle game.  Starts simple with 4x4 squares, and later becomes quite complex with all the various rules and larger squares to work with.  Probably harder then Sudoku given you're generally given no free squares to work with.  Even with all the rules, all puzzles can be solved logically.  The large volume of puzzles will certainly keep you busy for some time.			"

												Definitely a great little puzzle game. Don't be put off if you're not someone who loves Sudoku--even though the layout is similar, this isn't a straightforward Sudoku game, and there are many aspects of the game that make it easier and more interesting than regular Sudoku. For example, the game automatically removes numbers that will not satisfy the requirements of the grid, and notifies you if you have made a mistake. It also offers the option of displaying all of the possible mathematical operations that satisfy the conditions of the grid, but you can turn this off if you like more of a challenge.The first puzzles are very easy, but the challenge gradually increases, and there is a variety of puzzles to keep things interesting. Sometimes there are ""Hidden Cage"" puzzles, where you have to work out for yourself which rules apply to which squares, and sometimes there are ""Double Board"" puzzles, where you work out the solution by comparing two boards. You're not always doing the same puzzle over and over. If you want to do that, though, there are literally hundreds of similar puzzles to keep you occupied if you don't feel like grappling with a new puzzle type yet. Each type of puzzle is available in Easy, Medium, or Hard.One of the best things about this game is that it lets you take a ""challenge puzzle"" to unlock the next set of puzzles whenever you like. You don't have to complete all of the puzzles on each level before being able to unlock the next one. This is helpful if you find the first few levels too easy--you can keep skipping ahead until you find a level of difficulty that you like.Overall, a very good puzzle game that should offer hours of entertainment for a small price. Definitely worth the money.			"

												This is a great puzzle game. A lot like Sudoku in which you can only have a number appear once in every column and row. However, from there on out it has way more mechanics. In Sudoku, the 9x9 Grid is divided into 9 Boxes of 3x3, the Boxes themselves are arranged 3x3 as well. In SquareLogic the Boxes are called ""Cages"". And the cages aren't restricted to only on Mechanic either. In Sudoku, that Mechanic was that the 3x3 Box has to have 9 numbers in it, none of them repeating, and the Box had to be 3x3. In SquareLogic, the Cages can be any number of squares and in any shape. As for the Mechanics, there's a lot of them: For example, a 3 Square Cage has to have those 3 numbers add up to 8. So those 3 numbers(for the 3 squares in the Cage) could be 1+5+2, or 2+2+4, etc. You still have to make sure that numbers don't repeat in the same column and row, but numbers can repeat in the same cage, just not column and row. There's other Mechanics for cages too, mostly math, like all numbers subtracting to a certain value, multiplication, division, have number 3 numbers in consecutive order, etc.The game introduces the Mechanics slowly, so you're not overwhelmed. You start with a few Mechanics on a 4x4 Grid, and work your way up to a whopping 8x8 Grid with a large amount of mechanics. There's plenty of convenience mechanics too. To make it easier to narrow down numbers, all numbers are listed in the Squares so you can just left click to input that number as the Squares choice, or right click that number to cross it out. You can use your keyboard as well. And when you input a number into a square, that number is automatically crossed out from all the other Squares in the Row and Column. The hint system is great as well. It starts off with simple hints, then get's less subtle, then blatantly tells you the answer or just crosses off a number. The game can be solved with purely logic though. The Hints do a very good job of not making you feel like a moron and just nudging you in the proper direction.As I'm sure you guessed by now, there's math involved. But you don't need to do any calculations if you don't want too. Let's say for example you're playing on a 8x8 Grid, which means you have numbers 1-8 to play with. Now let's say you're working on a 6 Square Cage in which all 6 numbers must multiply up to 560. You don't need to do any math at all, because when you highlight that Cage, the Solution List Mechanic pops up on the right. This list will show all possible combinations(remember that numbers can repeat within a Cage, just not row/column) in one easy to read list. If you've crossed out numbers your self or done automatically as you've filled in the rest of the puzzle, the Solution List will automatically factor out all numbers that can't be used anymore in that cage, whether it be due to crossed out numbers or simply because the Cages arrangement means numbers cant repeat themselves without being in the same row/column. Solutions that are still possible are Green, while Solutions that are no longer possible are Red.Another thing worth mentioning is the ridiculous amount of puzzles in the game. The game is divided up into 5 Regions. Each Region has around 6-8 Locations that must be done in order. Each Location has 12 Practice Puzzles and 1 Challenge Puzzle, in which completing the Challenge Puzzle Unlocks the next Location, and finishing all the Locations Unlocks the next Region. Usually each Location gives you a new Mechanic to play with, and once you complete a Locations 12 Practice Puzzles + 1 Challenge Puzzle, you unlock an additional 787(That's right, Seven Hundred and Eighty Seven) Puzzles that all include the Mechanic learned at that Location plus all previous locations. The 787 Additional Puzzles are divided into 3 difficulties settings: Easy, Medium, and Hard. So if you're having trouble with a Mechanic, there's PLENTY of puzzles to practice with. If we just go with a basic 6 Locations per Region, that's 30 Locations. 12 Practice Puzzles + 1 Challenge Puzzle + 787 Additional Puzzles = 800 Puzzles per Location. That's a bare minimum 24,000 Puzzles in SquareLogic.There's more stuff to the game, such as other fun mechanics and convenience features, but I'll let you discover it. If you love puzzle games, I definitely recommend SquareLogic. If you love Sudoku I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND SquareLogic, especially if you're looking for more in your Sudoku.Edit: For some reason I can't post large reviews in one go. I have to copy paste the first half, submit, then edit, and finally post the second half, so thats the reason for the edit. If anyone knows why, please let me know.			"

There are a ridiculous number of puzzles here, and a good number of different puzzle types so even if you don't like one or two you can find other that are really good. The par number of moves thing is a fun incentive to think harder about what moves you're making. The 9x9 puzzles can be a bit overwhelming but I love playing through the smaller ones. 3 different difficulties for each puzzle type and size mean it's easy to find one to do quickly or one to take a while on.

												If you want to keep your mind going in life then this is a great game to play to not go crazy. There are puzzles that can take you 10  secs to beat and there are certain puzzles that might take you hours. It is a great game for anyone who is using numbers and colors together. The overall feel of the game is smooth and makes sense. Sometimes you have to guess to figure out a certain number or color. But if you just sit down and think it through you can complete any of the puzzles this game has to offer. This game is great for anyone ready to use  their mind. This game is great for people just waking up in the morning and wanting something to get their minds going. Its a great casual game, but can be great for those hardcore gamers that want get good at thinking. This is also a great game for any parent wanting to get their children into learning numbers and colors it will teach them simple adding and subtracting. I love playing this game and I highly recommend it!			"

												If you think fitting integers from 1 to 8 in a grid is too simple for you, think again. Square Logic revolutionalises puzzles with numbers. Much more challenging and entertaining than Sudoku. Very easy to start playing, and it'll get progressively harder along the way. This is the game to keep your brain from being rusty over a holiday.			"

												A very nice logic puzzle game.  Starts simple with 4x4 squares, and later becomes quite complex with all the various rules and larger squares to work with.  Probably harder then Sudoku given you're generally given no free squares to work with.  Even with all the rules, all puzzles can be solved logically.  The large volume of puzzles will certainly keep you busy for some time.			"

												One of the absolute best logic-deduction-only games so far. With such a ridiculous amount of puzzles, you won't have enough time to ever finish it most likely.			"

												I like this game alot, its uniqu (ive not seen anything like it) and the logic required to solve some more advanced puzzles is very satisfying for those who enjoy logic and puzzles.  I never learned my times tables in school and even without them I am able to solve these puzzles through logic.  For the higher dificulty puzzles which I enjoy playing more because they are more challenging, I find knowing the multiplication tables or at least part of them usefull because it helps to reduce the posibilites knowing for example that nothing multiplied with 3 would equal 8, you can immediately remove 3 from the options.  This game has some relaxing music and challenging logic puzzles with mathematics integrated.Does not go full screen on my system however it turns out to be a benifit being able to minimize the game between work periods.
