												Warning: running this or any of RuneStorm's other games can brick your system.The installation manifest for this game includes an outdated, buggy .NET installer, which on some systems will force a reboot without asking for permission or giving an option to cancel, and afterwards, the system will be put into an infinite loop of automatic rebooting because the installer continually runs (and fails) on startup.Despite this being a known issue from their previous games, the developer did nothing to address it for any of their titles. Apparently they think it's acceptable to brick users' systems and expect us to put in the time and work required to research and fix it.To that end, in the hopes of mitigating the loss to others, I will go one better and at least provide a shortcut to anyone in need of a solution: when the installer fails with an error message, open Task Manager (from Ctrl-Alt-Del menu) to terminate the dotnet* process before closing the installer (this prevents the imminent reboot that will otherwise happen), and then download and run the NetFXRepairTool from Microsoft to stop the installer from running again on the next boot.Note, however, that Steam will still not see a complete installation, and you will need to terminate the dotnet* process again when you try to run the game in order to get past the setup stage.

												Rooks Keep seems like it would be a good game, but the problem is that the multiplayer is completely dead, there are no servers for this game anymore, literally none, and in May the dedicated servers were shutdown.The game has multiple modes to play, there are two chess modes, classic and combat chess, and then a range of arena modes, which really feel like they are intended to be played online.from playing against bots (because i couldn't play with human players), the combat seemed enjoyable and it allows you to upgrade your character during a game with points you get from killing other players, you can buy upgrades such as increased damage and movespeed, and there are quite a few different things to choose from.However the main reason i am not recommending this game is because bots will only keep you entertained for so long, and most of the reviews of this game were written a long time ago, so there was probably a decent playerbase at the time they were written, but a game like this without multiplayer servers is definately not worth the asking price, I don't think many people would buy something like CS:GO without multiplayer, and this game shouldn't be any different.TL:DRDon't buy this game unless you are ok with playing alone with bots, or there is a price drop.

												From the creators of several excellent Unreal Tournament mods comes a retail game that feels like... an Unreal Tournament mod. A good, polished mod but for 15 eurobucks?There's two chesspiece armies fighting it out in melee, every piece is a different class with different weapons and abilities. In most modes you gain points from killing enemies which you can either spend on passive skills or save them to spawn as more powerful chesspieces. Of course, the pieces are not equal and killing a queen with a pawn is difficult and rewards you with more points. The arena deathmatch modes are fine but if you've ever played UT(3) in melee-only you'll soon notice that despite the new character models and levels it feels just like UT combat with no guns. I find Unreal Tournament's melee janky and prefer something like Mount & Blade or Chivalry when it comes to swinging swords. I don't know if the online side is populated since I played this with bots and like in UT, playing with bots customized to one's level works fine.The more surprising gamemode is Combat Chess which is actually quite similar to Archon if you're familiar with it. Two almost-but-not-quite-identical armies play on a normal chess board, but when a piece attacks another they're moved to a dueling arena where you assume direct control of your piece and fight to the death, with nice gory decapitations. I think this is the most unique side of the game.There's also a real chess mode if you want something like Battlechess where you can watch the pieces fight it out on the board that is soon covered in blood.The game itself looks nice and plays well if you enjoy Unreal Tournamenty combat with a nice suite of mutator customization options, but I'm not sure if it's worth the full price. You can get Unreal Tournament 3 for far less and install melee and gameplay changing mods to your heart's content.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Rooks KeepDeveloper:  RuneStormPublisher:  RuneStormGenre:  Chess HybridGeneral ImpressionRooks Keep is derivative form of chess that successfully combines action with beautiful graphical details, including plenty of gore as well. While it shall keep you entertained for quite some time, the AI itself may not suffice your need for a proper challenge. And then comes around,  the main flaw of this game: the multiplayer scene for this title is next to none. Still, if the singleplayer modes alone will convince you to try it out, know that it’s running very well on older systems even if the game looks and sounds better than most chess simulators. Any such title that strays off the classic path, deserves attention as chess itself is the type of game that can’t be improved by much. Not that it might need to, but some innovation through diversity is always welcome.Strong Points+ Beautiful  graphics and sounds.+ Alternative chess modes.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Lacks a storyline.- Sparse multiplayer community.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

Early Access Review
								*NOTE: This is an Early Access review meaning it will be a lot shorter than a normal review but will still explain what I thought about it. A full review will be published once Rooks Keep has released. Welcome to the official blood and gore feast! Rooks Keep is an arena-based, melee combat game. A variety of game-modes, characters, maps and mutators are available. It also has Chess modes, mod support and decapitation! It's available on Steam for and is being published and developed by RuneStorm.Rooks Keep is a very gory, but very entertaining fighting game. It all starts out with how well done the combat system is. There are three main parts; attacking, defending, and parrying. There are light attacks and heavy attacks, each with their own spot on your mouse. You use your mouse for most of the actions you're going to do, whether it's attacking or parrying (defending is a control on your keyboard, which is still easy to use). The tutorial allows people to learn the controls very quickly, but people will figure out that the controls are hard to master, due to the varying moves that the AI/other players throw at you.That's another thing. The AI that you face is pretty darn good at the combat system. Although it can be improved for every game mode, it will definitely give you a challenge. You may be able to take on one AI at a time, but when you get bombarded with two or three at a time; you're going to die a headless warrior. There are also multiple different classes to choose from, which gave me a sense of freedom. The skill points, which go into play with what class you can choose, reminded me of Star Wars: Battlefront 2. In Battlefront 2, you had to have enough points to play as a certain class and it is the same here. That being said, the unlockable classes aren't necessarily better because certain classes -with the right enough skill- have the potential to defeat them. That also goes with every class and that sets up a weird ""rock-paper-scissors"" element to it that I haven't seen in any other arena combat-based game. To add on, you can also use the skill points to add extra, helpful ""tiers"" to your character that will allow for a stronger fighter.The last thing that really got my attention was all the game modes given. For an arena combat-based game, you'd expect the typical team deathmatch and deathmatch gamemodes. RuneStorm went the extra distance and introduced a chess game mode and a combat chess game mode. The combat chess is my favorite because you get can go toe-to-toe as a pawn fighting the queen of the other team and you might even win the fight! There are also a few other game modes including Conversion, Last Man Standing, and even Team Last Man Standing. For all these game modes, RuneStorm provided a ""Mutators"" tab where you can alter game options and change it to how you would like it whether you want powerups, slomo enabled, or even for combatants to run.The only issues I had were a few texture pop-ins here and there with the ground and the player models. As I stated above, the AI will provide for a challenge, but they can definitely be smarter.8.5/10 - You can view it here: http://encryptgames.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/rooks-keep-early-access-game-review/ "

												This game has 64 player -epic- AI bots and/or human players in a mix of Unreal Tournament meets Chivalry/MountnBlade in various modes of Team Deathmatch.It's beautifully optimized, the netcode is amazing (UDK) the combat is sooo well thought out.....and to top it off, you can create a match vs a player or AI in chess similar to the ""Battle VS Chess"" game on Steam...but with waaaaaay better real-time combat.  Waaay better.10/10 Bought 20 copies, shared with friends.  Runs on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer like a dream and looks so boss <3			"

								After a very long wait finally there is something in the place of Rune! The fact that this game is 100% lan-able is great! The one thing chivalry did not do right. Great fun! Easy to get into hard to master. And when you get bored of killing your buddies retire to a good old fassioned game of chess! A rather bloody one that is! If you enjoyed games like The Reconing and Rune and Chivalry this is a must buy!! The price is so good its like if its on sale already!			"

								Gorgeous game, for starters.Second, the gameplay is quite good once you can get into it.  The chess archetypes make for some interesting playable characters, and the imbalanced nature of the character tiers means battles are extremely dynamic with people running in to beat on pawns and running away again when a rook or a queen shows up.Graphics are great, there's a huge amount of game and server customization, and lots of game modes to choose from.  Speaking of which, the chess gametypes were a really nice addition to the game, and says something about the people who put it together.I have been waiting eagerly for the Steam version of the game so that we can finally have some proper multiplayer support.

												When I tried to install this game,  ""Microsoft NET Framework 4 setup"" continued to turn off my computer. This was a infinite loop.  If you are in this infinite turning off hell, you have to activate ""Task Manager""(Ctrl+Alt+Delete) and end the Microsoft NET Framework 4 setup in ""process"" tab before computer has been tured off and after that uninstall ""Rooks Keep"". In another way, just start computer in safe mode and uninstall  ""Rooks Keep"". To install ""Rooks Keep"", I think the easiest way is to use ""dotnetfx_cleanup_tool"".http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip If you activate dotnetfx_cleanup_tool, just uninstall ""Microsoft NET Framework 4""(maybe uninstalling NET Framework All version is better). This will take several minutes. After turning off the computer, activate Steam and install ""Rooks Keep"". After that, there will be some messages to urge installing ""NET Framework 4.5.2"". If you completed the installation process once, installing another newer version of NET Framework has no problems. Just for the gamer who is in trouble like me! Enjoy it!			"

												It is a good game with enjoyable combat. There's some chess (two types, normal and one where your characters fight out to see the victor) and there's various modes you can play like Last Man Standing. I've thoroughly enjoyed playing this alone with bots. The combat is gorey and heavy hitting, it won't be long until you have been completely covered in the blood of your enemies.Of course that's where the biggest problem lies. Multiplayer. This game has no dedicated servers, and there are no people hosting (as far as I have seen anyway). This is a massive hit in the face since the game promises multiplayer in the game descriptiojn itself. This means that you will most likely only play with bots most of the time.Personally, I've been pretty happy with the game. The combat feels to satisfying and the game itself is fun and well made, I'm not even really bothered about the multiplayer thing since my ping is so high here in china.			"

												Wow... first impression: VERY impressive! Loved the battle chess mode (for all, who don't need the ""3D animated moves""... you can disable it! Of course it is obligatory for the battle scenes). The fighting mechanics are well done and the system manages to keep up a good balance for attackers/defenders (since you can completely undermine the rules of chess in this game mode).Unfortunately, I believe, that's all the game is good for... Normal chess can be played on a gazillion free platforms and the rest is rather a cheap version of Chivalry to me. Those who enjoy multiplayer meelee games, should give it a try. You get the game for under a Buck on {LINK REMOVED} (sorry steam!)Anywho... My recommendations for this game. BB!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Rooks Keep is a game developed by RuneStorm, the same people behind the wildly popular Viscera Cleanup Detail games, this game was developed before the Viscera Cleanup Detail series sprang to lifeRooks Keep seems like a good game, but the problem is that the multiplayer is completely dead. The are no longer official game servers provided by the game company and there are no other servers for this game anymore, literally none, nothing... so basically the online portion of this game is non existantThe game has multiple modes to play, there are two chess modes; classic and combat chess, and then a range of arena modes, which really feel like they are intended to be played online from playing against bots, the combat seemed enjoyable and it allows you to upgrade your character during a game with points you get from killing other players, you can buy upgrades such as increased damage and movespeed, and there are quite a few different things to choose fromHowever the main reason I am slightly sceptic about recommending this game is because bots will only keep you entertained for so long, and most of the reviews of this game were written a long time ago, so there was probably a decent playerbase at the time they were writtenBut a game like this without multiplayer servers which is heavily dependant on playing multiplayer is definitely not worth the asking price and I don't think many people would buy something like Counter Strike: Global Offensive or the Left 4 Dead series without multiplayer, and this game shouldn't be any different... RECOMMENDED :)  Provided it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given away to you for free, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  For its full price  "
