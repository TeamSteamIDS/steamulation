AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Howler Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: 2D; Simple; Puzzle; Strategy My Overall Grade: B- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Casual gamersREVIEWI love epic AAA titles that take three full work-weeks to complete just as much as the next guy; but sometimes I also enjoy those short and simple games that are easy to digest after a long day. The Howler is a great example of the latter. It has simple, straightforward mechanics with a pleasing, intimate art style. It is short and gratifyingly challenging without being too frustrating. And there is also an optional Voice-Mode which can be used to add a little dash of flavor to the experience. The game is comprised of a small amount of short levels. Most of them won’t take long to beat. The puzzles involve simple two-dimensional movement which requires timing and precision. It is all very simplistic. But if you want to try out something a little different, you can enable Voice-Mode, which will allow you to use your voice (via humming, whistling, or blowing into the microphone) to control the game. It’s kind of fun at first, but some of the harder levels require a lot of precision and it can be real difficult in Voice-Mode.The hand-drawn artwork is also very nice.  It is a pleasing mix of intimate, curious, and casual. It isn’t the most refined or aweing art, but it is unique and full of character, and it fits the game well.The last thing I’ll mention is that it is very short. To me, short games are great because I love variety and hate leaving things unfinished; but I know some people may have a problem with it, so be aware. Also, I generally try to not discuss price in my reviews, because everyone values a dollar differently depending on their lifestyle. But in this case I do want to say that I feel like the developers have priced this game reasonably considering its length. And so, like I suggested earlier: it is a nice, little game for those times you want something lightweight and intuitive. If that sounds like something you would be interested in, I would recommend you give The Howler some consideration.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!The most outstanding feature of The Howler is the art style for sure. Hand drawn art for both background and foreground objects. The later actually appear like paper cut-outs attached to the former.Gameplay is simple and straight forward! You are only required to click the left mouse button to control your balloon (click = balloon will rise, no-lick = balloon will drop). Movement to the left/right is controlled by flowing air currents; e.g. if you want to move to the right, just let the balloon rise or drop to the corresponding current, but beware of sharp objects that will let it burst by touching.The object in each level varies from simply getting to the landing spot to picking up packes, dropping them off and land.As much as I enjoy my time with The Howler, there is one important thing to mention, which might be shortcoming for some people: There is NO REAL FULLSCREEN support, that is, even if you go fullscreen, the game itself takes place in a realtively small window!

												It's pretty, but it shouldn't be a PC game. The mechanic - tap to go up, let go to let fall - is perfect for a mobile game and frankly silly on a PC.Their main gimmick is that if you have a mic, you can use audio instead of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes, but it doesn't work. It relies on the machine having a built-in audio source. There are no options to choose input, and so if it doesn't automatically work there's nothing you can do.For the main gimmick, this is pretty shoddy, because without it it's a lacklustre jetpack joyride on PC.I do really like the art style, though.Fair warning, I got this for free from a marketing group.

												2.99 on steam or 1.99 on app store. Totaly worth it.It a simple game to play as you talk to your ballon and yell at it to go ""UP,UP,UP!""The hardest part is trying to go quiet when you want to scream for your ballon to make it through that hole while decending down.Artwok is beautiful, and it's got that addicting factor of...just one more time I swear....only cons I have are-no full screen and no options to make it so.-I can't find how to close the game without X'ing it out-can't access settings while in game or return to main menu so you have to close game in order to change mic sensitivity or w/e.-the option to make a quick,loud sound to drop a bomb/parcel is too finiky to work well as I drop stuff without even yelling that loud or sharply-TOO SHORT I WANT MORE!!!All in All again totaly worth the price of a cup of coffee.Do Play....

												I will admit, I only bothered to look at this game due to its very cool graphical style. Though, on watching the gameplay video and reading the main synopsis present on the store page, I became fearful of a very real possibility. Namely, that hiding behind an excellent artistic direction is a shallow, and probably irritating, gimmick driven “game”. Not unexpectedly, I’m obliged to report that my suspicions proved accurate, but also that my discoveries come with several reservations.First, the gameplay itself (and this should be obvious from the accompanying trailers), is minimal. The goal is to slowly raise and lower your balloon in tune with the weather patterns, which push you left and right, to varying degrees, and land at some designated point. As the game goes on, you’ll have to contend with the added complexity of doing this several times per level, and occasionally even drop things down holes or bombs on unsuspecting flying spiky balls. Playing with a standard mouse, this gets boring, and at times irritating, though mostly due to the slow nature of your balloon and having to wait for your chance to fail again. Chances are, you will have to reset levels several times due to popping or floating too far off-screen. This is where the gimmick comes in, and the developers clearly hope that people haven’t learned from every other throwaway peripheral and gimmick that console makers try to push down our throats. By using your mic, you can control the balloon with your voice. Or any manner of sound, I suppose, so long as you can easily fluctuate it. This is also where my first aforementioned reservation comes in. If you can entertain yourself for hours on end by making stupid noises in the dark, than by all means, play and thoroughly enjoy The Howler. If you’re considering this as a fun diversion for you and your drunk friends, ask yourself this – when was the last time you were able to keep a group of drunks quiet for more than 5 seconds? If you can’t answer that question, than you’re better dusting off the ol’ Kinect for another go around of drunk digital soccer.Now here’s my second reservation: the art design. It is superb, often ranging from the melancholy to the downright foreboding. And of course, the Wolf. It really bothers me that such a fantastic art style is wasted on a game like this. Given that this mediocre excursion could be beaten in little more than hour (provided you’re forced to reset as often as I had to), than I would seriously consider recommending this title given you have a fondness for such things. If you can forgive, or at the very least tolerate the gameplay, than you may have a better time than I did, if only for the joy of viewing the set pieces. Know, though, that for some reason the game is limited to a small window (surrounded by a large black border in fullscreen), and cannot appear to be changed. While this keeps the art crisp and clean, I am disappointed that I couldn’t have a closer look at some of the better murals.The Howler is based off of a book, and you’ll see a direct link to it on Amazon.com in the game’s menu. It’s a shame that there is absolutely no exposition or plot to the game’s events, offering only a quick phrase explaining your mission for whatever group and off you go!. Perhaps it might have alleviated the boredom of the actual gameplay mechanic to have given it all a more defined purpose. In any case, The Howler is something you probably shouldn’t even bother playing in the first place. Unless you really think you’re going to enjoy making stupid noises into your mic for an hour, or absolutely refuse to use google to find the game’s sublime artwork, I’d recommend you at least find a better mobile port to spend your time on.

												TL;DR: The Howler is a slow, extremely tedious game that will test your patience and relies on an art style that doesn't compliment nor is complimented by either the gameplay or the sound design, causing frustration (did I mention that you gotta wait for everything, even bringing the pause menu is slow) especially when using the gimmick, sound-based control feature.The Howler is another gimmick ""arty"" indie game that hides its more than shallow and lackluster gameplay behind supposedly stunning art and visuals; which I normally have no problem with but in this case the graphics are far from gorgeous: I presume it's supposed to fit into a certain art style given that (quote from the game's store page) ""All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters."" but this art style is not meant for games, it just doesn't work and looks like a scanned colored pencil piece of drawing. It has terrible affordance and does a very poor job at showing what element is going to pop the balloon and what is just part of the background.Still going on the art: the sound design is dull and repetitive, as if they forgot to implement any sound and rushed it at the last minute.I will however admit that the first time the balloon approaches the iron Wolf, and the jaw opens with a deep, metallic sound, it was pretty cool. The gameplay, even though not the most important part in this kind of game, barely exists: it's roughly clicking and waiting with little challenge other than testing your patience.The sound control gimmick (note that I'm consciously using the word gimmick rather than feature) is forgettable. It's not bad, but it's far from good. It's forgettable for the very reason that it has little to no gameplay to be applied on!And regarding the level design, I'm hesitant whether it has been made by someone with little experience or someone simply lazy: it's over-simplistic and very repetitive.As a conclusion I'd like to address some errors in the store page user-defined tags:- Adventure: No. It's certainly not an Adventure game.- Simulation: I can see why this tag, but it barely simulates anything.- Strategy: Oh please, strategy? No. Strategy is term that defines long-term thinking and process. Even the word ""tactical"" would be more fitting here.- Action: Ahah... If your definition of Action is: click-wait-click-wait-wait-wait-click... then yes, maybe.- Shoot 'Em Up: Oh come on! Now that's just blatant lies.- Sports: What the f...- Puzzle: Nope. The Howler is very simplistic so no thinking requiered.- Difficult: No. Tedious.I give this game the rating of 15/100			"

												A simple idea made great with awesome hand-rendered charcoal/paint/ink art. Looks easy at first but very quickly becomes a highly precise battle against the wind and gravity. Despite only running in a 4:3 black bordered box or window, The Howlers representation of a steam-punk Lithuanian capital Vilnius remains hugely atmospheric. Excellent.			"

												I was very surprised by this short but sweet game, particularly considering how cheap it is. The premise of the game, to control a hot air balloon, is very simple, yet made interesting by the challenge of having to navigate often precarious routes. The game's controls are intuitive, as the only control over the balloon the player has is to increase its altitude, and to drop objects. The balloon's direction and speed are left to the whim of the wind, as the wind direction and speed alter according to altitude. By keeping both the premise and mechanics of the game simple and intuitive, yet introducing a new idea or challenge with each of 16 levels, the game kept me both intrigued and somewhat intellectually stimulated. Some aspects of the game I particularly enjoyed are the art style and music, and ability to use audio as a form of input instead of the mouse, which works very well. However, as with almost any game, there are a few aspects I would have liked to see imrpoved. Firstly, the inability to rebind controls, such as using the arrow keys instead of left click, the fact that the game doesn't scale with screen size, meaning there is a lot of unused black space around it, and the inability to move the camera independently from the balloon as I sometimes felt that my field of view was unnecessarily constrained. Yet, despite all of its flaws, I was left thouroughly satisfied by the game, and despite only taking up to an hour to complete, I would not expect any more for its price.			"

												I bought The Howler around Christmas time on sale- and to be honest it has sat in my games list untouched until now. It's been sat, waiting patiently, for a day where I have absolutely nothing else to do. Today was that day, and The Howler certainly helped me get through a hour or so until I went to get my Chinese takeaway.The artwork, as others have said, is beautiful. Really really well done on that part :) But the main thing that grasped me about this game was the alternate controls- the ability to use your microphone to do all the controlling! None of my steam games have surprised me with a feature like this before- it made the game so much more fun! Others have said how boring and slow the game can be, but this feature brings your concentration to a whole new level.THAT said- there were a few kinks to be worked out with the feature. At times it can be a little TOO sensitive- when a car drove past outside my balloon would fly away, or even on the Wolf cave level, the sound of the passage opening would be loud enough to also blow the balloon away... I have to complete that level using the mouse, which was a little disappointing.One more point about problems while playing- your balloon CAN touch some objects/walls... but not all? And it's not obvious what will and what wont pop your balloon. This became quite frustrating in the more tightly spaced levels :/All in all, really lovely little game, I'd recommend it to anyone for the unique controls input alone, especially as it's so cheap. REALLY wish this game had some achievements!!! Would play through the whole thing again for some achievements (Wink wink nudge nudge Mr Dev)- also it was nice getting 3/5 trading cards from drops :) That made the cute little badge nice and attainable too (Y)<3			"

This game has a lot of character and the kind of Steampunk feel to it, that can draw you in. The game mechanics were pretty simple. Alla mouse click anyhow, Follow the current's, drop the package, dont hit things, land on the pad. I enjoyed what I put into it, for my 0.14 cents.

												First impression: cute little physics timing game.Physics and art - what can go wrong? As it appears, a lot: the game runs in 1024x768, but not stretched, it does a fake fullscreen by adding huge black borders. (You can make it windowed by pressing Esc, that's not in the settings menu.) The microphone input cannot be calibrated to a ""rest"" sound, as a result my balloon always went up into the sky. With voice input active, the game crashes a lot, too. Which means I had to play it with mouse and space bar.And you need a lot of patience: in the first 6 levels, the main game mechanic means you stay at one height to get up to speed and then quickly rise into a countercurrent to hop over an obstacle. Get the timing on this even slightly wrong, and you may need to do it again.. and again... and again. Add random annoying spikey bits that often don't even look spikey for extra aggravation, and borders you can easily fly out of in any direction to restart the level for that extra patience drain.I'm tired now and don't have the patience, and that's why didn't complete it and don't recommend it. Your mileage may vary.

												The Howler is a game of dexterity and timing in which you control a hot air balloon. Clicking the mouse (or making noise if you have a compatible microphone) makes the balloon go up. In each level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through a parcours by making use of the wind. There are areas in which the wind blows the balloon forward and there are areas in which the wind blows the balloon back.At first, this simple idea looks promising. The first few levels are fun. But soon, the real difficulty pops up: level after level, you need to manoeuvre the balloon through spikey things. And the balloon snaps on the slightest contact with spikey things, so it requires perfect timing. At that point, you realize the game is actually a lot like an unforgiving old-school platformer game. You know, a game that requires you to try and try again until you pretty much know the exact timing to get through each level. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy games like that, and they will enjoy The Howler for what it is, but I think it's only fair to warn other people about the nature of this game because it doesn't show from the description and the screenshots.What you can tell from watching the screenshots, is that the artwork is very nice and pretty unique for an indie game like this. It's also a cheap game, especially when on sale, so if you're not sure whether to try it after reading this and some other reviews, I'd say give it a go. But because the Howler is not the sort of game I expected and because I simply didn't enjoy the game for what it turned out to be, I can't generally recommend this game so I feel obligated to click the 'thumbs down' button.

-Quick Review-The Howler is a short indie hot air balloon simulator developed by Antanas Marcelionis and released in mid 2014.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: There is a progressive story about the “Viceroy of Vilnius, Antanas Sidabras”, that is told through the 15 levels of the game. (not including bonus levels)Aesthetically speaking, the game has some really visually interesting graphics; the art is hand drawn and the “architecture actually exists in Vilnius today”, according to Antanas Marcelionis.


By the way, when I screenshot, I drop whatever I'm carrying, so I dropped a bomb right after taking this... haha

Gameplay: There are two control choices: the volume of your voice (obviously requiring a functional microphone on your computer), when the microphone picks up your voice being loud enough, your hot air balloon goes up.Alternatively, simply use a keyboard, pressing space to go up, and then any other key drops your cargo (including your Steam screenshot button, so beware the screenshot!)You need to dodge objects that may pop your balloon, and move into air currents that will push you to the right or left. While the game is very straightforward and controls very easily, it's definitely not an “easy” game.


This level.... *heavy breathing*

Achievements: There are no steam achievements for The Howler, quite frankly there isn't enough game to give very many achievements. If achievements were added at some point, it would be along the lines of “beat the game”, “find the hidden level codes”, and anything else would be along the lines of ""high score"".Price: The Howler is priced at $4.99, I spent only 1.5 hours to beat the game. By my value system (1 dollars for every hour played), this game is a bit too high priced. However, when on sale it's a fair price.In the end, the developers are indie so the prices tend to be lower and go on sale often, you could argue for buying the game just to support the developers.Conclusion: The game was short and sweet. The only problem is that I don't really feel like this game was designed for a computer. It felt like something you'd play on an iPad, or mobile device.I enjoyed playing it. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a neat unique game for a couple of hours. I suggest getting it on sale, or purchasing for a mobile device.


Well, that's the game! Woot!

												Vilnius, 1905.The world is like it used to be... Everything is calm, skies aren't invaded by thousands of pigeons and other ""friendly"" birds with free white item drops on you. We decided to make a package delivery services, but we probably weren't that smart picking our boss/air-man, whom at first level shouts ALLAHU AKBAR and crashes us into Vilnius Cathedral Bell Tower for entire 10 minutes. Also, it was not smart idea to take a guy whom always plays Counter-Strike : Global Offensive for most of his time and gives us calls to pick the ""Package"" and deliver it into the ""Spot"". - Antanas SidabrasSo, this game is about playing with mouse (if you are casual) or going pro like me, while using microphone. This game is on sale for -96%, but it's definetly worth it to pick it up for full price. The extra score goes to this, that it's made in Lithuania, my country.			"

												Great small and fun game. The artwork is beautiful. Very worthwhile if you ever visited (or will visit) Vilnius in Lithuania.Controls work well. Just make sure you have your mic configured correctly, to prevent crashes. You can disable voice control and use the mouse, which gives more precision and makes the levels a bit easier. Esc will switch the game from maximized to windowed. Finished the game in about 2,5 hours. Which makes €5 a little expensive. Currently on sale for €0,19 .. which is a steal. Definitely get it if you can for a euro or less.			"

												Usually, I don't have a problem with games made for smartphone being on Steam. But this is so wrong piece of c*ap!Basically, you just click and wait for miracles to happen.The creator didn't learn how the of Physics work and whole game concept doesn't make sense.Just +1 point for unique graphic design and the idea.But these two reasons are too weak to make the game worth. I would rather send directly €1 to the illustrator ONLY.Maybe works better on smartphone, haven't tried the voice commanding though.			"

												The attention to detail is why I love this game so much. The handmade art and engaging atmosphere are wonderful. The game is a little short & some levels can be frustrating. I have not encountered any gameplay issues such as bugs or crashes. It runs and plays smoothly, even though I was stuck at trying to fly into the wolf's mouth for a while.			"

												The Howler Review - Raymond KTFollowing the general outline of the Lithuanian novel The Hour of the Wolf by Andrius Tapinas, the game is set in an alternate steampunk version of Vilnius, Lithuania. In order to observe the goings on around the city, Antanas Sadabras, the legate of Vilnius, takes to his hot air balloon. During his observations, Antanas discovers that rioters are planning an attack on the city and that they have released automatons throughout the airspace as part of their scheme. With his precious city in peril, it is up to Antanas to stop the rioters and return Vilnius to normalcy. The story is simple, straightforward, and is presented to players through minimalist snippets of text just before you begin a mission. It's not extensive and it's not complex, but it gets the job done. That being said, I'm a sucker for a good story, and I would have loved a bit more insight into what exactly provoked these riots. In all honesty, though, this games isn't really about the story...I thought the concept of the game was fun, simple. Get to one destination from another. All of the artwork was done the tried and true way: drawn by hand on paper. HAND DRAWN!!! Overall, if you like platformers with highly sensitive controls, you will love The Howler. On the other hand, if you’re easily frustrated with games in this genre, you may want to spend the money on something less confounding…like a nice book about political intrigue! "

												Life as air-balloon pilot is tough.  You aren't afforded any of those nifty steering doo-dads.  All you have to guide you is the wind.  Playing The Howler is all about learning to become one with the wind as you soar around this pastel world.  Its a simple concept for a game but it comes together quite well.  Its a short but sweet ride that should keep you entertained for just over an hour.The controls are super simple.  All you can do is increase the heat to ascend or subsequently release the hot air to descend.  By controlling the elevation you will pass through different zones of air blowing the wind this way and that way.  Certain currents will be stronger than other and you must be careful of the potential momentum of the stronger winds.  By straddling these currents you can proceed to your destination or pick up goods required for the different objectives.Many levels will simply have to going for one spot to another.  Other levels may have you pick up and deliver a package.  Later in the game you'll be given bombs you can drop.  Use these to destroy obstacles in your path or take out the enemy's bridge.  Just be careful not to be too close to your bombs as you can easily be sent floating off screen and into the abyss.One of the coolest parts of the game is the hand drawn art.  The backgrounds are gorgeous and rich with detail.  They distinguish themselves nicely from the sharp,clean, lines of the objects in the foreground.  There isn't much to the sound design.  There isn't any music while playing which could be justified to help you concentrate.  Usually all you hear is balloon's propane kicking in as you turn on the heat to ascend.  That being said the automatons and cars really stick out in the levels they're present.There really isn't much else to say.  This is a really simple game, one that doesn't take long to finish.  That isn't necessary a bad thing considering the low price point.  Not to mention there really isn't many other games like it.  The unique art style might make it worth considering if you're on edge.  As long as you're not expecting anything too fancy there is fun to be had playing The Howler.			"

												A cool game where you must fly a ballon using the wind to complete levels. It has good artwork and it's simple, using only one button (sometimes another). You can also use your micro as an input device, but i haven't tested it. It's good while it lasts, but buy it on sale because you can beat it in under an hour, and there's isn't much replay value, besides improving your score. You'll probably have to idle for get all the card drops, even if you replay it once.			"

It was actually entertaining to me but I'll admit this game can be a little bit challenging.			"

												Disclosure: Received review copyOld lunar lander is probably closest to what comes to mind although in this game gravity itself is not the key element - sideways moving wind currents are and you dont always fly around over open skies. Even missions in tunnels with pointy things portruding from the walls can be found. Typical levels after the first few easy tutorial levels require sometimes multiple attempts and use of enviroment to the max to get to the goal in time and in one piece.Simple to learn but hard to master -formula in good use here.  Game is entertaining for small game sessions even though i have my doubts about the 'party game' claim.  To put it shortly the best parts in the game is the unique artwork and world (Steam punk Vilnius, Lithuania. Not exactly a no-risk bet there but it works) and varying mission goals. Devs have used quite well this ancient game formula and made it entertaining.			"

												The Howler is a very simple flying game where you ride wind currents in a balloon while completing specific objectives and finally landing safely. Objectives consist of picking up objects, dropping them at specific points, or blowing things up. The artwork is all hand draw and nicely done. Gameplay is literally clicking the mouse to make the balloon rise and pressing the spacebar to drop things. Alternatively, a microphone can be used which simulates clicking the mouse by making noise.There are only 16 levels in total and it took me about 50 minutes to complete them all. There are 2 or 3 tricky levels and the rest are pretty straightforward. If you have an hour to kill and a couple quarters to spend, you might consider adding this to your library, although you aren't missing much by passing this one up.			"

												What primarily motivated me to get The Howler was the really unique art style; what can I say, my love for indie games is strong. And even though it looks easy enough, the gameplay can be a (frustrating) challenge. I never thought that wind currents could ever possibly be such a nuisance to me. With exception of one or two rage-quits the game is otherwise chill and calming, the fine soundtrack definitely contributes greatly to that. All in all The Howler is an original and relaxing game, make sure to pick it up!			"

												If you're ever having troubles sleeping just play this game for 20 minutes, you'll be out in no time! I Was wondering why this game had such a good rating then I noticed majority of the people who rated it up didn't even invest a single hour into the game... I like the art and the idea but the gameplay is incredibly slow making it a boring experience. Sure it's one dollar but it's just one of those games to sit in your library if you're a game collector. The most excitement I got out of this game was crafting its badges!10/10 would craft again!			"

												I am quite fond of hand done art in a video game. It reminds me of where graphic art truly began. The Howler is a very interesting game that utilizes hand done art in most, if not all, of its assets. Based on the book Hour of the Wolf, the game is set in an alternate steampunk version of Vilnius, Lithuania.The Howler has a lot going for it. It is a physics game where you utilize wind current to move a hot air balloon to its destination. The Howler also allows you to use your voice as a form of game control. The length of The Howler is quite short, and due to that it is difficult to gain all the Steam Trading Cards without leaving it running. I did have a few bugs with the window and fullscreen, but I am able to look past that. My biggest complaint of The Howler is the platform I played it on. This is a mobile game, ported to the computer. I believe, because of that, I could not get into this game. I did complete it, however I never had fun. There was something pulling me away the experience, and I think it is because I could have played it on my phone.That being said, I would advise you to try The Howler out, but not for full price. Preferably, you should pick up The Howler when the Art Appreciation Pack goes on sale. The Art Appreciation Pack goes on sale once every few months, and the other games are quite interesting as well.

												Awoo?Basic Breakdown: Developed by Antanas Marcelionis and Renė Petrulienė, published by Antanas Marcelionis The Howler is an adventure puzzle game with a set of interesting, unusual, unforgiving and complex puzzles that will have you frustrated many a times. You control your air balloon through a series of 'missions' to either deliver packages, blow up automatons or just land atop another air ship as the winds play havoc with your flight path. Pro Tip - To unlock the final puzzle, the code is -sos-Menu: Honestly, there isn't really one which is slightly bothersome. Especially when it comes to wanting to remap certain keys that are to do with steam. Taking screenshots while you have a package or a bomb will instantly release them, interfering with your mission.Graphics/Art: All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained painters. Most of the art was thanks to Rene Petruliene: all the graphic design was drawn by hand, giving it that extra classic, renaissance feel. Soundtrack: It ties in with the aesthetics of the game so well. It gives it that timely atmospheric feel that just works. Final Conclusion: Great, fairly short puzzler that will keep you entertained and frustrated depending on how good you are at controlling your air balloon. Also has a nifty unique feature of being able to control your flight with voice/sound from your headset which I quite enjoy because it keeps things interesting.Completing a mission will leave you feeling satisfied and accomplished, which for me is very rare. Props to the devs for making such a well balanced game that is entertaining, has wonderful art that clearly shows a lot of work and initiative went into it, for making something really unique and a nice cross of difficult but not punishing.As must for any puzzle fans out there.

												Loved the art style, but little else. I found myself becoming frustrated by how slow paced the game is. The balloon's movement is very slow even in the fastest winds. Some of the more difficult levels you end up playing many times and it is aggravating to wait for the balloon to gain speed.Can't say I would recommend this game.			"

It's a game with nice art, but unfortunately that's about it.The gameplay is OK.  All you can do is control the fire (aka lift) of the balloon which raises and lowers it.  Doing this, puts the balloon in different ""zones"" of wind travelling in different directions and speeds (indicated by arrows on left of screen).  Using the wind to move around, the goal is simply to land at a particular location, and on some levels pickup a package/bomb or drop a package/bomb onto something before landing.  Simple idea and each level takes only a couple minutes to complete.There's 15 campaign missions which I completed in exactly one hour and one unique bonus level good for another cool 5 minutes of play BUT you have to enter a password first.  The game tells you that the password is given to you by a tower, but then doesn't tell you on which of the 15 levels the tower is....uh...so instead of playing another hour, I just googled the password...the password is:  SOSOverall:  It's a nice / pretty game for an hour, but there's really not much here.  7 out of 10.

												It started out fun but then I hit level 3. I could not get over the castle for the life of me. 30 minutes later an induced rage quit occured. Eventually I came back to it. WHY CAN I NOT GET OFF THIS LEVEL?! lol. All my game time is based on level 3. Maybe I will return to it for more rage quits, but as of right now, enough is enough.I've tried voice recognition on and playing with it off. Playing without the microphone seemed to work smoother for me. Although I stated in one of my other reviews that I would like to see more voice recognition games on Steam, this one missed the mark for me.

												The Howler doesn't have enough to be worth a monetary value. It has a unique art style and a cool game concept. Not sure why but only 16 levels were developed, making this game a short read to say the least. With only a few game mechanics available, gameplay gets stale quickly if not after the first level. No achievements or challenges give very little purpose to touch the game and so I give it a thumbs down.			"

												A game is not worth even 19 cents if you cannot play it. Your mileage may vary but for me it crashed within a minute of launching it, several times. Couldn't proceed further than level 2 because of this. The idea is great and all, but I cannot recommend a game that is just plain broken.			"

												(This copy of the game was provided freely by EpicQuest Games)I don't particularly like to ragequit a game, but this is the first one that's driven me to do so in a while.The Howler has a lot of things a good game should have. There's the unique concept of using your voice (or noise in general) to move your hot air balloon around the map. The artwork is beautiful and really worth taking a good time to enjoy. That's where it stops. Right there is where The Howler ceases and I find myself completely irritated with the game.There is simplicity in the game. You are delivering parcels and you don't want your balloon oblierated on the ornate and breath-taking buildings. That's great and that would appeal to a wide audience there. That's perfect. Yet here's what flubs it up. The wind and weather direction should be something that gives you a slight challenge, not forces you to constantly restart the level because the angle wasn't just perfect so your balloon didn't pop or you didn't fly too high into the heavens. I've played similar games to this before and especially when you're starting out, they're a lot more forgiving with their wind merchanics. The Howler punishes you mercilessly on level 3 and continues to kick you in the stomach with that mechanic until you've had enough and switch the game off.There's also the fact that the voice control, even when your microphone is on the most sensitivity possible, will not be enough to keep your balloon afloat. Now I'm aware that the game suggested I scream, but not everyone using Steam is living in a house where we have enough privacy to scream. If I have to make my voice raw to get that thing off the ground, why am I playing the game at all? That's entirely too much work and I'm not getting a sore throat just to play it.The screens betwen levels are charming and give me the option to turn off the microphone (your mouse will be easier to play with at this rate, I suppose!) but little exposition except a bit of real life history of the city. There's no actual substansial story here and I was expecting a tiny bit more, given I felt teased with the artwork and fairly let down by game play.It's like a really pretty flappy bird with a harder obstacle course you're supposed to scream at. I just didn't feel the need to open my big trap since it doesn't actually help!Accessibility warnings? Transition screens are bright and have a white light. May cause migraines or seizures if you're sensitive. It certainly brought me a migraine. The repetitive motion of clicking upward gets sore (and pretty old!) fast as well.			"

												Well, 5 euros may seem a lot to someone, but, for me, it totally worths it.  It is really artistic and it releaves a very interesting story about a city which now I want to visit. It is short, but some levels are really tricky. Voice controller changes everything. The fact that it made me start singing trying to find the best song for each level, means a lot. By all means, I recommend this game to everyone who want to play something retro and different.			"

												Nice, simple premise game.  It starts out simple and grows in difficulty as you progress.  I've only played the first several missions.  The artwork is beautiful, the music simple so far.  Sound effects assist in the game.  I played with keyboard and mouse, but you can play with a touch device or even use your voice via microphone to control your balloon.  That is interesting and I may try that later.   It was definitely worth .14.  I bought a combo of this and another game for 0.44.  Not an earth-shattering game but a nice indy game to pass some time with and enjoy.			"

												So, i was joking that this game is now worth buying for 19 cents. And it IS a very short game (completed in 75 minutes, not even enough for trading cards to start dropping). Maybe i would pay like 1,99 for it gladly. It was interesting (sometimes frustrating, but still). A nice play on physics, speed, timing, etc. Graphics are nice two (hand drawn). Can't not recommend it with 96% discount :)P.S. and if you want to go completely insane you can play it controlling the balloon with your voice :D I haven't tried it, my arm was already hurting by the end after clicking a mouse button constantly. But it is innovative and.. interesting :)			"

												This game features an interesting and unique art style that gives a warm, yet delightfully bleak impression due to its limited color palette of autumn colors. This wonderfully rich world is painted with a variety of shades, including earthly reds, moody oranges and warm bronze. In my opinion, the interesting choice of colour represents a particular time of day when winds are most calm to traverse along with a traditional autumn season. The culture of the narrative is represented mainly in it's architecture, which are presented as obstacles throughout the game. These buildings are very detailed and is clearly the work of a talented artist. Unfortunately, apart from on-screen text that shows the player's objective and motivations, the building's style is the only visual means of connecting the player to the game world. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for such a short, independent title, but it leaves a strong desire to dive deeper into it's limited narrative once all levels are completed. The game is almost entirely played with a single tap of a mouse or screen, with the exception of the spacebar. Despite it's simple mechanics, the gameplay can be very challenging at certain levels. Espically at the beginning of the game, where the pilot is tasked to fly beyond a collosal monstrosity of a howling wolf to retrieve a set of packages before returning to the glorious canine to descend into it's steel belly. The hour that you will typlically spend playing 'The Howler' will be an artisticaly inspirational and rewarding hour. I would gladly reccommend the game for anyone who appreciates art or has a simple hour to spend.			"

												The Howler is very slow pasted and has a unique gameplay. The game's steampunk artstyle was alright closer up as in the walls or towers but the background almost seemed to fit in but then not at times. Speaking of witch the tall walls or towers have these little points on the sides of the obstacle that just blow up your hot air balloon instantly so watch out for those. Anyway I really did not like how the game was not capable for wider screens and leaves you with two dark as night borders at the ends of your screen which really does not go well with the background at all since it is mosly white or redish. Another point I do want to point out is that you can beat all of the levels in about two hours and in my opion The Howler not have a hole lot of replay value due to the fact that it only has fifteen levels (plus one more level if you know morse code) with no goal times to challenge the player.Even though i do not recommend The Howler it is worth checking out for just fourteen cents.

												A simplified lander type game with an interesting art style.  It starts off easy enough, and the difficulty ramps up as you progress.  You click and hold the mouse to go up, and you ride the air currents to move left or right.  You can also use your microphone and blow or yell to make it rise, but I really doubt many people will play that way except for a laugh.  Some missions have you collect and/or drop off parcels in specific locations.  Eventually, you encounter moving obstacles, rather than just the buildings you avoid hitting early on.  It does what set out to do, and does it well enough.  Maybe that's enough for you.			"

												It's really great, I totally recommend it ! I finished it in 2 hours (but it'll probably take you less time), there are 16 levels and it's really cheap too, which is always cool. It's really beautiful, it's all drawings and they're sublime ! The physics of the game is perfect. The option that allows to use the micro to control the balloon is fun too, even if it's easier to do it with the mouse, it's still fun to try in the beginning. In short, download it, it's awesome !

												Disclaimer: Review CopyThe Howler is simply not a fun game. Tedious gameplay and an unengaging story. The voice controlls are really pointless and don't add any enjoyment to the game. I only managed to get through a few levels before I had enough of the game, The book that the game is based on may be good, but it didn't translate well into a game. I will give the developers credit on the nice visuals though.			"

												It would probably have been even more fun if my PC had touch controls, but I did enjoy my time with this game. It plays like the old Lunar Lander flash games I wasted time on in my middle school computer lab. And there is apparently a novel tie-in, which definitely tickled my fancy. Haven't read the book yet, bhut I intend to.Solid game and cheap as hell on sale.			"

												The Howler combines elements of Angry Birds with Super Meat Boy...quite the combo. Navigate a hot-air balloon through treacherous missions without getting popped! Deliver packages safely and drop bombs on selected targets, all the while protecting yourself from destruction. The game is very challenging, but equally rewarding. Got nerves of steel?

												To be honest, I really didn't get to the point of actually playing the game, instead of that, I was submerged into a state of deafness and irascibility since the game almost ripped my ears appart the second it started. Then I proceeded to desperately look for an ""Options"" button or else, just to annoyingly find out that the game has no option to set a lower sound volume; there's no way to regulate the output sound.At that point I was almost bleeding out from my ear canals... well sort of.Then, in a last attempt to regain consciousness, I looked for the ""Exit"" option so I could stop the unbearable loud noise, but to make things even worse, that option is also absent: no ""Quit"", ""Exit"", ""Quit to desktop"" nor similar alternative is present in the menus. Well, there are no menus either.I came back safely to silence and quietness by pressing the almighty Alt-F4 combo breaker.			"

												It’s just... Boring. I think I’ve played maybe an hour or two tops and The Howler just puts me to sleep.I seem to remember a lot of praise for this game when it was released, and I’m not sure what it was for. The best I can tell, everything is pretty much your standard “3-star the level” kind of puzzle game. I suppose on mobile there is supposed to be mic integration (or maybe they expect you to plug a mic into your PC) but if I’ve learned anything from consoles it’s that voice integration is little more than a gimmick. I’m never going to sit at my computer and yell to make a balloon go up and down, especially since the game is so dull that I could never get the energy to muster up a yell in the first place.If you find joy in this game, to each their own; I find it to be one of the most bland things I’ve played in a while.

A Fun Little GameThe Howler is a fun little game.***A microphone is not requiered but reccomend to get the full experience of the mechanics of the game.***Basically the the game goes like this: you control the altitude of the air baloon using your mic (you blow into it) reaching diferent heights there are different wind currents allowing you to drift right or left depending on what way the wind is blowing for that height. Thats pretty much it. The game has you fly from start to a landing zone, there a bonus packages along the way in the later levels you also have to drop them off. But Point A to B is how it goes.In Short Although simple and repeatitive, the game has a factor of enjoyment about it. Don't care too much for the price tag it's got though, for whats its worth i'd say it should be cheaper than it is now. Doubt it would be in a sale but who knows...I like playing it but theres not much to shake it up.on a scale of 1-10 i'd give it a 4/10 with a reccomendation.			"

												The Howler is a great game you can Buy for cheep on sale (like 49 cents cheep). While it would make sense to do that, I spent one more cent (so 50 cents overall) and got 2 more games from the developer (Gravilon and Morphopolis). While I haven't tried those two yet, for one cent its fine. The game is good. I like how you can skip levels. Some levels are ludicrous, and the balloon needs to not pop on the most delicate things. Other than that it's a nice time-waster			"

												Do NOT buy this game. It does not work, and upon attempting to load a level it gives a white screen. And the helpful advice to disable voice does nothing. Further, if one clicks on the ""pause"" button at the initial loading screen, it bugs the game out and there is only a background, no level select. And it remains like that every time it is started, until you uninstall and reinstall. I was given this game for free, but now i'm out some time that I won't get back again.			"

												Maybe good for its genre but kinda boring as a PC game.

												The game has 16 levels. I must have considered just uninstalling it about 14 times, now... Awful controls, and terribly gimmicky game making for very very slow replays, despite the levels being 40 seconds long.I really, really dislike this one, that doesn't happen too often. Every level I feel like dropping it because of the counter intuitive way to solve the levels with very poor hit detection, while keeping you boxed in a tiny area, killing you if you leave it even a bit... No.P.S.: The bonus level could have been a very nice thing. You have a completely different vehicle, which is kinda nice. Unfortunately, they didn't bother to test it and check that it has very, very imprecise hitboxes, in a level with very narrow paths. So yeah, you die several times without ""touching"" the bombs. ... This is game has the most contrived levels I've ever seen.			"

												You click for elevating your balloon and release for it to go down. Winds blow left and right depending on the altitude. You have to get to some places and deliver some objects.Main problem is that, if you fail to set the right speed, you will not pass some obstacles and will have to reposition yourselft waiting for the wind to push you, going down and trying again, which can become a little frustrating and repetitive.Graphics are ok, gameplay seems very limited to me.

												Gameplay is similar to many flash/ mobile games. Simply a direct promotional sale for a novel. When the first things on the main menu are links to amazon to purchase ""hour of the wolf"" and a facebook page link its not always a good sign. The closest analogue to the game is something like a flappy bird or rocket racer. The player controls a balloon by holding down the mouse to go up and when letting go they fall. They then have to use wind currents to reach a destination or pick up a crate. Its just not really all that great and has to much to do with promoting the Novel.			"

												The game has a wonderful art style which is a combination of hand sketching and watercolor wash. The setting is steampunk and you play as a hotair balloon pilot. You have some control over the upward and downward motion of the balloon but you are at the mercy of the wind currents to move left and right. You will need to use momentum to navigate around obstacles, using the wind to your advantage and quickly changing elevation. The difficulty of the game ramps up quite quickly. On most levels (missions) you will be picking up and/or dropping parcels. There is a great deal of verticality in the game and often your destinations will be outside of your view. Each mission starts with a quick scan over the scene, but it will be up to you to remember where you need to go. You can control the game with your mouse and keyboard, but you can also control it with your voice. I tried this feature but found it less appealing than traditional controls. The game has a 4x3 aspect ratio and is locked at 30 FPS. I suspect this is due to it being available on iOS as well. Given how the level design works they would not have been able to simply expand the aspect ratio. This may be off-putting to some but the game can run in windowed mode so you won't notice any wasted space. In full screen you will have black bars on the sides. You cannot control the volume in the game, you'll have to rely on the system sound controls. This is probably another aspect of its iOS support.Overall I enjoyed my time with the game so far and I will play more of it. If you like to be in complete control of your ""character"" you may not enjoy this title since a lot of the time the control is out of your hands.If you'd like to see 20 minutes of my experience with the game check out my Twenty Minute Tryout video on YouTube...

												Slightly more than hour of gameplay. (For card drops you need more than 2 hours).15 levels + one bonus level.The game iself is played quite differently than I expected from description. It's not game for all. It's not eye-appealing. Sounds are not making you wonder ""how awesome that is"".But, considering many games that got release, this one is not pure trash. It's a bit bad - it doesn't calibrate microphone... to change microphone settings (sensitivity) you need to go through up to 5 clicks, but transistion screens are slow...It's very week recommendation. I would prefer to set that to Neutral, but that's not the option (yet) "

												The Howler is a game about Howling, Where your screams take you through the levels but will this be a game you will want to scream through ? In the Howler you take controller of a baloon which you can controll by your voice by screaming or you can enable mouse controlls and controll the balloon by clicking. Overall so how is this game ? Im kinda mixed on this one. The game is actually fun but its also quite annoying. So first of all the games positives. The game has an amazing art style which is just amazing to look at. Everything is hand drawn and it looks great. The game also has simple and fun controlls but if you play with Voice mode enabled after a while youre throat will start to hurt because it requires alot of screaming in some levels. The game also has tedious level desing because sometimes its hard to navigate because some levels are more open than others and sometimes its possible to get lost. The game is quite short only an hour long but youre time will be increased because some levels are quite hard and you will need to repeat them. Overall Howler is quite a fun game but it also has a few other problems. Poorly optimized port. Its quite buggy as well . But overall The Howler is a game you should buy for puzzle game fans and people who like artistic games. I give The Howler a 7/10. Bonus for the readers who havent accesed the bonus stage The code is SOS. Enjoy.			"

												Seeing that this game seemed to involve ""howling"", ""touching"", and ""screaming"" I was hoping it'd be a dating simulator, but nope - it's Flappy Bird, but with a ""make noise in real life to flap"" gimmick. The game's pace is tear-jerkingly tediously slow - it takes forrrrrever for that balloon to inch its way forwards. Nice steampunky art assets but far too trifling an experience to bother with on a real computer and too slow to really enjoy as a mobile game.That said, if you or a loved one is a mouthbreather with a microphone - and let's face it, anyone who's played a team game knows there's plenty out there - this game will at least be a nice compliment to that skillset.

												I hate to downvote this one for it is a neatly done software with original aesthetics and fine mechanics. It feels great. The problem is in the gameplay itself. Instead of an atmospheric meditative aeronautics trip over the rooftops of old Vilnius which I hoped for I got a gimmicky phisics based puzzle arcade without much substance - every level here is just a short but irritating obstacle course artificially made up of some unnatural structures that force you to perform miracles trying to use those wind directions on different heights to your favor. Even the interesting technology of motion control through noise generation doesn't add to the excitement. Screen resolution is fixed and won't stretch to fullscreen.Жаль, что приходится голосовать против, потому что программа сделана аккуратно, с оригинальной эстетикой и точной механикой. Ощущения по началу приятные. Проблема в самом процессе игры. Вместо атмосферного медитативного воздухоплавания над крышами старинного Вильнюса, что я себе воображал, я получил замороченную физическую головоломку без особой глубины: каждый уровень - короткая раздражающая полоса препятствий, искусственно слепленная из противоестественных объектов, которые вынуждают вас творить чудеса, пытаясь использовать нужное направление ветра на той или иной высоте. Даже любопытная технология управления движением через подачу звука в микрофон также не добавляет интересности. Разрешение экрана фиксировано, на полный экран не разворачивается.			"

												Summary: I can't swallow the broken physics and without it there is no game.Right:Hot Air balloons can be controlled with a single ""burn"" input (one button), sending the hot-air balloon upwards. Think ""Flappy Bird"", not ""Kerbal SPace Program"".Wrong:The only thing that makes this a ""game"" (instead of a ""follow the arrows"" exercise) is that physics is twisted so that the balloon can gain momentum in one windstream, and when the balloon enters a different windstream, the balloon will briefly continue moving as though it were still in the first windstream. Neither Boyle, Bernoulli nor Newton would have approved this game-design decision. It's not how balloons work in air. And without this twist there is no game.Wrong:The player can hear the burn when the balloon is ordered to move upwards, suggesting a warm balloon filled with mostly Nitrogen and Carbon Dioxide. Yet the balloon detonates when it strikes an object, as thought the balloon were constructed of strike-anywhere matches and filled with hydrogen.Wrong:The balloon can go seemingly infinitely far off the map to the left, right, or bottom. But if it goes off the top of the map, it is ""lost"" and forces a restart. What, did it go into orbit? Doesn't the air on this planet get thinner with altitude?Wrong:No fuel meter, infinite burns are allowed. Fuel should have been the ""game"", and physics should have been real.			"

			What an interesting little game! Howl much like a tablet or Phone styled game, you play using your voice levels to give hot air to the balloon thus controlling its elevation, you then pilot it too...

												Without a doubt the most boring game I have ever played. Look, I knew what this game was before going into it and, as such, I wasn’t expecting an epic storyline or smooth, ultra realistic graphics, however this game is just tedious. You pilot an unresponsive hot air balloon and have to get it to its destination by using the direction of the wind, which miraculously changes from left to right and back again depending on how high up you are. Oh and just to add a little bit of pointlessness to the mix, you sometimes pick up packages and drop them off at their destination. There’s approximately a million indie titles you can buy that are better than this, so there's no excuse for this to even exist. Even 16bit Trader wasn’t this boring!			"

Take the skies in a hot air balloon to distribute newspapers and quell riots.  This physics puzzle game challenges the player to use the air currents at different altitudes to navigate through it's levels.The biggest issue with this game is that it's goal of using a hand drawn artistic style weakens the gameplay by removing visuals cues for that parts of the geometry are safe or deadly.Despite the small size of the games levels, the mechanics of play make the experience slow and plodding.  There is an option to play with a microphone, but it was not a strength for the game.			"

												The Howler is one of those games which, (in my opinion) is hard to (not to) recommend. On the one hand, the game is beautifully drawn and it's quite cheap (3 bucks) for a game like this. On the other hand the gameplay just is not my kind of thing. You're suppose to fly an airballoon and land it on several platforms making good use of the gravity and ofcourse you should make sure the airballoon won't crash.I'm sure there are lots of people who enjoy a game like this but I just did not. If you're into physical games this might be something for you.  "

												The art is not bad but... the gameplay is awful. It's designed to torture me. I passed four or five levels before I quitted. So basically you got forward win in the lower half of the screen, and some obstacles, and any wind above the obstacle is in the opposite direction. So you have to gain speed in the lower half, rise right before the obstacle before the upper wind blow you back. Difficult and meaningless setting. There is frustration and no sense of success when you finnaly did that whatsover.			"

YouTube™ Video: The Howler - let's play & first impressions 

			Views: 49		

			This is my first impressions of The Howler by Antanas Macelionis & Rene Petruliene. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam.		

The game looks great. It's very peaceful, there not a lot of sound or music aside from your own voice. Only problem I had was that I coudln't put the game into fullscreen. So the footage I made of the game is essentially in letterbox format (I should have lowered the desktop resolution).You control the altitude of a hot air baloon with a the mouse or by the making sound into a microphone. Lateral movement depends on the strength and direction of the air current you are in. So you have to navigate the air currents. Each level has a different objective e.g. to start you just have to fly to the landing pad and later you need to pick up and deliver parcels.It's a lot of fun to use voice to control the hot air Baloon. I lost control several times when I spoke or burst into laughter which would seen the baloon rising out of the boundaries of the level. So I had to make myself shut sometimes lol. The game gets pretty tricky fast. It will make you navigate through currents pushing against you. The only way to do so is by gaining momentum in a current moving in the correct direction. I had back track a lot and it can be pretty slow using the air currents. But you need to concentrate to create just the right amount of sound. You are supposed to be able to drop objects by using your voice. But I couldn't get this to work so I used the space bar.So it is a really cool game and $2.99 is an awesome price.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												This game looked super fun but it just constantly crashes. I can't seem to get it to work and I'm not alone in this. Essentially, a game that can't be played is not a game. Don't buy it until you see them make major improvements.			"

Summary ReviewMasturbation Simulator 2014Detailed ReviewSo I was in an internship where my team thought it would be a brilliant idea to make a videogame where you have players play a game where your voice is the game, and the key goal is that at certain points in the game, you scream as loud as you can. And the the louder you scream, the more points you get.Everyone's all for that idea.Except for me.I thought it was a stupid idea from the start, because not only does that just sound stupid on its own, but that encourages players to be annoying.It's already bad enough you have CoD kids screaming at you online, why the hell are we making a game that promotes being obnoxious?I honestly hope it doesn't fly out of production. Because if it does fly, they'll probably get something like ""The Howler.""This game uses the gimmick of using your voice to help elevate your hot air balloon and get from point A to point B, C and so on. And the louder you are, the faster you go up. That's basically your goal in this game.Yeah, I could use the mouse instead, but that already sounded lame, so lets go use my voice.I couldn't stand the idea I had to talk/scream louder than I should be, and it's really unfortunate too with this kind of art style. Whoever's the artist deserves better than this. And if the artist is one of the Game Devs themselves: shame on him for thinking this concept was even a good idea.Eventually after 5~10 minutes of screaming, I got tired and stopped.And you know what I did? No, I didn't start using my mouse.I got a paper towel, wrapped it around my mic, and started stroking it to raise my hot air balloon across the field....yeah. If that ain't innuendo enough for you, I don't know what is.This game blows.Literally.Please don't make anything atrocious like this ever again, game developers.It encourages people to be stupid, and you should feel bad for it.

												Click to go up. Grab parcels, drop them off.The screen is divided into three horizontal sections with arrows that are wind that blow you left and right.You can do it with your voice, but you won't want to;it's not precise enough, and the game becomes too difficult to be enjoyable.[not that it was in the first place]Art is pretty good.Don't buy this.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												I would recommend buying this game on sale. I think I bought it for about $0.25. As far as I can tell, it is a pretty short game. I think I got about 40% done in about 15 minutes. I expect it to get harder. There is not much to say about the game, but here goes nothing.It is a short game about a hot air baloon. There is a minimalistic story which helps to add a bit of something to the game. The art is fairly nice and unique. It seems that this game has a function to work with a microphone. I did not try this. While it may be fun, I expect it to be less precise. The controls are pretty good. The baloon has to do various tasks, such as picking up cargo, dropping it off, and landing. There is only one control, and that is gas (makes the baloon go upwards). The wind currents indicated on the side of the screen indicate the direction and speed of wind. While it is incredibly simply, it probably gets pretty challenging. Really, this game reminds me just a bit of the old game Pilotwings for the super nintendo. It is all about precision. It is an enjoyable little game. It's worth buying on sale. Unless there is a second map of levels beyond the first 17 or so levels,  I would NOT recommend buying it at full price.			"

												The art style for Howler is absolutely gorgeous. However, it's a shame the game only runs windowed and at such a small resolution. It would be nice to enjoy the art at a bit higher scale. Overall, the game mechanics are fairly simple and fun. A few areas can be challenging, but for the most part it's not too difficult.  I do wish it were easier to tell which areas/walls destroy the balloon, and which areas just cause a ""bounce"" effect. Overall, I completed it in an hour. I purchased it for $0.50 on sale, so not many complaints in terms of content-to-cost ratio.			"

												The Howler is a beautiful but whisper-thin sort of puzzle game that'll provide you with about an hour of entertainment. You pilot a balloon through a very nicely handpainted 2D representation of Vilnius, Lithuania, done up all steampunk-like. You press the mouse button to provide thrust which carries the balloon higher—steering is left up to the winds which're denoted on the side of the screen. Using those winds you steer around, over, and under obstacles and enemies to reach your goal, which always consists of picking up and/or dropping off items before plopping down on a landing pad elsewhere in the level.That's really it. Lunar Lander with some extra physics. There's a story attached involving impending riots and your efforts to stave them off supposedly taken from or relating in some way to the Lithuanian novel Hour of the Wolf, but like the rest of the game it's pretty insubstantial.There's also an option to use your PC's microphone to control the balloon with your voice, which I didn't use at all. One, it feels like a bit of a gimmick which I don't consider to be either innovative or even essential to gameplay. If the voice commands were integrated into the experience in some way that made them inseperable—or even more effective than just clicking the mouse—I might take the concept seriously, but it seems more like the developer asking you to handicap yourself to make its game seem deeper than it really is. You can play Snake with a Dance Dance Revolution pad, but that doesn't make it innovative, it's still just Snake. Two, I have roommates.All that said the levels are well designed—occasionally cunningly so—and it is very well presented with lovely artwork and music, giving the game a cohesive style that kept me relatively engrossed for the 58 minutes it lasted.I picked this up for $0.49 during the Autumn Sale. For the cost of a game of pinball I suppose I have nothing to cry about. But it normally retails for $1.99, and there's simply not enough here to recommend even at that price.			"

												The Howler is a simple, nice looking game of skill where you take advantage of air stream to pilot a hot air balloon over obstacles. It's very obviously a direct port from tablet but it works fine on PC, even though it only offers one screen resolution that will display the game in a dark frame. This is the game to challenge your grandma who would otherwise never touch a videogame. It's very cheap and often even cheaper on sales, so there's really no risk at throwing a handful of cents at it.			"

												Discovered this game when sorting by cheapest price during a massive sale. It costed less than a Euro, and I bought it right away. The sole reason was... because of how it looked. I love drawing, and this was a nice inspiration to draw some more. The game itself was surprisingly competent, too. A very simple 90-minute puzzle game. It's shortness works in it's favor. The mechanic is extremely simple, and would not be amusing if I had to solve increasingly hard puzzles requiring pixel perfect accuracy for 6 hours.			"

I would give the game a 9/10 Only because I really would have liked the game to be slightly longer & there is not really anything to complain about considering I bought the game for $1.50 with a coupon from crafting a badge!

												The Howler is a simple, nice looking game of skill where you take advantage of air stream to pilot a hot air balloon over obstacles. It's very obviously a direct port from tablet but it works fine on PC, even though it only offers one screen resolution that will display the game in a dark frame. This is the game to challenge your grandma who would otherwise never touch a videogame. It's very cheap and often even cheaper on sales, so there's really no risk at throwing a handful of cents at it.			"

												The pros: Beautiful artSimple gameplayThe artBonus levelGame is about the right length to not get tedious and boringThe cons:Later levels are hard and/or infuriatingShould've had more missions with the bonus vehicleYah it will take you about an hour to beat the entire game. After that there really isn't a reason to replay it.I underestimated this game as one of those nice games. It is a nice-looking game, but didn't help my stress much.Try it, it is worth supporting the artists.Mackeh brought me here. Thanks Mackeh.			"

												Amazing and simple game. The ideea is to guide your hot air baloon and drop packages. But the way you`ll navigate is interesting and the obstacles are interesting. Now the aestetics are amazing in this game with this gloomy original hand painted artstyle that evokes a steam-world with slight nightmarish elements.			"

												The Howler is a beautiful but whisper-thin sort of puzzle game that'll provide you with about an hour of entertainment. You pilot a balloon through a very nicely handpainted 2D representation of Vilnius, Lithuania, done up all steampunk-like. You press the mouse button to provide thrust which carries the balloon higher—steering is left up to the winds which're denoted on the side of the screen. Using those winds you steer around, over, and under obstacles and enemies to reach your goal, which always consists of picking up and/or dropping off items before plopping down on a landing pad elsewhere in the level.That's really it. Lunar Lander with some extra physics. There's a story attached involving impending riots and your efforts to stave them off supposedly taken from or relating in some way to the Lithuanian novel Hour of the Wolf, but like the rest of the game it's pretty insubstantial.There's also an option to use your PC's microphone to control the balloon with your voice, which I didn't use at all. One, it feels like a bit of a gimmick which I don't consider to be either innovative or even essential to gameplay. If the voice commands were integrated into the experience in some way that made them inseperable—or even more effective than just clicking the mouse—I might take the concept seriously, but it seems more like the developer asking you to handicap yourself to make its game seem deeper than it really is. You can play Snake with a Dance Dance Revolution pad, but that doesn't make it innovative, it's still just Snake. Two, I have roommates.All that said the levels are well designed—occasionally cunningly so—and it is very well presented with lovely artwork and music, giving the game a cohesive style that kept me relatively engrossed for the 58 minutes it lasted.I picked this up for $0.49 during the Autumn Sale. For the cost of a game of pinball I suppose I have nothing to cry about. But it normally retails for $1.99, and there's simply not enough here to recommend even at that price.			"

												It's not bad looking, although not very creative. Beside that and gimmicky microphone controls, there's not much to say about this game.It almost seems like they just have focused on drawing random buildings and then after placing them next to each other, they tacked some gameplay elements, so they could sell it as a game.It's boring, clunky at places, overly simplistic, easy (the only challenge is that in some parts of the game, they give you very little space to maneuver, often resulting in restarting the level over and over again,) and very short (you could finish it in around 30 minutes.)

												Discovered this game when sorting by cheapest price during a massive sale. It costed less than a Euro, and I bought it right away. The sole reason was... because of how it looked. I love drawing, and this was a nice inspiration to draw some more. The game itself was surprisingly competent, too. A very simple 90-minute puzzle game. It's shortness works in it's favor. The mechanic is extremely simple, and would not be amusing if I had to solve increasingly hard puzzles requiring pixel perfect accuracy for 6 hours.			"

												If you like very simple games where you tap a button to stay floating, you may like this game. For me, it got boring after the second level. It's a slow moving, finicky game. Glad I got it on sale for 14 cents because I only played it for about ten minutes. Beautiful art, but it's more of a game you'd play waiting for your bus to arrive. It's not a terrible game, I just wouldn't recommend it.			"

Graphics look alot like Machinarium and very little sound effects are in this game.You are in a hot air balloon and you must fly to different levels where the direction of the air changes. You use these physics to fly over, under, and around objects on the map. Sometimes you must collect pkgs for delivery or bombs to blow up certain objects. And that is it. 15 levels that offered very little challenge and 1 bonus level if you find the password posted on a building in one of the levels. Took me about 65-70 minutes to beat this.

												When I bought it a few hours ago, I swear it was rated overwhelmingly positive overall and recently. Its cheap on sale.It has beautiful artwork.Its 2DIts getting boring after an hour because you need to memorize the wind patterns and know where you have to go up and down and where you pick things up and drop things off because you can't see most of it until you get to it. It could use more arrows. Sometimes I go up and move into a different wind speed but I don't know which way or how hard its blowing. You have to wait until you're in the middle of the wind pattern vertically to get the small arrow which indicates direction and speed.It would make a nice calendar!Did I mention the artwork is nice?Also, its a little boring. If you've played a lot of games, then this will probaby bore you before long.			"

 Cool concept	I dont't know a lot of games with voice as the primary way of playing the game (except singing games XD) so i like the idea. It can be really fun and frustrating trying adjust your voice to fly since there is a lot of precission when navigating the different levels. The only thing i can say about it is its most fun to play with your voice and especially when trying to be a little ""Dramatic"" or whatever when playing. The downsides is its short and can become boring quickly and you are using your voice, and you might not be in the mood for yelling at your pc for an hour (unless you already do that...). Its a fun little game but i personally wouldn't throw a lot of money after it.			"

												A very artistic game with a dark grey/brown sort of color pallet and a sketchy sort of feel. Though there are some miniscule bits of sloppyness, the art seems to work well with the movement of the game. I got the game in a bundle for VERY cheap (around 3 games with similar quality to this one for $.50). It is a reletively short game though, with about a 2 hour playthrough time and a bonus level that requires a passcode from a previous level in the game. Some of the levels can seem to be a bit tedious at times, but it wasn't anything to get too frustrated over. Gameplay-wise, it is a very simple concept that hasn't really been exercised in many other games as a main mechanic. it also has trading cards which, in my case, literally made the game pay for itself. For how cheap it was, i would have bought it even if it didn't have cards. However, i don't know if i would have bought it for it's full price, so if you're looking to get this game, i would reccomend adding it to your wishlist so you know when it's on sale, and buy it then.

												The Howler is a pretty good deal for 1.19 USD. It's normally 1.99 USD when its not on sale. The Howler has a pretty unique physics based game mechanic as you navigate your hot air balloon over Vilnius, capital of Lithuania. It's a quick game that has some replay value after letting it sit for a while. The only negative thing I can say about it is that its too short. Other than that I'd recommend you give it a whirl.Pros+ Balloon+ Unique art style+ Moderately challenging+ Physics basedCons- Too short			"

The HowlerThis review was last edited after I had completed the first 15 levelsShort ReviewA delightful game with beautiful, hand drawn graphics & simple game play that whilst only mildly challenging is fun to play none the less.Long ReviewThere is no tutorial but adequate hints are provided in the first few levels and the game play is so simple the lack of a tutorial is not an issue.The game is set in 2D with beautiful, hand drawn graphics. The game play is simple. You control a got air balloon that you must direct from one point to another, performing simple tasks like dropping off parcels along the way. The audio is restricted to sound effects which are fairly limited but effective.The controls are simple, for vertical control you press the left mouse button to ignite the hot air and raise and stop pressing it to allow gravity to take over. For left and right control you must rely on the wind direction and speed which varies at different altitudes and is indicated by an arrow on the left hand side; the number of feathers in the quill indicating the strength. Thus you need to be at the correct altitude to move in the correct direction. The SPACE BAR is used to drop objects you are carrying and there is a pause button click able by the mouse.You cannot pan around so you only see a screens worth of the level around the current location of the balloon. If you go too high, low, left or right and disappear off the edge of the level you die. Similarly if the balloon hits other objects you will usually die.As you progress through levels additional obstacles like floating bombs are introduced. Fortunately these move in a predictable manner.The only way to play is via a campaign of different screen levels you play in order (although once you have completed a level you can replay it at any time). The levels are pretty small (maybe twice the width of the monitor). When you start a new level you are quickly shown what needs to be done by the camera panning about and short text messages appearing. You have a set time limit to complete the tasks.This game play is short and the game can be easily be completed in 2-3 hours. Ignore my 17 hours game play - I left the game running in the start menu overnight by mistake.ProsBeautiful, hand drawn graphicsSimple game playConsThe sequence at the start of a level to show you what to do moves along a little fast for me to read all of the textMarks Out Of 55) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away freeWhere I got the game fromI have no idea how this game got into my Steam library but boy am I glad it did!Platform Played OnIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, EasyAcc Mouse and Steelseries Merc keyboardMy best guess for a  PEGI Rating 3: I can't see any reason to raise it above this.

												This is more a mobile game than a desktop game.The Howler is a simple puzzle game where you have to fly a balloon through the sky (and some more places) to achieve certain simples objectives, like taking some packages over there and bringing it over here again.The graphics are as simple as it can be, all hand drawing. I like it, actually. Everything has a steampunk theme, which is cool.Don't expect too much, you'll only use a single button to play the entire game. This ou give you 30m to 1h30 fun if really like it.I'll only recommend if you get this for as low as $0.50			"

												A nice-looking game that misses the mark in actual gameplay. The Howler is a boring game with a gimmick that just doesn't work well as a PC game. It's cheap, so it might not hurt to try it yourself, but I honestly feel it would just be a waste of money and time.For a bit more explanation for my viewpoints, check out my full review at https://shellgamesblog.wordpress.com/2015/12/08/the-howler-review/ "

												So far what i observed is: You hit the sides of the Balloon & it explodes easily,it's sensitive on the sides whereas you hit the head of the Balloon,the ballon won't explode that easily! You need Tons of Patience to complete 'The Howler' though the game is short :)It took me hardly 60mins to finish the game... You need to play each Stage several times to get the grasp of it Only 15 Stages, Simple, Short & Sweet <3Trading Cards FTW xD			"

												It's not bad looking, although not very creative. Beside that and gimmicky microphone controls, there's not much to say about this game.It almost seems like they just have focused on drawing random buildings and then after placing them next to each other, they tacked some gameplay elements, so they could sell it as a game.It's boring, clunky at places, overly simplistic, easy (the only challenge is that in some parts of the game, they give you very little space to maneuver, often resulting in restarting the level over and over again,) and very short (you could finish it in around 30 minutes.)

												what can i say about the howler? its a simple game. it's short you can see i have 2.9 hours on record its not even that long.at the most it's a 45 min game with 16 levels.the art style is beautiful in my opinion.the game play is nice yet can be kind of dickish.for example you play as a hot air balloon and you go through the ""maps"" with a set objective whether its delivering a package,blowing something up(its not as cool as its sounds but its ok),or just go here to complete the level.all whilst trying to avoid the ""enemies"" and sharp points of the area youre in that want to explode your balloon. some of the sharp points of the map dont look sharp at all.in fact look quite the opposite and you think ""ok i can touch that to get around the blatant  sharp thing/enemy"" and end up exploding and failing the level.as for replay value...to me there is none.it seems like a one timer unless you want to play it until you can do every level on the first go(a lot of the levels are quite easy to do and can be done on the first go but others are the same  but those tiny details can(and sometimes will) get you.do i recommend this game?yes but not for the $5 asking price.i got my copy on sale for 19 cents.if you can find it on sale yes grab it if you have some spare change and an hour to kill.other wise save your money and buy something else.

												In this air current and physics based game you will have to navigate safely through level upon level completing tasks while on the clock. In this 2D game you will spend most of your time in a hot air balloon where you will have to master the different speeds of the air currents while taking into consideration that air can blow in both directions.Graphically The Howler definitely has that aged look to it. I don't mean that it looks dated it just looks more like a steam-punk Victorian age type of feel. One of the things I like about the art style in this game is that it gives you the look of a city or area of the city while not overly cluttering up the screen. This game is basically played with just a couple of buttons and/or your voice. I know that sounds a bit crazy, but if you have a good enough mic you can issues increases and decreases in altitude by the level of your voice. Do you want to go higher, get louder, you want to descend, well just get quieter. I wouldn't recommend being silent that might cause a not so fun crash, but hey you never know until you try it.One of the things that really impressed me with The Howler was the fact that if you had the tutorial text on you could easily pick up this game and be able to play it. Now I know that there are games that put you through the tutorial once and then disable, but in this game it doesn't and that's not a problem. Instead of constantly taking the player out of the game by throwing up dialogue boxes that you have to click ok or next on they put the text into the background of the game and once you start moving around it just vanishes.Now there is a slight downside to this game and that is it DEFINITELY feels like a port of a tablet or phone game. The resolution for the game can't be changed so you'll be faced with playing in a small box on your screen. The other thing is that as easy as the controls are for some reason the mouse button just doesn't seem to translate as well as say a tap and hold on a touchscreen, maybe that's just me, but I think it makes a difference.So if you are looking for a challenging puzzle game to play with some interesting yet simple controls you are going to want to pick up this game. I'm not going to lie there are definitely some of the levels where it took me more tries than it should have, but that sense of accomplishment when you do gain enough speed to negate the wind going the opposite direction, or the precision flying/floating required to navigate treacherous locations is pretty astounding. So with that I'm giving this game a 7.5 out of 10.			"

												Not much fun and very little challenge. Graphics look alot like Machinarium and very little sound effects are in this game.You are in a hot air balloon and you must fly to different levels where the direction of the air changes. You use these physics to fly over, under, and around objects on the map. Sometimes you must collect pkgs for delivery or bombs to blow up certain objects. And that is it. 15 levels that offered very little challenge and 1 bonus level if you find the password posted on a building in one of the levels. Took me about 65-70 minutes to beat this. At least the game is cheap.			"

 Cool concept	I dont't know a lot of games with voice as the primary way of playing the game (except singing games XD) so i like the idea. It can be really fun and frustrating trying adjust your voice to fly since there is a lot of precission when navigating the different levels. The only thing i can say about it is its most fun to play with your voice and especially when trying to be a little ""Dramatic"" or whatever when playing. The downsides is its short and can become boring quickly and you are using your voice, and you might not be in the mood for yelling at your pc for an hour (unless you already do that...). Its a fun little game but i personally wouldn't throw a lot of money after it.			"

												When I bought it a few hours ago, I swear it was rated overwhelmingly positive overall and recently. Its cheap on sale.It has beautiful artwork.Its 2DIts getting boring after an hour because you need to memorize the wind patterns and know where you have to go up and down and where you pick things up and drop things off because you can't see most of it until you get to it. It could use more arrows. Sometimes I go up and move into a different wind speed but I don't know which way or how hard its blowing. You have to wait until you're in the middle of the wind pattern vertically to get the small arrow which indicates direction and speed.It would make a nice calendar!Did I mention the artwork is nice?Also, its a little boring. If you've played a lot of games, then this will probaby bore you before long.			"

												i bought this game mostly because it was dirt-cheap in a midweek madness sale, and to be honest, i don't regret it. I Haven't had time to fully get knee-deep into it, but from what i played, i have to say i like it, and want to play more when CS:GO isn't hogging all of my spare time.the basic premise is this: You are random Jonny No-Face piloting a hot-air balloon, and you have to steer it from A to B, maybe dropping off a package every once in a while. you can only control upward motion, relying on air currents to steer you left and right through this steam-punk-esque balloon adventure. so to progress, you have to put your balloon in a specific air current, all the while dodging buildings, hazards and fighting your own flawed sense of timing.the first few missions are rather easy, with them being simple tutorials to introduce you to mechanics. around level 5 is where the journey into keyboard-forcefully-lodged-in-monitor fury begins, as you have to continously thread the needle across this artistically-drawn cityscape.whilst all of the models up-front are really pretty, the background is simply a quick sketch of a cityscape, which brings down the overall quality. also the colour scheme is very drab, with browns and greys taking centre stage. which is fantastic around level 10, as it made me both clinically depressed and infuriated at the difficulty at the same time.eh, if you're bored and and too happy for your own good, get it. if not, go play doom or counter-strike or something less drab and difficultso counter-strike might not be a good idea either. pewdiepie's name and acompanying quote is plastered on the store page, which means he played it on his channel, so go whatch that for a better idea.

												What's best about this game is how it looks like. Visually it really is nice. But despite the great art it didn't manage to create any atmosphere for me. I wish there was actually more story or at least some puzzle in each level but it was all about getting it right manually. Some levels are challenging but others can be cleared on first try in like 20 seconds. I feel a bit bad giving it a negative because there are some good things about it but the truth is I didn't enjoy playing it. I didn't unlock the bonul level too.			"

												As proud as i am, that my own countrymen managed to create a game, that portrays my city of birth in such a elegant steampunk-ish fashion, i cannot force myself to shake the thought the this was the main concern of the developer, as the gameplay mechanics are very frustrating and the game requires a way too high level of precision and in most cases - luck to complete the levels. Furthermore, i've noticed how the game is a cross-ad for A.Tapinas' book Hour of the wolf, that shares it's name with a swedish horror drama that i enjoyed far more than this game and the book combined. But that's aside the point. In conclusion i'll name the strong and weak points of game so you can decide, whether the game is worth your time.+ Gorgeus artstyle+ Decent soundtrack+- Simple concept- Frustratingly difficult due to poor level design- Poorly optimized for screens wider than those of smartphones, resulting in low res, or the game being displayed in a small cube, with black outlines taking up most of the space, letting the player believe, that the game is in ""fullscreen""- Short* Useless functions/alternative controls like voice command, which are nowhere close to being precise enough for the game's sadistic needs.Vistiek norėčiau padėkot kūrėjam, kad skyrė laiko šiam projektui, nes visgi, kaip pirmas blynas, neturint patirties žaidimų kūrimo sferoje, tikrai ne baisiai prisvilęs.

												A really great game that you could either use your mouse or your voice to control a hot air balloon flying and completing objectives. A challenging game but still it never will frustrate you. The art in this game is beautiful.			"
