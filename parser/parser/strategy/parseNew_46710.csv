												Bad, just bad. It's a very boring and dull game with few game mechanics and I suggest steering to port at 125 degrees before you hit this iceberg of a game.			"

												Well, I got this cos I'm quite a nerd for ironclad ships, but I think I really wasted my money even though I got it pretty cheap on sale.  The gameplay is barely there, all you can do is steer your columns of ships and tell them when to start firing.  you can't target specific enemy ships, you get very little info about the status of any ships.  I was very dissapointed as I really wanted this game to be at least ok.			"

												having played now a littl eof this i think it is an okay game to get if on sale perhaps but its appeal is going to be restricted to only the few diehard fans of the period who like their battles to move at a snails pace and also to how a limited role in activity of the battle itselfyou can direct the ship column and you can alter its speed and tell it not to fire if you want, though i cant see any reason ever to do so- there is no way to change formations in battle or even to detach a ship from you column - these omissions i find strangeperhaps the biggest gripe i would have are the non-existent collision physics - for a historical game like this where the close quarters ship firefights happen alot as the AI will come right in to fight, there are frequent collisions, but the ships just bounce of each stutteringly until one a bounce enough to move away - this is ridiculous when the pointy end of an ironclad civil war gun ship rams into the side of a wooden sailing vessel - there is no destruction occurring at all, except for the slight percentage damage added to the ships damage stat - but this sometimes doesnt occur at all - ram a ship like this would certainly sink at least one of them outrighti will recommend the game because it is easy to play with and i think the graphics are nice enough, but with the above caveats about its shoddy collision physics and limited player controls			"

												Do NOT buy this game, here is why:- ZERO help, figure everything out by yourself, there isn't even a text help file you can read- LAGGY interface, you never know if you actually clicked something or not- BAD graphic, I know not to expect much, but the ships looks bad, so does the sea- NO FUN its a really really boring game, doubt most people will finish the first battle (takes quite a while)Worst of all:- NO POINT - It was an absolutely pointless experience			"

												a very nice game.for those who complain that there is no tutorial, i suggest that you consult the game manual.its brief, clear and does the job.for those who say its a slow boring game i suggest that realistic naval wargames are obviously not your thing.this game is very tactical and rewarding.my only complaint is that i can t turn the music off!

												Absolute dog of a game.  It's like a cheap mobile game.  The 'campaign' is the same battle over and over.  The ships are really boring, and even if one of them was unique, you can sink it again and again, or own 4.  Combat drags on forever.  Graphics weren't very good for 2009, and haven't aged well.			"

												This game is like an early alpha.  There's only one mode of play - buy a fleet of ships then set them against eachother in a fleet action.  In the battle phase of the game there's very little to actually do.  Your ships are grouped into three squadrons and for each squadron you can pick a speed and course, and whether or not the ships can open fire or not.  And that's pretty much the total gameplay.  You can't pick your targets.  You can't choose ammunition types.  There's no damage control or firefighting.  You can't grapple and board.  Because the game is set in the ""High Seas"" (despite using river monitors!) the battles are in completely open ocean, without so much as an island to add variety.  I finally gave up on this game when a ship ramming another amidships had absolutely no effect whatsoever.Graphics are barely adequate, music and sound effects are okay.  It's like someone started a project to do a naval combat game and got the code to the absolute minimal running state before abandoning it.  You might be tempted to buy this if you see it cheap.  Don't.  However little you pay for it, you won't get your money's worth.			"
