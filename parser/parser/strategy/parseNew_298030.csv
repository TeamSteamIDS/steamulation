												My favorite real-time strategy game. I'll try to make this short and sweet.This particular version of the game:+ Includes both of the expansion packs. The description doesn't mention it, but both Core Contingency and Battle Tactics are here.+ Includes the map editor.+ Supports resolutions up to 1920x1200, though I find that the game looks and plays better after bumping it down a few notches.+ Seems to run perfectly on Windows 10.+ Is good old version 3.1, combatible with countless fan-made maps and mods. There are probably thousands of extra units available to add on to this game, though the game has a cap of allowing ~230 custom additional units to be installed at one time.- Does not include any updated multiplayer lobbies or functionalty.- Does not currently support the Steam overlay.If you're not familiar with the game itself, go read a real review. And then buy it. This game kicks all sorts of♥♥♥♥♥and it's worth five bucks all day long.Enjoy!			"

												10/10The Best RTS game that I have ever played, and putting it on steam is the icing on the cake.The AI is hard, but not brutal. Sounds - Are perfect for this game, the lasers sound as good as Star Wars, the cannons sound like cannons, and the explosions have a meaty punch to them. Graphics - Even though this game is from 1997, it has great graphics for the time. The explosions look great and the movements look ahead of their time, with each bot having a good looking action.Gameplay is just spectacular. If you have any interest in RTS this is a game you have to have in your library.			"

												I remembered ALL the keyboard shortcuts.  The game runs will on my SSD / Windows 10 machine and it's as fun as I remember.  No RTS has duplicated this game's ""feel"" which is a shame, since a straight rewrite of the mechanics would probably sell well today.   Every RTS I try I compare to this game and every RTS I've played falls short.Basically the best RTS ever written.   Many have attempted to become it's succssor, none have succeeded. "

												Total Annihilation is the defining game of the RTS genre. Looking back to the late 90s and the technology available then, this game was amazingly advanced and did many things that weren't at all common then. Many common RTS elements that are expected in a game released today can be seen in their youth in TA. The order queuing system, the streaming resource and building systems, the diversity of units and asymmetrical factions are all key features that were later used in practically every RTS since. You can clearly see the foundation of Supreme Commander especially. There are aspects of TA that still haven’t been matched, such as the unit diversity: Air, Land, Sea, Seaplane, Hovercraft, Amphibious.Like artillery? How about the Intimidator, which can fire halfway across the map? Too slow? Build the Buzzsaw: a giant rotary cannon made up of Intimidators that fires as fast as a machine gun and will drain your energy economy in seconds. Yes, it IS the most entertaining gun ever!The music of TA is the best orchestral soundtrack ever made for a game. I still sometimes listen to the ""battle"" tracks in my car. I turn the music off in every other game I’ve played and listen to “real” music instead (I remember listening to Spice Girls on a CD while playing), but TA got to keep its soundtrack.I think a large part of what made TA such a fun and long lasting experience was the modding community. I remember spending as much time finding, downloading (V.90 modem, yo), and figuring out conflicts between mods as playing the game, but those mods extended the diversity and playability of the game so extensively that there are still active players AND active modders for TA. You don’t see that with too many 19 year-old games.The chief contender for the RTS throne was Starcraft, which was released right around the same time as TA, and went on to define the ""twitch"" RTS subgenre. Coming from Warcraft 2, I remember buying both games, and being rather disappointed in Starcraft, since it seemed to me to be ""Warcraft in space"". TA was something entirely new and captured that certain something that makes it a gaming classic... and I've probably spent more time in this game than any other, ever.			"

												Word of Warning it is a nostalgic game.A true RTS Game that could be said to have out lasted Starcraft Brood War and inspired the next generation of Real Time Stratergy games, Remember fondly playing this game as a kid and back in the day it was perhaps one of the first community driven games that boasted thousands of mods and total conversions from Star Wars to the Modern World this game was much like the Skyrim of the 90's with an seemingly endless supply of units, mods, and creativity on the part of the community.Unsurprisingly this hasn't changed, Total Annihilation still retains a small but solid community of players ranging from Casuals to Professionals all it covers all the basis for a RTS game but not without it's issues.The base game is known to suffer from pathfinding issues, you'll frequently find that without the use of mods or modified scripts the AI will struggle considerably and will at times do stupid things that might ruin the experiance of players looking for a challenge, if that's you then I'd recommend either playing with friends or joining one of the many communities out their!Or look into getting one of the many mods the game supports, most if not all improve the AI come to ruthless degrees where you'll hard pressed to both micro and marco manage an entire force of soulless machines. The best way I can descrbe it would be to think of Skyrim without mods, then think of Skyrim with mods that's effectively TA in a nuthshell.Options:+ The developers certainly had longevity in mind, you can adjust the resolution up to 1920 x 1080.+ Provides all the options you might expect from a game of this age, perhaps abit more.- On/Off only, you can't find a middle ground without adjusting the files directly.Gameplay+ A map for everybody! - every map has something for everybody the metal maps provide infinite resources and lead to a fast-paced style game. In contrast low metal maps have you fighting over resources while slowly pushing your way into the enemy base. Maps on distant moons have you transporting units by air over impassable chasms or bombing your opponent into the dust.+ Play how you want - Many RTS games have a 'defined' stratergy TA has no such definition, you will encounter players who love the good old peepee rush or those whose sole purpose is to watch you squirm as they destroy your outlying extractors. You'll encounter the turtles naturally but the game provides you with all the nessesary tools to enact your stratergy and descimate others.- AI Pathfinding - As mentioned the pathfinding is horrible and will almost certainly require fixing especially if you want to play Skirmish thankfully their are mods and simple scripts to fix this.- Performance - Most modern day PC's won't have a problem until like Skyrim you hit a point where your computer begins to chug along. This tends to arise from heavily modded games especially when you start to up the unit cap from 200 to 1000+Community:+ Still going strong not much else to say here besides the fact you have over 10 years of mods to discover some of which have been developed over so many years.

												It looks like just a bunch of robots killing each other to most people, but Total Annihilation is one of the deepest darkest stories ever told. It's the only accurate game I've ever seen about our future, where humans are all dead and the arm clones fight the core planetary mind for control of the universe.  They don't even care about being alive or anything, they just want to annihilate the other side so so much.  Sometimes a battle can take like 8 hours and just grind on, it takes so much willpower to keep going, or to even notice when you get nuked.  It's an endless battle.  It also has a great soundtrack written by Jeremy Seole, who wrote a lot of the music in Secret of Evermore.  The first time I saw Total Annihilation, I was in Circuit City and I saw this cool looking guy getting bombed by 50 fast moving fighters and planes and he couldn't stop the computer from killing him and he eventually lost his commander and then his last towers and the map went grey.  It was like 1997 or something and he must have been horrible at the game and I don't think either of us bought anything from circuit city that day, but to see that cool guy get annihilated by an endless wave of planes was shocking to me.  He said ""damn it"" or something like that and then looked at his watch and said ""oh no"" and then he ran away, I guess he had to go somewhere and was late.  I saw it as a great challenge to become as good as he was some day, and I still feel like I'm not, but objectively I must have met that challenge because I have won wars against 10 computer players with population limits in the thousands.  If I could go back in time, I would go back there, ask him if i could help, and save his base.			"

												The future is grand. Here we are, at the end of 2015, and I can now play my favorite game of all time! There is a very good reason this game was 1997 game of the year and it wore that badge proudly on the sales box. So jump on board, I have hours of child hood that have NOT been wasted to prove how great Total Annihilation truly is.If you liked Supreme Commander and/or Planetary Annihilation, I would highly recomend you check out the game that started it all. While it might seem a little dated, even to this day, it is still quite impressive. You see, this game was a first to do a lot of things. A true innovator. Not to mention the fantastic soundtrack, still being one of the best ever thanks to Jeremy Soule.You should note that this download does come with both expansion packs: Battle Tactics and The Core Contingency. This is great news as the expansions have not worked on Windows without some kind of emulation since XP. I myself can finaly battle with a Krogoth, something I've not done for 7 odd years.Most people buying and downloading this game have probably already played it, so I will spare it a rating breakdown, though it would be just about perfect score. Instead I will point out a couple bugs that I've been getting so far. I will edit this review with fixes as they come along. Feel free to comment for patches, fixes, whatnots.-Everytime game launches it squishes all my windows desktop icons together.-Will tab out of game to windows desktop whenever a new screen is loaded in game. Game doesn't crash though, so that if mostly fine.-Can't side scroll at a widescreen resolution. Also not turly an issue in my mind, just changed the resolution to 1024x600-Sometimes construction units will drop their shift queues.-Seems like Steam Overlay might not be compatible?Other than that the game is still the masterpiece that it always has been and the under $4 asking price is chump coin. Enjoy!			"

												Total Annihilation was and still is a very fun RTS game. You build a base, gather two types of resources and pump our land, sea and air units to engage your enemy. Explosions and bits of units will rain over the battlefield. The game works great on modern day systems with several resolutions available. For the price this is a bargain as the game has a lot of content and you have lots of mods/maps/units to try out too.			"

												The emotions I experienced when I saw this game on Steam were indescriptible. To be honest, this is the greatest RTS I have ever played and have ever seen in my entire life.  I spent most of my gaming days playing this work of art.  A little bummed out that multiplayer is complicated to set up, but it is still possible.  To put it simply, this is a game I would recommend to anyone I have ever met.  It may be old, but that doesn't mean that it's mechanics and gameplay aren't unique.  This game is truly one of a kind and its gaming mechanics and how it is played might not be replicated for a very, very long time.			"

Posted: January 8, 2016
												My favorite game as a child, i quickly snapped up the DRM Free edition availible through GOG.com. Now OTA is here on Steam in all its glory! It wasnt Starcraft or Command & Conquer that set the bar for late 90s rts games. OTA is the undisputed and most refferenced old-school RTS that to this day inspires the finer qualities in the EPIC War genre we crave.Its important to note *though steam failed to mention it in the product details* This edition includes all DLC along with the main game (Original Total Annihilation, Core contengency Expansion, All of the Battle Tactics Expansions, Bonus Maps, Bonus Official Cavedog Units, Patch 3.1 known as the ""No CD Patch"" Patch 3.1 also is tweaked with the expanded unit cap which can be modified in the system files to a maximum of 5000 units per player in a 10 player battle. updated and fully supported multiplayer hosting for matches complete with thier own communities... The Added bennefit of the Steam Edition is access to the steam community for multiplayer compatibility. by comparison it is identical to the GOG edition with exception that the steam version has better compatibility with modern windows OS. Both copies work seamlessly with Wine if you use Linux or Mac. I reccomend the Steam edition for ease of gaming with friends. but the GOG.com version is DRM Free meaning you can buy one copy and then gift as many as you want to your friends per thier TOS agreement.-----Some useful details about the game not mentioned in the description-----Minor Bug: Due to this being a rather ancient game... there is an issue with the screen rendering of the game for flat screens which will cause a periodic flicker. Alt Tab didnt exist back then either so you should press the Windows key to minimise your game if you wish to chat with your steam buddies outside of the game. This however has an issue where the the screen will tweak out into odd colors... just minimize and maximize a couple times and the emulator steam uses to run the game will adjust and fix the issue pretty reliably. This is caused by the change in formatting for video displays after the flat screen transition.Some Extra Stuff:by default the multiplayer loby should have this enabled due to game additions added for both the GOG.com & Steam versions of the game. If you accidently shrink your lobby down or it appears as the old default of maximum of 4 players for skirmish and multi, simply press the 8 key on your keyboard followed by the roman numeral key from 2 to 10 indicating the max player matches. so 2 would be ""8 ii"" while 10 would be ""8 x"".to enter a ""console code"" while playing multiplayer or skirmish game modes simply press Enter and type + followed by the command. (The older versions of the game allowed some console commands to work in single player but the 3.1 patch made many commands nonfunctional or were removed all together. Many of these commands are now only availible within the develloper mode which you will need to download from TAUniverse & other fansites. It is possible to reinable them by editing the configuration files but the engine will not allow you to play multiplayer with other clients that have different files then you.)some useful console commands are +gamma, +contour, & +showranges. These dont really break gameplay and fully function in all gamemodes, so enabling cheats to use these functions is ok if you agree with your gamemates that they can be used.+gamma lets you adjust the brightness of the screen ""+gamma 8.5"" was default for the old tube monitors... you can play around with this if you have lighting issues. +contour is useful for seeing the 3D terrain elivations and is highly useful as nobody back then had a concept of strategic zoom like what was introduced by Supreme Commander. +contour 5 is best i think as it still lets you view the pretty terrain features while letting you put that factory on the perfect spot easier. type +contour with no number to remove the elivation overlay. if you put a value in decimal that is less then one you will need to place a zero before the decimal for it to register... note this can cause framerate loss or artificial slowdown of the game for really minor details. in case of a game crash you will need to reinstall yourgame if you input values lower then 0.045.+showranges indicates the ranges of the various weapons on mobile units. it doesnt work on fixed fortifications which was fixed when they included the same feature in Supreme Commander. By default all units have an explosion range where they will harm other units within that range... and most units have 1 - 2 weapon ranges which might be off screen if its a long ranged weapon. some specdial units will by default have other indicators depending on functionality such as a cloak or stealth/jammer field that should be enabled by default.a neat feature on the main menu is to type ""dxdeath"" which will enable or disable a Cavedog logo in the lower middle of the menuscreen. if you click that... in the old days it would allow you to view the credit screen... also while enabled it would allow you to manually pick missions rather then unlocking missions as you played.--another 2 codes that are neat but may become annoying for various reasons are +sing & +dither.+sing replaces the vehical sounds of units with a guy singing some nonsensical toon.+dither changes the gray scale of the out of view zones in the game to a ""dithered"" or bug-screen colored view. it looked great on the old analog tube monitors but causes major flickering issues on modern digital flatscreens. DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY or are at risk for seizures or taking medications with this risk (regular gameplay on flatscreens however is completely safe)... there is no warning for this feature as this game predates those videogame warnings by like 10 years.

Not a deal breaker but incredibly annoying since the map is a huge part of managing a 100 different units.   "

												Back when everyone was playing Starcraft, I was still playing this game.  I couldn't believe more people didn't know how intelligent its design was, how brilliant the waypointing and resource system were.  True, it is not a ""hard counter"" style of play like Starcraft; it is not a click-fest action-RTS hybrid where each unit has a special ability.  It is definitely hard-core RTS with many different build paths, a much deeper tech tree, and much larger armies that are still somehow easy to manage.  So many games and sequels (spiritual and direct) have tried to emulate the ease of play here, but they've all botched it up somehow.  True, it does somewhat boil down to a war of escalation, but it's damn fun every single time getting there.for $5 I'd recommend this to anyone unless you really can't stand RTS games in general.			"

												RTS Classic!  Works in Windows 10!  Tons of Missions!  Cheap!  Buy it!Another favorite RTS from my childhood brought back to life!  Horraaayyy!  Great strategy game with an interesting resource system, tons of units, tons of missions and hours of fun to be had!Was ahead of its time in so many ways when it came out back in 1997 and it still has so much to offer, especially with the cheap price tag!  The expansions are also included so you get TONS of single player missions and content.  Only real drawbacks are the 1997 era graphics and occasional clumsy unit pathing.  If you can look past the graphics, the depth and difficulty really do rival that of most modern RTS games.  There is also no Auto-Save type feature so make sure to save your game often!  (and also use your commander to capture the warp gates, don't blow them up!  You'll thank me later...) Despite being an old game it works great in Windows 10 with no compatibilty problems or issues.  Just install and go!If you enjoy games like Command and Conquer, Warcraft 1 and 2, Starcraft, Supreme Commander, ect... Dont Skip this one!Truely a classic and not to be missed! "

												My parents got us a used PC with a Pentium I in 1997, which was nothing to scoff at in Eastern Europe at that time. The odds of the machine arriving with Total Annihilation on it's hard drive however seem incredible to me in hindsight. Of course initially, we, a 7-, 4- and 3-year-old didn't have much of a clue what we were doing playing this game, but I reckon by the time I was 10 or so I started getting better, reaching higher campaign missions. Never had the skill to complete the game back then though and I spent most of the time nuking the AI player on a random map with infinite metal, which was great fun in itself.Shortly before writing this review, I didn't know TA won Game of the Year in 1997, or even that it was made in 1997, but replaying this classic really made me realize why I was less impressed than my peers with later titles like Age of Empires 2 or Command & Conquer. TA had simply done so much better before them and I knew of it. I kid you not, Total Annihilation would be a strong title if it was released today. The mechanics of destruction feel so satisfying. Even the graphics don't look too bad. Most of today's titles cannot match it's diversity of units. TA had a pseudo-3D world where hills obstruct artillery fire, unit task queues and radar almost 20 years ago and I haven't even seen a similar veteran unit mechanic since. Even the story (I mean how cool is a Jupiter Brain?) is good and the soundtrack great. 7-year-old me in 1997 would have massively overestimated what a 2016 RTS title should look like based on this game, but I also get that if RTS-s would have progressed from TA to better as fast as things move in today's world, they would have become too complicated for most of the population by 1999 and everyone would have jumped ship for something simpler like Starcraft anyway.So yeah, it's highly debatable if any RTS has surpassed Cavedog's 1997 masterpiece, which works on a Pentium I, to this day.

												TL;DR: Buy this. It's worth it.Total Annihilation.Damn.This game was my childhood. I remember sitting on my Dad's lap and we'd build up our army together and then nuke the CORE to pieces. Those were the days.Total Annihilation is a Real-Time Strategy game. You start off with one 'Unit', your Commander, and slowly build up your army of planes, vehicles, mechs, boats, hovercraft, etc. For a game that is 20 years old this year this is STILL in my opinion the greatest RTS game of all time. This is the type of game that despite the graphics being massively outdated, and only 1.1GB big (not even that), it's still feels full of content. The maps are HUGE and there's lots of variety. The Units all have their own jobs and characteristics. There's a campaign too, and also, if you can figure out how to get it to work, a multiplayer. At the time of writing this review it only says I have 2.1 hours on record, but to be truthful I probably have hundereds outside of Steam. This game is truly one of my favourite games of all time and I HIGHLY reccomend it to anybody who's into the Supreme Commander series. This is similar to Planetary Annihilation in that it was made by a few of the same people, but from what I've heard from Planetary Annihilation, despite being more modern, better in graphical design and including much more content, THIS is the game you want. Trust me.Thanks for reading my review of Total Annihilation. I really hope you buy this game; it's truly a masterpiece.			"

Sadly the graphics don't hold up, but the gameplay is still solid as the day it was released. If you are an RTS fan and haven't played this game at ANY point, you owe it to yourself to play the progenitor of many RTS's.			"

												Best RTS game ever made. Have played this online since 2001 at the top level. It is a game that never fully got the success it deserves, it came out around the same time as StarCraft and is a much nicer game, just never fully took off. Haven't played for around 3-4 years properly but recently got back into it through the mod TA Escalation which improves on the game in every way. There is a decent sized community playing this mod online through GameRanger and it is growing all the time. Link for TA Escalation: http://taesc.tauniverse.com/-A new version of ESC coming out very soon-Tournaments (one just finished, another coming up soon, for money!)-Maps still being made to play online-A player named FN202 has his own Youtube and Twitch accounts and regularly streams games on Twitch and records for Youtube  -Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKiCHTzW6NykcHVS9ygHxaA  -Twitch: http://www.twitch.tv/fn202-Still played online through GameRanger, whether that's OTA (original TA, no mods) or TA Escalation and I'm seeing more and more players all the timeI see no reason why this game cannot be huge again. TA online seems to be picking up momentum and there is no better time to get online and play, whether you're an old player coming back or completely new.Check out the www.tauniverse.com forum for any information you might need.Another note, please be aware the 3.1 patch this version comes with isn't final. There is a 3.9.02 unofficial patch which you can get from TA Universe above which is accepted as the standard online and fixes many bugs and adds many new features. The direct link for that is here:http://www.tauniverse.com/forum/showthread.php?t=43735Enjoy			"

												This is one of those old games that age really really well. like the GOG version it works fine on newer systems. And no need for mods to get 1080p or higher. As the game even back in 1997 did scale to your max windows resolutions, sadly the game UI don't. Nor the radar. So at 2K or 4K they are really tiny. And ofc this has the addon ""The Core Contingency"" and lots of other old bonus missions. And yes. I use Win10 and it works just fine. At the time of this writing the Arm campaing is done, 11 hours played and not a single crash. This game is equally great for turtle players and rushers alike. The SP campaign AI can be brutal on the attacks at times. But even a turtle player can focus on defenses and hold up until he is ready. Some of the maps are huge and will need some micro managing to get around well, but take your time and it will work out. There are tons of units to select form. So it will fit any style you have the more you progress in the story. I would recommend to google keyboard shortcuts, as there are a ton of then to make the game easier to handle. As the game set the standard for way point systems, so you can order a unit to move to the enemy base, attack a unit, fall back and patrol the base all in one way point go. Or set the commander to build a few buildings while you attack or scout.For this price, even not on a discount. You would be foolish to skip this part of RTS history. It set the standards along with C&C for all time to come. Old or new RTS player, it won't take long to get into this gem. Even with the huge unit count. Only downside is that buildings count towards the unit cap at 200. But each unit counts as 1. Not 1 to 8 like in SC.Highly recommended.			"

												It felt like christmas come early today when I saw this game finally come to Steam. This game was my childhood. Any fan of RTS really needs to have played this! It was so ahead of its time and still provides great entertainment today. Tons of units, advanced controls, huge maps, 3D environment, great physics engine with satisfying explosions, an active modding community (still - almost 20 years on! check out TA Universe) and one of the best game OSTs i've ever heard courtesy of Jeremy Soule. The only thing that could do with updating a little is the AI, but skirmish is still great (hit * then x at the skirmish menu to unlock all 10 AI slots).The only RTS i've loved since has been Supreme Commander (the first one), which was the spiritual successor to this game and made by the same people.

												Okay. The process of how this game goes is mind blowing, so stay with me as long as you can.You start out as the commander.So do your enemies.You're a ROBOT.You need to make a machine that makes robots that can make robots.The machine can make Construction bots which can then make advanced machines based on their purpose.If it's an airport, advanced airport.You'll need energy and metal to keep creating things, without it you build slower and you have a lowered chance to survive.Advanced bots can also build advanced stuff such as nukes and anti missile machines. Soon enough it's your army of robots against all of the other armys of robots.If your mind isn't blown then this should do it: There's so much more in this game then I have described so far.Best freaking game I've ever played. For the age of the game, I can still play it and have more fun then all of the games I have in my library including Binding of Isaac, Payday 2, Garry's Mod, and such more.GET IT IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT.As long as you're okay with 2d.

												This used to be THE game I played when I was a kid growing up. It was always school, homework, total annihilation until dinner. After buying Planetary Annihilation and being somewhat disappointed with the game and then seeing they decided ""It'll be funny if we and remake it and sell it again"", I spent $4.99 to buy this game digitally since I can no longer play the disc instead of ""upgrading"" my copy of PA to TITANS. Probably going to end up spending hundreds of hours playing this game again just like when I was a kid.Pros: +Both expansion packs automatically included+Map editor+Supports larger screen sizes+Ver 3.1, compatible with tons of community mods / custom units and maps+Working perfectly fine with windows 10+Nostalgia boner if you've played the game before+It has this unique feel to it. Idk how to really explain it, but, after playing other RTS games, I've never got the same feel with them as I have to this game.+Probably the spark of what started my robot love as a child+I'm just pulling extra pros to make the game look even better to other people+Edited Pro: Works perfectly with other modded version of TA (like what i mentioned above) after doing the community updates for the game, however doesn't clock hours since they run on a separate .exe. Been playing tons of  TA: EscalationCons: (most of these can probably be fixed with community mods anyway, haven't actually looked yet)-With larger screen sizes, the hud gets super tiny because of it. Probably cause the game wasn't originally made for sizes that large-Cap on custom units. I personally don't find it that big of an issue but some people may.-Steam overlay doesn't work-Multiplayer functions not updated-Upon launching, smashes all my opened windows into a small corner  on a single monitor. Not really an issue, just annoying tbh			"

												(Don't be fooled by the small number of hours played: I've owned this game since its release, back in 1997)If you want to know what a RTS should look and feel like, play this game. Or even Star/Warcraft. Or even any C&C title up to 3. Forget about C&C 4 and anything after it. But I digress. TA has withstood the test of time, has a active community that has produced quite literaly thousands of new units, and dated graphics as it has, still is an incredible and massive game, with a even more incredible original made music.The only flaw I can point is that the minimap wont scale up with monitor resolution, a thing that for those like me that still have the original CDs, might be a tad frustrating.Give yourself the chance to play this true classic of PC gaming, that deserves the same praise given to titles such as Doom or Baldur's Gate.  10000/10 Energy would 1000/10 Metal again.

												You have been transported back to 1998 and after summer school swimming you would first watch your friend's lawyer law firm dad play total Annihilation. You thought first, ""Well, this isn't [Command and Conquer: Red Alert]"" is what you would had thought. No, this is some sort of rule defying CPU magic that could only happen on a Hewlett Packard running Windows 98. There on the screen were fully rendered 3D polygons with basic bit textures, with full working shadows and particles that you could see. Robots were expected to be scouts and ambushers, vehicles were to be the ground spearhead, aircraft had a role in providing support, but wait the ships at sea or the riverbanks might need a world from you. This was not a 2D plane that had grid square movements and spacing, this was close to real life when war was not fought with sprites, but with real 3D modeling of both the unit and environment. Tanks robots and ships will attempt to shoot aircraft with all weapons when attacked by them. Subs stay underwater when firing torpedos. Everything land and sea leaves a wreckage. Audio is not stuck in 16 bit audio but uses the CD as the audio.Nukes and missile defenses were a real game changer. And all the things that you had then, all started with nothing but a single unit known to as your avatar commander.You could build anything, everywhere, all the time. You can make anything, anywhere, every time. You can fight anything, any time, all the time.Somehow, somewhere, you are thinking about anything that can possibly be absolutely perfect in 1998 only to top it off with a soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule.

When the game is transitioning from screens it seems to shrink then enlarge again for me at least. Obviously the sound effects are muffled because of it's age and the visuals are lacking.

A Mega-tactical WTF, and absolutely way ahead of its time.  It recreated a whole new standard and ushered a new era of hardcore RTS gaming.  It maintains that standard to this day and can hold its head high.  The game has aged with grace so extremely well and I am proud and priveledged to have played it.  Well worth it.

												If you have not heard of this game, and you see the date it was created and you are thinking, ""There's no way I'm playing a game that's THAT old!"", STOP!!!If you have not heard of this game, then you have been in the proverbial closet of games for far too long!I cannot express how amazing this game is, even after it's almost 20 years old now.  I first got this game long before it was available on Steam, and for me it's a classic.  For me, this game set the standard for games I like.  This was one of the first games I've ever played on PC, and it is FUN!And this is a GREAT DEAL for it: The whole game plus its Expansions/DLC's for $5?  But enough of my rambling praise, let get into WHY it is sooo good.First off, a bit of history: this game made it.  This was the first game to feature the concept of 3D terrain.  It set a precedent for RTS games in that regard.  To this day, even after its creators went out of business (RIP Cavedog), it still has an active community and modding fanbase.What makes this game so fun for me is, remarkably, its simplicity.  The game is very straight-forward, so there isn't much of a learning curve to worry about.  All you need to learn are some basic tactics, base defense skills, and then watch as your enemy explodes. #NukesForDaysSkirmishes can add new dynamics/entertainment to the game.  The only point of frustration here is that when it comes to their own bases, the AI are not the brightest (but then again, they're pretty good for something from the mid-90's!).In short, Do you enjoy watching things explode?  Do you enjoy tactically destroying or swarming your opponent?  Do you like building the figurative ultimate-base/fortress?  DO YOU LIKE WATCHING THINGS EXPLODE!?!?!?Then get this game, Because it has aged well, and it's Awesome!!!!			"

												Don't be fooled by my play time here on Steam. No other game in my entire collection has more hours put into it than this game right here. Spanning across many, many years, multiple computer systems, multiple OS, and countless mods, no other game I've ever owned has had as much attention in my life as this game right here.And now, it's on Steam.It's not the best port, I'll say that right now. The cracked unofficial WIndows 7 version I had running on my Windows 8,1 computer two years ago ran smoother than this one, but I digress, to finally have this game on a Windows 10 computer is pretty nifty. It does look a bit dated compared to many modern RTS, but at the same time it has aged very well. If you've ever played a ""Collect resources, build things, destroy your enemy"" RTS in the past decade or so, Total Anihilation will be very easy to get into. There are a few technical issues with this port, and some fixes to resolution need to be made for certain, plust it seems the game only has the ""official"" patches, meaning the unit limit cap is sadly smaller than I'm used to. For those who thrived off of modding this game, you'll understand what I mean. For those that don't, let's just say a 500 unit cap was ""small"" to us.Technical aspects aside, it is still a decent port and truly a game worthy of giving a look over. A rare gem of an RTS that was revolutionary back in a time dominated by Starcraft and Command & Conquer. Here you not only get the original legendary game itself, but all it's expansions and the final patch that was released shortly before Cavedog studios went belly up. For the price you're paying, it's well worth a play.Either for nostalgia's sake, curiosity, or if you're like me and never want to stop playing this game, OS be damned, then seriously, get it.End the war spanning the galaxy, and leave your enemy in total annihilation.

												I love this game. I spent 1000 hours or more playing this game as a kid. For years it was my go-to boredom killer. It is, hands down, the best RTS I've ever played. It may even be my favorite game of all time. I am so excited that it is now on Steam. Pros: The soundtrack is amazing. Tons of maps for skirmishes and multiplayer. Lots of modern screen resolutions, including 2560x1080 ultrawide. Looks very good for its age, and seems to run very well. Includes expansion and extras.Cons: Definitely a nostalgia game. May not be everyones cup of tea. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS games. Buy it NOW!			"

												I have thousands of hours in this game (pre steam) and it is one of the best RTS of all time. It doesnt exactly hold up to todays standards in some areas as this game was made in the mid 90s, but that being said it still has features that a number of RTS games should have and still don't. This game set the standard upon what all RTS should be made. It had a number of features that were way a head of its time so the resolution is still great not to mention it was one of the first games to use advanced sound features so jeremy soule (Elder Scroll series, Harry Potter, Guild wars, a ton of other stuff) and his orchestrial soundtrack still get your adrenaline going. As others have said, this is a nostalgic game that still has a community that supports it +1000s of maps and mods along with that. If you buy this expecting it to look like a brand new RTS you will be mistaken. One last note. IF that graphics really do kill you but you like the feel of the game, there is always Supreme Commander/ Supreme Commander: FA. Same developers different studio and publisher. Also, Supreme Commander 2 sucks and is nothing like these.			"

												This game is quite possibly the single greatest video game ever made. When it was released in 1997, Total Annihilation was so far ahead of its time that in some respects it has never been duplicated since.At the time I write this review there is no Steamworks multiplayer or Workshop mod support. But if these things are implemented, I have no doubts whatsoever that we will see a huge resurgence of Total Annihilation. There are already tens of thousands of third-party units, many mega-mods of hundreds of units, total conversions for everything from Star Wars to WWII to Gundam, to entirely new games built on TA as a basis. The amount of strategic depth flowing from fairly simple rules of collecting metal from metal spots and using it to construct various types of units, using a continous economy, physics-based battles, and a serious need for planning and tactics rather than unit counter relationships, make Total Annihilation a much deeper and more interesting strategy game than most of its contemporary cousins, including Starcraft and Age of Empires.Real time strategy games have been starved for ideas for many years now, with the most successful ones being sequels and spiritual successors to genuinely innovative strategy games from the '90s. Alongside Starcraft, Total Annihilation is one of the great progenitors of the modern era of strategy games, and in many respects it has never been equaled.			"

Found this a couple months ago, I was SO EXCITED!The best part is, its still totally playable. And its super cheap!Like many others have said, it has a pretty good AI system. Although I still havent figured out if you can attack move? (Which is sending units to move and attack on sight) Funny story, I clicked attack on a position thinking it was attack move, couldnt figure out why my units were attacking units i couldnt even see...it was the ground LOL.*Also for those of you that want to play a more modern version, there is planetary annihilation: TITANS.

So maybe search on the tube if you may still like it even if the graphics are so old, even if nowadays controls are better, even if... and decide.			"

												Total Annihilation, the legend.I remember playing this game nearly every day after school. I fired it up again now, and it's just as awesome as I remember. Many more hours will follow. TA pioneered so many great concepts and there are still RTS games that try and fail at being as good a game as this is. It's well balanced, it's exciting and the soundtrack is unlike anything you get these days, I still remember hearing my CD-ROM drive winding up as I was being attacked, trying to change songs to something more upbeat. It's addictive too, with memorable and unique units across the board (especially the planes that are properly fast). Also, 1920 x 1080 in 1997. This is the game that stood the test of time, and it continues to do so with every passing year.I could go on but all I can say is: Worth every cent.			"

												Critical part of gaming history, and a must-have addition to anyone looking to look at gaming's history. This is one of the major three archetypes of RTS, those being C&C, TA, and SC in terms of gameplay semblance. Games usually follow one of these three determinite paths, as these are archetypes, so you should probably look at those if you're intrested in RTS games and want to make one too.Total Annihilation is the creation of Chris Taylor, an industry veteran and, interestingly enough, Toy maker. You can see why he would eventually partner with THQ or TOY HEADQUARTERS.As a toymaker, naturally, chris taylor took this same idea to game creation, and eventually with his team, Cavedog created Total Annihilation. Not satisfied with the SC and C&C, the developers went ""Wait a second, no. this is wrong. We need MORE UNITS."" And so it was. Whilst C&C never traditionally had a unit cap, it was not specifically made for this, where as TA was specifically constructed with an emphasis on massive armies.The story involves you, as THE LAST COMMANDER OF YOUR FACTION, either arm or core, to quite simply, annihilate the other faction. This war began over the concept of patterning that, at mass civilian request, made mandatory for citizen protection, as their conciousness was saved and preserved on massive databanks and transfered to machine. This is what became CORE CONCIOUSNESS, and then later CORE. Both of their names hold a lot of semblance. ARM is not machines, rather, mass numbers of cloned individuals that detested the move to machines. ARM possesses it's central HQ in an ARM of the galaxy, where CORE is, well, the core. At this point, there are endless ruined worlds by this war's wake. Now all that's left is the other faction, and the only acceptable outcome for the other is...TOTAL               ANNIHILATION. "

												This game simply oozes 90's charm, from gameplay to experiencing the limitations.A lot of people who are not long time RTS fans will probably get turned off by this game, just from looking at it.I do, however, encourage people to play this game.This game is still to this day years, decades even, ahead of it's time.From the notion of destroyed unit husks blocking unit movement, to the sheer scale of how powerful simple units can be.And for once in an RTS I actually feel like an Experimental unit, is Experimental.The Krogoth is an amazing unit that, while yes, does take a long time to build, can dish out serious firepower, however unlike Experimental units of today it is not Nigh-on invincible, and can die reletively easily, but can quickly pave the way for an army.The one big downside to the Krogoth is that only the CORE can build it, so if you're the ARM, you might want to build up your artillery.Although you'll probably never reach the point of actually building the Krogoth since it does take a considerable amount of time to build.The game also has a booming soundtrack, composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule, who also composed the music for Elder Scrolls, Guild Wars and other hit/Cult Classic titles.Very few composers such as Soule actually still compose today.Frank Klepaki is one such artist, alough his Command and Conquer work, will probably still be his best.The only game that I could recommend to ever coming close to TA, is probably Dark Reign, and even that doesn't come anywhere near the level this game produced.Pros:-The game is quite fluid, and offers quite a great deal of control over your units.-The future setting works in its favor instead of against it (Even to this day).-The music is masterfully crafted to suit the game's tone and ambition.-The art is quite unique and no 2 units look the same.-One of the very few RTS of its time to use more than 1 resource and be balanced-Maps are expertly crafted so that no one position feels, acts, or is the same.-Terrain actually plays a role in the game's combat.-Buildings actually have a wide degree of rotation (For the most part).Cons:-The game's flidity can be hindered by unexpected obstacles (UI, terrain, etc.).-While the art is incredibly unique, I do understand that it is a bit dated, namely how units and structures act.-Having 2 resources also means having more to protect in specific locations.-Asymmetry can lead to many problems on some of the maps, such as spawns.-Terrain is nice, but the tiniest of bumps can make a well planned base fall apart (So be very careful and wary)-Yes buildings have a surprising amount of rotation, however construction buildings can only be placed one way with minor rotation when placed.The game also came with a map editor and a ridiculous player system, both of which were not great.Building maps was a chore, and had many placement issues.The player count required 4 extra copies if you wanted to take advantage of all 8 player slots.TA Kingdoms improved on both of those features, but was unfortunately the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child, to many people, of the franchise.Although I quite liked Kingdoms, I just feel like it had too many units, and could have been better.Overall I give Total Annihilation a 10/10.Not even the flaws can keep me from loving this Masterpiece of ""Ahead of its time"" technology.

												I'll never forget the day I stumbled upon a copy Total Annihilation in a discount bin around the holidays of '98. It was the year of the big Ice Storm of '98 rocked Montreal and it's surrounding regions really hard I had never heard of the game or even played many games like it except for Age of Empires at the time, but what I saw interested me. The name of the game was cool, the box art was awesome. All I needed was a yes from my Dad and the rest was history. I remember going home that night and playing the campaign and days later taking what I learned to the online matchmaking on my wicked fast 56k modem, good times.. Total Annihilation was full of replay value due to the number of units and maps the community was creating at the time and the two official expansions that were released in the spring of '98.This game is nostalgic but the fun never wears off. The only thing that doesn't hold up is the graphics but if you set that aside there are hundreds of hours of fun to be had especially with the balancing mods, units and maps that can be added.			"

												My favourite RTS game of all time that I played non stop for days as a kid has finally come to steam today, fixing all the bugs that you have if you try to play the original on a modern PC, thank you so much. I love this game so much, Who would have thought an RTS game could be so atmospheric, but so epic at the same time and The soundtrack to this game is probably my favorite even today. I will be spending a lot of time on this.			"

												This is one of the greatest games of all time and probably the greatest RTS of all time. If you already own the GOG version, there is no reason to buy this steam version, however.  It adds absolutely nothing. I bought it and already requested a refund, which doesn't reflect poorly on this release -- just that it's nothing new.But if you don't already own the GOG version, this might be the right version to pick up. You owe it to yourself to play this.			"

												This is a surprisingly good game despite it's age. It's a solid RTS that's has clearly shown it's greatness for nearly two decades. Mind that this game is old and you'll need some sort of a third party program to play multiplayer (I'm using Game Ranger). My biggest problem is that the AI when set beyond easy/when used in a multiplayer match, they'll literally cheat themselves resources. To get the most out of it, you'll likely require the Escalation mod, which most multiplayer games i've seen use.In the end, I'd give it a 7/10, it's old, but a pretty swell game as a whole, best played with friends too!

												one of my most fav RTS from years past... easily beats the snot out of any RTS created since. shame CD shutdown as they made some decent games. WG gave this for ""free"" by buying Moo reboot but honestly soo worth the money. this is copy 3 or 4 of TA i now own, ofcourse the original physical hard copy was the first with the xpacks. then i think GoG or something has the other copy now steam. as long as this 3.1 version can be ""modded"" with the community upgrade pack.. it will most likely replace CoH2 as my rts fix. if you dont own TA I'd actually suggest you get it, supreme commander was a shallow attempt to reboot it, and that planet commander failure doesnt live up to true TA either.oh and CORE will always win....

												I'll warn it outright, this game review may have a bias of nearly 20 years of Nostalgia, but I still own my original disks and have for the most part, kept reinstalling up until those disks got scratched badly.Back in 1997, this game blew my 9-year-old mind.  Yes the graphics are lack-luster compared to today, but we were running Windows 98 at the time.  This game is the first game of the Supreme Commander Series that, ironically takes place at the end of the war.The music is astounding, you can just listen to the soundtrack and make a movie around them.  The classical style just makes the scene of hundreds of robots killing each other more epic.Gameplay: It's an RTS.  Both sides are fairly equal, except the ARM units are faster where the CORE has more health...so picking a side really comes to looks.You get the core game and all its expansion packs, which were great expansion packs for the game, from new units to the new campaign.Also, the Aeon Illuminate don't exist, so that's a plus.If you want a fit of nostalgia, get the game....if you want to see what us kids in the 90's played...get this game.

												While it may look dated, and the full Total Annihilation game I remember playing included 8 players and more Kbots (where's my Necro?), Steam's Total Annihilation is still an amazing game.  To this day, when I play any RTS I compare it to Total Annihilation.  Time, graphics, and computers may keep forging ahead, but TA is a classic I can't stop playing.For $3 you just can't go wrong!

												An instant 10/10!Gamers of this generation might or might not understand that THIS game is the CORE of RTS gaming.The mechanics of the gameplay, the storyline, the tiers of the machines and the difference between the factions prove us that no corners were cut back in the day, and creators gave their best.There is no explanation on how great is the feeling of a huge battlefield with constant explosions, shells, lasers, screenshakes and the amazing, AMAZING soundtrack by Jeremy Soul. To understand you just need to PLAY it.This game was my whole childhood, then Supreme Commander appeared and i was disappointed since it lacked the same vibe, and had a lot of unnecessary features. Then, recently Planetary Annihilation came trying to give us that sense of nostalgia, but it still couldn't cut it for me. When i saw this game came on steam, this was an instant buy for me, and now, if we can transfer the whole modding community here on steam, and patch the game some more, it would have limitless potential.What can i say, The games made today are awesome in their own way, really, but the old ones like Total Annihilation, Unreal and UT, AoE, or even Ubisoft's 2000's Infestation (a game that people barely remember existed which is very disappointing)There is something special about them that today's games lack.

												TLDR; This is the game that inspired tons of RTS games as well as people. BUYITRIGHTNOWGOI write this review holding my original copy of Total Annihilation in hand. But I'll just set it down, so I can type better. This game is what many other games have tried to emulate, but have failed in some aspect (looking mainly at YOU, Planetary Annihilation). It really should be able to please just about any RTS fan. Want a quick, in your face battle? You got it. Want a long war of attrition? Done (Play Seven Islands for an epic air/sea/nuke battle royale). The campaign is pretty solid too, from what I remember. The music is what I remembered the most, I think. It was just so epic, and fit the game so perfectly. And, for a game that's pushing 20 years old, it still has a charming look to it, not too far off from some indie games released much later. Sometimes pathing can be a bit annoying, but when your units get stuck, just blast them with your Commander's D-gun, for instant gratification.I think really the only negative thing I can say, is that this version includes all the expansion(s). I felt the base game is awesome without the new units and such. Also, I can't help but notice that the AI had to have been tweaked in some ways. It's much more predictable with the xpacs, and dumbed down. It is nice they included the map editor though, sometimes it feels that the provided maps can get stale. That might also be from playing every map many, many times.Cavedog was a pretty legit developer that just unfortunately got overwhelmed by a small market at that time period. I loved their other release, TA: Kingdoms as well. I've sunk tons and tons of hours into both TA series. And Boneyards (their inhouse online service) was so ahead of its time, as far as matchmaking, community, patch releases, and content updates on the reg, it's a shame nothing else has really come along, at least for me, that made the same impression.Pro Tip(s): You want more than 4 players/AI in a skirmish? After hitting the 'single' button, press * and the corresponding roman numeral to the amount of players you want. Example: *X would bump the limit to 10. Reap benefits and/or get rekt.You want to play any campaign mission, any way? From the main menu, click 'Single' then type, drdeath    All one word, no spaces, lowercase. A bone will appear in the gap on the right menu, that once clicked, a campaign master menu opens up, from which you can select any assortment of mission you'd like.			"

												I was either playing CnC RedAlert or other CnC games or Total Annihilation+ core contingency..... This game IS the RTS that really spoke to me... Cavedog had a website that you could download extra  stuff -  new units and maps and perimeter defenses.... all available at the time via dialup. but if you were patient, you ended up with a game that had sooo much content plus what end users had made.... Mods for this game were available everywere, but my fav place to get mods was TA universe(i dont have a clue if TAU still exists).. i was sad to see cavedog get bought out by atari much like westwood studios gought bought by EAI had no idea what GoG was untill yesterday or the fact that this game was available through them. BUT im glad i found it again and will play the heck out of it.I love the imense battles, the controls in the Hud, the smoldering shrapnel that literally flies across an entire map if a structure is decimated.i would litterally make choke points for my enemies out of destroyed enemy hardware. lolthis game is Item 9, its the Bee's Knees			"

If you are looking for a modern remake check out TA Spring. Glad to see such a classic on steam. Has some of Jeremy Soule's best work as a sound track. Don't know if wargaming actually did anything for this game other than buy rights. Suffers pathfinding issues for units, but still good for a game almost 20 years old.			"

Posted: December 21, 2015
												I'm a pretty crappy writer so I apologize in advance.Total Annihilation is an incredibly unique and intense RTS that was light-years ahead of its time and still is today. I still strongly prefer the original over the more spiritual-successor, Planetary Annihilation.Total Annihilation features so many small features that just make it amazing, the battles can be huge and intense with massive amounts of units having a huge Warhammer 40k esque fight all on one screen, or the games can be slow and brilliantly thought out. This is a strategy game where you can win purely by 'defensive' play at times, something I find to be rather unique among a lot of strategy games that even today have rather narrow methods to win, usually by just having the larger and better offensive force, but not always in Total Annihilation. A feature that makes Total Annihilation so unique is the true emphasis on a defensive playstyle, if you so desire. There are an impressive amount of options for defensive, slow play styles and faster, more offensive playstyles alike. You can choose to hunker down and improve your economy while building a large amount of turrets and upgrading to better ones over the course of the game, some are even capable of bombarding your opponent from the entire maps length, assuming you reach the demanding level of tech and economy required for them. Even tactical nukes can be constructed and launched over a map away if the game length and level of sustainable economy is reached. This allows for a lot of options for a lot of different types of players. There is also no real super demanding macro-memory required à la StarCraft II, making the game just a bit more accessable to newer players, especially in more team oriented game modes.The game also features incredible physics for it's more 2.5 dimensional, isometric strategy experience. One of my favourite things about this game is seeing things like unit inaccuracy, especially when on the move or on unstable ground or even when taking pot-shots at something through the fog-of-war. Units will have better vision when on the high ground and worse vision when in a trench, making a lot of areas on maps incredibly strategic locations. There's even bullet physics, units will often adjust their aim higher or lower depending on the target, and when the steel corpses begin to litter the battlefield they will often block incoming rounds harmlessly while your units continue to trudge past the enemy fire. There's a gritty feeling seeing all your units charge an enemy fortified position only to begin seeing the missiles and rounds begin to rain down upon them and seeing a huge chunk of your force get obliterated by a large round, shaking the screen and sending chunks of steel flying in every direction, the steel ""gibs"" even damaging nearby units who get hit by them.The game also features an amazing orchestral 'dynamic' music score written and composed by the one and only Jeremy Soule. The music really compliments an already fantastic game nicely, changing to a more brooding tone as you build up your base and switching to a more heart-pounding score as enemy fighters engage your army. It's an incredible soundtrack that you may even consider finding for your own music player. The sound design alone in this game is also very unique and give it a great distinct and 'mechanical' feel.If there was one strategy that I think is criminally unknown to most people, this would have to be it. It's made an amazingly tight-knit community that continue to play the original and have a huge modding scene. (Seriously, try the Total Annihilation Escalation mod, it's just insanely good.) Some even going as far as recreating the Total Annihilation experience in full 3D via an open source engine called Spring, try Spring Total Annihilation out sometime, it has a great community still supporting it to this day.Overall it's my favourite RTS game of all time, and I'm not even a huge RTS fan. It's incredibly exciting just to watch with an amazing soundtrack and huge, epic battles.10/10, would D-Gun again.			"

												A game I played extensively back in the day when it was hailed as a classic RTS.With hindsight though, it is a game that lent on its visual's and audio, which, particularly the later, are still very powerful today, along with quantity (i.e tons of unit's, the base game has two 25 mission campaigns etc) to hide a bit of a lack of control and polish.This Steam release is excellent value and would be even for just the base game (£3.99 with a 20% discount, as of writting); you also get both official expansions and the map editor with this release.It's still a good RTS though, just not quite a classic.

												OMG WHERE TO START! The process of how this game goes is mind blowing, so stay with me as long as you can.You start out as the commander.So do your enemies.You're a ROBOT.You need to make a machine that makes robots that can make robots.The machine can make Construction bots which can then make advanced machines based on their purpose.If it's an airport, advanced airport.You'll need energy and metal to keep creating things, without it you build slower and you have a lowered chance to survive.Advanced bots can also build advanced stuff such as nukes and anti missile machines. Soon enough it's your army of robots against all of the other armys of robots.If your mind isn't blown then this should do it: There's so much more in this game then I have described so far.Best freaking game I've ever played. For the age of the game, I can still play it and have more fun then all of the games I have in my library including Binding of Isaac, Payday 2, Garry's Mod, and such more.GET IT IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT, MUST BUY!!

(i got internet access and i lived on starcraft for half a decade)Surprisingly the game runs really well on Win 10, supports some modern resolutions (no 1080p option, but there are some thereabouts) and in my short play time i haven't encountered a single bug.Nostalgia was worth the price alone, great game and can see myself having a skirmish now and then.

												As I'm sure many of nostalgic fans will agree with me, Total Annihilation set the standard for what an RTS should be.It breaks my heart that Cavedog being that hardworking company that it was no longer exists.That being said, their legacy lives on nearly 20 years later with a game so well designed it puts all other RTS games to shame.What makes this game worth playing? Being that the econ in this game is rather unique as compared to others, you don't exhaust resources just at you would in other games.That being said, resource production becomes a layer of immersion being that certain maps would produce more solar energy as opposing to wind energy and vice versa.The units themselves also bring a unique flair to the game by allowing a mulitude of different stratagies to arise from playing the game.This game was without a doubt one the best then and still is now.I could not be happier to see steam finally managed to get ahold of the game and has revived the game for the masses, if you can deal with the game looking dated you'll absoutely enjoy having countless hours of fun to an epic soundtrack. 12/10 You need this game period.

												Don't mistake Steam playing time here:I was 10 when this came out, playing on our old Amstrad Pentium 100MhZ with 1gb HDD. By 1997 we could only really have one game on the PC to play, and Total Annihilation spent alot of time on there. Coming from C&C and AoE TA just blew them out of the water, two lovingly crafted factions, totally unique units and such a wide array of units it had too! You were never locked down into a play style, you had the tools to do whatever you felt necessary. Maps were varied, from closed corridor battles to open ground which often changed from pristine wildernesses to a decimated hell hole throughout the course of the map.The amount of content here is vast, it's an old school campaign, so tons of missions with good scaling difficulty, piles of maps for skirmishing and top mods available. Not to mention a top soundtrack by Jeremy Soule (Elder Scrolls, KOTOR etc).And for the pittance they're asking, this a steal.			"

												One of the best games of my high school years. I have played this game so much, I don't think any other game can compare. The modding community at the time was crazy, tons of new options to add in. You can still find mods to this day. The first one was great but the expansions added so much more to the game. For its time this game was the Farcry of RTS, graphics were amazing, maps were never ending, and battles were not capped to 200 units per player. Game defaults to 1000 units, however patchs are available, or a simple edit of the config file to allow as many as you desire.When cavedog first offered their gaming service to connect players it was all I ever did. I finally had an endless amount of players to play with. It is just sad that the sequal to the game was such a downfall in the game play department. Seems to collopsed their mightly RTS empire.I hope you all enjoy this game as much as I did. Just some helpful hints to play the game, starting with before you actually play It doesn't appear narration is available in the game, sad face. Maybe it is just mine. Secondly change left click to right click in the menus if your used to other RTS. Game sound starts at mono and can be changes to 3D (Stereo). Options accessed only once you select single or multiple player. Options in game can be selected by pressing tab. Game I believe is auto paused on start for all maps. Resolution support works for 1080p but must be selected, most games at this time barely supported 1280x1028.  While playing: Speed can be adjusted during single and multiple player via the + or - buttons.  Multiple buildings can be queued together using shift. Resource sharing is possible with allies at set increments so you never have to constantly send resources. Building units also has an infinite queue. Holding shift increments 5. Left click to add units, right click to remove. Your commander has a gun called the D-Gun hot key is D, this is a huge blast that can one shot everything but a commander and expieremental units not in the original (later expansions). If your commander dies in campaign it is the end of the match, multiplayer depending on settings. Your commander blows up like a big nuke. Planes build the slowest, then Kbots, then vechicles. Forgot hover vechicles, but they are in an expansion as well. Each one has different perks, and should be used together to cordinate strikes. However planes usually over power all else, as they are fast, hard to hit, and cheap to build.			"

												If you have played it before, it is exactly how you remember.If you have not played it before, it's a great game at a great price, but I would recommend you look at the Supreme Commander series. It is, in a way, the spiritual successor to Total Annihilation. It kept everything good about Total Annihilation and improved it.			"

												Okay, about this game.Total Annihilation was my childhood and it was amazing to play this with other RTS game like Age of Empire and some else.Most of you who doesn't even know what Total Annihilation is or never heard of it, let's just say something like this:Before Planetaty Annihilation, there was Supreme Commanders and before Supreme Commanders, there was Total Annihilation.This game was the main core for those two other games, one of them is the spiritual successor and other just disappointment and this is my own opinion on the other one.Supreme commanders, followed the almost every steps of the Total Annihilation and it is well done game and they made little bit their own adjustments on the game.Planetary Annihilation was suppose to be ""sequel"" to the Total Annihilation with some it original developers and original narrator, but it was disappointment.Yes we did end up using planets on other planets as they promised with the title, but when it was fully released and lowered from that ridiculous pricing from EA stage, there was still lots of problem that wasn't fixed and top of that cake, they decided release the ""expansion"" of it as full game to it, why do that, they just betrayed their loyal supporters and fans by doing that, you could've just made it as free for those who already own the damn game.But enough with that one and back to main topic of this review.Total Annihilation like I said is my childhood and seeing it released on steam now made my day and I cannot see any problem with the game but that it is kinda hard to control it, but it was because I haven't played over 16 years and couldn't find the copy of it.It just this game still has it and it brings back good memories of it.This is just perfect for those who were seeking this game for long time and for those who are curious about the origin of the supreme commander or planetary annihilation.

												One of the best RTS ever made. The scale of those battles was so much bigger than anything else at that time, I had a hard time playing any other RTS for years after TA.The classical music, played by 96-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra, was also perfectly fitting for that kind of game, really good quality by Jeremy Soule, composer of Icewind Dale, Baldur's gate, Oblivion, Skyrim music and many more. Music switched depending on what you were doing, which was also uncommon at that time (with ""battle themes"" and ""quiet themes"" for construction phases, something we didn't see in every game at that time).Unit animation was also awesome for that time, with all those small robots animated everywhere. Seeing a group of robots run in one direction but with their torsos turned in another to shoot at an enemy is fun to see.The game universe is great, very varied, lots of different map styles and landscapes. Game depth can be quite deep. There is A LOT of units (hundreds in base game, and hundreds in each DLC), and quite a lot of them are useful. Also has an incredible mix of units, from ""pure"" land tanks, or bombers, to planes that can ""land"" underwater, amphibious tanks, hovercraft units. Same for resources, a lot of different ways to get any of each of them, for power for example, you can go solar, nuclear, hydro plants, wind plants, etc.Also, low price, all extensions (DLC) included, much better than all those 20 years old base games with terrible port sold for over $10.

												This game feels like it was lifted straight from 1997.  There are no Steam extras except to play the game at higher resolutions.  Still functions and plays exactly like it used to.  Works great with Windows 10. They're still problems with this title though, pathfinding is horrible, sounds cut out when you have too many units fighting on the screen.  Enemy AI isn't the greatest.  There are many mods out for this title though that would fix a majority of these problems.Multiplayer is non existant, with many of the links in the multiplayer section of the game taking you to now defunct sites.  There are still workarounds though.For the price I would recommend this game.			"

If you like in depth RTS games with robots and explosions, or if you've played Supreme Commander and liked it, this game is a definite 'must-have'!It runs great on my modern machine (windows 7) which is quite unique for such an old game.The game comes with all it's expansions ever released and has a very good price.Oh, and the music... Jeremy Soule created the score for this game and it's an absolute masterpiece!In conclusion:Great old school RTS, buy it if you like SupCom or classic futuristic robot RTS games!			"

												Imagine over 1 gb of data files back then.... This game was/ is legendary. I cant tell you how many times I destroyed the family computer from all the mods I used on this... thousands of mods from not the greatest sources. All the south park characters(which Im pretty sure was one of the unit downloads that tanked the computer the first time), the burrowing nukes, all the mech warriors, all the star wars ships, 50+ units in the krogoth gantry, the 10k unit patch, unlimited energy/metal, and the 1000's of hours of enjoyment I got out of this game throughout my childhood. The new supreme commanders are good in their own way, but theres nothing like having to bring the grenade robots(mod) along... just to clear a path through all the dead robots that you just slaughtered.Im really looking forward to the community items coming out for this game, and maybe ill even make some myself. Im hoping core contingency/battle tactics is included with this, or becomes available soon. I highly doubt they will allow you to upload the serial keys from the originals (if they even had them back then).PS: just picked up enemy commander with transport plane and let them shoot the plane down;)over 9000/10			"

												Do you know any games from 1997 that can be played at 4k resolution, without mod/plugins? TA can, and to me, this embodies what TA was. It was a game of limitless expansion, only inhibited by the power of the PC. That was the world of gaming Chris Taylor wanted  to create.I spent so many hundreds of hours on this from a kid to teenager, we were poor and had a bad computer so this was the only game that worked, and I was fine with that. The gameplay is still as good as it's ever been and once you pump up the resolution, even the graphics have aged surprisingly well.No game has captivated me like this one has. From modding, to playing with friends, to learning more about gaming in general, this embodied my whole childhood and I'm more than happy to shell out a few bucks to play it again.			"

												The predecessor to Supreme Commander.  This is one of those few games that is still playable today, it has a big variety of units from land, sea, and air to choose from and can change the outcome of the game.  The units are 3D modeled on a 2D interface, and there are units that the TA community have built that can be inserted into the game to increase the types of units and structures that you can build.  A person/persons put together a mod that can be used with TA that makes changes to the games interface and includes new units and defense structures to make the game more interesting.   There are those people that will complain about the graphics, but the graphics are still fine, you can tell what the units are supposed to be and there is still detail on the units themselves, it's not like they are just flat Atari tanks and planes moving around.  I own many RTS games, this is still one of the best ones out there that has good balance and a slew of things to make, not to mention the patrol system is still ahead of many modern games.  One of the cool things of today is that this game can be played using huge maps and 1000+ units/buildings and still run great due to todays processors.  If you enjoy huge battles that will force you to make various things to win, then this is a game for you, but if you like your star craft and like to build few things and rely on specific units, then you best stick to your star craft type games.

												Old but gold. This is THE grandaddy of Starcraft, Warcraft, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, Age of Empires. You name a popular RTS these days and this is the game that made the formula. This isn't nostalgia talking. Sure I may've logged 1000+ hours playing against my dad (and getting my♥♥♥♥♥ruthlessy handed to me until I got good and showed my Old Man who's boss) but I'm not joking when I say that this game singelhandedly wrote the bible on an RTS game. This is also an excellent port of the game. It supports a ton more resolutions than the original did and modding is easy. I haven't encountered many bugs (though I haven't even played an hour yet because I haven't made time to sit down and play a skirmish or two yet) so far and everything works oh so smoothly. This game could run on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toaster with a screen duct-taped on it (It's probably the duct-tape. That stuff's magic).This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and still is. The only problem I can see is that the graphics are horribly outdated. That's really it. If you love RTS games than you NEED to have this game.			"

												I can state with confidence that this is one of THE Best damn gems EVER made, and that Cavedog Entertainment didn't deserve to die, seriously... T_T  Total Annihilation holds a VERY dear place in my heart ever since my childhood and as such I highly/EXTREMELY recommend it for those who love worthy Strategy games like myself, especially with its beautiful ost (original sound track).  It gets even BETTER when you add TAUCP ( http://taucp.tauniverse.com/taucp.htm ) or UTASP ( http://mad-ta.tauniverse.com/utasp_about.php ) unit packs in the mix (Dat Orcone/Agamemnon goodness...! ^-^ ), since when my CD disc holder still worked (problem is is that it refuses to open, no matter how many times I press the eject button, so stubborn... DX ) I still remember those badass days long ago, even now...  Ahh...  The good old days... <3 Hell, I still even have the original two TA discs just to prove how much I love TA, if only the damn CD disc eject button worked...! >_<   Definitely giving this a 50000/10, that's how badass this is, period.Pros:  Oh, I don't know...  EVERYTHING!?!?  Especially with the aforementioned TAUCP or UTASP unit packs, I cannot overstate this enough and words alone utterly fail...  FAIL to get this point across, you'll literally have to see it for yourself to believe it...!Cons:   Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me...?   Long story short.   Buy. This. RIGHT. Now!Also, I had the unfortunate luck to not delve into the TA Expansion packs so this will be the first time I get into those, beyond excited...! <3  All that's left now is to get KKnD onto Steam somehow, then I can rest more easily. ^^			"

												The defintive overhead RTS strategy game. This game one ups Command and Conquers small battles. The game is does not have any actors or cutscenes, but it has a brilliantly narrated story. The multiplayer games can take hours sometimes, and are alot of fun. The only drawback now for the game is finding someone to play with, and making sure that each player has the same version of the still everchanging game. TAUniverse and D-Gun are good for finding files, strats, and maps.			"

												It came out in 1997, after the very first Comand and Conquer game.  During the golden age of RTS games,   These graphics blew my mind back then.  The graphics may be dated but the music and game play are solid and have stood the test of time.  I love this game, Supreme Commander and Forged Alliance are the updated version of this master piece.  Can't until the map packs come, and hoepfully we can do some multiplayer.  I would love to see a 1080p version of this.  Supreme Commander 2 is my best friend.  The music is epic! For under 5 bucks just get it!			"

												This is one of the Greatest games ever made!It is old though, and there have been many small things added to modern RTSs that feel like a must now!  So I highly reccomend getting all the comunity patches and mods. TAUniverse will make this game feel sooooo much better. But this game is wonderful regardless.I highly reccomend it!			"

												Quite possibly the greatest RTS of all time. Must play. What most impresses me about the game is how well balanced it is, between air, infantry, vehicles and water. It's also one of the only RTS games I've played where defense has a decent enough boost early on to incentivize defending and researching over the standard RTS blitzkrieg. Blitzkrieg RTS has got me to drop so many other RTS games.			"

												A rather simplistic game, and you can tell that it's from the early 2000's. On that note, it has a charm to it, not unlike the original Starcraft, though it uses a more top-down perspective as opposed to SC's isometric camera view. There's plenty of content in single player, I've heard that multiplayer is still kicking, and overall there's much to enjoy here if you enjoy RTS's. "

Great game back then!I was very thrilled when i saw TA in the steam store! Hoping they did it right and now screw it up like with heroes III.Without thinking i bought this game , as i played it when i was younger LOADS of hours.This game is the setter for the Supcom fancise etc, it was the first RTS game with real 3D graphics, and ooooowh god there sooo ugly anno 2016.But anyways , If you ever played TA and liked it alot you should buy it agian. This steam version is a stable build, i am using OS windows 10 and had no issue's to deal with.If you are not fammiliar with this game but you like retro rts games or like the subcom franchise and want to know where it came from BUY IT. For new players it can be a sort of stuggle to get into the game since there is no totorial, i advice to just play the campaign on easy first, you will have enough time to understand the mechanics and units. Try to play the campaign on normal or hard to get a real challenge, the NPC will spam alot more units to destroy and the battlefield will result in a massive clusterf**k wich is nice... Good luck comrades!			"

												Brilliant game to play and survived the aging process really well when compared to many current-gen RTS games. In my opinion the spiritual successors Supreme command/Forged Alliance are the only games that perhaps can get close to this game.However with the nostalgia value and and the possiblities that were already available when this game was released in the 1990-1999 period, i still prefer this game over the successors created later on.If this game would be properly updated to the current generation (improved path-finding, group-mapping and the optionally graphichs), i think it will be able to compete the current top RTS games available.10/10 - Will turtle play the game to get massive army consisting of several types of units before attacking the opponent.

It is so satisfying to destroy everything that gets hurled your way by the enemy in a back and forth battle of Tug of War ! Please get this Relic if you are a fan of the RTS Genre, download now with the mods and multiplayer support....You will never regret it I promise you. If you are the type of person that cares alot about graphics then i can't help you there unless you want Balanced Annihilation on the spring engine that has more refined 3d graphics and plays somewhat different. Anyway it is a very in depth game to this day and is not that hard to learn. You will be constantly be getting better at this game. If you got problem with modding don't worry about it. Just go in the steam discussions and the forums on TA universe, they will help. I hope you found this review helpful cause this is my favorite game of all time and it stil holds that title to this day.

IntroductionOne of the seminal 3D games of the RTS genre, this game was far ahead of its time when released. Total Annihilation still remains peerless in how well rounded it is, from both sequels and rivals.MechanicsThe simplicity of the mechanics is the game's strongest point. All aspects of the game are easy to understand and intuitive. From a clean UI, to satisfying movement and speed of vehicles, the game just feels right. Once you've completed the campaign, skirmishes will entertain for a long time.GraphicsThe visuals still hold up, with solidly modeled machines, angling to accommodate the contours of the landscape - an original feature at release, it still looks convincing to this day. A very complete selection of environment types to choose from, offering varied experiences.SoundThe music of the game is excellent. Sometimes pensively tense, at other times sorrowful, and occasionally stirring with strident pride - but always memorable.ConclusionPerhaps one of the most wholesome RTS games of all time, and certainly one of the most technologically innovative of its time. Own a piece of PC gaming history.			"

												This is a great game, very easy to learn and with enough unit choices that it allows a number of playing styles.  As an example, I tend to play with multiple static long range artillery bases, using anti-air defence to protect the assets and scout aircraft to look for things to crush.  However, if you like tanks (you do right?) then you can build a sexy amount of them and ram them down the enemies throat.  You'll loose more units, but it's way more satisfying than building fire bases.You only have 2 resources (metal and enery), so thats easy to master.  There are land, sea, sub-sea and air units, as well as structures that provide various functions.  There is now a huge range of maps, and if you play one of the metal ones that eliminates a common early problem of lack of metal for construction.The only down side I would raise is there are only 2 sides (core and arm).  However, you get use your commander to stride across a wide variety of map types and blast the crap out of stuff.  Come on, what more reson do you need to click purchase?			"

												This game is just, I can't even put into words, it is my childhood, it is my lifeblood, the glitches are still there which you could debate is bad but to me it's just more nostalgia. If you don't like RTS or can't play on older graphics then maybe this game is not for you but for it's price I highly suggest you give it a try, I'd love to rant and rant about all the amazing things this game does but it's just better to experience it for yourself. The only complaint i have to say about it (this being a totally biased review and all for the sake of nostalgia (but it's as good as i remember it when playing)) is that steam overlay does not work and I really hope they implement it back in69/69 would buy again and keep yelling at friends to buy it.

												If you are not sold on the orchestra and narrator, o god.. When i saw this 18 year old game come up on steam, im like. hey.. i still have the cd's in my desk. So i bought the game... again?Man, i can't tell you how many thousands of hours i threw into this game while growing up, And the thousands more i have with the mods i downloaded.Im running on a win10, i booted up the game and it worked flawlessly. had to google some things i forgot like adding -d for windows as a launch parameter, and setting the game's resolution in the main menu before starting the game. But after i got past the small things i jumped right into the game and started playing, killing some bots quickly and then moving on to some mods. 2 mods to look at are zero, and escalation.But without mods the game is considered a mass RTS. You start out with just your commander and you gather some metal deposits in the world, generate energy, and create some buildings for defenses, and factorys to produce your units. In a game like this, you want to be using up 100% of your produced resourses 24/7, pumping out as many units as you possibly can. If you go over, you run your storage dry and production gets slower. If you dont use 100% you end up wasting excess when your storage is full. Default maps are very bland for me, i usually just to randomly pick one and go with it. And if you play against the AI, even on the hardest difficulty you are going to destroy them easily in a 1v1, once you know the base of the game.			"

												This game is just, I can't even put into words, it is my childhood, it is my lifeblood, the glitches are still there which you could debate is bad but to me it's just more nostalgia. If you don't like RTS or can't play on older graphics then maybe this game is not for you but for it's price I highly suggest you give it a try, I'd love to rant and rant about all the amazing things this game does but it's just better to experience it for yourself. The only complaint i have to say about it (this being a totally biased review and all for the sake of nostalgia (but it's as good as i remember it when playing)) is that steam overlay does not work and I really hope they implement it back in69/69 would buy again and keep yelling at friends to buy it.

												If you are not sold on the orchestra and narrator, o god.. When i saw this 18 year old game come up on steam, im like. hey.. i still have the cd's in my desk. So i bought the game... again?Man, i can't tell you how many thousands of hours i threw into this game while growing up, And the thousands more i have with the mods i downloaded.Im running on a win10, i booted up the game and it worked flawlessly. had to google some things i forgot like adding -d for windows as a launch parameter, and setting the game's resolution in the main menu before starting the game. But after i got past the small things i jumped right into the game and started playing, killing some bots quickly and then moving on to some mods. 2 mods to look at are zero, and escalation.But without mods the game is considered a mass RTS. You start out with just your commander and you gather some metal deposits in the world, generate energy, and create some buildings for defenses, and factorys to produce your units. In a game like this, you want to be using up 100% of your produced resourses 24/7, pumping out as many units as you possibly can. If you go over, you run your storage dry and production gets slower. If you dont use 100% you end up wasting excess when your storage is full. Default maps are very bland for me, i usually just to randomly pick one and go with it. And if you play against the AI, even on the hardest difficulty you are going to destroy them easily in a 1v1, once you know the base of the game.			"

												This Game is an old Real time Stragegy game. The grapics are maybe a bit out dated but the gameplay is still for this time one of the best RTS game. The campaign is a good way to learn the units for each camp step by step because you have limits there. (for example only Tech level 1 Robots)  Like it's sequel Planetry Annihilation It's all bout getting  steady income of metal and energy and build units to destroy the opponent(s). It's easy to learn, hard to master, and you can adjust the difficult level of the AI in Skirmish mode to your liking. (also increase or decrease their base value of metal and energy)I played this game for years and I probaly will keep playing it for many more.			"

												I'm using a Win 10 pro amd 7850k with 8 gig 2133 ram with R9 380 4 gig  cyst driver I can say the game working fine for me so far in my test got play 1920x 1080 though really looks outdated days at that res.  I suggest a lower res and remember it was a game build around 1997 single core 200 mhz 8 16 32MB   1,2,4,8 MB shared memory video was more common place.AI for it day was good given the limits of tech. But by todays by standard to be like, do they know what a AI path finder is.  But can say that by standards there not really like it in the game world I have found that was so fun to play for years.  Next to Surpreme Commander 1 only upped the scale and mayham SC2 I cann't even call it a RTS.If you like griddy older games that was great for it day.  I can suggest this one for a title add your library. Also go folder and go to  ""TotalA.exe"" left click and pick ""Run As Admin"".This may help some that may want to run it.  Mine failed to start in steam till I did that.P.S. This TA total package.  Both expansions are included. First time RTS player or that have problems with speed of games.  It will let you set speed of the game so your not so rushed like many RTS's game today.  I know I cann't play alot of RTS do fact I cann't adapt to speed some of them want you to run at.  Right down to a crawl if you like.			"

												Warning: The review below is biased with nostogliaI remember watching a review of Total Annihiliation from one of those 90's ""tech"" shows on cable in my early teens.  I recall being immediately blown away by how fluid and realistic the action was.  I remember the presenter showed an ingame clip of the action depicting a dozen of infantry bots marching haphazardly through a plain with some trees scattered about.  Meanwhile ovehead, three fighters intercepts an incoming enemy bomber.  The fighters fired a salvo of missiles, and barrel rolls away from the explosion of a downed bomber.  EPIC.I brought this game more than 20 years ago.  I've recreated that scene on numerous occasions and then some.  I felt the combination of variety in unit behavior, weapon physic, and the rock/paper/scissor approach to balancing was the epitomy of what real time strategy games are.  Twenty years later, I believe this is still the core defintion that only one other RTS IP was able to achieve, and that's Homeworld.There's Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihiliation, but those are essentially spiritual successors.  Even then, it's still missing something that makes Total Annihilation unique.Plus you have these things Carpet bombingAircraft carriersA wall of artillaries shooting  Flak gunsEPIC SOUNDTRACKI would buy this again many times over if steam goes away.

Total Annihilation reigns solo as the best strategy game ever made.For the enthusiasts, I recommend Total Annihilation: Mayhem, a brilliant, community-made mod. If there's anybody out there who needs help setting up, installing mods, or playing the game, please add me and I will help in every way I can. Total Annihilation is worth playing.			"

												This game is something Unique. Munitions fly in the air in 3D, where ground elevations matter and a long range plasma cannon could hit a scout drone flying in the air. The game has both very short very long learning curves, and you can be effective right from the start and get better for years.I highly recommend the 5v5 multiplayer that is still going on every day, with 1000 units each player, massive battles but also very small and tactical ones.Well worth a try.

												This is a good RTS game. The main problem with it is that the tactics are flawed because the enemy has line of sight over all your assets, but your visibility of them is obscured by the fog of war. This makes some levels difficult, but not for tactical reasons. This is frustrating. Enemies should not have infinite line of sight, that's unreasonable. Total annihilation is hard for all the wrong reasons, also units are difficult to control, they do their own thing a lot. Steam please sell Dark Reign, it's the best RTS game OF ALL TIME and does not have all the weakesses of Starcraft or TA.			"

It is still just as amazing today as it was back then.Pros:-Some of the most innovative, diverse and dynamic RTS gaming mechanics of its time, filled to the brim with all kinds of units, and many different routes to victory. The level of detail and thought put into the hundreds of buildings and units on both sides means that you must anticipate your opponents strategies.-Some of the best video game music produced by Jeremy Soule-Visuals were amazing for their time and have aged incredibly well, and still immerse you into the world of TA to this day.-Build freaking huge tank armies, navies, aircraft, Turrets, nukes, or tank-turret-nuke nightmares (you know what i speak of), and prepare for the most epic and chaotic battles of any RTS games.-The game is freaking epic on every level especially with how it plays out.

												December 25th, 1997, My uncle was visiting from Chicago.  He brought with him two presents for me. As I ripped the wrapping paper off the boxes like a savage, two gleaming jewel cases shone before me. Like diamonds twinkling foreward from the dirt.  My first video games, Earth Siege 2 and Total Annihilation. Total Annihilation is the game that set me forward on a life of being a gamer. I have never stopped loving this game. I still have my original CD. I bought a copy from good ol' games. I bought it again on steam when I saw it was available. Every modern RTS that I have played, I judge against this game. The graphics still look amazing, even after all this time. fantastic amounts of units and differing storylines in the campaign.I truly cannot express how much I love this game.			"

												Easily one of the best RTS games of all time while also being the predecessor to Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation. Hoping to see this game worked on the same way Age of Empires II HD is being developed by eliminating bugs, Steam Workshop integration, improving multiplayer stability and implementing a lobby system.Gameplay Features:  + Many unit types - Bots, Vehicles, Airplanes, Ships, Subs and Hovercrafts.  + Numerous tilesets with some offering unique experiences such as Water, Acid and Metal worlds.  + Maps have their own gravity, wind and tidal strength affecting certain resource generating structures and weapons.  + Resources are infinite with several ways to generate them, they're only limited by your economy. This version:  + Includes Core Contingency, Battle Tactics and v3.1, the last official patch.  + Runs well on newer OS  + Includes the map editor  + Heavily and easily moddable just like every other version.  - Game seems to crash when trying to load a saved game.  - Multiplayer wasn't updatedAlthough not the same game, I have precious memories of playing TA on the Spring Engine and having large-scale battles. I hope I'm able to do the same through this game one day.			"

												An old time classic that still holds up pretty well. With the exception of UI flaws this game is actually able to stand the test of time. Which is quite rare for a RTS game. It'll run on Windows 10 too but some things need to be installed first.So what can you expect? It's an RTS with infinitive resources that needs to be balanced. Metal and Energy. While you have a stock amount of metal and Energy this will quickly go away if you can't keep up with the demand and when it hits bottom things will take far longer to build.The two sides have similar units on Tier 1 but on Tier 2 they vary a bit. But most units can be useful later on. Arm are the best looking though. Just a fact.With mods installed you can build up to 1000 per player but that generally just crashes the game so keep to 500 per player. The AI can't really handle this amount either as they'll do stupid things like building 100 Metal extractors instead of Moho Mines on a metal planet.You'll also get conga lines of enemies towards your base and these lines can be pretty long and pretty big. For instance with 1000 units on that line is just one long line from the enemy base to my base. Or rather to the range of my turrets.There are plenty of unit mods for this game and you'll be needing some programs in order to use them all. But there is still a limit on how many you can have.If you decide to play online you can limit how many units the AI can build of certain things and this can be used to stop them from building a ton of useless structures. Could be a way to make it more of a challenge too.			"

												Unless nostalgia rules your life, I'd have to say pass on this game (unless it's on sale or free). It's not that it's a bad game per se; rather, it hasn't held up over time.The main things about Total Annihilation (specifically, the Steam version) that make me not want to recommend the game are listed below:  • The available screen size is very limited compared to modern successors. It makes finding enemy units firing from far off screen very difficult, and base management as well.  • The command interface is split across several pages, and is non-intuitive compared to modern games but also compared to some of its contemporaries (Age of Empires, Warcraft 2, Command & Conquer: Red Alert, etc.)  • The unit movement and structure placement is very finicky -- once again, this is based upon my comparisons to modern RTS games of its kind, but watching a robot spend several (5+) seconds walking into a wall isn't as entertaining as you might think.  • Also, I felt that several of the campaign missions are very unbalanced, but your opinion may differ on this point.Therefore, it was a good game during its heyday when it was fresh and introduced new and novel features to RTS games, but I can't recommend it now.(P.S. If you find this review unhelpful, please comment with what information can be provided to make the review more helpful to you. Thanks!)			"

You have to do it all yourself and spend much effort to organize.For what reason do I need steam then, if they don't spend much effort to makethis game well playable?Why no server-rooms and autoconnect?

												In the game's current state, I can not recommend this game. I tried a multiplayer session with a friend and we could not join each other's game, regardless of who hosted. I was hoping the game code would have been revamped to work on modern operating systems, but that seems to not be the case. It's dependent on DirectPlay, an API that has been deprecated by Microsoft since the early 2000's.edit:At the time we attempted to play this game, my friend and I were on the same local area network (192.168.1.2 to 192.168.1.11). At one point, I did alt+tab out of the game, and added an exception, when prompted, to the Windows Firewall to allow this game to communicate. We were able to see each other's game on the list of games, but when either of us attempted to join the other's hosted game, the interface would lock up and hang indefinitely.My review of not recommending this game is solely based on the game's current state. The networking code is obviously dated and doesn't ""work out of the box,"" requiring tweaking and/or third-party extensions to make it work. This is not what I had in mind when I paid $5 for the Steam version of this game.As far as the game itself, my friend and I had a lot of fun playing this game a decade ago when it worked. So if the game did ""work out of the box,"" I would give this game a thumbs up.			"

												Loved TA back in the day and was very happy to see it land on Steam. It is one of my all time favorites.The only downside is that there is a glitch when running the game from Steam for the first time. For me it was an easy fix (as described below).If you're ok with doing a one-time workaround, then definitely go purchase this game. Otherwise, I’d wait a little while. The game was recently released and I’m sure it will be fixed fairly soon.So here’s the problem and my fix. Keep in mind that this worked for me and may not work for everyone!Problem: When launching TA for the first time through Steam, I kept getting “Error: Environment initialization failed! Check your DirectX”The Fix:Launched the game directly by running TotalA.exe. This is found in the installation folder:C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Total AnnihilationAfterwards, you should be able to start TA from Steam everytime.If the above does not work, then take a look at Peepswood's post describing how to use these patches:http://steamcommunity.com/app/298030/discussions/0/487877107150113391/If this issue is officialy resolved, then I will change my review to a thumbs up			"

												Doesn't always work on windows 10 pcs. It wanted to use direct play which wouldn't install.. after some searching I had to disable Avast for the install to go through. Did that and is now giving a new error. After more searching I found that I need to install some 3rd party unofficial patches etc. Downloaded and installed those. Still not working, is it just me or does this seem like a bit of work for a steam release? If you let companies release old games, atleast make sure they are compatible and patched for new hardware. Only pro so far is it was cheap, so I will try to research more later to get it working, I cannot however recommend it in its current state. (I had to let time elapse on the crash screen just to get the 5 minutes req. to write this review)(Edit: I guess the Windows 10 thing is hit or miss. For me its a miss so far)			"

												Initially I thought this was a great game until I discovered one particular bu****** mechanic. Since WHEN does a building count as a unit? In pretty much every RTS ever made, a unit is MOBILE, a character or vehicle with combat, constructive, or special abilities. Buildings are STATIONARY. They typically do nothing to defend your base and are used for production purposes. So, let's say you're expanding your base, fighting tooth and claw for metal, building solar complexes and also building DEFENSES to PROTECT what you've had to fight hard for. Laser towers on resource spots, production buildings abroad so you can deploy forces from key locations. Well guess what? This whole time you've been expanding your base, you have been taking space from your COMBAT UNITS. There is a UNIT CAP. So now, if you do have an expanded base, there's a good chance the enemy has a larger fighting force than you and regardless of whether you attack or wait to be attacked, you'll take heavy casualties and the enemy will sense this and just overwhelm you with a larger army. Oh and the game DOESN'T tell you how close you're getting to the unit cap. So you basically have to finely tune the production of everything or else you might waste an hour and a half because your fighting units are crippled by the unit cap. This is the issue I've found in campaign and it's kind of horse s***.In closing, why does a game called TOTAL ANNIHILATION, which is about the mass production of combat robots between two factions who have been hating each other for 400 years have this cap? It's like putting a diaper on a grizzly bear. Wherever we look, sentient robots are a HUGE problem. Terminator: the whole damn planet has been overrun with machines. Mass Effect: THE WHOLE F****** UNIVERSE is about to be destroyed by machines. Robots bring two things when they attack, firepower and numbers. In a game like Age of Empires it makes sense. Want to train more troops and villagers? You need more houses/castles for your people to shelter in. Robots don't give a f*** about rest and typically don't care about how much space is left on the planet, they just want to kill stuff!			"

Wide variety of tactics and million combinations of different armies you can build and achieve victory. For a nearly 20 years old game, this one is pretty damn good quality graphicwise even today.... sound and music wise too and not to mention game mechanics.10/10 for a nearly 20 year old, amazing game that runs even on windows 10 without any issues.

												Certainly not a perfect version. It still has issues of disappearing status bar at the bottom of the screen if you actually run AT your resolution (1920x1080 for example), you gotta run at something like 1680x900 in order to actually see the entire UI on screen, which is ridiculous.And it really is a must, because you NEED that status bar to see build rates, energy and metal rates, etc for selected or hovered-over items and factories.The great thing however is that this IS the best working version so far. You dont have to edit .ini files or use third party apps to get it running properly in fullscreen without glitches, apart from the above mentioned. For that alone it is worth a rebuy (because we cant really blame the original devs for not considering Windows 8 / 10 compatability, now can we?) :)That said, I highly recommend people to immediately get some of the convenience mods / balance patches out there.In some ways they are almost required to enjoy the game in a modern RTS mindset.Such as being able to select groups with just pressing 1, instead of pressing Alt+1 which was ridiculous at that time, and is still highly user-unfriendly today.Or being able to hold and drag buildings when holding shift. Makes building walls feasible, which it wasnt in vanilla TA placing one at a time, click click click click.A great masterpiece of a game that DOES show its age due to some weird control schemes they opted for in the old days.But with mods to modernize and ""logicalize"" the controls, it still holds up today, despite the awful pathfinding.The pure atmosphere and ""feel"" of the game is still un-rivaled. No other RTS ""feels"" like TA.Perhaps it is the music, perhaps it is the graphics, perhaps it is the clunky slow controls.No matter what it is, it is greater than the sum of its part. A robbery at this price, must-buy.			"

												I haven't seen this game in years! Just reading about it brough so much nostalgia - I still have 2 CDs for the game, with the booklet on story and individual units in my home country somewhere. I played it when I was little, when I couldn't understand a word in English XDOne disk was for Single and the other for Multi player after installation, I believe.The game itself was brilliant, so versatile and with so many options and units, advanced extraction facilities and units - and that was just the original version - never had the expansions before.Unique system of having one special unit called Commander, who you used to build basic structures and then had to protect him from destruction, or you would loose. You can capture buildings and enemies with him, and if you did it correctly, you could then start building units and buildings of the opposite fracion! Not that it would matter much though, as both fractions have almost idenical units for most part (varied just look and attack type), even the same number of them varies just by 2-4 objects less or more on each side ovarall.Going in Skirmish mode against AI was a bit pointless though - Difficulty gave the AI upper hand, instead of making it smarter. The enemy almost never used advanced weaponry, or buildings. I hope this will be different with this version.Despite its little flaws above, it could still be called indescribably brilliant game - at the time of its relevance, and even in this day. Give me Total Annihilation over some of those new fancy RTSs any time.			"

												VERY good game! But do not buy it for the multiplayer. The game still uses the old IP connection and NOT steam multiplayer. You cannot join via steam, only direct connection. This game is one of the best RTS's out there even today, I strongly advise downloading the mods. The ""unit"" development has been relentless up to present day and the mods expand the tech trees to a whole new level. Also check out the new maps that can be downloaded, some are very well made! This is the kind of RTS that requires speed of base building and automation of unit production. Mass production is the name of the game. Use ""shift"" click to add 5 to building que.Can not recommend the game more!			"

												Almost 20 years ago is when I first played this game. 20 years... it was awesome then, it is awesome still.Game has infinite replayability, skirmishes and missions. Wide variety of tactics and million combinations of different armies you can build and achieve victory. For a nearly 20 years old game, this one is pretty damn good quality graphicwise even today.... sound and music wise too and not to mention game mechanics.10/10 for a nearly 20 year old, amazing game that runs even on windows 10 without any issues.

												Oh... good old memory. It was one of the best strategy games I've played during the late 90s. Better than Starcraft. The AI are simple. They build things randomly. Then they attack when they have certain # of units then retreat when fall below. But just because of this randomness, it doesnt make you feel predictable. The AI dont always do the same thing over and over again.			"

												I was shocked to see this game on steam as I was just browsing the store. As a child I'd spent many hours playing this. At first I was a bit worried this game would not run on windows 10  but because its so low in price I thought I would risk it, There are some negative reviews saying it does not work but for me it runs perfectly. The game will start in 640x480 resolution, you can change this in the options. I was also worried it would not play in 1920x1080 but it does. It will not change resolution once you change the setting but it does change once you start a battle.			"

												Very fun!Great Soundtrack!Love the story!Overall, best game ever!As the son of one of the founders of the Freedom Fighters Alliance on HEAT, I was quickly introduced to Total Annihilation at a very young age, and quickly fell in love with it! When I got a new computer, and lost Total Annihilation, and I never got to play it ever again, UNTIL NOW!I love this game, and I Totally Annihilate everyone! (Get it? hehe)The soundtrack is if not, one of the greatest soundtracks ever! Composed by Jeremy Soule, the soundtrack has that suspencful classic theme to it whenever you are in combat, which just makes the gameplay experience so much better!I also thought the story and lore of Total Annihilation was really cool, so I will give you a brief summary (Spoilers probably)In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core, and their triumphs has set to colonize the milky way galaxy and set them in a long lasting time of prosperity.All has changed when a technological breakthrough called ""Patterning"", which transfers human consciousness into mechanical bodies, which makes them live indefinately. The Core makes this a public health measure and made it manditory to Pattern all human life forms. A rebellious group called the Arm protested and fought the Core because of this decision, resulting in a 4000 year war. The Arm and the Core fought so viciously, which lead to the extinction of the human race, but the robotic armies of the two still manage to fight and keep the war going. Now it is up to you to decide who wins...Overall, I really recommend this game! "

Nuking the hell out of the enemy. Also i has some new updates well to me anyways. You can now have a hover army which is pretty cool. New defenses which are hella good. Even the reactors can be clocked so the enemy wont go for it. EMP is op as hell. Targeting system buliding which you can see the diffrence wither you have it or not. I would recommend it to all that have not played this. I love this gamew.			"

												Just by it's name, will strike fear in any one that plays this game. To be a commander that controles hundreds of units, weather that be land, sea, air, or a combination of all. There is K-bots, tanks, bombers, fighters, frigets, destoryers, submarines, battleships, lazer turrets, Big cannons, and Of course nuke launchers. That is just a fraction of stuff you can build, and incounter. You get one of two factions to choose from. The Core and the Arm. Both teams have there pros and cons which makes for diffrent tactics to be used for both factions. The battles get intense with a wonderful orcestrated soundtrack to go with it. The campain is a great way to learn the lore behind the machines. This game supports single player campain, single player skirmesh, and multiplayer skirmesh. You get a nice veriety of maps to play on and AI support up to nine which is nice but very cayotic and sometimes hard to play on smaller maps.(Because every one D-Guns each others face at start). The core game is grate and considering this steam reliese comes with both Core Contingency, and Battle Tactics expantions makes me prund to still love and praise TA as the best RTS from the past. Long live the ARM!!RIP CaveDog Entertainment			"

It plays simular to the Supreme commander series (it was its predicessor after all) where you start with a commander unit that builds your base. The campaign lets you planethop by capturing planetary gates as each planet surface had 5 missions. Skirmish is available to allong with over 40 maps to choose from.The steam version works on windows 7,8 and 10, and has all expansion packs. No cd required anymore to play and you can finaly use the largest maps at full speed on your modern PC's.			"

												This game is as good as it was back in the 90's! Hands down best RTS game ever with the most epic OST (which is dynamic and changes according to battle situation, nice)! I got this once more, since my old CD version 3.1 won't work on Windows 7 (which is one of the saddest things happened to me!) but this Steam version runs very smoothly! And this version was easier to get working via LAN when playing with 3 other friends than the previous installments. And boi, that was some high quality LAN-gaming at its finest!My only nag with this version is the archaic 250 unit limit, which I haven't been able to remove (yet). It made me and my friends focus more on quality than on quantity (spamming), which isn't so bad thing either!			"

Still a large active following, fan-made units, mods, maps...  TA is a must own.    With the totala.ini unit increase, you can easily bump unit cap to 500 without modding.			"

												A good childhood memory that i have been dieing to look for. Always was wondering when steam was going to have this game on the market. Plaing the maps that  ever so loved. Nuking the hell out of the enemy. Also i has some new updates well to me anyways. You can now have a hover army which is pretty cool. New defenses which are hella good. Even the reactors can be clocked so the enemy wont go for it. EMP is op as hell. Targeting system buliding which you can see the diffrence wither you have it or not. I would recommend it to all that have not played this. I love this gamew.			"

												VERY good game! But do not buy it for the multiplayer. The game still uses the old IP connection and NOT steam multiplayer. You cannot join via steam, only direct connection. This game is one of the best RTS's out there even today, I strongly advise downloading the mods. The ""unit"" development has been relentless up to present day and the mods expand the tech trees to a whole new level. Also check out the new maps that can be downloaded, some are very well made! This is the kind of RTS that requires speed of base building and automation of unit production. Mass production is the name of the game. Use ""shift"" click to add 5 to building que.Can not recommend the game more!			"

												I haven't seen this game in years! Just reading about it brough so much nostalgia - I still have 2 CDs for the game, with the booklet on story and individual units in my home country somewhere. I played it when I was little, when I couldn't understand a word in English XDOne disk was for Single and the other for Multi player after installation, I believe.The game itself was brilliant, so versatile and with so many options and units, advanced extraction facilities and units - and that was just the original version - never had the expansions before.Unique system of having one special unit called Commander, who you used to build basic structures and then had to protect him from destruction, or you would loose. You can capture buildings and enemies with him, and if you did it correctly, you could then start building units and buildings of the opposite fracion! Not that it would matter much though, as both fractions have almost idenical units for most part (varied just look and attack type), even the same number of them varies just by 2-4 objects less or more on each side ovarall.Going in Skirmish mode against AI was a bit pointless though - Difficulty gave the AI upper hand, instead of making it smarter. The enemy almost never used advanced weaponry, or buildings. I hope this will be different with this version.Despite its little flaws above, it could still be called indescribably brilliant game - at the time of its relevance, and even in this day. Give me Total Annihilation over some of those new fancy RTSs any time.			"

For those wondering, I can't see any problems with the game running on Windows 10 or running on 1920*1080 resolution which is just great. Of course, because this game is so old you can play it on just about any modern computer or laptop. I look forward to seeing what this does for reviving the TA community and introducing new players to the genre! If you're looking for a trip down memory lane or are looking to get into RTS games, this might be the one for you.			"

												Oh man, this game. This. Game.  From a CD-R of the skirmish disc to a legit big box copy, I invested hundreds if not thousands of hours in Total Annihilation during the tail-end of the 90s. Its relaxed pace, expansive map size and tactical variety put the microscopic, tunnel-visioned zerg rush of StarCraft and Red Alert to shame, the competitor's popularity be damned.My opinion has not changed in the nearly two decades that have passed since Total Annihilation's launch date; this is still a forward-thinking masterwork of the RTS genre, its eerily desolate atmosphere and lush, Jeremy Soule-composed score just as evocative as it was back then.Am I biased? Perhaps. Is it perfect? Not at all, but given the time period and meager price tag for what is the definitive Total Annihilation experience? More than worth a revisiting for newcomers and veterans alike.			"

												Oh... good old memory. It was one of the best strategy games I've played during the late 90s. Better than Starcraft. The AI are simple. They build things randomly. Then they attack when they have certain # of units then retreat when fall below. But just because of this randomness, it doesnt make you feel predictable. The AI dont always do the same thing over and over again.			"

												My childhood all over again. <3 This game was one of the first RTSs I ever played, before and during the AGE of EMPIRES era of the 90s! Not very nice on the pvp aspect back then either, nor very forgiving for mistakes, and the cheat console is broken, but hey, the base game itself is where the fun and joys were at! The models were articulate, and the ""dodging"" of fire from opposing units was always good. This game could have gotten so much more potential, but it couldn't keep up with Age of Empires, nor Starcraft/Warcraft. Still... for the nostalgia, this is worth the $5 or less that it is posted as.			"

												One of the best RTS ever made. Great variety of units, hundred combat's possibilities (air, ground, water), every single moviment must be calculated. As a game from 90's, some features are questionables for today: huge numbers of hotkeys (and few are actually usuable) and difficulty to access a huge army or to attack from many different fronts with different units are the most noticeables. Also, the AI of the skirmishes is weak and even if play in hard mode it's very easy, depending on the map you play.			"

												Wow, I am so glad this game is on steam. I remember fondly playing this in the 90s and getting my butt kicked repeatedly. Luckily, as an adult, I just dominated the Arm campaign that I could never beat as a kid. This RTS is a classic gem. It did things no one else did at the time, like queing units up and setting rally points. The unique mix of units is amazing and few games since have come up with the sheer variety and versatility between all the ground, air and sea units. I enjoy it now almost as much as I did back then on my old Pentium beast.For the asking price, this is a steal. If you can handle the dated look, it is an absolute treasure.10/10 - One of the best RTS games of all time.			"

												This is a Great classic game of the RTS Genera. THIS si what a good RTS should be a game few modern RTSs even come close to. I have been playing this game since day 1 and I still love this game today. I probably have hours into the 5 digits invested in this game. the AI in units is something few games have these days, base building makes you feel like your are really building a real BASE unlike many games whee you build a small outpost. The battle are Epic and even the most powerful weapons in the game have a counter to make this a fair and balanced game, unlike C&C where they build a superweapon your hosed, cause there is no counter. If anyone is looking for a real classic RTS experience, then THIS is your game. A game this old still has a huge following and fanbase today. it is the Diablo II of RTS.			"

												This was probably the first non-educational computer game I ever played as a kid and it has been on pretty much every computer my family or I have had, so needless to say it holds a very dear place in my heart. Even after all these years the intro still gets me pumped up,  excited to play, the Krogoth mission still scares the crap out of me, and is still completely and utterly addicting.This is probably the best modern release of one of the best RTS games, starts up and works flawlessly on my Win10 comp, loads very quickly, gameplay is nice and smooth and the music actually plays. The music playing is a huge thing to me, the game music is incredible and really helps set the tone and mood, from the franticness of battles to the calm of building.The biggest downside to the game is honestly the AI, luckily this game has a great modding community and you can find more AI's and mods than you would ever need.

												Total Annihilation was a stand-out release among a successful and populare genre which has simply died off after age. Many of the good titles are off the market, hard to find or on unpreferred platforms. Dark Reign, Red Alert, Command and Conquer, Total Annihilation, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology and of course Warcraft and Starcraft...It was a much better time for the genre, where the games were of supreme quality and the hours were infinite. LAN parties flocked with custom maps, units, mods of all the popular titles of the time.Total Annihilation reigned supreme with the greats - Dark Reign, Warcraft 2, Starcraft and Red Alert 2. It's really fun, simple and intense. Cavedog weren't deserving of going under but they will always will be remembered. If you love strategy games, classics, or simply games, this is a game for you.This game should be in everybody's collection, without a doubt. And for the price it's going for there's no excuse to not own this one.			"

Myself I have only updated the unit cap to 500 units from 250 default. Thanks. This is a game that is a strategy must....I have played it since 1997 just stopped for about 10 years. Now I must say I am so excited to hear Chris Taylor may be making a true sequel or maybe just a revamped version of this game for modern times, as he works for Wargamming now and they bought the rights to the title.

												This game... This is a game I like to remember as being one of the best RTS games ever. Being released in the late 90s it came out amongst other great RTS games like, Starcraft, Warcraft 2, Red Alert, Command and Conquer and Age of Empires. Back then the RTS competition was a tough one to beat and Total Annihilation proved it could be on top with the rest of them. Its gameplay is smooth, it works and its easy to learn.The resources in this game are Energy and Metal, and the resource gathering is different but works in the case of Income and Loss. Your income will be determined by things such as how many solar collectors you have for energy, and how many metal deposits you are collecting from. You always want to aim for your income to higher than your loss at all times even when you're building, this way you can almost avoid any loss in resources all together. The best way to explain this is like this; Max Metal and Energy at the start is 1000 in stores, A barracks could cost 500 metal and 2350 energy, the game will decide how much you will lose per second that its being built, so youre income of metal might be 5.4, and energy is 111 you're loss might then be 6.2 and 120 so you will start to lose these resources over time and could run out of energy before its finished you avoid this by building more energy collectors to make the income of energy much higher and then not run out of energy in the middle of building.Most of the gameplay exists around your one main builder unit, The Commander, this guy builds all your buildings and gathers temporary resources (of which btw is pretty much everything, you can gather trees and folliage for energy. Rocks and whats left of units are gathered as metal.). That being said however, once your base is built up and your income of resources is good, is where you start to build your massive robotic army of your infantry, vehicles and aircraft. There is no population cap so you build as much as you like. Through reading everything that is said about the units and buildings you'll be able to find a good mix of what you need nice and easy. Pros: -Quick Gameplay- Gameplay makes sense and works- Robot Armies- A different type of resource collecting not seen often- A long story driven campaign- Pretty much everything explodesCons: - its from the 90s so graphics will be out dated- Resources might get annoying to keep at a steady rate			"

												Should be named 'Time Annihilation.'Probably my favorite RTS of all time!  Sorry Starcraft, but TA has unlimited resources which translates to obscenely long games and epic battles of awesomeness.  This includes working hi-fi music tracks that really set the mood of the moment in a grand and well orchestrated fashion as well!  I'm very glad they ironed that issue out because the music is extremely well done, but is in CD-DA format.  Considering the game's age it of course only supported analog playback of the music, so  most machines would be SOL, but not THIS version!  Full music support here!			"

												I Could say manythings about this game. But if i took the time to tell you all the time i spent in this game we'd be here all week. Before the colapse of this Style of RTS genre, A thought i hate to see ongoing this titan Rose to power in the young days of my youth. Back then i had fewer things to worry about. Sleep. Eat.School. and then it was all about TA.In shadow of the legacy of Red Alert and age of empires being its Competitors at the time TA rose above and beyond them with a mighty D-Gun and Conqured the competion in my Lan Parties and Matches with my TA Obssed Older brother. I love this game.Theres few games that stand the test of time like this game does, and i still to this day call it in at my top 10 games of all time right there beside Red Alert 1. Much loved CAVEDOG and thank you Chris Taylor for puting this gem out for us.Also when can we get steam workshop support for my Maps and old AI files...damn it i still have some sitting on my old Win 95 dos pc			"

												Awesome game. I remember playing this game when I was younger and it still feels awesome even today. For those wondering, I can't see any problems with the game running on Windows 10 or running on 1920*1080 resolution which is just great. Of course, because this game is so old you can play it on just about any modern computer or laptop. I look forward to seeing what this does for reviving the TA community and introducing new players to the genre! If you're looking for a trip down memory lane or are looking to get into RTS games, this might be the one for you.			"

												I absolutely adore this RTS. Prior to this, I'd played some SupComm, but it didn't quite scratch the itch this one did. Great modding community that keeps the advanced players around, astounding base game, and a soundtrack to die for. These are only a few of the reasons to buy it, counting what other people have said. My only problem with it is a lack of a Mac OS X port. Much as I'd love to buy it again through GoG (which does contain a ported version), it feels like a waste to buy it twice just for the ability to play it on my laptop. To anyone thinking about purchasing it, I advise Total Annihilation whole-heartedly, but I'd advise the GoG version simply by virtue of mac compatibility and ease of unit cap increasing.			"

												Total Annihilation was a stand-out release among a successful and populare genre which has simply died off after age. Many of the good titles are off the market, hard to find or on unpreferred platforms. Dark Reign, Red Alert, Command and Conquer, Total Annihilation, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology and of course Warcraft and Starcraft...It was a much better time for the genre, where the games were of supreme quality and the hours were infinite. LAN parties flocked with custom maps, units, mods of all the popular titles of the time.Total Annihilation reigned supreme with the greats - Dark Reign, Warcraft 2, Starcraft and Red Alert 2. It's really fun, simple and intense. Cavedog weren't deserving of going under but they will always will be remembered. If you love strategy games, classics, or simply games, this is a game for you.This game should be in everybody's collection, without a doubt. And for the price it's going for there's no excuse to not own this one.			"

												Probably one of the Best RTS's ever made.  Still runs great on modern systems, even though it was released almost 20 years ago now.  Was build to be modable from the start, long before game mods were really even a thing.  If you like RTS's, this is a must have for your library.			"

In an era when 10 to 20 hours is the life expectancy of a game on a PC, ""Total Annihilation"" can give you 1 hour per mission and it has 50 of them.

												When it was released in 1997 it quickly became apparent how TA was going to be THE genre defining game of the decade, going on to win Gamespot's Game of the Year award that same year. Whether you choose to use lowly k-bots to rush their base, prefer a more elegant appraoch using stealth fighters, or prefer to build an entire line of Big Berthas to long range bomb them into submission there are multiple strategies to winning a battle.Total Annihilation removes the resource gathering, micromanaging aspect of strategy games and instead focuses on combat. War materials are broken into two catagories of either metal or energy, both of which are harvested at a constant rate through each resource generation structure.All in all, TA is my favorite strategy game of all time and I've played countless hundreds of hours blowing up my enemies and securing map domination.

												T.A. is on Steam, what a glorious moment.  I Love You T.A.The game I brought before I even had a computer to play it on, played so many hours I couldnt begin to imagine.  Dune 2 was great in it's day but it got totally blown away by the many advances this game created, many things you would now consider integral to an RTS, heres where it started.  Queueable orders, orders from factory, 3D elevated terrain, alternate animations, responsive music, oh and the D gun...Such a quality game even the vanilla holds up compared to some you see brand new released on steam, but with all the mods out there, oh the lovely wars we shall have again.May Brawlers wipe away all traces of your enemies, good luck Commanders.P.S.  Why am I only able to give one thumbs up to recommend this game??  I could fill a whole review with just thumbs ups.			"

												Total Annihilation is one of the true classics of the RTS genre, and IMHO, a must-own for any strategy fan. While parts of it can feel dated today, the basic mechanics, gameplay, and the epic score still hold their own nearly 20 years later. I first bought this game barely a month after release, back in the beforetime of 1997, and it's been perpetually on my favorite games of all time list since then. At a time when Starcraft was dominating the RTS market, Total Annihilation was providing an alternative to the small scale clickfest style of gameplay that Starcraft ushered in, offering large maps, epic battles, physics-based combat, and some truly memorable moments. Why throw a dozen marines at something when you can command a hundred-plus giant robots and tanks to obliterate everything in their path?The game definitely had and still has its faults - players unfamiliar with the game are going to be confused by the relative sameness of some of the units, and the sheer numbers of them available to build. It also featured an active use economy; the first of its kind that I'm aware of - I personally love it, but it does entail quite a learning curve from the classic Dune II/Age of Empires ""spend it when you build it"" model. Some of the larger maps are also not for the faint of heart - while eventually outdone by Supreme Commander, the larger TA maps can take literally hours of multiplayer slug-matches to end a game, particularly once you bump up the unit count to something a modern computer can sink its teeth into.In the end though, it's said that an amateur thinks in terms of strategy, while a professional thinks in terms of logistics - and that's absolutely the case here, where you can spend yourself into inaction, or use the shattered remains of your opponents' armies to fuel your own war machine.

												Total Annihilation is a ridiculously fun and addictive RTS game that was developed in 1997 by a little company called Cavedog. For an almost 20-year-old game, it's amazing how fun this game is to still play. The user interface is very user-friendly, and the game itself is simple to learn. Despite the ease of being able to get into the game and just start playing, there is a wide variety of units that allow an incredible level of complex creativity in terms of strategy. Total Annihilation is like eating candy without the calories: it gives you a cool robot army, huge explosions, and probably one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard composed for a game.Total Annihilation is also very mod-friendly and customizable. Despite being a great game, there are some pitfalls: Getting a multiplayer game can be tricky if you have no idea what you're doing. You will need to connect to the ip address of the host, which most modern games do for you automatically. Additionally, there is a unit cap of 250 (which includes buildings) that you *can* increase, but you have to manually edit the totala.ini file. This can be a pain in the butt for the computer-challenged, but isn't difficult to actually do. The main complaint I hear about this game is the pathfinding. And I agree. Sometimes your units will do what seem to be nonsensical things, like trying to drive up a wall instead of going around it. Very large armies also have difficulty moving around, and the units tend to get stuck on each other. Naval units are the best example of this, where they will grind against each other trying to find their way to a destination. There ARE pathfinding patches out there that will significantly help with these difficulties, though.Overall, this is a great game. I highly recommend it for pretty much anyone ever.			"

												Best R.T.S. ever made in my opinoin. Biggiest unit diversity, Biggiest unit cap ( 5,000) yet to date.  The maps are bigger and also  first rts to do 3d maps and units. T.A. has one of the biggiest modding communitys in existence, containg over a thousand different units and buildings to add to your game.  you can also edit your buildings and units, such as buidling faster and having more life points or more damage. T.A is also the first and only R.T.S. to date where you can sahre resources with your team mate, not donate or sale you can actually set up your resources to go to your team mates and vice a versa.  T.A. is also the first R.T.S to cover all 4 aeras of combat : land, air, sea and even under the sea,  you can even build buildings on the water and under the water.  T.A. is also the first R.T.S. with muilple different units that can build: construction aircraft, advanced construction aircraft, construction kbot, advanced construction kbot, construction tank, advanced construction tank, construction and advanced construction hover tanks, construction and advanced construction sea planes, and you have a commander. T.A. also was the first to correctly utilize a queing system, you can have an endless number of buildings qued up to be built at once. There is keyboard short cuts for selecting all of one type of unite or selecting all units, there is a self destruct button to remove blunders while building. you can even have thousands of units qued up to be built instead of just 5 per building like starcraft. In short if your looking for the best rts experience then buy this game, it also comes with the 2 expansions that were released a year after the game. buy buy buy buy BUY ! you will love it i promise!

												Hands down the best RTS game. Thousands of hours wasted in my youth setting up precision attacks with air, land and sea units. Not to mention creating defensive bases that no AI could ever breach, even when you had ten players on a 64x64 map all allied against you.What C&C and Starcraft failed to deliver, TA has covered.About time this came to Steam.

												A RTS where the limits are just so much more.""food supply?"" not required. 250 unit/building cap which you WILL hit, but can easily get mods to increase.Units? More in this than there are in pretty much all RTS's combined. there are 4000 for download at units.tauniverse.com, not saying they're all good, but i added 65 ones which i like wih more to follow.Large amount of maps available, again, way more to download.The main ""restriction"" i have is that if you're downloading a lot of units, you will find out there's a weapon maximum of about 255, if you go over this, they will simply not work. Also, if they conflict, they will not work (hence why there are programs such as ta:mutation (a must have!) to resolve this.""some"" people may find graphics a little ""basic"", especially on cinematics, this for me isnt an issue.Surprised how easily the steam version was to get it working with ta:Mutation/TA:conflict crusher.If you get nothing else, look for ""drake"" and a tier 3 tech lab which builds it, might be a little overpowered, but is a beautiful unit and so enjoyable to use.To name a few more: Troll, razorback, oddity, bumblebee, blitz, phobos, howie, abolisher, tremor (get ta:mutation to resolve issues)Also, if playing single player, get the map pack: http://files.tauniverse.com/files/ta/maps-1/  then in cavedog, the ""repacked (recommended version)"". plenty more maps available, but there's a few must haves in that pack.Didn't realise how much i missed this game. If you want a RTS for single player play, this is the one.For online multiplayer, i would suggest other RTS's, unless you and a friend (or group of friends) want something which can be modified heavily and easily.

												What a game!God knows how much CRT radiation I soaked up while glued to this game back at the turn of the century.Total Annihilation has finally made the jump to Steam, so I'm back for more play. I'm still damn impressed that this game from '97 supported widescreen (16:9) aspect ratios straight out of the box (Quite literally so, I remember first buying this game when it came in a cardboard box).Things that I remember impressed me about Total Annihilation back in 1999:-• 3D units• You could start forest fires• The ability to mine rocks for metal and harvest trees for surplus energy• The messy aftermath of significant battles (big battles left a big mess, metal wreckage of hundreds of destroyed units would litter large portions of the map) • You could often recycle the metal from the wreckage of destroyed unitsThe explosions in-game are also awesome, and will gratify most action junkies. When your units get destroyed, the explosions are screen-shaking, audibly thunderous, polygonal chunks of shrapnel debris hurtle through the air all over the place.When your commander unit is destroyed, it triggers an enormous nuclear explosion that causes significant 'splash damage', therefore when you sense an inevitable defeat you have an opportunity to rage quit in a kamikaze-esque enemy-destroying nuclear blaze of glory.If you like RTS games, science fiction and playing with nuclear weapons, you should check this game out.

												I already own a physical copy of this game. So you are probably thinking: ""Why did you buy it AGAIN?""The answer:It's just that f@$%ing good.I have spent countless hours playing this game, my hours of playing on Steam are only an extremely small fraction of how much I have played this.This game, Halo:CE, Halo 2, Star Wars Battlefront I & II, EAW, and Republic Commando made up a pretty large chunk of my childhood. Total Annihilation is just as good as I remember it. Fun, simple, full of hours upon hours of enjoyment. Of course, being this old, the graphics won't blow you away, and there are bound to be glitches and bugs. It is still extremely fun, and has good LAN support, so if you set everything up correctly and use Hamachi or Tunngle, it would be a very enjoyable experience for you and your friends. There are also many custom maps and units available on sites like TA Universe. Need a giant nuke robot? No problem. Need X-Wings? Of course! Nuke planes? Yep, they have that too. They even have full blown fan-made expansion packs and updates that add numerous new features. All you need to install them is basic computer knowledge. If you want an RTS that isn't overly complicated, extremely fun, has high moddability, can run on really any PC you throw at it? This is your best bet.Would I reccomend this?HELL YEAH.			"

												This is such a great game, it astounds me how such an old game is this good, i like how unique the art style is, and the gameplay is interesting, since it is in a way 3D a turret/unit's effectivness against certain units is less about reducing numbers against them and more about how often they can hit, AA guns deal no more damage to aircraft than other things but is the only thing that can reliably hit them. Because of this nothing seems forced and the game just works. this is a great game and i wish that more games today were like this.			"

												Superb classic.There is no other RTS game that has such an immense diversity of different units and tactics to go with them. kbots, vehicles, aircraft, hovercraft, naval vessels, along with a diverse array of base defences, turrets, special buildings and superweapons. A superb FUN game, just as addictive now as it was 20 years ago. The campaigns are still fun and involving to do, and there is a huge amount of skirmish maps to mess about on.CORE VERMIN HAVE BEEN EXTERMINATEDRecommended. 10/10			"

												The graphics are still not bad. It has eerie music and a very low learning curve. Each level is different enough to keep the gamer interested. As a game of resource management and tactical combat, Total Annihilation is not fundamentally different from anything that has come before, but it is nonetheless an evolutionary leap for the genre of real-time strategy. Even for this day. If you like RTS, don't miss this amazing classic.  "

												This is absolutely the best RTS game of all times.  When this came out I axhausted all my free time on this game.  They released a new unit every week and pumped out 2 expansion packs.  Cavedog aimed to please and did with the RTS.  While there have been a lot of great RTS games since, no one has come close to creating a one as great as this.  I can even play it today and it is still a valid game by todays standards even in 2D with the lack of graphics enhancements.			"
